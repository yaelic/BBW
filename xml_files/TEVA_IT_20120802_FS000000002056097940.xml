          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Kevin Mannix, VP of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you operator. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm joined today by our President, Jeremy Levin; CFO, Eyal Desheh; Dr. Michael Hayden, President-Global Research &amp; Development and Chief Scientific Officer; Bill Marth, President and CEO of Teva Americas; Dr. Maurice Chagnaud, Chief Commercial Officer of Teva Europe.</p>
          <p>Jeremy will begin by providing an overview of the quarters' highlights followed by Eyal, who will then provide additional details on our consolidated financial results. We'll then open the call for question-and-answer period. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of foreign currency translation effect, macroeconomic trends, interruptions in our supply chain and other factors that could cause actual results to differ as discussed in Teva's report on Form 20-F and Form 6-K.</p>
          <p>Also, we are presenting non-GAAP data, which excludes the amortization of purchased intangible assets, costs related to certain regulatory actions, inventory step-ups, legal settlements, and reserves and impairments, and related tax effects.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeremy. Jeremy, if you would please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today to discuss Teva's Second Quarter 2012 Results.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I'd like to take a moment to thank our Israeli shareholders and analysts for their understanding our need to implement a new communication schedule around our earnings announcement. The new time schedule allows us to accommodate a diverse group of Teva shareholders and ensures a more-effective way of communicating with all our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Now let me start by saying that we're pleased with the results from our second quarter, the details of which I will address in a moment. Before I do so however, I want to refer you to my previous statement in May regarding augmenting and strengthening the Teva management team. In this regard, I would like to say how pleased we are that Dr. Carlo De Notaristefani has joined Teva in the newly created role of President and Chief Executive Officer of Global Operations.</p>
          <p>Carlo is one of the most distinguished voices in our operation in our industry. During his tenure at Bristol-Myers Squibb, he built an exemplary team, led one of the most successful productivity transformations within the pharmaceutical industry, and was instrumental in driving the company's success.</p>
          <p>As you know, manufacturing and product supply is key to our business and our commitment to our customers and patients. We're extremely pleased to have someone of Carlo's caliber and international expertise to lead Teva's ongoing commitment to bring together efficient, state-of-the-art supply chain techniques with a strong focus on meeting the highest standards across our worldwide operations.</p>
          <p>In addition, Carlo will continue the development of the superbly talented team that we have at Teva today. A team that under Carlo's leadership, I am confident will, set an example of excellence across the industry for many years to come.</p>
          <p>Recognizing the critical importance of management, growth of talent and leadership, Teva is completely committed to assembling a talented team of professionals who will play a key role in enhancing our global efforts and help guide the company into what I see as a very exciting future as a leader in both Generics and Branded medicines. Carlo is an excellent addition to the Teva executive team and joins recently appointed Dr. Michael Hayden, President of Global R&amp;D and Chief Scientific Officer.</p>
          <p>Carlo will complement Michael in our commitment to lead an initiative is that unique in our industry not just to combine the strength of R&amp;D in Generics that of Branded, but also to develop and maintain world leading manufacturing capabilities.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are also very pleased that Mr. Arik Yaari has accepted the role to lead the company's community and institutional affairs. Arik in his new role will lead Teva's commitment and activities in the areas of social responsibility, philanthropy, institutional affairs, and academia on a global level. He will build a cohesive strategy that will enhance public well-being by drawing on Teva's core. I want to thank Arik for his many years of commitment and service to Teva and I look forward to his continued contribution.</p>
          <p>Now as I mentioned at the opening of the call, we are pleased with our second quarter results. We had a solid second quarter and we're on track to achieve the goals we set for the remainder of this year. Revenues are up 19% compared to second quarter of 2011 with non-GAAP EPS up 16% to $1.28 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>We are reaffirming our May 24th guidance for fiscal 2012. We'll highlight the top line guidance. We anticipate revenues of approximately $20 billion to $21 billion consisting of total U.S. net sales of $10.5 billion, total European net sales of $5.8 billion and total rest of world net sales of $4.2 billion. In addition, we continue to anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share between $5.30 and $5.40; an estimated fully diluted average number of shares between 870 million and 876 million. All other business lines also remain as reported on May 24, 2012. We expect that in keeping with this reaffirmation, we'll have a Q3 that is lighter than Q2, but a strong Q4.</p>
          <p>In the past quarter, there were three substantial Copaxone events that were considered by many to be pivotal for the company. In June, we announced positive top line data from the GALA Phase III clinical trial assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 40-milligram per ml. glatiramer acetate injection administered subcutaneously three times a week compared to placebo in relapsing, remitting, multiple sclerosis patients.</p>
          <p>The study results showed that the dosage of glatiramer acetate significantly reduced disease activity while maintaining a favorable safety and tolerability profile. As further analysis of the GALA data are ongoing and as we continue to work with the health authorities to determine the next steps, we are guiding on a submission of the GALA data to the U.S. FDA in the first quarter of 2013 with a possible launch date in the first quarter of 2014.</p>
          <p>We were also extremely pleased with the favorable court ruling in the Copaxone patent infringement litigation where the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York found in favor of Teva. The court has also enjoined the FDA from approving the defendant's purported generic versions of Copaxone until the Orange Book patents expire on May 24, 2014, and the defendants from selling their products until the process patent expires on September 1, 2015, assuming of course they achieve the necessary regulatory approval.</p>
          <p>In addition, we also received a favorable outcome in the United Kingdom court ruling in the Copaxone patent litigation proceeding. The High Court specifically determined that the asserted claims of our patent were valid and also found that the proposed generic version of Copaxone would infringe our patent which is scheduled to expire May 23, 2015.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our U.S. generic operations where we continue to make progress and are seeing U.S. generics recovering from 2011. To date we've launched 12 products with $17 billion in brand value and have the potential to launch an additional 20 products with $13 billion in brand value including larger-volume products such as Singulair, Actos and Diovan.</p>
          <p>Moving to our global brands organization, Copaxone global sales grew 3% and units grew by 7% for second quarter 2012 versus second quarter 2011. U.S. growth was driven by strong demand and the January 2012 pricing increase, however, this growth was somewhat offset by wholesalers adjusting inventory due to the effect of the new DSA agreement as previously discussed in May. Growth in Europe was due to significant unit growth of 23% while offset by unfavorable foreign-exchange effect. We also saw rest-of-world growth due to tender success in Russia.</p>
          <p>When we take a closer look at Copaxone in the U.S. we note that our market share, as measured by total prescriptions, grew by 40.8% while the U.S. Multiple Sclerosis market grew 3% per year-over-year, Copaxone was the only medicine, I repeat, the only medicine, of the ABCRs [Avonex, Betaferon, Copaxone, Rebif] to grow over that same period.</p>
          <p>In addition, when we look at the change in Copaxone total prescriptions from first quarter 2012 to second quarter 2012, we see an 8% increase or almost 186,000 total prescriptions, an all-time high.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we continue to see strong results in our oncology franchise from Treanda, which continues to deliver increases quarter-over-quarter. Further, in our wakefulness franchise, Nuvigil sales growth is worth noting at $91 million for the second quarter 2012.</p>
          <p>Added to that in our Parkinson's franchise Azilect revenues increased by 36% over the prior year because of strong sales globally, in particular in the U.S., France, and the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p>Despite ongoing macro-economic challenges in Europe, we are very pleased to report that European sales grew by 12% during this quarter in local currencies versus second quarter 2011. We saw a significant increase in sales of our branded products due both to the inclusion of products we acquired from Cephalon as well as the take back of the Copaxone rights from Sanofi.</p>
          <p>Our sales in Europe in local currencies grew 14% from first quarter to second quarter in 2012. We did see growth in our European Union operations. However, it was offset by expected lower generic sales due to ongoing macro-economic conditions and the end of de-stocking in the channel, which we are now seeing industry-wide in Europe.</p>
          <p>In response to the Eurozone crisis intensifying in the E.U., we adjusted our strategy to have the right critical mass and we are more focused on profitability and sustainable growth rather than seeking market share or growth at any price.</p>
          <p>Our European launches are proving successful. We successfully launched generics of Lipitor and Atacand on day one and out-performed the competition. We also continue to see growth from many of our smaller markets like Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Romania, and Bulgaria.</p>
          <p>As we continue to anticipate a challenging and unpredictable European climate, we will continue to improve our diversity, reach, and flexibility in Europe. This is a core strategic imperative of Teva. We will continue to focus on keeping a healthy and competitive organization in the E.U.</p>
          <p>I would also like to highlight our rest-of-world unit, which delivered a 30% increase in U.S. dollars in the second quarter 2012 over second quarter 2011 and 36% in local currency. In addition, the rest of world generics unit grew 36% in dollars over 2011 and 40% in local currency. We recognize the potential value of markets such as Japan, Eastern Europe and Latin America.</p>
          <p>Japan is a key strategic market for us with high generic growth potential supported by the Japanese government. Teva <mark type="ph" /> Saiyoku (15:42) is now the third largest player in Japan and we're well positioned to respond to the generic opportunity by leveraging our global scale and expertise generic medicines.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we continue to see opportunity as we report favorable results with 10% growth in U.S. dollars in the second quarter 2012 over second quarter 2011. Contributing to these results were higher Copaxone sales in Argentina, Brazil and Chile.</p>
          <p>In our OTC businesses, we are very pleased by the initial launch of Vicks in Russia and Poland. Together with our partner, P&amp;G, we hope the success of the uptake by pharmacies will now be followed by robust retail sales.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Eyal.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>The second quarter of 2012 continues a positive trend for Teva. We are reporting today solid growth in key parameters. Compared to the second quarter of 2011, net revenues, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP earning per share were up 19%, 27% and 16% respectively. The main drivers of this growth was the performance of our global branded business whose sales grew by 37%, benefiting from contribution from Cephalon's medicines as well as the growth of both Copaxone and Azilect that was coupled with the improvement of our U.S. generic business.</p>
          <p>Overall our global generic business grew by a solid 9%. The U.S. generic business continued to improve, demonstrating solid growth compared to the second quarter of 2011. EMEA, Latin America and API also showed organic and profitable growth. Our European generic business declined slightly in local currency terms compared to last year and grew 14% compared to the sequential quarter despite the ongoing macroeconomic conditions in the region.</p>
          <p>Our other revenues, including OTC, grew by 12%. We also recorded solid cash flow from operation and free cash flow this quarter, which improved compared to Q1 this year. In spite of the negative impact of foreign currencies, our global balanced business model as well as tight expense control in our SG&amp;A produced successful financial results for the quarter.</p>
          <p>I would like to touch on two issues before I review the first quarter numbers. First, I would like to remind everyone that we are presenting GAAP and non-GAAP results. In our non-GAAP presentation we have excluded the following items: amortization of purchased intangible assets totaling $275 million of which $267 million are included in cost of goods sold and the remaining $8 million in selling and marketing expenses; inventory step-up of $7 million in connection with the Cephalon acquisition; costs related to regulatory action taking in facilities of $40 million which relates primarily to our injectable and animal health plans; impairment of long-lived assets of $8 million; acquisition, restructuring and other expenses of $48 million related primarily to the Cephalon and Taiyo acquisitions; and related tax benefits of $123 million. Please review our press release and related tables for complete information including reconciliation to the GAAP figures. As we have indicated in the past, we present non-GAAP figures to show you how we, the management team and our board, look at our financial results.</p>
          <p>Second, I would like to cover the impact of foreign currencies on our P&amp;L as well as on our balance sheet. During the second quarter, foreign currency differences had a negative impact of approximately $236 million in sales compared to Q2 last year. This resulted primarily from the weakening of some currencies, mainly the euro, the Hungarian forint, and the Russian ruble relative to the U.S. dollar. Currencies had a minor negative effect of about $8 million on our non-GAAP operating income this quarter.</p>
          <p>Approximately half of our sales are conducted in non-U.S. dollar environments and therefore, currency fluctuations have a material impact on our top line results. The major currencies in which we sell our medicines are: euro, about 20% of total net sales; Japanese yen, 4% to 5%; British pound at 3% to 3.5%; Canadian dollar also 3% to 3.5%; Russian ruble, the Israeli shekel, and the Hungarian forint at 2.5% to 3%; and certain Latin America currencies at 3.5% to 4%.</p>
          <p>Our guidance for the year, which we reiterated today, makes certain assumptions regarding currency rates compared to the U.S. dollar. These assumptions may not materialize. For example, we assumed an exchange rate of $1.27 per euro while the current rate today is $1.22. Therefore, we expect foreign currencies to continue to have impact on our sales in 2012 compared to 2011. Foreign currency also had a negative impact on our equity, decreasing it by over $800 million.</p>
          <p>Let me go over now to our consolidated results for the second quarter of 2012. Net revenues for the quarter reached $5 billion, an increase of 19% compared to the second quarter of last year. Our organic growth year-over-year making a comparison as if we had owned Cephalon and Taiyo in the comparable quarter were 3% and neutralizing the effect of Generic competition to Provigil this quarter, organic growth reached a solid 7%.</p>
          <p>Generic medicines net sales in the second quarter of 2012 were approximately $2.6 billion including API sales of $200 million, an increase of 9% when compared to the second quarter of 2011. Our generic business in the U.S. had a strong quarter with sales of $1.1 billion, an increase of 16% compared to the second quarter of 2011. The U.S. generic business continued to benefit from first quarter launches which included several medicines that were either exclusive, semi-exclusive, or otherwise had limited competition, as well as from the launch of four new generic medicines during the quarter.</p>
          <p>In Europe, our generic business generated quarterly sales of $884 million, a decrease of 12% but only 1% decrease in local currency terms compared to the second quarter of 2011. The slight decrease year-over-year despite continued economic and regulatory pressure in some key markets in Europe and destocking by distributors demonstrates our balanced and diversified business model in the region and the contribution of Cephalon.</p>
          <p>While we retained our generic leadership in key markets in Europe, we are moving away from a pure growth focus to a profitable and attractive growth model. As part of this model, certain discounts and rebates, which reduce profitability, are no longer utilized.</p>
          <p>We have seen some stabilization in our European Generic markets and with the strong multi-country launches of generic Lipitor and Atacand this quarter, as well as our overall improved performance, we grew our revenues by 14% when compared to Q1 this year.</p>
          <p>The generic business in our rest-of-the-world markets had another excellent quarter with sales of $676 million, an increase of 36% or 40% in local currency terms driven primarily by sales in Eastern Europe and Latin America coupled with the inclusion of Taiyo in Japan and slightly offset by a decrease in generic sales in Canada and the negative effect of foreign currencies.</p>
          <p>Let's all turn now to our branded business, where we had a good quarter across most product lines. Total net sales in the first quarter were approximately $1.9 billion, an increase of 37% when compared to the second quarter of 2011. Branded Medicine revenues this quarter comprised 39% of our total revenues. Branded Medicine sales in the U.S. this quarter were $1.4 billion, an increase of 35% compared to the second quarter of 2011. This was mostly the result of the inclusion of Cephalon as well as growth of Copaxone, Azilect and ProAir.</p>
          <p>In Europe, our branded business had a good quarter with sales of $402 million, an increase of 46% or 63% in local currency terms compared to Q2 2011 driven by the successful completion of the take-back of Copaxone sales in Europe from Sanofi and the inclusion of Cephalon and strong sales of its medicine.</p>
          <p>In the rest-of-the-world markets, branded sales were $182 million, an increase of 30% or 45% in local currency terms, driven primarily by strong sales of Copaxone in Russia and certain Latin America countries.</p>
          <p>Finally turning to our OTC business, net sales for the second quarter of 2012 were $219 million, an increase of 21% when compared to the second quarter of 2011. OTC sales are made primarily in non-U.S.-dollar currencies and in local currencies increased by 31%.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to our non-GAAP operating income, which totaled $1.4 billion in the second quarter, up 27% compared to Q2 2011 reflecting mainly the inclusion of Cephalon, strong sales of our branded medicines, the strength of our generic business and tight expense management. Non-GAAP net income and fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.1 billion and $1.28, up 14% and 16% respectively compared to Q2 2011.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter of 2012, the weighted-average share count for the fully diluted earnings-per-share calculation was 873 million shares on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to discuss profit margin and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross profit margin for the quarter was 59.5% in the second quarter compared to 57.3% in Q1 2011. This improvement is a result of the increase in the contribution from branded medicines, primarily due to the integration of Cephalon, higher sales of Copaxone, the new generic launches in the U.S., and was slightly offset by the effect of Taiyo acquisition and the PGT joint venture, which generated lower gross margin.</p>
          <p>Net R&amp;D expenses reached $298 million this quarter compared to $243 million in the second quarter of 2011, mostly reflecting the inclusion of Cephalon. Our R&amp;D expenses are tracking lower than planned right now and we do expect an increase in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Selling and marketing expenses for the quarter totaled $973 million compared to $794 million in the second quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Cephalon and Taiyo as well as the take-back of distribution and marketing responsibilities for Copaxone in Europe, partially offset by lower royalty payments on Generic medicines in the U.S. and the impact of exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Total G&amp;A expenses this quarter were $316 million compared with $284 million in Q2 last year, again primarily due to our acquisition of Cephalon and Taiyo, offset by the impact of exchange rates and lower legal expenses.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter reached 27.7%, up from 25.9% in the comparable quarter last year driven primarily by the inclusion of Cephalon, the new launches in the U.S., and tight expense management.</p>
          <p>We recorded $97 million of financial expenses on a non-GAAP basis in Q2 compared with $20 million of financial income in the comparable quarter of 2011, which included income from a financial transaction. The increase is mainly due to a higher interest expense resulting from the additional debt incurred to finance the acquisition of Cephalon and Taiyo, as well as increased costs of hedging activity. Our financial expenses this quarter are somewhat higher than what we see as our run rate and we do expect them to slightly go down for the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The provision of non-GAAP tax for the second quarter of 2012 was 12.6% and amounted to $162 million. The provision for taxes in the second quarter of 2011 was $133 million or 10.2%. Our tax provision this quarter is lower than our planned run rate and we expect it to go up in the next two quarters towards the range we guided in, in late May of 13% to 14.5%. As we said before, our increase in annual tax rate for 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily a result of the change in geographical and product mix following the Cephalon and Taiyo acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at our cash flow. Cash from operations in the quarter was a solid $1.2 billion and our free cash flow, excluding net capital expenditures and cash dividends, amounted to $709 million. This represented a decrease of 10% and 21% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2011. However, the decrease is mostly the result of the fact that our cash flow in the second quarter of 2011 was exceptional and did not represent our regular trend. When we look at cash flow development during 2012, we recorded an improvement of 58% in cash flow from operation and 71% in free cash flow compared to Q1 this year.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we continued to manage our buyback program and bought back 3.5 million shares at an average price of $38.70 per share for a total of $135 million. Year-to-date we invested a total of $667 million in our buyback program.</p>
          <p>We also used cash to reduce our debt by approximately $500 million. On June 30, our total outstanding loans, bonds and convertible debentures declined to $14 billion. This quarter, we completed the refinancing of approximately $3.4 billion of our short-term debt and extended its maturity. Our debt to EBITDA ratio improved from 2.6 times post the Cephalon acquisition to 2.2 times as of the end of the second quarter. We expect to continue reducing our financial leverage and total debt gradually and improve our debt to EBITDA ratio over the coming years.</p>
          <p>Net capital expenditure reached $252 million this quarter as we continue to invest in our manufacturing network in order to improve service levels to our customer. This represents an increase compared to $224 million in Q2 2011.</p>
          <p>On July 31st, Teva's Board approved a quarterly dividend for the second quarter of 1 shekel per share based on rates of the exchange on July 31, 2012, of the shekel to the U.S. dollar this translates into approximately $0.25 per share or a total amount of approximately $217 million.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. I would now like to turn the call back to Jeremy for his closing remarks. Jeremy?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Eyal, and I appreciate you going through the details.</p>
          <p>As I've said before, our company is driven by the mandate to answer the unmet needs of patients, exceed our customer expectations and return value to our shareholders. To encourage these values and to optimize the performance of the company, we have created an internal strategic initiative known as Project Spring. This initiative started on May 17, 2012, identifies areas for improvement, creates opportunities, solicits new ideas, implements practical steps and recommendations across all parts of the organization.</p>
          <p>Through it, we've laid the foundation for key elements of our strategic plan and have galvanized and fully-engaged our organization. The full fruits of this effort will be laid out as the foundation to our strategy.</p>
          <p>Some of the steps central to our strategy have already been taken including globalizing certain functions, consolidating research and development, and recruiting or promoting new management as we announced today. I fully expect that other core changes will occur throughout the remainder of 2012 and over the next several years and of course, you will be notified of those changes as they occur.</p>
          <p>Before turning the call back over to the operator for questions, I am pleased to close by letting everybody know that our Investor Day is scheduled for December 11th in New York. At that time, we'll present the 2013 strategic plan to you and you'll have the opportunity to meet many key executives from across the company.</p>
          <p>We thank you for joining us today and would like to open the call up for questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Thanks, Jeremy for all the details. I was just wondering as many of the Teva calls that we have, Copaxone was a main feature once again. So I was wondering as you look at the franchise and have had more time to do your analysis, is there anything you believe we on the Street are missing either in terms of the BG-12 impact more or less, better retention potentially for GALA, and maybe less or more risk from the Generic as September 2015 approaches? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of things. First of all, Copaxone is a terrific medicine. I have been deeply impressed by what I've seen. There's a million patient years out there of safety. We're seeing tremendous uptake and retention of patients and indeed benefit to patients.</p>
          <p>So number one, there was news this quarter and I believe it was significant news, which bolstered Teva's position as a leader in the field to treat and to sustain patients who have this devastating disease. So I can't speak for the entire Street but clearly, the court victories were substantial and make it very clear as to where things are going and they allow us to build and continue to build our franchise in this area. I'll hand over to Bill now and he will give you a perspective on how this is looking in the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ken, and thanks, for the question. I think that many of the things we should say about Copaxone were reflected in Jeremy's statement. Share growth was there, 40.8% of the market, and it's great growth in a time when people thought Copaxone would be declining. And a lot of that has to do with some of the things that we did early on.</p>
          <p>When knew competition from Gilenya would be tough earlier on this year and we had about 200 reps in the field prior to this year. And so, what we did was &#x2013; and about 145 to 150 of them were constantly on Copaxone and the rest on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:15). We repositioned our sales force this year to put all 200 on Copaxone, added some additional CNEs [Clinical Nurse Educators] into the market, as well and that's really helped us and our share of voice has picked up. We're just a bit behind Gilenya but we're doing very well in that market as reflected in this quarter, almost 168,000 TRxs. It's huge. The biggest quarter we've ever had.</p>
          <p>So in this market, you see how we continue to grow with this product. And that, as Jeremy said, goes to the years of safety and efficacy of this product that continues and we have seen Gilenya's share peak and hit an inflection point back in January and were doing very, very well in this market and that cannot be understated.</p>
          <p>And I think the last part is we've got great news here with respect to the court decision as well as GALA. We think that we can do very, very well with GALA pushing at a minimum a third of our patients or more. Our research says it could be much higher than that: two to three times a week, because we think it's a very convenient step for the patients.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, I would mention that not only do we have that date out there of now September of 2015 but you have the regulatory process there. We still think there's a lot of challenge out there for any "generic" competition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just to follow up, Jeremy, with this win, does it change your view of being more aggressive in terms of acquisitions now that there's more of a definitive protection? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, I don't think the win is one that one wants to link any types of transaction.</p>
          <p>Bottom-line is first of all, let's state the facts. We have a terrific, repeat, terrific, MS franchise. We are very proud of it; we're going to focus on it.</p>
          <p>Number two, what this does for the corporation as a whole, is it bolsters what was confidence and now we have significant confidence in our future and allows us now to plan for something that we had intended to plan for and we have planned and will execute on, which is a terrific plan to drive the company into the next five, six years and looking forward very much to that.</p>
          <p>Transactions, of course, play a role in it, but as I've said before previously, transactions are only part of an overall strategy and again I'll come back to the fact that our MS and neurology franchises are something that we're extremely proud of and will be focusing on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. First question is with respect to performance in your patent generic business, certainly encouraging to see some signs of improvement. I was hoping to maybe just drill down on the performance of those a little bit more, specifically I'm thinking about the 14% sequential growth in the business. I'm wondering to &#x2013; before we get ahead of ourselves here &#x2013; maybe to what extent you think that could have been positively impacted by the inventory reduction measures that have been taking place across the continent and whether or not that had an equivalent impact in the second quarter versus the first or if it actually ended up being a positive or a negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Elliot, hello there. Nice to meet you on the phone. Look, I think the way look at this is that you should understand that across the board the company is going through business changes. We have implemented a number of different things. It's not just that which you described, the inventory. But let me hand over to Bill to drill down for you and perhaps Maurice can do the same in Europe. So, Bill, first of all you, how about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Elliot, thanks again for the question. But the growth in the U.S. market, of course, is always driven by approvals. And so far we've had 12 approvals to date and it's been a nice stream of approvals, although the approvals in the second quarter weren't as large. But we do still have lingering effects from olanzapine, escitalopram, modafinil is still going strong. So we have a number and then we have a number of smaller launches that are quite good and even in launches such as clopidogrel, where we captured significant share although price being very, very low.</p>
          <p>So the business is doing quite well on the launch side. We're looking for better performance as we move forward on our base business with respect to supply and service and we're very optimistic there. Things are returning to normal there and we're doing very well.</p>
          <p>So we see a great list of approvals for the back half of the year, as many as 20 products, worth about $13 billion in innovator value. And I would just caution on that, we generally get a yield about half of that. So if you think back to my earlier comments in the year I talked about 24 products for the first half of the year and we've gotten 12 so far so it's pretty close.</p>
          <p>So again driven by approvals, driven by service level to our customers, so far we're doing very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Europe, good morning, Elliott. As the turmoil in the Eurozone will continue, as we mentioned in the previous earning calls, we continue to adapt our approach. Two points here: first we decide to adjust our organization and go to market model in the countries impacted by severe economic measures as Poland, Hungary and Portugal the decision where it's necessary to keep healthy and competitive organizations. These result in a reduction of 5% of our total European commercial workforce.</p>
          <p>On other hand, we continue to have a truly pan-European platform with diversified model and we enjoy a strong generic growth for many of our other markets, like Switzerland, coming from the acquisition of Cephalon with Mepha, Sweden, Finland and other smaller countries.</p>
          <p>On the second hand, as we are generics leader in Europe and have the critical mass, we focus on profitable and sustainable growth. Focus on the performance of the launch and not competition at any price for some tenders for example, by reducing complexity, harmonization of the portfolio after the different acquisitions: Ratiopharm and Mepha, by simplifying our go-to-market model in some countries, two brands versus three or one brand versus one; and also by a strong management of tail process. These help us to see the profitability of the generics business nearly double.</p>
          <p>On the top of that we have also a significant performance in Q2 versus Q1 in terms of launch, as was mentioned before, is a good performance in the launch of Lipitor (atorvastatin), Atacand (candesartan), we benefit off the cumulative sale of the launch of Q1 and Q2 where for some products we have outperformed the competition. For example, in Germany we regularly outperform competition in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:35) on launch, olanzapine and quetiapine, and atorvastatin in France for example is also a good example of the good launch when we are above our natural market share.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I can speak a little bit more about Germany and Spain. In Germany, market generic sales grew slightly versus the same quarter last year while our non-generic sales were impacted by ongoing destocking activity in the channel. We see some wholesaler moving from 20 to 10 day of inventory. We expect this traction to come and end in Q2. The quarter in Germany was dominated by excellent launch of generics, I mentioned before, and we outperformed competition. Teva kept the first supposition with the brand of Ratiopharm and our brand sales increased primarily due to the inclusion of Cephalon and the assumption of the marketing responsibility for Copaxone and Azilect back from Lunbeck.</p>
          <p>In Spain is also one of our major countries, both the generics and the brand product sale in Spain grew compared to the second quarter of 2011. The market for generic pharmaceuticals in Spain is still growing, but at a lower rate than the previous quarter is the impact of the Royal Decree in November of 2011. The Spanish market is heavily influenced by governmental measures aiming to reduce healthcare spending. And the last amendment of the Spanish legislation was implemented in May 2012 allowing dispensation for only the lowest price product within certain product group Teva is adapting it infrastructure to keep a healthy and competitive organization as well in Spain. We have maintained our position in the Spanish generics market.</p>
          <p>And on the brand side is very important also to mention we launched Zoely, our new oral contraceptive pill, in June after to have launched this product in France, Italy and Belgium during Q1 and Q2 and with, by the way, a very strong result of the launch of Zoely in France and Italy.</p>
          <p>New measures are in place also in some countries like in France, for example, is a major &#x2013; I can call that crazy for generics. Now everywhere in France if the patient refuses a generic product, he has to pay in advance versus originator and since this measure very interesting because we see an increase of the volume in the last months of the quarter in June.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on Project Spring and I'm not going to ask you specifics, but most people are looking at your strategy update and they're looking at cost rationalization, they're looking at business mix. The one thing that maybe people haven't talked as much about is a potential change in pricing strategy as you think about some of the businesses worldwide. How important is that in your review? And is that something that you think could be an opportunity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randall, first of all, let me say Project Spring is exactly as you described and thank you for not sort of pressing me on it, but I will be happy to give you some color. Some of the speculation is absolutely appropriate in the sense that it's talking about the kinds of things that any company should be looking at which essentially is looking at its cost structure; looking at our manufacturing footprint; understanding the growth opportunities in the R&amp;D pipeline; and, in addition to that, asking ourselves the question, where are other opportunities geographically; and then, as then you've seen over the last couple of months, seizing the opportunity to change some of our business practices.</p>
          <p>So all of those were really integral in this, underpinned, I would say, in a very firm attempt to engage the entire organization in development of something that I believe will excite not only them, but also the entire <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:35).</p>
          <p>With regard to pricing, it's something that's part of the business. I just want to point out, we view this as something that we look at not just as a standalone, it's part of the entire process of looking at generics and our branded and understanding how we can satisfy what other markets and how those markets look at our products. So pricing is not delinked from the other business aspects. It's certainly embedded in all of our thinking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just the follow up to that, as we think about the update and having that date is helpful, December 11, as we think about getting the update on what you plan to implement, how long is it going to take you to fully implement the changes that you're going to describe to us on that day?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, some of these things are already rolling out and have already been implemented.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of these things are &#x2013; these are a gradual progressive approach to laying out and articulating what effectively we're doing. So an example of that is &#x2013; I know that this doesn't necessarily immediately strike as being crucial to shareholders, but it is central to shareholder value, and that's compliance. We have <mark type="audio gap" /> (52:57). That's already implemented. There are, in addition, several other items that are already being implemented, changes for example, which may not be necessarily visible to you, but affect the underlying business structure that we have and lead to efficiencies.</p>
          <p>So, for example, one item would be our IT systems, significantly committing to invest and enhance those in programs that make a heck of a lot of sense from a business perspective. So all of these are rolling out step-by-step-by-step and they are being implemented. And some of these will, by the time we get to the end of the year, you'll see them. Some of them you're already seeing the impact on our cost structure and our profitability. And so I would look at this as an incremental rollout of pieces that all knit together and that will be able to show you the picture at the end of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking my questions. I have two high-level ones. The first one, Jeremy, as one of the big debates in the industry is around the ability of Teva and some of the I'd call them developed world-based companies to compete profitably at the low-end of the cost spectrum in generics, especially the $3.00 per 1,000 type of product. And the question is, as you kind of think about Teva going forward over the next five years, is this a strategic area you want to be in?</p>
          <p>And second, I'm not sure Michael Hayden is on the phone, but as you guys are going through some of the strategic review of the key products you currently have in the pipeline, I was wondering if you can comment about where you are in terms of your thinking, specifically about things like DiaPep277, the Oncology portfolio and perhaps laquinimod now that it's being submitted in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ronny. Terrific. Good questions. So first of all let's talk about the low cost. We're really talking about the United States, Canada, and Great Britain and the ability to deliver full portfolio at that &#x2013; you used the words, $3 a thousand. I've heard figures $4, I've heard figures $5 but the fact of the matter is this is a core business for us. So the challenge that we face and must deliver on is the ability to deliver at that pricing structure a comprehensive, high-quality, high-service commitment to our customers and we will do that. That's our goal. That's what we're intending to do.</p>
          <p>We believe that this is an important arena to be in for a couple of reasons. First of all, it has synergies with parts of our manufacturing organization. This is terribly important. We have a footprint which is second to none. We have 74 manufacturing facilities worldwide: eight of them in Israel, 17 in North America, 26 in Europe, and others in Asia and South America. Some of these are devoted specifically to the types of products that you talked about.</p>
          <p>And we have now &#x2013; because we are as you've seen that we're bringing on-board Carlo with the intent to really focus on the ability to deliver some superb cost position and drive &#x2013; and ensure that we make a profitable array of products that we can sell in these markets. And looking to the future, I would anticipate some other markets might go the same way so we have to be well-prepared for this and we are. And that's embedded in our thinking.</p>
          <p>Michael is here and let me just flip to him for a moment and have him address the second half of your question if I have answered your first one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You did. I guess the only follow up, maybe follow on is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:62) ongoing investment in low-cost capacity, should we expect that you would continue to build large facilities in low-cost locations? Is this the direction the organization going that way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Carlo lay that all out a little later on. He's on-board and he'll have his manufacturing strategy as part of our update. You'll see that in its fullness and I'll allow him to do that. But philosophically I think I've stated where the company stands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Ronny, for that question. We are currently undergoing a very detailed review of every project that's part of the R&amp;D portfolio, DiaPep is part of that and we will be reporting on the outcome of all of this during our Investor Day in December.</p>
          <p>But let me just talk about one of the drugs you mentioned in the pipeline, which has been a wonderful and a very pleasant surprise for me, is the drug laquinimod, as you know showed very significant results in terms of its ability to reduce disability progression and also brain-volume loss.</p>
          <p>In fact, what's really quite remarkable about this unique asset is that many of its mode of actions and its ability to prevent inflammatory changes are really potentially extrapolatable to some of the more common and more serious disorders for which there really are no therapies. These include some of the neuro-degenerative disorders. And so I would say as part of this review, of course, we are very interested at the potential utilization of drugs in our portfolio for unmet indications, which would match their mechanism of action, which then would very suitably match the cause and the pathways perturbed in some of these other diseases.</p>
          <p>So we're looking at this. And I'd say laquinimod is one of those that has been a wonderful surprise in terms of understanding more deeply its mechanisms of action and its potential utility in other diseases.</p>

And I don't know if he's on the call or not but clearly a significant opportunity for Teva is to consolidate some of your 74 plants that are spread out all over the world. Can you talk about Carlo's experience at Bristol-Myers? What his experience brings to the table? And give us a sense for the feasibility of bringing that 74 number down substantially and sort of generally how long it would take? And I recognize that I'm sure you're still early in your planning process but I view this as a significant hire.

But effectively for those of you who are not familiar, Carlo's experience in this was to take 28 plants down to 12 and effectively increase capacity significantly in that while not reducing quality but indeed enhancing quality. So I view that as part of the skills that he brings, certainly it's understanding that.</p>
          <p>Now of course, generics, some portions of our plants are country-specific, Carlo will be looking there to integrate the best practices within those organizations and bring his experience which is many, many years and many nations of experience, many different cultures, many different networks together so that he can basically handle a significant change in the way that we as an organization operate.</p>
          <p>So first of all, number one, there is the experience of reducing the numbers of plants and making them more efficient. Number two, he has actually invested significantly in plants and I'm sure many of you know of the work that &#x2013; some of you may know the work that he did in Biologics up in Devon.</p>
          <p>Then I would add to you also that, in a company such as ours you have a tremendous talent pool and the talent pool often is focused on individual plants or regional networks and in that capacity, Carlo now has the opportunity to really raise the game for all of those.</p>
          <p>So I would also think about that not just in the pure manufacturing concepts but also &#x2013; and managerial concepts, also business practice. Carlo ran global procurement and we currently have procurement, which is within his organization, and again it will be in his organization. So he brings &#x2013; remember I mentioned the concept of globalizing some of our activities. Once you globalize global procurement, which we will do and it is part of our strategic initiatives, it will end up having a significant impact on the gross margin.</p>
          <p>So, this is part of a holistic look of how bringing in a senior manager can help, not just growing the people, getting greater efficiency out of the plants but also introducing business practices which have a direct impact on the profitability of the company.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, the first question is for Bill. Given this quarter the updates on the Concerta Citizens' Petition and then the Adderall XR competitor front, I just want to get your feel for the sufficiency of the Teva ANDAs to meet the regulatory requirements that are out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jason. I appreciate the question. Obviously the approval is there for Watson and the Citizens' Petition has been answered and we know exactly what the requirements are. I'm not really going to comment too much on our file at this point in time, but we anticipate being in the market one way or the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could just follow up with one other question just on the Advair front, I know in the past I think you targeted a 2014 U.S. filing date. Haven't seen any updates in clinicaltrials.gov, but just curious if you feel like that filing date is still achievable and when we can expect an update on Advair? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, on the Advair, are you referring to our branded program or are you referring to a generic strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My understanding was it was an Advair-similar that would be branded.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are probably be better off letting Dr. Hayden address our Advair-like product, but we are in Phase II, we're getting ready to &#x2013; we wouldn't be entering any Phase IIIs until 2014 is the last look that I saw. I don't know if there's any update to that. And I'm going to save a minute here because Dr. Hayden is shaking his head saying no. So there's no update beyond that.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On the European performance, you were down in generics just 1% this quarter. Can you break that out in terms of volume, pricing and inventory destocking contributions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, Michael, for your question. Effectively we have a really little decrease in terms of market share in terms of price as we have see all over the last year, we have every year a decrease around 4% to 6% in Europe. This year we saw a difference in some country like, for example, a price decrease in Spain and Italy around 10% but an increase of the volume, for example, as I mentioned before in Spain and also in Italy. So by the way, every year's volume and the new launch compensate the impact of the price. And fortunately for us we have a very strong performance in Q2 in terms of launch and this additional volume compensates the price reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one other question on expenses. On R&amp;D, are you still tracking towards a 6.8% to 7.2% percentage of sales for the year? And if so, what will drive the significant increase in the second half versus the roughly 6% that you're at this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Eyal. The answer to your question is yes. As we mentioned earlier in the opening comments we do plan to ramp up R&amp;D expenses in the second half of the year as some of our development program will approach milestones and expenses will be accelerated. So yes, we're very committed to the R&amp;D program and the costs will go up in the second half.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for your question, Michael. The next question comes from the line of David Risinger. Your line is live. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that. Okay. Thanks very much for taking my questions here. First of all, I just wanted to better understand the numbers. So I guess these are really questions for Eyal.</p>
          <p>In terms of constant-currency growth, you provided that by region but I was hoping that you could tell us what the constant-currency organic growth is in EMEA and in rest-of-world. I know that for the total company it was up 7% if you exclude Provigil generics but I was hoping for that breakdown in EMEA and rest-of-world.</p>
          <p>And then with respect to the inventory reduction, I was hoping that you could just review and explain the figures in the first quarter. So what were the channel inventory reductions again in the first quarter by geography? And what were the inventory reductions in the second quarter so that we can better understand and calculate the true demand growth? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks for the question. Let me try to take them one by one as there are a lot of details behind it.</p>
          <p>First, on the organic growth and growth with currency impact in the rest of the world, we don't break EMEA separately. Our rest-of-the-world markets include: EMEA, Latin America but also Canada, Israel, and Asia, including Japan. But our organic growth for this region, the real organic growth bringing into account both the acquisitions at the base of the calculation and foreign exchange, the entire organic growth for this region was 15%, which we believe it was nice.</p>
          <p>It was driven primarily by EMEA, by Eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine, and the Eastern European regions, by Latin America, which demonstrated a very nice growth in real terms in local currencies, and also Japan. Japan gave us very strong nominal growth because we added Taiyo this quarter as compared to last year but even if we put Taiyo at the base of the calculation, Japan demonstrated very nice organic growth.</p>
          <p>So the entire rest of the world is doing very well. When we look only at the generic part of that, we see that the real growth of the generic part was 9% so you can assume that the branded part grew faster, especially Copaxone in Eastern Europe and Latin America.</p>
          <p>Now regarding inventory, Bill, do you want to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David. I really thank you for the question because I think you're driving at something that maybe people in general are missing. So let's talk about the U.S. for instance.</p>
          <p>Now on the generic side, we've taken about $100 million worth of inventory out of the channel. And as we talked about that last quarter, that's a significant move that was taken out this last quarter. But if you think about the impact of the DSAs on the brand business, when you look at the numbers it somewhat confuses the fact that we have strong, organic growth in all of our branded products. And I think I was concerned myself that people would miss this. Copaxone with 186,000 TRxs and share moved up to 40.8% really growing in MS. And we're down about 20 days in the market.</p>
          <p>We took about 20 days out of the market and that's a little bit higher than the 30 days we'd like to normally keep there, but there was some data there that we couldn't get from ABC when we were negotiating the DSAs and so that's why a little bit more inventory trailed out there. But that's a significant amount that we took out of the market and we're driving patient growth and that's really what matters.</p>
          <p>Treanda's up 10% from prior year and the NSP data shows we're tracking a 21% growth; excellent. Azilect up 15% in units shipped and 11.5% in TRxs.  ProAir increased TRxs 7.7% over the prior year in the SABA market. In the ITS market, Qvar, the TRx growth went from 21.9% to 25.1%, so our TRx volume's up 14.6% versus the prior year. Nuvigil, we talked about that, the share is now in the wake market 48.3% and the volume increase is 17% even though we did have significant price increase there, but the volume increase is 17%. And it's a total increase of 54% for the year.</p>
          <p>So when you look at the brands in the U.S., you've got strong organic growth. Even something like Amrix, where we finally won the patent case back on April 16th, we're looking to return that to promotion in the fourth quarter so we look to reestablish that market. So very strong growth in the brands and generics in the U.S. market.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Couple for Bill, and then a philosophical one for Jeremy. Bill, good morning. How big is generic Pulmicort in the U.S. either specifically or generally? And when have you factored in a hit from additional competition? And can you confirm that the Neutroval action date is the end of this month? And how is that progressing from a review standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we don't have any update on Neutroval. The Neutroval date is &#x2013; the response to PDUFA date is in 2012 here and it's coming up I think, but I'm not sure if it's exactly in 1 month, but it's coming up. So it's moving forward and we won't know until we get a response, of course, from the agency on Neutroval, okay?</p>
          <p>The second part of your question with respect to budesonide; that is a significant product for us in excess of $400 million. We have not factored any competition into our current guidance and we can't really say. We don't know what will happen with the court case with respect to Watson. When we find out what's going to happen, when we understand that, we'll be able to factor that into our numbers. So at this point in time there's very little for us to know other than they'll probably go through the TRO and PI process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, Jeremy, philosophically, are you on board with continuing to raise dividends significantly each year as was the case before you joined? And secondly, are you adding layers of management or streamlining? I realize we've probably only seen a fraction of what you've done or are thinking about doing, but want to understand your philosophy on management complexity and structure as you look out. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions there. First of all, I think &#x2013; and I'd like to ask you to repeat the second half. But the first half was really about dividends. That's a board decision. I'm going to let the board make that decision as they observe our business performance.</p>
          <p>With regard &#x2013; could you repeat your second question? I want to be able to answer it specifically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean the couple of publicly disclosed management announcements are, I believe, new layers or new appointments as opposed to swap-outs. So I want to understand your philosophy on whether you think Teva needs to be bulked up from a management standpoint in terms of complexity and numbers of management level people or is it the reverse? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's neither. It's really a blend and it depends on which part of the company you're looking at. But at the end of the day, there's only one item that I think the outside world should be looking at and asking the question are we building a first-class management team? That's all. There are superb managers in the company and there are superb people who will change positions and we'll bring in from the outside. We're looking for excellence right across the board. This is a very important company and it deserves a world-class management team. And different parts of the company will be treated differently subject to their performance and the talent that's present within them.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for your question, Gregg. The next question comes from the line of Mr. David Buckingham (sic) [David Buck] (1:15:48) from Buckingham Research. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks. Just a couple of follow ups, on the profitability focus in Europe, you talked a little bit about I believe the 5% workforce reduction. Can you talk about whether that was in excess of the Cephalon synergies? And also maybe for Eyal, just to give an overall synergy assessment with Cephalon. And then housekeeping, what was the order of magnitude of the Copaxone tender in rest of world? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first part of the question, I assume will be for Eyal, we have a different model of generic business in Europe. We know how to manage branded generic business we know how to manage substitution driver more by partnering with pharmacist and we know how to manage also the tender business.</p>
          <p>What we are looking for is to anticipate the change, to anticipate the different measures take by the authority and to prevent; and for that we are more working on a more flexible model in terms of go to market model, adapting our organization. And for that, as I mentioned before, we have some change in terms of organization in some countries where the very strong measure was taken by the authority, for example, in Portugal, in Poland, in Hungary moving for the branded generics market for more substitution market. We know exactly what we have to do, what is a key factor of success in the substitution market and we are going to anticipate in other countries <mark type="ph" /> a kind of measure, (1:17:28) like for example, in Spain and we are totally on track also for the integration of the Cephalon acquisition in France, and these help us to move our profitability up and the first result is, as I mentioned, 5% of the reduction of our commercial people in the workforce.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David. It's Eyal. A few more clarifications to your question. First, impact of foreign exchange on profitability. It's important. We had an $8 million negative impact on our operating profit coming from foreign exchange compared to $236 million impact to the top line. So we do have a natural hedge within the structure of our currencies but it is moving and there's a lot of moving parts, they're hard to predict. It could have an impact in the future but definitely the bottom line impact is less than top.</p>
          <p>You asked about Copaxone tenders. We do participate in tenders in many of the small countries outside of Europe and U.S. Russia is the main one which we won in tenders as we talk about tens of millions not very huge numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow up maybe for Eyal, the Cephalon synergies, where do we stand there? And the European 5% reduction in commercial workforce, was that exclusive of, separate from the Cephalon synergies? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 5% is without including the Cephalon acquisition. Just a link of our new modeling some go to market model where we anticipate as mentioned before a branded generics business moving to the more substitution business.</p>
