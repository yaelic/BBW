            <mark type="ph" /> Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Eni's 2011 Second Quarter Results (00:00) Conference Call hosted by Paolo Scaroni, Chief Executive Officer and Alessandro Bernini, Chief Financial Officer. For the duration of the call, you will be in listen-only mode. However, at the end of the call, you'll have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>
          <p>I'm now handing you over to your host to begin today's conference call. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our interim update and second quarter results conference call. During the first half of 2011, our results were hit by two uncertainties of which the major one is of course Libya. In this context, we have made good progress on the strategic drivers which underpin our medium and long-term growth and value creation target.</p>
          <p>Let me now give you a brief overview of the development in our business for this quarter. Alessandro will then take you through our financial performance in Q2. Let's look at the two uncertainties which impacted the first half results in more depth. The disruption in Libya has affected all our businesses. Turning first to E&amp;P, in the second quarter of the year, our Libyan production averaged about 50,000 boe per day with a negative impact of more than 230,000 boe per day on the average daily production for the quarter. Meanwhile, the suspension of Libyan gas imports into Italy impacted Gas &amp; Power results in two ways.</p>
          <p>In terms of volumes, we suffered from reduced sales to shippers and in terms of margins, we suffered because Libyan gas was replaced with gas from other source which have not yet been re-negotiated. The situation in Libya is also impacting our downstream refining and petrochemical businesses as both had to replace Libyan feedstocks with more expensive alternatives. For forecasting purposes, we are assuming that the situation in Libya will continue as it is until the end of 2011. However, we are ready to resume normal operations as soon as the necessary political and security conditions are in place.</p>
          <p>Our assets have suffered no damage and we will be able to return to pre crisis levels of productions in a relatively short space of time especially in our gas fields. The second major uncertainty affecting our results this year is the ongoing re-negotiation of our main gas supply contract. Our reported first half EBIT does not include the expected benefit from contract re-negotiations which would be retroactive once agreement have been reached. Discussion with our suppliers are progressing well.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the broader picture, we have made significant progress on the strategic drivers which underpin our medium and long-term growth. Exploration continues to deliver excellent results. Following the over 900 million boe discovered last year, we added another 415 million boe of resources in the first half of 2011. Amongst those, we are particularly excited by the Skrugard discovery in the Barents Sea which together with the Goliat project starting up in 2015 will give us significant prices in this new frontier oil-producing area.</p>
          <p>Indonesia, we have roughly doubled the gross recover of the resources in place at Jangkrik to more than 2 <mark type="ph" /> tcf (4:06) through additional exploration resulting in a material resource base in an area with existing infrastructure and favorable gas market conditions. Over the last few months, we have also made excellent progress on some of the giants which will drive growth to 2014. In Venezuela, we have agreed all the details of the Junin-5 development plan with PDVSA including the possibility of bringing forward production start up and we are finalizing the commercial agreements for Perla for which we expect to sign the GSA and take the FID before year-end.</p>
          <p>In Russia, our joint venture with Novatek has defined the gas sales agreement with Gazprom for our fields in the Yamal Peninsula paving the way for a final investment decisions on Samburgskoye and also Urengoskoye in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, we continue to strengthen our leading position in the European gas market. Organically, we have expanded our market share, recovering 6 percentage points in Italy and increasing volumes despite the sluggish demand in Germany, France and Spain. Meanwhile, we have consolidated our presence in the Belgium retail market through the recent acquisition of Nuon Belgium.</p>
          <p>We also continue to work on our objective of maximizing value from our non-core subsidiaries, Galp and Snam.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Sandro for the presentation of our results.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paolo, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. In the second quarter of '11, the macroenvironment was mixed. On the positive side, the Brent price averaged $117 a barrel, up 50% compared to the second quarter of '10. However, the average European refining margin Brent/Ural was $2.2 per barrel, a 52% year-on-year decrease that heavily impacted our R&amp;M results. Finally, the euro appreciated 13% versus the U.S. dollar compared to the corresponding period of last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to our results, adjusted operating profit in the second quarter amounted to &#x20AC;4 billion, down 3% year-on-year. This result is mainly due to the weak performances of the Gas &amp; Power, which doesn't reflect any benefits upon gas contract re-negotiations and downstream businesses, partially offset by the contribution of Exploration &amp; Production division and Saipem.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net profit for the second quarter was &#x20AC;1.4 billion, down 14% year-on-year. This result also reflects a higher adjusted tax rate up by more than two percentage point to 59.2%. In the second quarter of '11, Eni's hydrocarbon production amounted to 1,489,000 boe per day, a decrease of 15% compared to Q2 '10. This negative operating result was mainly due to the ongoing instability in Libya which reduced production by approximately 2,000 boe per day if compared to the second quarter '10 and by at least 230,000 boe per day if compared to our plan production profile in Q2 '11.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, PSA entitlements were negatively affected by the sharp increase in the oil price of 36,000 boe per day. The increase in the oil price however boosted the division's adjusted operating profit which amounted to over &#x20AC;3.8 billion, up 11% compared to the second quarter of last year. This positive result comes in spite of the negative impact of the U.S. dollar depreciation amounted to around &#x20AC;300 million the in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the Gas &amp; Power, overall gas volume sold, including consolidated and associated companies, totaled 20.3 bcm, up around 14% year-on-year. However, adjusted operating profit decreased by 60% compared to the same period of '10 due to the sharply lower results delivered by the marketing business. It's worth reminding you that the results do not include any benefits from the renegotiation of our long-term supply contracts, although this will be retroactive once agreements are finalized.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the second quarter of '11 was &#x20AC;300 million compared to &#x20AC;800 million in the second quarter of '10. International transportation results showed a 17% increase notwithstanding the closure of the GreenStream pipeline. The regulated businesses generated &#x20AC;367 million, up 5% versus the corresponding period of last year. The increase is mainly due to higher returns of &#x2013; on the new investments and efficiency actions.</p>
          <p>Adjusted pro forma EBITDA in the Marketing and Power business was negatively impacted by increasing competitive pressure in Italy and Europe, as well as unfavorable climate and scenario effects.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the ongoing situation in Libya reduced the volumes to shippers and affected margins, owing to the substitution of recently renegotiated Libyan gas with other sources of supply not yet renegotiated.</p>
          <p>Turning now to R&amp;M, in the second quarter of '11, the division reported an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;114 million versus a loss of &#x20AC;52 million in the same period of last year due to an unfavorable scenario as well as the depreciation of the dollar versus the euro. These negatives were partially offset by improved efficiency, the synergic integration of refineries and optimization of supply.</p>
          <p>Marketing activities reported a significant improvement of EBIT benefiting from higher sales margins, positively influenced by commercial initiatives which more than offset the sluggish demand for oil products both in Italy and abroad.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter of '11, the Petrochemical business reported an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;30 million compared to a loss of &#x20AC;11 million in the second quarter of '10. The results was negatively impacted by lower margins as high cost of oil-based feedstock and the cost substituting the Libya virgin naphtha were not fully recovered in sale prices on end markets and substantial demand decrease.</p>
          <p>Saipem delivered adjusted operating profit of &#x20AC;378 million, up 10% versus Q2 '10, mainly driven by higher results in onshore construction and offshore drilling operation. Other activities and corporate showed an aggregate loss of &#x20AC;129 million in line with the result reported in the second quarter of '10. In the second quarter of '11, cash flow operations was &#x20AC;4.4 billion. Other sources of cash included proceeds from divestments amounted to around &#x20AC;100 million, mainly related to the sale of upstream marginal assets.</p>
          <p>The cash inflows were used to partially fund cash flow outflows relating to capital expenditure of &#x20AC;3.7 billion and dividend payment of &#x20AC;2.2 billion, which included the payment of the final dividend of '010, as well as dividends to Snam and Saipem minorities. Net financial debt as at the end of June amounted to &#x20AC;26 billion, an increase of &#x20AC;1 billion versus Q1 and in line with the net debt at the end of '010. In the second part of the year, we will benefit from the sale of the international pipelines, one which has been already finalized while we are in exclusive negotiations with a preferred bidder for the disposal of TENP and Transitgas. The cash in is expected by year-end.</p>
          <p>In this time of market turbulence, we can rely on a financial debt which is well diversified by source of funding and is characterized by an optimal profile in terms of both composition and duration.</p>
          <p>In the first half of the year, we further extended the duration of our debt. Over 80% of our gross debt is mid long-term, with an average maturity of more than 5 years. No bond are due this year and long term debt due by year-end '011 is just &#x20AC;300 million. In addition, 53% of our long-term debt bears fixed interest rate, further stabilizing our risk exposure.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and I will now hand you over to Paolo for his closing remarks.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sandro. In conclusion, in E&amp;P, we are delivering on our strategy of developing giant fields in promising areas and making good progress on our growth target for the plan period and beyond. For 2011, we forecast that Libya will continue to produce at current reduced levels until the end of the year with an estimated overall impact of at least 200,000 boe per day on full year production. Net of this impact, we confirm our previous guidance of growth excluding PSA effect of flat production at $100 per barrel <mark type="ph" /> as startups, rentups (15:48) and better performance from other areas of the world will sustain our production in the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, giving guidance for 2011 is particularly complex, as our results will depend on both the timing and the terms of ongoing supplier negotiations which are at present confidential. That said, assuming the negotiations are closed before the end of the year, we expect Gas &amp; Power results to be broadly in line with 2010, net of the impact on Libya. The final impact of substituting Libyan gas with alternative from our portfolio will also depend on the outcome of negotiation, but we expect it to be around &#x20AC;300 million.</p>
          <p>In R&amp;M, we previously guided to breakeven in 2011 at the same refining market conditions as 2010. So far this year, market conditions have continued to decline, leading us to report a &#x20AC;260 million loss for the first half. We expect market conditions to improve slightly in the second half of the year, which coupled with continuing cost optimization and the favorable seasonality of marketing results, we significantly reduced second half losses.</p>
          <p>In terms of leverage, we confirm our guidance of reducing year-end gearing below that reported at the end of last year. Looking forward, our strategy remains unchanged. We continue to invest for growth in the long-term interest of our shareholder while maintaining a firm financial discipline, a strong balance sheet and our dividend policy. Our solid long-term prospects and the good overall results expected for this year support our proposal of an interim dividend of $0.52 a share with a 4% increase on the 2010 interim dividend. We will now be pleased to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Hello ladies and gentlemen. The Q&amp;A session is now open. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question comes from Clint Oswald from Sanford Bernstein. Mr. Oswald please proceed with your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, good afternoon. <mark type="ph" /> Two quick (18:39) questions, first one just on the natural gas. Can I just confirm, are you paying for extra Russian gas in 2011 and you're not sourcing deferred volumes on your long-term contracts from potentially 2010? So, you're actually buying extra natural gas from Russia and then secondly, really maybe just on Ghana, could you talk about what some of your second discovery there this week and now you have two. Could you talk about the prospect of what you think you have in that block and also, the split you may have between natural gas and condensate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good, the first answer will be from Domenico and the second from Claudio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, we are taking more gas just because <mark type="ph" /> they replace (19:27) the Libyan gas. We use our own portfolio but it is true that we are taking more Russian gas than from other sources, but is within the contract that of course offer some flexibility in uptakes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ghana; so the second discovery we made in Ghana that is close to the first one, is 15 kilometers is tactically with the discovery, we double our resource base and the percentage of condensate is a few percentage, we talk about 5%. So, the condensate is not large, but in this second discovery, we have also found some good oil horizon that at the moment it's just under evaluation and can give additional prospectivity on other prospect structure that we have in the surrounding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Just a follow-up, could you potentially to put some numbers on that resource? You said it doubled; can you talk about some numbers on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are about 2 Tcf.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you very for giving an indication of what capital employed you have in Libya. Could you give us an estimate of what proportion of last year's PV-10, was represented by your Libyan asset?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think we want to disclose these numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you &#x2013; can you give us any indication of just the reserve number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when we speak about production, listen our production within normal conditions is between 280,000 boe and 300,000 boe per day of which a large proportion is gas, almost to 60-plus percent. These assets, our assets, generally speaking, young and therefore with an amount of production expected to continue for a long time. This, I think, is the maximum we can really disclose about Libya.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Barry MacCarthy from Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr. MacCarthy, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon. Thank you for the presentation. Can I just ask about the non-core comment Galp and Snam Rete Gas, and I think that's a stronger indication than you've previously given that Snam is non-core, is that correct? Have you moved on in your thinking about Snam in the portfolio? And if you can give any update at all and I understand it's sensitive, but any update at all on when you might conclude a deal on Galp? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay let me make first a general comment about Snam. You have heard me saying in the past that we were not dogmatic about the presence of Snam in our portfolio. We were not dogmatic, but of course what we wanted to avoid at almost any price was to be obliged to sell, because when you are obliged to sell, you normally sell at very poor conditions.</p>
          <p>Now, we think we have achieved that through the adoption of the Third Directive in the form of the, what we call <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:22) which will allow us to keep the ownership of Snam Rete Gas as long as we want. Now, with this behind us, then we become even less dogmatic than before. What I mean by that is that if we find ways to create value from this shareholding of ours, for our shareholders, we would be happy to do it.</p>
          <p>Now, this is easier to say than to do because you should always remember that whatever solution we find for a divestment of Snam needs the approval of the Italian government, and even more, needs a decree from the government which allows us to go below 50% of the capital because it is a kind of process of privatization, so called.</p>
          <p>So, we are in the middle of all of that, and we frankly will not hurry because in the meanwhile, the company is performing well and delivering a return which is well in excess of our WACC. But of course, we are working on this project and we're expecting the next few months to come with some ideas. Now, as you said, all this is confidential because we are talking about two listed companies, and we don't want to raise expectations of something very soon, but certainly, we are working on this subject. Galp, do you want me to say something about Galp as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you could, Mr. Scaroni, it would be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as Galp is concerned, our strategy has not changed. We certainly don't want to be long-term investor in a listed company which we do not control and which represents a sizable amount of investment, because our shareholding in Galp is worth nothing in excess of &#x20AC;4 billion. We are looking at potential opportunities. Again, here too, things are easier to say than to do because until 2014, any divestment of our stake in Galp should in fact be approved by the two partners we have, the two strategic partners. One being Mr. Amorim, Amorim Energia and the other one being the government, the Portuguese government through <mark type="ph" /> La Caixa, (26:09) their financial institution.</p>
          <p>So, again this is a point on which we are working. We are probably more in advance than on the Snam in terms of timing. We cannot really disclose much more than that. Again, we are relaxed in terms of timing for two reasons. First of all, because the company is a good company, share price is performing reasonably well, and second, because Galp will &#x2013; is in the process of selling a stake of its Petrogal asset which includes all the assets that Galp has in Brazil, so roughly 75%, 80% of the value of the company. And we expect that at the end of this process, the share price of Galp will move up rather than down; so again, yes, we are working but no hurry at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the question. You talked about the Gas &amp; Power business and I recognize on the gas marketing, you don't want to talk specifically about the negotiations by country. But could you sort of talk in a rather high level about if the contracts had been renegotiated to your satisfaction prior to the second quarter, where you would have expected the gas marketing earnings to be? Or to put it another way is, if we get to the fourth quarter and you're able to renegotiate and we sort of spread it back across the &#x2013; can you just talk a little more about that?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I think you then said something about comparing it to last year but then having to adjust it for Libyan effects. Can you also just elaborate a little further on that if that's possible? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try to take you through a kind of process out of which you might deduct what our expectations are. Now, I am more than giving you elements about the negotiation which as you can imagine is very delicate on one side and that it is not concluded, so even more.</p>
          <p>Now, we try to solve this question of yours giving you guidance for 2011. The guidance we give on Gas &amp; Power is that on the basis of what we consider a potential outcome of the re-negotiations, our result will be in line with 2010, excluding &#x20AC;300 million of Libya, okay?</p>
          <p>Now, if you elaborate on that you take our results on the first half, which do not include any result of this negotiation, and you compare with this guidance we are giving to you, I think you might extract a total number of what we expect to be the benefit we should have by year-end from our negotiations, both with Gazprom and Sonatrach.</p>

          <p>And the &#x20AC;300 million that is a Libyan effect, is that loss of market share to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:53)?</p>

          <p>No, this is made of two components; one is, we sold less gas than we would have sold, simply because we didn't have the gas. Second, I would say &#x2013; then second, price. Price is made, again, of two components; the first component is that we had to replace some Libyan gas with our portfolio which is certainly much more expensive than the Libyan gas for the simple reason the Libyan gas is the only one we have already renegotiated. We have been unlucky; we renegotiated the wrong one first, I have to say. Now, that's the first.</p>
          <p>Second, in the contract of the Libyan gas, there is a portion which is what we call extra gas, so gas released by the Libyans which do not use it for internal consumption, which is particularly cheap and therefore, we had to replace even this one. At the conclusion of that, we attribute roughly &#x20AC;300 million to the Libyan shortfall.</p>

          <p>Our next question is Sharma Nitin from JPMorgan. Mr. Sharma, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just one question please. And I'm conscious that you've delivered a 4% increase in interim dividend, but given the likely divestment of stake in Galp, international pipeline, much stronger oil price versus your planning assumptions, when do you plan to reevaluate your dividend policy in terms of the pace of Euro 1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, now, we are not planning to reevaluate our dividend policy. We are planning to reevaluate our dividend base; that is, I don't know if you remember, but our dividend policy is based on our scenario, and according to our scenario, our plan, which include the CapEx we plan to make and the need we had to do to go below 40% of leverage, define the sustainable dividend for the four years period of the plan.</p>
          <p>Therefore, in our presentation, in our strategy presentation we will make in February, which we will present a new plan of Eni and we will disclose as usual our scenario as far as oil prices are concerned, then we will give you the new base of calculation of our dividend. Now, of course, the new thing is that all this has to take into account Libya, because Libya is such an important position for us, that if, well, frankly, I hope it will not be the case, but if in February next year, the Libyan situation will be at the same point where we are today, this will be also part of our considerations.</p>

          <p>Next question come from Mr. Demichelis Alejandro from Bank of America. Mr. Demichelis, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. A couple of questions from me; the first one is on the renegotiation of the contracts for your gas. Is that number that you're providing us with kind of the minimum number you're expecting on those renegotiations, or is there a kind of range that &#x2013; of different alternatives that we should be thinking about?</p>
          <p>And the second question is regarding the Libyan situation and how quickly you said you can restart production? Can you give us some kind of time, if you're saying for the gas, it's quite quickly but for the oil, how long should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Domenico will answer the first one and Claudio the second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> One of the main factor, (33:59) Mr. Scaroni, is in line what our expectation of the result or the final result of the negotiations we are running. So, our basing on what we think will be the possible outcome of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Libyan production, for gas, because of different reason than the first one, is that gas fields are quite young and so there is no water problem, water kind of problem and all the installations for what we know up to now are in very good shape. I think is a question of month, two, three months we can restart calculate full production. For oil field, it's quite different. We talk about giant field but really old field with old installations. So, is some, we need some time not less than 1 year, 12 months to restart production for oil fields.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, then when you're talking about your guidance for this year and not for next year, then we should be thinking that even if the situation in Libya were to be solved today, your 2012 numbers would be quite satisfactory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as today, I think that for gas, we can consider a full rate gas for 2012 and for oil, our share now is very low, because there is not big investment. So, I think that we talk about 40,000, 50,000 barrels per day and we can consider half of that production for the guidance of next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, yes, two questions please. First of all, on Iraq, perhaps you could update us on the pace of developments there and how that's progressing since you've taken operatorship of Zubair? And second question, just turning to China; I wondered if you could update us on the status of your negotiations with PetroChina under the MOU that you signed earlier this year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Claudio will answer both the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First Iraq; from operation point of view, Iraq is going quite well. We are still producing 280 &#x2013; an average of 280,000 barrels per day. We are still in the first phase, you know that we have the rehabilitation phase that will last three years and after that, the full development phase. There is no operational problem; we are experiencing some problem in the awarding of contracts because of bureaucracy. And that is the main hurdle we are facing there. So, there is no &#x2013; the hurdle that we saw at the very beginning, pipe capacity or other things. But the main issue now on the table is the awarding of contract that will allow us to go ahead with development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could I follow up on that point, does that change your expectations for production from Iraq this year or next?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that doesn't impact production. Because if you remember during the strategy presentation, we put some contingency on Iraqi production. And so, there is no impact from that point of view, or for that reason you say that our guidance for 2011 is absolutely the same. And I don't think that this problem that is not a technical problem, it's just bureaucracy. I think that will be solved.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, China, we start, we signed the first MOU at the beginning of the year with PetroChina. And now, very recently, with SinoTech. The aim and the content of the MOU are more or less the same, in the sense that it's our main objective is to have some unconventional blocks in China and may target an objective of our Chinese partner is to have an access in Africa, where we are the first company in terms of <mark type="ph" /> actually just (38:39) production and reserves. So, we are working really, identify some possible area. And I think that in the next month, we will be ready to start serious discussion and possible transaction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:03) two question if I may. The first one, I would like ask how the sale and how did the consolidation of Snam Rete Gas could change your strategy? I don't know &#x2013; more aggressive exploration, acquisition of assets, more generally, what are the main constraint you see in your current gearing?</p>
          <p>Second question, what's the main takeaway from the recent negotiation of Edison with Promgas, your joint venture with Gazprom? It looks like quite generous for Edison, so I was wondering whether you could give us more flavor on what happened there? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say a word about the consolidation of Snam Rete Gas. Let's say, we do not expect that rating agencies will look at us in a different way if we deconsolidate Snam Rete Gas, for the simple reason that it is true that, out of our &#x20AC;26 billion of debt, &#x20AC;12 billion or &#x20AC;11.5 billion or &#x20AC;12 billion are Snam Rete Gas debt. But the rating agencies quite correctly make the define of reasoning that this debt is well hedged with regulated assets and therefore, we are not expecting major change in the perception of the rating agency or of the financial markets. As far as Edison is concerned, I think Domenico will give you a feel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you may have read, Edison <mark type="ph" /> found (22:44) agreement with Gazprom on the gas they buy. This <mark type="ph" /> after a threat, in fact an arbitration clause that one month maybe (40:46) started. <mark type="ph" /> Both on the line of date, (40:51) Edison and ourself operate in a different market. Edison is mainly concentrated in power generation. Our marketing is a little bit different. Another element that we should consider is that the volumes sold to Edison are around 2 bcm a year, it means around 10 time less because we buy around what we buy because we buy around 20 billion cubic meter a year. Anyhow, this result is quite interesting because it shows the ability of Gazprom to find agreements.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. I just had one very quick question on your exploration program, offshore Mozambique this year; if you could provide any color on that, that would be great? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exploration for us in the second half year, as well in Mozambique and that is at the Block 4 that we have big expectation for this well and for the result of this well also based on the result of the well drilled by Anadarko.</p>
          <p>So, we think that we have big structure and the <mark type="ph" /> BOS (22:44) now very, very high, close of 50%, 60% and we are very, I think thought about possible appraisal phase <mark type="ph" /> where we a rig (42:27) and all the materials, equipment and people ready to go at immediately with back to back drilling to be able to define a very quick way, the dimension of the reserves but we are very, very positive on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. I've got a follow-up; just on thinking about Snam a little bit, is that as you said, is that it was sort of legally acknowledged that the structure that you had in place complied with the directive &#x2013; the directive, which I believe essentially says that you don't have direct management control any further over the actions of Snam management. Does that mean actually in legal terms that you could de-consolidate it anyway even if you don't own, even if your continue to own 50% just on a substance over form?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to be more precise. Today, in what we call Snam, there is the transportation, gas transportation which is the network in Italy; then there is storage, then we have Italgas distribution and then we have the GNL, so the regasification terminal. Out of all these four businesses, the only one which is object of further activity, the transportation. Therefore, within Snam Rete Gas, they will create a company which would be built around the rules of the <mark type="ph" /> ITAL (44:21) which are very specific rules of governance which will manage the transportation system.</p>
          <p>All the rest, nothing will change, will stay exactly as it is. Now, this transportation business represents roughly 40% of Snam, a little less than 40% of Snam. For the other 60% of Snam, nothing changes.</p>

So, the things are going quite well and for the first phase as we said already, there are times we confirm that technically there is no problem to reach the first production by the end of 2012 and we are discussing about course of the Phase II for that reason, we are slowing down and first of all, we want to see the result of the Phase I and we are looking at the conceptual of the Phase II to optimize cost and increase the internal rate of return of the project.
