          <p>Good morning. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the UniCredit Group's First Quarter 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Federico Ghizzoni, Chief Executive Officer of UniCredit Group. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, everybody. I've understood that we were online already few minutes ago, so let's say that we celebrate the birthday of our CFO, Marina Natale with a very good quarter.</p>
          <p>With the net profit going up to &#x20AC;810 million, big jump versus the first quarter on 2010. Revenues are going up 7% mostly driven by trading income, but also with the commercial business performing in line with expectation in particular in term of trend of commissions &#x2013; fees and commissions. Operating cost up 3.7%, but excluding banking leverage and some non-recurring element, we have quite good plus 1% quarter-on-quarter. Good trend in term of loan loss provision with a double-digit decrease and the cost of risk down by 18 basis points to 108 basis points.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet confirming a solid structure, the leverage ratio is down to 20.7 from 21.5. As I said already asset quality trend is improving still gross impaired loans growing 1.1% quarter-on-quarter but with signal of deceleration and certain improvement especially in Germany and Central Eastern Europe. Funding plan is well underway. We've completed up to the 6th of May 58% of the Group funding and two-third of the funding needed in Italy completed. Very good is the trend of the capital ratios. We have core Tier 1 that goes up to 9.06%, thanks to an increase of 49 basis points and the risk weighted assets are down 2.4% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look now more in detail. Operating profit and profit as you can see here big jump or big increase quarter-on-quarter but also year-on-year. In particular, the net operating profit is growing at 56% and quarter-on-quarter, 41% year-on-year. It is worth to mention that in term of net profit, this is the best quarter since the second quarter '08. So quite, let's say promising starting of the year. Few words &#x2013; small words about the net operating profit, as you can see comes from 7% increase of the revenues. Costs as I said already 3.7% and then we'll go more in details later on, loan loss provision decreasing quarter-on-quarter 14.1%. All-in-all, as I said that we have a big increase in term of operating profit with cost to income down 1.8 points so to 55.7%.</p>
          <p>In the right side of this slide, we start to give you a new representation. So, we have separated Western Europe from CEE and Poland in order to give you more clarity about the two regions. As you can see, the trading in particular and the effect is significant in Western Europe. So, the net operating profit is growing quarter-on-quarter 70%, but also very positive in CEE and Poland with 33.5%. Revenues as we said up 7%, mainly driven by the improved market condition. Nevertheless, also fees and commission are up versus the previous quarter 0.6%. If you consider that traditionally the fourth quarter is better than the first quarter, especially versus Central Eastern Europe, I think is a good trend.</p>
          <p>The net interest income is down 2.5%. We touch upon at this point, is affected also by some one-off in the fourth quarter and two days less of interest in this quarter. Just if you can stay one second on this page, again, as you can see, the trend is opposite to West Europe versus Central Eastern Europe 10% increased, West Europe internal revenues 4.1% minus. In CEE, here we have a double effect one is the seasonality. Traditionally, since many years sort of first quarter in CEE is worse than the fourth quarter and there's also some FX effect.</p>
          <p>Net interest, as I said minus 2.5%, but two days less in term of duration of the quarters means more or less &#x20AC;90 million less of net interest income, plus one-off in the first quarter. This brings to substantially to a trend that is basically flat versus first two quarter. In fact we have not perceived during the quarter any significant positive impact from increase of Euribor, which has been limited to 5 or 6 basis point. We hope this will kick-in in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>Volumes, loans are up 0.6%. What is important to note is inside this number is a fact that we see return to growth from the Italian commercial business. As you know very well Italy is for us a strong point of attention, the fact that overall &#x2013; or maybe later on, we will talk a bit more about Italy. Italy start to signal some recovery in term of volumes, and business in general is quite positive. Deposits are stable quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Fees and commissions, as we said, we are growing 0.6% despite, as I said, of the fact that traditionally the fourth quarter is higher than the first quarter. Overall there is a good trend in West Europe, 2.4% increase; and once again minus 6.1% increase in CEE partially due to effects partially due to the trend that I explained before.</p>
          <p>Operating cost, there is an increase of total of 3.7% quarter-on-quarter. In reality and once again the net of one-off, the increase is 1%, and the cost-to-income is down minus 1.8 points. In particular staff expenses once again up 6.2% but once again the net one-off basically stable. And other expenses are same, they are flat but net one-off is going down 5.2%. I've already commented the cost-to-income.</p>
          <p>Good trend in term of FTE. We decreased 1,300 people mostly coming from Italy. This is the effect &#x2013; first effect of the agreement reached with the unions, October last year. Particular, as you see, the decrease is minus 1.5% in West Europe and in Italy, once again in CEE is stable. The trend is positive and should continue even though with not &#x2013; not with this speed during the year. We benefit also in term of P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to the cost of risk. This is a positive trend. We have a double-digit decrease quarter-on-quarter from &#x20AC;1.7 billion to &#x20AC;1.5 billion is generalized decrease. All division and business shows are showing a good trend. You can see again a different representation on the right side of the slide. So we have division at the top and country below. We can see Italy, particular is improving overall quite well, from 178 basis point to 141 basis point.</p>
          <p>There is a recovery &#x2013; there is an increase in Germany, but coming from very exceptionally good fourth quarter, so 37 basis point is a very good level. But basically stable in Austria and strong decrease in Central Eastern Europe and Poland from 225 basis point to 142 basis point.</p>
          <p>Point of attention in term of asset quality is on the impaired loans. Impaired loans are still growing 1.1% with some differences region-by-region. The speed of growth is less than the previous quarter. As we discussed already two, three months ago, we are expecting stabilization especially in Italy during the year. So again, Italy has been a country that has shown us the signal of increase, good trend and decreasing in Germany, decreasing impaired loans also in Central Eastern Europe. As I said comes mostly from Italy, but we see decelerating time line and we expect a stabilization during the year. The coverage ratio is going up from 43.9% to 44.7% especially on that NPL side.</p>
          <p>This slide where you're already familiar, I think it gives good idea with the red line on the annualized cost of risk per quarter. As you can see the trend down is consolidated. But important also the addition in term of bps of the impaired loans after the pick of the fourth quarter, we are very much down to 5 bps. In this case as well, it is clear that the speed of additions is significantly decreasing. It is also consolidating trend.</p>
          <p>Staying with the asset quality, I would focus on these slides on the reverse ratio. You can see it is once again evident the improvement from 41% to the first quarter '09 is going progressively down &#x2013; sorry it went up. In this case up is positive to 76%, confirming once again that in term of new addition, new flow we are approaching &#x2013; we are going in the right &#x2013; to the right direction.</p>
          <p>I will move now to the non-operating items, not too much to say, this is just a walk from the net operating profit to net profit, nothing special to be explained here. So I will move straight way to the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Also In terms of balance sheet, not significant change total assets are down 2% quarter-on-quarter, tangible equity plus 1.8%, important leverage ratio that shows a continuous improvement to 20.7%. So this gives space to catch opportunity should the recovery in economy shall be confirmed.</p>
          <p>On the structure of the balance sheet, no significant change. Just a point of attention is on the net interbank position. We had as you remember a big jump third quarter, fourth quarter is stabilizing. But still pretty high and this is confirming &#x2013; it's coming from the, let's say still difficulties on the CD/CP market that is pretty close, so we had to go to the interbank market.</p>
          <p>Few words about the funding. The funding plan has been anticipated versus the original but as I said 58% has been already completed, 65% in Italy. This obviously have some effect in term of cost of funding meaning anticipating the plan has some negative effect. But on the other side, we feel very much comfortable in this position in a market that is still pretty volatile and complicated in term of liquidity. So, I think that this is a quite good news.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to the capital position. The major point comes from risk weighted assets are decreasing 2.4% quarter-on-quarter driven by decreasing of credit risk weighted asset mostly. So the decrease is equivalent to &#x20AC;11.1 billion.</p>
          <p>And as you can see on the next slide, this has a positive effect on the capital ratios in particular, the Core Tier 1 goes up 49 basis points to 9.06%. As you can read from the slide, we have 15 basis point coming from retained earnings. So profitability 21 basis points is the reduction in term of risk-weighted asset, 13 basis point comes from the exclusion of goodwill deductibility filter as per new rules of Bank of Italy. So except the 13 basis point all the rest comes from the profit and the restructuring of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, and before coming to your question, the starting of the year has been in our opinion positive. As I said it is the best quarter since beginning of 2008. Revenues are up and cost of risk is going down. We think that in term of asset quality the trend is in the positive &#x2013; is positive and should continue. Risk weighted asset under control with positive effect on the Core Tier 1. Important for us is the fact that from Italy we start to see signal of improvement.</p>
          <p>This is confirmed by this slide, it is very synthetic, but as you can see this is about Italy. Loans, even though not too much, is plus 1.1% are increasing. Then, again, maybe through Roberto, most definitely can go in more detail. But we start to see good signal on the retail side <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:30) and SMEs and also achieved. Very important the fact that in term of revenues risk weighted asset there is a particular good improvement from 6.57% to 7.23%, and in terms of asset quality a general improvement in all division.</p>
          <p>So considering again that Italy is substantially 40% of our business this is a good signal in line with the fact that Germany and <mark type="ph" /> Austria (19:01) are performing well and CEE is expected to deliver good results during the year.</p>
          <p>So, I would stop here, opening the floor to your question. Thanks for your attention.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me this is the Chorus Call conference operator. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Mr. Marcello Zanardo of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mr. Ghizzoni and colleagues. The first question is on capital. We see some better than expected capital generation from you for different reasons that you just explained. And today, on the front page of the <mark type="ph" /> FP (20:05), there seems to be &#x2013; of the <mark type="ph" /> FP (20:06) there seems to be consensus building of introducing a 4C fee at Tiered 1 systems, so not a flat surcharge, which probably is going to benefit big banks but not huge banks just to simplify my terminology. So on capital, I would like to ask you a few things. First of all from the first impressions from the conversation you have. If this system were to be implemented what do you think that would be the impact versus what we know today, which I know you have been saying I am still waiting for final rules still. So I am just asking you the impression, what would be the impact to your capital position from this new regulation?</p>
          <p>The second question on capital as well is from your cashes, I read some of the comments reporting by your conference with the media. It looks like the &#x20AC;3 billion of cashes are likely to be including Core Tier 1, if you could also give us some more color on this. The second question is on profitability, which as you pointed out, where Italy has been the main weak point of the Group. Can you give us at the comp level the losses made by the Italy and all the corporate governance &#x2013; the corporate center, sorry which is allocated part to Italy, part to the rest of the Group? But just for us to better understand the starting point, so if you could give us some figures of the pre-tax loss or net profit loss in Italy, what the situation is, so that we can better assess.</p>
          <p>And second, asset quality, you cannot control that but you can control costs and it looks to me that UniCredit could have a significant potential to cut costs in Italy. What is preventing you from implementing a significant restructuring on the cost side that we've seen in other banks, so it's possible to do it in Italy? I just would like to see if this is possible, if this is difficult, if this is impossible? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So starting from the new rules, well, let's say we've got in this period of time clearly periodic meetings with regulators and what has been anticipated today, I must say, it was already known to us at least. So rules are not clearly defined yet and not communicated yet. It maybe possible that will come what <mark type="ph" /> FP (22:56) is saying, in other words rather than one flat surcharge it will see buckets of banks with different surcharges. The number of banks included and the names are not yet defined. Rumors are saying 30, 40 banks are maximum, maximum. But we have &#x2013; I have no evidence <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:22) positive or negative.</p>
          <p>Decision will be taken in November. We should know something more precise starting from July. Well impact on us, the reason why we kept saying, let's see and wait, is because that there is a big <mark type="ph" /> differentive (23:47) &#x2013; again will come unique surcharge for everybody is different. It will have different steps or different buckets, is also different. It will be only equity, pure equity or a composition of equity income and further instruments like Fineco. It also is not yet clear how Fineco will be treated. So again I am not in a position to say what will be in reality the impact on us. We have to wait another two, three months at least hopefully.</p>
          <p>But it seems that will be less rigid than what we were supposed to be in the first version. And once again it would be also important not only what regulator will decide, but also what the market will perceive within a right level, for example in term of phasing, we know that <mark type="ph" /> CDS (24:50) will not kick in immediately. So we'll be given a time, to banks to adjust their capital, but as we have seen from Basel III, markets tend to anticipate these actions. Any case this discussion is still open and we have to wait a bit.</p>
          <p>Cashes, let's say we are &#x2013; let's say already in negotiation. Our feeling is that there is a very constructive discussion ongoing. So we think we will find a solution and we think that cashes will continue to be considered Core Tier 1. Italy, let me say, just to give you a feeling, if we look only at the commercial business of Italy, so what is the so-called <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:53) meaning the three business division plus leasing, factoring, et cetera, <mark type="ph" /> Fineco (25:59) et cetera.</p>
          <p>First quarter give us an important signal, because it's turned to be profitable and the swing between the fourth quarter and the first quarter is in the range of &#x20AC;400 million. So there is a significant improvement quarter-on-quarter with the business, that is back to generate profit. And finally internal cost cutting well, let's say, for sure I can assure everybody that we are working hard in order to be effective in this respect also in Italy. The plan that we have is defined, action are ongoing. So I'm sure that we will have a good benefit also in this respect. Going back now to the commercial business, again, I ask Roberto Nicastro to give you some more feelings about the Italy business overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Maybe I could start by full elaborating on cost &#x2013; on cost in Italy, to say that we share the view that there exists potential for reduction. There are especially three areas that could overtime support the cost actions. First of all, as you know, there are currently negotiations at national level about the labor contract. We come from an history in which the sector has been warranting over time a 1% average real salary increase in the last five years. This was the result of negotiation based on relatively high return on equities for the industry achieved in the past. The new negotiation clearly is on a completely different basis. There are different view points between trade unions in this sector, clearly the outcome of that might generate cost opportunity. Second, we have been starting as with the One4C project, a significant action on the corporate centers. With the merger of the six legal entities, we feel that there is more that we can do and we are actually targeting the overall, let's say, corporate center cost in Italy.</p>
          <p>Further aspect, within the branch network we have seen that also based on our efforts, customer's attitude to do transaction via online channels and known physical channel is drastically increasing. To give you an idea, for us in Italy, we moved from a situation where in 2008, 41% of transactions were passing through the branch &#x2013; through branch counter. Right now that &#x2013; sorry, I apologize, 59% was passing from the branch, that's 59% is being reduced as numbers of March 2011, so the last month after 29%. So, this clearly gives an idea on the fact that there is room for reducing the average size of branches. There is room for reducing <mark type="ph" /> real estate based asset (29:44) cost. There is a room for reducing the full time equivalent branch. As you remember in 2010, we struck an agreement with trade unions allowing us to reduce by 3,000 full time equivalents &#x2013; by 3,000 people the Italian staff and in exchange for 1,000 recruits. We've a clear benefit in terms of overall cost.</p>
          <p>Talking about the commercial developments, on commercial developments we have seen a good start, I would say in all sectors, in all businesses in Italy, with private banking having double-digit improvements in these asset commissions. We've a good increase in the lending activity by corporate, by medium enterprises and small business and in consumer finance. In corporate, I think it is good to see that there has been an important commercial action being launched whereby just by leveraging on the unused credit lines on the one to five &#x2013; on the best one to five ratings there is a &#x20AC;20 billion of room-to-go. Also I think its worthwhile to mention, the very excellent, very good development of Fineco in the asset gathering activity. Fineco has among other things increased all in the quarter by 15,000 the number of new customers.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I will &#x2013; I will stick to two questions then. Going back to your slide 23 on capital and risk weighted asset management, which is really relevant. Can you give us a bit more color how you managed your risk weighted assets down to generate the 20 bps in the quarter? I am surprised actually to see its credits. Other banks have actually had better results from the market component. How exactly have you reduced it? Have you &#x2013; selling position, have you been reducing the risk-weighting for the risk implied in certain position? How much more do you have to do, if you can give us a little bit more color there?</p>
          <p>And then going back to your fixed income results clearly fantastic results your trading line has been the second best quarterly trading you've reported in the last five years. Everybody has had fantastic fixed income results this quarter. You've done particularly better, 20% above last year I think is the best &#x2013; one of the best I have seen. Can you tell us a little bit more where that is coming from, does that mean that actually there are businesses that you were not capturing now you are? And how should we looking at this business going forward fully plateau in terms of potential contribution? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I will ask maybe Jean Pierre mostly then to elaborate more on both questions. I would say that in term of risk weighted asset, we have started a program of rationalization and optimization of the balance sheet. It is touching the three components so credit, markets and also operational risk, implies also a change a bit of strategy. For example on the credit side, we are reviewing the large exposure of customer and &#x2013; commercial customer and institutions in order to understand what is the return on asset and taking appropriate decision. As you remember three months ago we were discussing that risk-weighted asset and return on asset are somewhat the major challenges in front of us. And we started to address them. So I'll ask, maybe, Jean Pierre Mustier, because most comes from CIB, to elaborate more on this point and then on the trading results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I think on the risk-weighted assets side and the changes &#x2013; the decrease are coming from two different components. One is from the market activities where the VaR has actually been decreasing, so that impacted the risk-weighted asset components of the market side. The VaR decreased because we had positions which were basically smaller and also because of some C&amp;I coming out from the VaR. So you had the double impact basically. When I look at the projection of VaR, I think that the VaR right now is relatively low in terms of its absolute level, but I don't anticipate pending a major market surge &#x2013; any massive rebound. I think VaR can increase slightly, but not in a massive way.</p>
          <p>On the second component which is coming from the financing side from the financing portfolio as Federico mentioned. We have more technical impact basically for the risk-weighted assets decrease, which in the new parameter has been of around &#x20AC;8 billion and this technical impact are linked to debt equality and may further give out changes. So there has been a certain number of impact into the change of model or to taking into account some of the guarantees. But for the moment, no impact of &#x2013; for instance CDS hedges or securitization that, we could have been putting in place, but we're looking at potentially managing some of the concentration and managing our risk-weighted assets, maybe with more dynamic hedges, in the future. So, this is something that as Federico mentioned, is under consideration. But which was not put in place for the first quarter. And there I cannot comment on the quantum of the effect it would have in the future as we see work in progress.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Just to clarify therefore, improvements in modeling taking account of &#x2013; better account of guarantees has actually allowed you to reduce some of the risk-weighting of certain position as opposed to actually cutting certain position. Am I correct -</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're cheating because you're asking more than two questions, but I'll answer this one. Always more can be done, but mostly you see &#x2013; I think that we're working on some of the models, for instance, on some of the real estate models, which can be put in place, but not in advance model in some of our related portfolio, for instance. So, there could be further improvement to come. The quantum of improvement might be within what we've see in the first quarter, but maybe later in the year or early in 2012. So, it's still going to be a major impact per se, but more step-by-step improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back to the market side, I think most of the improvements on the market side is coming from our interest rate activities where we're on one side good client business, which improved the revenues and also a recovery of some of the portfolios, which are used for the client facilitation side. And so where we were impacted in the first quarter, mostly by the sovereign factor we have some hedges which were linked to some of the sovereign paper from the <mark type="ph" /> top five countries (38:37) and which &#x2013; we converted. There has been basically a short-term movement up in price for this asset, which had a very positive impact for the first quarter. So if we look at more normalized revenue for the market activities, clearly you should not base your expectation for the year, based off the result of the first quarter. But maybe something which is going to be between the first quarter and the fourth quarter and then you could have some kind of view of the normalized revenues pending any market shorts basically.</p>

          <p>And then &#x2013; sorry just to complete the reference point. We are also have some improvement in other area, for example, in Italy the improvement of the PD is impacting 3 basis point. Then the fine-tuning of the models explained as well some positive impact in Austria, for example, on the FX mortgage we have 5 or 6 basis point coming back. So there is again a business approach and there is a fine-tuning of the model. So we're working a lot in internal understanding what is the impact coming from the conversion to Basel II to Basel III, in order to limit impact as much as we can.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I have still two questions on capital and then one of funding. On capital, so basically the organic capital generation was about 40 basis points this quarter. Clearly there was a strong trading, there was a big drop in risk-weighted assets volume, it cannot be repeated every quarter, but what do you think can be a sustainable level of capital generation? And particularly, what do you think risk-weighted asset for the Group can be at the end of the year? And that's just still on this on capital. With the 20, 30 basis point of capital generation, you think you're going to be around 10% Basel II Core Tier 1 end of the year, do you feel that is a level that could use some of the pressure from regulators and from the market, from the fixed income market to increase core capital? And just very briefly on funding, deposit down in Italy both in the retail division and the corporate, just wondering what's the reason behind that is, just you're staying away from increasing competition or there is something else? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on the capital side, and capital generation and risk-weighted assets, et cetera. Let me say, we don't give numbers in the sense that we know, and as you know already that in the &#x2013; from moving from Basel II to Basel 2.5 and then Basel III and Basel CRD III, we have an increase of risk-weighted assets. They have been already discounting in our numbers in markets and credit risk. Now what we are doing is to try to limit as much as we can this increase. On top, as we said we have actions also on the business side trying to address the risk-weighted asset to optimize our balance sheet. Overall, I think that considering the expected profitability and considering number of actions in place ongoing, we can expect some positive effect on the Core Tier 1 clearly not with the speed we have seen in the first quarter. Then there was a question about funding, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as funding in Italy, we experienced two different trends on the two sub-segments. On one side we have as you know, one sub-segment that is more price sensitive and does mainly focus on repos and sometimes also to term deposits. In this area, we have lost market share in the last quarter as a result of a approach of being very cool in terms of pricing. So on the most price sensitive, we've seen a little bit of deposit outflows. On the opposite side on core deposits, the side deposits the one where price is less relevant, we actually experienced a improvement in market share over the quarter. Quarter was also instead being quite positive in terms of increasing the overall retail bond placement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a clarification, I understand that you're not willing to provide the guidance from the evolution of the stats on core, but just assuming you will be at this level of 10% Basel II that seems a realistic number, given the result. Do you have that feeling but that would ease pressure from regulators and from the market to do something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that, first of all the better we go up &#x2013; the more we go up the less pressure will &#x2013; is clear. I think the market is as well now waiting for information from regulators at the end of the day. So both things goes together. And it will be very important the decision about C fees. From regulators I think that with the level we have today there is not a specific pressure, because as you know we were already one quarter ago over 7% Basel III, 1st of January 2013, we further improve this quarter. I think it will be important to see what will be the scenario in few months starting from now. Our strategy is very simple is to keep working internally now to try to keep improving our capital through organic generation and then when the scenario will be more clear we will take our final decision.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Mr. Ghizzoni, good morning, everyone. Two quick questions, the first one is on the retail Italy division where the fee income increased 7% year-on-year. I am just wondering whether this trend is sustainable in your view and whether there were any exceptionals? The second question is on the asset quality and cost of risk. We've seen an improvement in the CEE. And specifically in Ukraine, we have had a low loss charge of 370 basis points in the first quarter and that's against an average of 600 basis points in 2010. I am just wondering how sustainable is this decrease in the cost of credit in Ukraine? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the fee income in Italy, fee income in the first quarter has been up, due to a few drivers. One has been the increase in the overall mortgage and consumer finance activity that has produced an improvement within the CPI bancassurance fees. Another important one has been the placement of owned bonds. In this case, what you have is a positive, for the Group is neutral on a consolidated level in the sense of what you see is a plus in the retail &#x2013; I mean the <mark type="ph" /> semi (47:13) division and the minus in the corporate center. Third important aspect has been a good increase in some asset management product, especially the pack, the recurring monthly payment mutual fund that also experienced quite a positive growth. Moving forward, we expect typically a good second and fourth quarter of the year, while we will expect in the third quarter a usual seasonality that decreases the overall retail commission level.</p>
          <p>As far as Ukraine is concerned, in terms of cost of risk we experienced, as you know, some volatility. In reality the cost of risk of this quarter was significantly better. I mean, one experience in the first quarter of the year was significantly worse than what we experienced in the fourth quarter of the year. But the situation overall &#x2013; because there has been some one-offs, but the situation overall is &#x2013; and there are steady improvement. About Ukraine like I don't remember exactly numbers, but we have seen also a different accounting rules applied with a shift from net interest to loss &#x2013; to provisions. So, has to be normalized. Maybe we will provide to you the more precise number later on. In any case in general on CEE, I think that the positive trend is sustainable. Overall, countries are, economies are improving and also what has been traditionally considered the most critical area like Ukraine and Kazakhstan, even though the situation is still, let's say fragile, clearly we see signal of improvement in the macro situation and also on our results. They are telling me that the shift in Ukraine is &#x20AC;47 million this is what has impacted instead of -</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions. The first one is again on RWA, any particular, the overall positive impact that you experienced in the first quarter, is something that was already included in the mitigation effect that you were showing when moving to Basel III or is something on top? And then as far as you provide some numbers in terms of improvement, I mean 3 bps for an improved PD in Italy, can you share also some similar numbers for Germany and Austria, because my question is, is also a better credit assessment thanks to the improving situation in those countries?</p>
          <p>Second question is relating to net interest income. You mentioned that the overall result in the first quarter was somehow weak due to lower trading related interest. So, my question is, can you please give us an idea of how much this item is accounting on the quarter and what will you expect going forward in the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, regarding the first question on risk-weighted asset, we had 27, I think, basis point or mitigation action that we presented in three months ago, they're working from Basel II to Basel III, what has been done this quarter is on top of them. So, they were not included. Then, coming to Austria and Germany can ask an opinion also from Karl, in any case Germany in term of credit shows clear improvement, if I remember correctly, in term of impaired loans. For example, there is a decrease of 5.2% quarter-on-quarter. Austria is a very stable situation as we said before; we had a benefit of 6 basis point on the fine-tuning of the model on the FX mortgages. Maybe we'll ask Karl to comment a bit more. Regarding the last point, the numbers, Marina, you have the net interest income. Marina will give you the precise number.</p>

          <p>On NIIs, as already pointed out, there is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:31) &#x2013; Federico mentioned &#x20AC;90 million related today's the results of a negative contribution resulting from trading. The swing quarter-from-quarter is &#x20AC;30 million due to delta from fourth quarter into the first quarter. So this is contribution and the level is you see on the page of the presentation the amount. And let's say, if you are asking for what is the amount towards &#x20AC;146 million down to the &#x20AC;110 million which clearly is a swing of &#x20AC;30 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe Karl can comment a bit about -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you're seeing in general is actually an improvement across the board notwithstanding the comment that was made earlier about the increase that you do see in the impaired loan. What you do see across the board is the PD is getting better. The PDs are getting better simply because on the advance model as the economy improves, it's an inevitability. So this is the first thing. The second thing that is important in trend wise is that, when you look into the impaired categories for &#x2013; the four specific categories that Bank of Italy requires us to do. The most important indicator is when you start paying attention to the past-due category. So if you look at the past-due category in effect that's being going down, so that &#x2013; because that's the beginning of the chain. And in terms of &#x2013; because by the time it ends up <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:07) there is a fairly long, sort of, journey that goes through it.</p>
          <p>So hopefully at this point, there are two things that are important, what's the reverse migration from non-performing to performing and those numbers were given by Federico earlier, and they are very robust. The second thing that was not given, but you should see, is in terms of past due, which is the first category there is a decline of roughly 3.8% for the Group. For Italy, it's been about 2.8%, for Germany that's roughly 73%, and this has had a follow on effect also &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; for Austria it's more or less flat, for Poland is down 11 point &#x2013; Austria is flat from a very low level. This is I think the point that you need to make in &#x2013; bear in mind. In Poland, this number is down by 11%, for CEE overall is 26%. So if you're looking at the future in terms of trend, these are the two most important things that play into the asset quality and, ultimately, the RWA calculations that you're looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is &#x2013; like you say that there is an overall improvement across the board rather than specifically a single country like Germany, for instance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Germany is more pronounced simply because in Germany the nature of the portfolio is very large single names. So when they tend to move one way or another they have a disproportionate influence, positive or negative. So in this case, it stands out by a very large amount in percentage terms, but in the original comment of is there a sustained improvement across the board, the answer is yes.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. Good morning, everybody. The first question is on the outlook for NII for the rest of the year. Am I right in assuming that starting from Q2 the NII should go up significantly given that the five years CDS, I think the average this quarter is 40 basis point lower and Euribor is 36 higher in the traditional base this quarter? The other question is still on overall provisions. How comfortable are you currently with your overall coverage ratio? I feel that the data on page 15 that you have given, so basically almost not impaired, no addition in basis points this quarter is quite extraordinary. So unless you want to increase your coverage significantly over next few quarters, we have to see the provision number going down. Am I right in thinking along these lines? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On NII, we had the same assumptions. We hope that the improvements we are experiencing these days in Euribor will help during the next quarter during the year. For sure there is another element, which has to be taken into account. We have already put in place a big portion of our funding plan and 58% already done. So going forward, let's say the funding plan &#x2013; the completion on the funding plan will affect that our NII. And so we will not see additional cost coming from the long-term activities. Well, on provision -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe also on the commercial side, let's say, we'll be &#x2013; as we spoke already about Italy, so Italy hopefully shows, continue this gradual recovery, and also on the Central Eastern Europe side we have to keep in mind that the first quarter is all the time lower than the fourth quarter. The budget in CEE is built up on a progressive increase quarter-after-quarter and CEE is over budget in this moment. So we may expect <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:14) some contribution. On the provision again, I'll ask for a more wider comment, Karl. I think that, I can anticipate with help from Karl the coverage ratio is for us, okay, at this stage. But I ask &#x2013; I think Karl can elaborate more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Federico. I think the coverage ratio in itself &#x2013; I think when you look at it I think it's a rarely &#x2013; it's a reasonably realistic level. I would not necessarily extrapolate as you did into loan-loss provisions over the next quarters. What is clear, I think there are two messages that I would really like to leave on the plate; first, there is a definitive and sustained improvement in the portfolio and I think you will see that in the coming period. In terms of extrapolating one quarter to another is not particularly wise simply because that's not how credit flows. There is always a lag effect. But I think as a general trend and also the number that you saw on page 15 are indicative in itself of the numbers, but I would not do the regression analysis the way you're doing it, because that's tempting fate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The PD obviously clearly has an impact, influences the expected loss and as you know the expected loss in terms of has an impact, in terms of <mark type="ph" /> what's (59:46) close to the provision.

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fantastic. So on Basel III, first, could you give us an update on the Basel III guidance? And just one thing to confirm the goodwill deductibility which helped your Basel II capital ratios this quarter, was that already captured in the previous Basel III guidance? The second question, when you do changes to your risk-weighted asset models and assumptions, are they signed-off by the regulator or is that a sort of review process that confirms those results? And thirdly, is there any update you can give us on potential disposals in CEE or elsewhere? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Specifically about goodwill this was not included in our assumption &#x2013; this in the quarter was not included in our assumption. Then you ask Basel III work, if I'm not mistaken, let's say that, today we start from 9.06%, we have calculated &#x2013; we have given to you in the past some guidance substantially 130 basis point was supposed to be the impact moving from Basel II to Basel III and 27 basis point was supposed to be the mitigation actions, then the phase-in impact for 055 basis point. So substantially, if we go today from Basel &#x2013; from 9.06% to Basel III January 13, including all circumstances, internal retained earnings, and without phase-in, we will end up to 8.62%, with phase-in to 9.13%.</p>

I keep saying that we are looking for the optimization of our portfolio, in term of return on asset. So in this view we may also consider some disposal, but there is no list of countries to be given to you or to the market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the model, I'm assuming that you mean the mathematical type. Under the advanced methodology that we apply as you know that we have internal models, there is a fairly rigorous validation process. First, within the Group itself, there is complete segregation between the people proposing the model, and people validating the model. There is further work done by audit &#x2013; internal audit independently on the validation work. And finally this is also checked by Bank of Italy and other regulators in terms of the process. So both in terms of the rigor and the &#x2013; the rigor that we follow in this process is and the checks and balances in the process is very, very robust. So, if the underlying concern a question is that we are somehow understating it, I think you have to ask my colleagues, because they worry that I may be overstating it. So there is absolutely no concerns and issues. Where we have standardized, which is in some countries in Central Eastern Europe, it is defined by law anyway it's not model based so.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I have two question, the first one for Mr. Guha. He has always been very prudent in terms of provisions, but if we look at slide 15 and slide 16, and what you just said about the definitive improvement in the portfolio, can we assume if the situation will continue that towards the end of the year, the loan losses provisions for the company &#x2013; for the Group as a whole will be probably lower than what he was expecting? The second question is on risk-weighted assets in capital generation has been pretty impressive quarter. But if we remove the impact on the risk-weighted assets, do you think that we will be going towards something like 20 bps of capital generation per quarter going forward or we should assume that there will be more mitigating actions that will be out from the original program that you just indicated in terms of the Basel III impact? And therefore we should get a little bit more on what we have seen in quarter one. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question in terms of my being prudent. Well, I think you said the operative word. Prudence would prevent me from committing to what you are asking me to commit to. The long and short of it is, I think, there is sustained improvement. I think you will see materially better numbers than last year. To what extent and degree, I think is &#x2013; would be tempting fate and go against what you accuse me of being prudent. So, I will be prudent and say it will be in line with what we have already told you. And my colleagues are smiling by the way at this -</p>

          <p>Regarding organic capital generation, well, you said apart from risk-weighted asset is 20 basis points per quarter is feasible and sustainable. Again we don't give numbers, but target is obviously to keep &#x2013; try to improve the ratios quarter-after-quarter. So it will depend on the profitability and it will depend on a number of other actions including the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:07:31) cost of risk. So let's say, we are looking positively to the end of the year, but I prefer to not give or take commitment internal numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. My question relates to a comment that apparently you made in the press conference yesterday afternoon with journalists, which was these 1Q results are sustainable for the rest of the year. What you exactly mean for that? Are you talking about the net profit? What are you talking about? And the second question relates to the net interest income. You started flat year-on-year for this quarter and down Q-on-Q, but recently, I mean, in the last conference call commenting on a question, do you feel confident of the net interest income going up in the range of 5% this year, I mean, 2011, you are say will be something similar to that. Actually what is your comment now given the rise of short-term rates on the one side and the rising cost of funding on the other side and the Q1 in fact flat, what is your comment for today in terms of guidance for net interest income? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding first of all, if results are sustainable or not, I think that there is a consensus, if I'm not mistaken, for a result of &#x20AC;2.8 billion, &#x20AC;2.9 billion year end. Let's say that, I'm confident we can definitely meet the consensus, in this respect the results are sustainable. I don't think the quarter is just a one-off. We have volatility for sure on the market side as already explained by Jean Pierre Mustier. I think it's sustainable the expected growth in commercial bank, and so mostly NII and fees and commission is sustainable on the cost side. And we discussed already, we expect the positive trend in term of cost of risk will continue. So I'm confident that the Group starts to be &#x2013; I don't want to be over optimistic, but the Group starts to be in recovery &#x2013; in a recovery phase. Capital we have already discussed. NII, okay, I leave to Marina to explain better how cost of funding and the rest is explained.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see that the &#x2013; we don't see any significant changes versus the first quarter &#x2013; the comment we made last quarter. But this quarter you see a drop in the NII, but as explained that is mainly driven by some one-offs recorded in the fourth quarter and the 86 days less we have in the first quarter. Plus, I will leave that to Jean Pierre to comment more in detail, but also the markets and the F&amp;A business has contributed with a lower trading related interest. Overall, we don't experience, so on the short part, to be very honest we didn't face significant increase in costs. So the short-term fund has increased on average by 5 basis points, as it's in line with the average increase of Euribor rates in short-term maturity. This impact is neutral since also short-term assets are constantly re-pricing on the basis of these dynamics.</p>
          <p>On long-term, I'd already pointed out that we did a long-term so $18.7 billion has been raised at average side which is higher we have to say versus the one of 2010, 130 versus 104 we experienced in 2010. But I think that it is important to notice a couple of number, while in Italy the cost of funding described is higher. In Germany and Austria we manage to have issuances on average at 48 basis points versus 52, and I think that both the level and dynamics are impressive. So, it should &#x2013; its worth to mention and to underline. And also in Austria we are experiencing lower cost on funding during 2011. Whereas Italy is higher and is mainly due to the highest spread we pay our retail and private banking clientele in line with the wider government spreads. But again, we don't see specific deterioration against the market condition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the net interest margin for CIB side, there has been some non-recurring item, basically which impacted the net interest margin to the tune of &#x20AC;96 million quarter-on-quarter. And from the network side, we had an impact of almost &#x20AC;46 million, which were due to specific fine, which were restructured in Q4 and which on a non-recurring basis increased our net interest margin in Q4 and clearly this is non-recurrent. And on the market side, I mean the &#x2013; for classification issues our repos with financial institution are classified under the net interest margin and the repos can move in terms of market activity. And explain &#x20AC;51 million of lower trading related to net interest margin. So, basically the volatility of the net interest margin linked to this one-off event was quite high by the ways, I mean, as Marina mentioned, we have something which is much more stable.</p>

          <p>Good morning. I just have one question on the cost of deposits in Italy. I wonder if you've considered in your plans a possible increase in the cost of deposits following some aggressive commercial activity from some competitors. So if you can give us an update on this front if you're still convinced that there will be an increase, but manageable or if things are getting a bit worse than you expected? Thank you.</p>

          <p>We probably &#x2013; that is you have a reference point which is this being a situation &#x2013; a Spanish situation and you look at it as potential benchmark, but this is not the case. So, the situation in Italy will &#x2013; the costs are increasing, the competition is strong, but we don't see it becoming and transforming into a real cumbersome situation for our NII.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just follow-up on the Basel III new estimate. You have been mentioning 8.62% as the level that you can reach today under Basel III fully phased. So I just wanted to have a clarification on this point, this basically means that your previous guidance was 130 bps negative now it becomes 44. So that means that the mitigation actions that originally were 27 bps as you mentioned, now should be something like 150 bps. So, if you can clarify this &#x2013; if this matter is correct or not. The other questions that I have is on asset quality, in Q4 you gave us a very interesting slide on the asset quality by region with the gross ratio and coverage in Italy also Germany and CEE and Poland, I don't know if you can give us &#x2013; maybe share some information about this.</p>
          <p>And also if I look at your cost of credit, it seems me that the strongest improvement, the strongest delta is in Eastern Europe considering also the fact in Q4 the cost of credit in some country was zero, in Ukraine you didn't have any losses. So there is a material improvement there and I wonder, how much of this is related to fundamentals and how much of this is related to the fact that now you're adopting the Bank of Italy methodology to classify impaired loans in Eastern Europe? Because, it seems to me that you've been increasing the impaired loans, but then on the other hand, the composition is different because NPLs are lower and you've higher substandard which require less coverage. On this basis, I would be interested to know what you expect to be the cost of credit that you will be used in Eastern Europe over the next few quarters. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About Basel III, I'll now, will ask Marina to give you once again the numbers. But no, it has not directly down to <mark type="ph" /> zero, 44 (1:18:24). The assumption is to say the starting point that is different. And Marina can elaborate more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We were not commenting and we're not adjusting the figures so we provide to you on page 26 of the previous quarter result. So the only starting point is new is 9.06% and all this element you see on the previous presentation are kept equal also because as already pointed out the filter on good deductibility is already in the result of the first quarter. So the point made by Federico is that, we don't have the improvement which are resulting in the first quarter on the risk weighted assets as not ready, so we might have further and additional mitigation action which have already displayed during the first quarter in a good &#x2013; in a significant way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if I understand correctly, sorry &#x2013; this 8.62% is not the level as of today, but is the level that you expect to achieve in January 2013, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Without &#x2013; so with &#x2013; this is including only 27 or 29 &#x2013; actually 25, sorry, of mitigation action. So when &#x2013; if you remember we go back a couple of quarter, when we gave this number for the first time, we said we want to stay very prudent and to indicate that the mitigation action only worked at that point was known. No we know that we can do better clearly, but in term of guidance, still we stay with the same numbers we have given in September and December is only the starting point 9.06% versus 8.58% that is changing. So, consequently if you want to be positive, we may have enough sight.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was going to say that if I'm prudent, you must be really a skeptic. If I look at the coverage ratios, I think I would &#x2013; these numbers are actually quite solid and good. Let me go through the numbers with you. If you look at the coverage ratio for the Group overall, there has been a 79 basis point improvement in the coverage. If I look at Italy, its roughly 12 basis points, if I look at Germany, it's roughly 389 basis points, if I look at Austria, which is already at a high level in terms of coverage, its 3 basis points, Poland, again very high level, 14 basis points and CEE overall 178 basis points. So the &#x2013; I would not extrapolate that the Bank of Italy classification is leading to either lower coverage or alternatively different classification of NPL. This is not the right conclusion as these number bear out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally about CEE, yes, we had the change of methodology coming from Bank of Italy. But if we look the portfolio in itself, the portfolio is giving encouraging signal of improvement. That comes from &#x2013; at the end from the fundamentals on these economies, meaning except still some countries like Romania, like Ukraine, partially Bulgaria that are still suffering the downturn of their economies. The other one, overall are giving important signal of recovery and this clearly will affect also our portfolio. Then let me say also that in the past starting since 2000 &#x2013; May 2008 has been done very deep activity in the region in order to address recovery restructuring work out, putting in place a good machine, a lot has been done and some benefit, I hope and I'm sure we can bet now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I've got two questions on provisions and revenue growth. Starting from provisions, we heard a lot of comments on the significant improvements across the board and including Italy. Nevertheless, Italy keeps on running at twice the level of provisions of peers quarter-after-quarter, which implies a heavy clean up is ongoing and it's been going on for almost two years, now. Can you articulate a bit more why this is and when you expect to realign provisioning levels in Italy to peers? And where do you intend to progressively bring coverage ratios? The second question is on revenues and revenue growth, if we exclude for trading in the quarter regardless of seasonality the reason that much quarter-on-quarter growth, you are one of the best positioned banks by geographic mix in my view and you have got positive sensitivity to rising rates and can use German funding to partly mitigate it against some of the risks. So, when do you expect the Group to start posting strong top line growth and how much do you have in mind? Also how much can you reduce interbank funding if rates increase and are you still without a hedge on deposits? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on provision you're right. Our level is still higher than peers. We know &#x2013; and we have explained to everybody that this is a point of attention for us. Clearly, the ambition is to reduce this number to a level that is in line with peers. Keep in mind that through the cycle, remember correctly and Karl can elaborate more, we expect to grow through the cycle to a cost of risk on average in the Group of 75 basis points. And clearly considering Italy rates in this respect you can understand that Italy will go down significantly. In respect to reach this level the end of 2013, beginning '14, so still a long way to go back but what is today is still a problem, it can become also an upside looking forward. Coverage in Italy, once again, we're not at the lower level but opposite. We're in the upper level. And obviously, we can give you many better numbers. So because we have to look not only <mark type="ph" /> NPLs (1:26:24), but we have to look also doubtful and is clear that on doubtful, we have a coverage which is higher than many peers, and doubtful &#x2013; the amount of doubtful is by definition much larger than the level of NPLs in terms of volumes. So that total coverage is better for us than other peers.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, NII in particular, again we are quite confident as we've already explained that the trend will continue positively. Here we have also to look a bit, what is happening country-by-country, region-by-region. For example Germany is a country that is performing extremely well, too well, if you can say something like this meaning that in term of credit demand for example is still very low, because in customer corporates are very cash rich. So for Germany we will be mostly working on transaction as banking investment effects, other effects, et cetera, et cetera. Rather than increasing of volumes in the long side at least for a while and sooner or later corporates, will go back to investment then the cycle will continue. Italy we discuss and also foresee once again the expectation is for increasing better quarters versus the first that is traditionally very low. It's very low also because we have for example a number of countries especially in January, like Russia that are closed for two, three weeks due to the combination of Christmas and Orthodox &#x2013; and Orthodox holidays. So we're expecting again a positive trend of the quarter to come.</p>
