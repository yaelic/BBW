          <p>Thank you, Michelle . Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO Dave Cote, and Senior Vice President and CFO Dave Anderson. This call and webcast including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-lookings that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light. This morning, we will review our financial results for the second quarter as well as our expectations for the second half and third quarter of 2010 and of course, allow time for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Dave Cote.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. We have a great start to 2010 with better than expected improvement in many of our end markets with revenues ahead of expectations and good execution across our businesses. Sales were 8.2 billion, up 8% and that's reported and organic with continued growth in new products, geographic expansion and overall improving conditions.</p>
          <p>We generated earnings per share of $0.60. On an operating basis that is excluding pension, our earnings were up 24% in the quarter. Our segment margin rate was 13.6%, up 130 basis points from prior year reflecting margin expansion in three out of our four businesses. This really reinforces the quality of our earnings performance and continued cost discipline while maintaining our growth investments for the future. Further reflecting that earnings quality, we generated just under $1 billion of free cash flow, representing over 200% free cash flow conversion. Given the strength of our first-half financial performance and improving end market condition, we are raising our full year guidance.</p>
          <p>We now expect sales in the range of 32.4 to 32.9 and earnings in the range of 2.40 to 2.50 a share. We're also raising our free cash flow estimate to 3.1 to 3.3 billion for the year up from 2.8 to 3.1. We believe the recovery is happening. However, given ongoing economic uncertainties, we remain cautious about the future. Our early cycle businesses are seeing the biggest improvement year over year, such as Turbo, Sensors and Controls, Scanning and Mobility, Field Instruments, Gas Detection and Safety Products.</p>
          <p>Further, we're benefiting in the marketplace from the steps we took in each of our businesses to ensure that we and our suppliers were prepared for the recovery, especially around things like electronic components and we are seeing better growth because of it. What's also impressive are the orders' growth rates in the longer cycle businesses, which we think of as ACS solutions, UOP, Commercial Aero, OE with book-to-build rates above one. We saw strong double-digit increases across the group with backlog for the company growing approximately 15% year over year. The growth we are seeing in our end markets is being complemented by the results of our seed planting initiatives. We're excited about the acquisition we announced in the quarter, Sperian Protection, a leader in personal protection equipment. We think the combination of Sperian with our Safety Products business and Life Safety will generate significant synergies including expanded access to global manufacturing and distribution channels and a strong retail presence.</p>
          <p>The combination will offer a full range of complementary head-to-toe products for those who work in environments where safety is paramount. Including the general industrial, construction, fire service and electrical safety industries. Dave will provide more details on the transaction and timing in a couple minutes. Our investments and focus in emerging regions are also paying off. Sales in Asia Pacific are up strongly, about 17%, reflecting good growth in China and transportation ACS and also growth in Japan, India and Korea. We continue to build on our platforms for growth as evidenced by the number of wins in Aerospace and Process Solutions in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Honeywell was awarded additional systems on the C919, the single aisle commercial airliner in China. In addition to the APU announced previously, COMAC selected Honeywell to provide our wheels and brakes and flight controls, bringing our total wins with COMAC to more than $11 billion over the life of the programs, and there's still more to be decided. In addition, Process Solutions was selected by PetroChina to provide the control and safety systems for the world's longest gas pipeline and to be the integrated main automation contractor with Abu Dhabi Gas Development Company for its Shah gas development project to help the site operate safely, reliably and efficiently.</p>
          <p>The first phase of the project is valued at more than $80 million with a total potential of more than 200 million over subsequent phases. The Shah gas project is one of the largest and most complex projects in the industry and is expected to process one billion cubic feet of gas per day when the site reaches full production capacity in 2014. Overall, some very impressive wins in the quarter. Also, Honeywell Fluorine Products entered into a supply agreement with General Motors for a new refrigerant for use in automotive air conditioning systems, HFO-1234yf, don't you love the marketing names we assign to these things?</p>
          <p>In addition to its non ozone-depleting characteristics, 1234yf has 99.7% lower global warming potential than the current refrigerant, helping General Motors meet new environmental regulations in the United States and Europe. In addition, we continue to invest in our big Process initiatives as well as other seed planting across the organization. Our Velocity Product Development initiative helps to bring new products that customers want to market faster. This quarter, ACS introduced approximately 100 new products including the new Xenon Imager, which redefines the standard for hand-held scanners by delivering 1D laser performance with all the benefits of 2D imaging. It incorporates the best imaging technology from hand-held products and the decoder technology from Metrologic, delivering extended depth of field, faster reading and improved scanning performance on poor quality barcodes.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we reached a milestone in the implementation of the Honeywell operating system as Life Safety's Trieste, Italy and Turbo's Atessa, Italy sites became the first to earn Silver certifications. Both sites operate at 99% on time delivery, maintain terrific inventory, have great quality, and safety and productivity metrics. Across the company, we now have a total of 36 Bronze or higher sites and we expect further acceleration as the year progresses. So in summary, a strong first half, another better-than-expected quarter demonstrating Honeywell's ability to execute both commercially and operationally and invest in future growth. So with that, let me turn it over to Dave.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the Honeywell conference call. Let's go to Slide 4 and let me take you through the summary of the results for the quarter. As Dave mentioned, we're seeing signs of improvement. It's obvious in terms of the &#x2013; our reported financials and the better than anticipated performance in the quarter. Sales were up 8% to 8.2 billion reflecting good organic growth in a number of our businesses. As you can see, foreign exchange and M&amp;A had a minimal impact in the quarter. The company had strong operating leverage, growing segment profit by 19% and margins lifted 130 basis points to 13.6%.</p>
          <p>We saw further good margin performance from ACS, which was up 90 basis points in the quarter and another impressive quarter of year-over-year gains in both Transportation Systems and Specialty Materials, which were up 810 and 270 basis points respectively in the quarter. Net income rose 4%. EPS was flat on a reported basis but when you exclude pension expense from both '09 and '10, earnings were up an impressive 24% year over year. Now our earnings growth ex-pension is really driven by better than expected sales and terrific sales conversion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>To underscore that point, there are a couple of items worth pointing out. First, we had $24 million of net repositioning actions in the quarter. Mark, by the way, that brings repositioning year to date to $63 million. Second, we absorbed 13 million related to an asbestos insurance receivable settlement and higher year-over-year environmental expense in the quarter. Lastly, we had M&amp;A expenses in the quarter of approximately 10 million, or a penny of EPS. Therefore, if you were to adjust for these items, you have clearly a significant beat in the quarter, so the $0.60 is really a terrific number and a much stronger quarter than we anticipated, driven by better than expected operating performance.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was also very strong in the quarter. As Dave said, 975 million of cash. Looking at free cash flow conversion, if you strip out the impact of noncash pension expense, it's again a very high quality earnings story. It equates to 160% conversion of net income, reinforcing the core processes we have in place to convert sales to earnings and earnings to cash. And by the way, that brings year-to-date free cash flow to over $1.6 billion, well ahead of the record $1.2 billion that we produced in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>So with that backdrop, let's turn to Slide 5 to give you an update on what we're seeing and what we're expecting for the remainder of the year. Now given the pace of the strong second quarter performance, again on Slide 5, and the economic uncertainty that Dave referenced that obviously still lingers in both the U.S. and Europe, we thought it would be helpful to spend a few minutes updating you on both what we're seeing in our key end markets as well as providing the backdrop for how we're thinking about the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>First, Aerospace. The assumptions for 2010 remain largely intact. We're seeing some improvement in global flying hours. Global flying hours were up 5.5% in the second quarter. We're already seeing these higher utilization rates translate into an improvement in commercial spares activity. Commercial spares were up 10% in the quarter, up 9% sequentially. And importantly, we're now anticipating global flying hours to be somewhere in the range for the full year '10 relative to '09, up about 3.5 to 4.5%, that compares to 3 to 4% in our previous guidance. And importantly, we now expect growth in commercial aftermarket to outpace flying hours in the fourth quarter. I'll talk a little bit more about that later when I cover Aerospace.</p>
          <p>While large air transport deliveries are expected to be down in '10, we're expecting delivery increases in '11 and '12 with the recently announced production rate increases from the major OEMs and as always, there will be some mix between platforms, but we're encouraged in particular on the production rate increases for the 737, the A320 and the 747 and obviously, their flow-through and impact on future Honeywell sales.</p>
          <p>We're highly encouraged by the early cycle nature of the portfolio and the recovery we're seeing in industrial businesses within ACS and Specialty Materials. We saw above market organic growth in Sensing and Control, Scanning and Mobility, Industrial Combustion, Field Instrumentation, Gas Detection, Thermostats and Combustion Controls, Safety Products, Specialty Products and Electronic Materials. We believe all of those are largely attributable to our great position to good industries, to great commercial execution that we're demonstrating; but obviously, we're also benefiting in the marketplace from the steps that we've taken in each of our businesses to ensure that Honeywell and our suppliers were prepared for recovery. You are going to recall, this was a major theme that Dave spoke to at our February Investor Day. Clearly, it was a good call on his part, and it's paying off for us in terms of our preparedness and our readiness.</p>
          <p>Now focusing on Turbo. The first half macro environment was great. We saw better-than-expected European light vehicle production, up dramatically in the first half from a very low base. European diesel penetration improved also, three points in the first half over 2009 levels. Now it's important to point out that the industry's expecting a 9% decline in European light vehicle production in the second half of '10, down 12% sequentially and compared to growth of 18% in the first half. But Turbo, Honeywell Turbo will continue to benefit from a significant number of new platform launches, which this year, you will recall, totals over 100. So despite industry headwind in the second half, we'll continue to grow our Turbo business for the remainder of '10. Now we're also experiencing significant growth in emerging regions which have been less impacted obviously by the credit market issues and turmoil in some of those related markets.</p>
          <p>While the second quarter saw some downward pressure on China's GDP figures, we'll still see strong double-digit growth out of these markets. UOP of course is benefiting from solid demand for their products and technologies across refining, petrochemical and natural gas markets and while U.S. capacity rationalization is in process in the refining industry, we see continued new investments in emerging regions. Therefore, we're seeing a higher mix of project-related process technology and equipment sales versus new catalyst units or reloads, but global energy demand continues to rise. With the most rapid growth expected to occur in emerging regions, we've won a lot of new projects in both UOP and Process Solutions and we're at the forefront of new infrastructure and capacity additions in both refining and natural gas.</p>
          <p>While we saw good growth in Europe in the first half and by the way, the second quarter was up in Europe, 9% organically, that's an impressive number. We expect growth in this region to obviously to moderate. We also expect to see further headwinds on foreign exchange given our exposure for both the euro and the pound, and to give you some perspective, the low end of our second half guidance and we'll take you through some details of the buildup of that guidance in a moment, assumes a euro rate of 1.20 versus the prior year actuals of approximately 1.46. So we've got some FX headwind in the second half that's about $0.09 in terms of earnings per share on a year-over-year basis that's built into our guidance.</p>
          <p>In addition, there's been a lot of talk about austerity measures or the need for them in the U.S. and across the world. We're assuming governments are going to be increasingly mindful of these deficits and stimulus spending will subside accordingly. So in summary, we believe we're taking a balanced stance, as Dave said, on planning, weighing the economic uncertainties in our forward planning, but we're obviously also seeing improvement in most of our end markets. However, we're remaining cautious on the timing and the continued pace of the recovery. So we'll continue to be very disciplined in our cost controls and exceedingly careful about adding to infrastructure, which is expected to provide us with continued strong volume leverage in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Something not on the slide and I just want to reference quickly as we transition here, our outlook on the timing of the funding of the NARCO Trust has changed. You will recall that we originally anticipated funding to occur sometime in '10. However, the timing of the Trust formation is dependent upon the resolution of bankruptcy proceedings, including the proceedings of a NARCO affiliate. We now believe as a result of certain actions there that this will not be a 2010 event. Therefore, that's also contributing to our pre-cash flow guidance improvement for the year. We're raising that to 3.1 to 3.3 billion reflecting both a higher earnings outlook as well as the positive impact deferring the cash funding requirements for the NARCO Trust beyond 2010.</p>
          <p>With that, let's turn to the businesses, go through each of those in turn. Starting with Aerospace on slide number 6. Aerospace sales, as you can see, were down in the quarter 3%. However, that reflects improvement in the rate of the change from the first quarter which was down 9% and sales of 2.6 billion reflect the high end of our second quarter guidance range that we set back in April. The segment profit for Aero was down 2% with margins held flat on lower sales.</p>
          <p>We executed well on cost reductions, pricing initiatives, benefits from prior period repositioning actions which were more than offset by the absence of the benefit of a number of labor cost actions that we took last year which were not repeated again this year. So excluding the impact of payments to business also excluding the impacts to business and general aviation manufacturers to offset pre-production costs, Aero sales would have been approximately flat in the quarter, segment margins would have been up approximately 100 basis points. You recall those launch contributions have been made as a result of the significant platform wins that we had in both '08 and '09.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk a little bit about total commercial Aerospace sales. That is the sum of ATR and BGA. Those were down 4% in the quarter. Commercial OE were down 8% year on year driven by declines in BGA OE deliveries as expected and the OEM payments that I referenced. However, we're now seeing sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2010 and into the second quarter of 2010. Air Transport and Regional 0E sales were up 8% on higher avionics upgrades and in line with the delivery schedules at both Airbus and Boeing.</p>
          <p>We anticipate a decline in sales for ATR OE in the second half, consistent with what we forecast in the beginning of the year. You'll recall the guidance that we gave you at the beginning of the year was for ATR OE to be down 10% for 2010. We're forecasting year-over-year increases in BGA OE up about 30%, which, of course, will help offset those ATR OE declines. So Commercial OE in the second half is expected to be roughly flat on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>Looking at the aftermarket. Commercial aftermarket sales were approximately flat in the quarter. However, up sequentially. Commercial spares as I referenced earlier which are tracking closely which were up 10% year over year, reflecting improvement in both large airlines as well as business jet operators. Air Transport and Regional aftermarket sales were down 4% with an improvement in spares, more than offset by continued deferral of maintenance events by major airlines.</p>
          <p>Now while the impact of airline de-stocking has subsided, high levels of parked aircraft remain a drag on repair and maintenance activity. We're also seeing airlines drive profitability by increasing load factors as flight hours increase rather than adding capacity. So we expect the older parked aircraft, which need more repair and overhaul to be slower to return to service.</p>
          <p>On the BGA side, the BGA aftermarket also benefited from an uptick in spares activity with sales up 8% year over year, also reflecting good sequential improvement in TFE engine hours continue to improve. Finally, as I mentioned earlier with improved utilization rates, we expect commercial aftermarket growth in the fourth quarter to outpace flying hours.</p>
          <p>A few words on Defense and Space. Defense and Space sales were down 1% in the quarter. Reflecting the expected ramp down in the TIGER tank program and lower increment international sales partially offset by growth in government services which provide logistic support to military bases throughout the world and also an uptick in advanced Navy navigation system sales.</p>
          <p>So in summary for Aero, we're seeing signs of sequential growth in our Commercial aftermarket business, improving market conditions in business jets, and steady performance out of Defense and Space. Despite the continued challenging environment in '10, the Aerospace team is executing very well across all of the businesses, winning new attractive businesses including the multiple wins valued at over $11 billion over the life of the programs on the COMAC C919 aircraft mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>So now let's turn to Slide 7, a couple points on ACS for the quarter. Automation and Control Solutions. Slide 7, as Dave mentioned, we're seeing continued growth in our short cycle businesses as well as pockets of growth in the long cycle businesses and backlog. Sales for ACS were up 7% in the quarter, importantly all organic, with the biggest increase in the Products businesses. Segment margins were, again, a good story, up an impressive 90 basis points to 12.4%. The favorability in Products performance as well as commercial excellence really contributed to the margin lift, in addition to the continued cost controls and the benefits from prior period repositionings.</p>
          <p>Now, again, with all of our businesses, we had headwinds in the quarter due to the large labor cost actions we took last year that were not repeated in this year given the recovery that we're experiencing. The Products businesses were up 9% in the quarter, we believe outpacing growth in their respective markets. We saw the impact of obviously the continued industrial recovery with businesses linked to industrial production seeing both orders and sales growth, supported by increases in manufacturing production and the favorable impact of increased safety regulations.</p>
          <p>China and India led growth in Asia-Pac up 20% and 30%, respectively, organically. And while external indicators continue to show softness in commercial construction end markets, we're actually seeing that that sector held up well. Moderate growth in commercial construction end markets, driven primarily by the uptake of several new products and customer expansion in ECC's Commercial Control Systems. On the other hand, residential continues to be a soft spot in the developed regions, impacting both Security as well as ECC.</p>
          <p>Now the Solutions businesses were up 6% in the quarter, driven by strong demand in Building Solutions, Energy Efficiency, and Demand Response or Smart Grid. While Process Solutions sales were down on an organic basis, orders were up an impressive 22%, reflecting the second subsequent quarter of double digits orders growth for HPS. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we had two impressive global energy wins in the quarter, Shah Gas and the PetroChina west-to-east pipeline solidifying our leadership position in the attractive and growing natural gas segment. Backlog in both Solutions businesses is up strong double digits over the prior year. Now the ACS segment profit up 16% on the 7% sales growth reflecting strong operating leverage and delivering 90 basis points of improvement. Another great effort by the ACS team that continues to execute on commercial excellence initiatives including a robust new product pipeline, international expansion as well as attractive acquisitions.</p>
          <p>So with that review of ACS, let's now go to Slide 8, spend just a quick minute on the Sperian acquisition and an update for you on that. As you know, during the second quarter we announced our intent to acquire Sperian Protection, a leader in the highly attractive personal protection equipment space. Sperian will be combined with ACS' Safety Products business, a business we acquired through the Norcross acquisition in '08 to create an approximately $2 billion global franchise with complementary head-to-toe products.</p>
          <p>Sperian has a strong European presence. They have leading positions in fall and head protection Honeywell, of course, is very strong in North America, with products spanning protective footwear and clothing, including fire turnout gear, rubber boots and gloves. With the robust integration process that you know characterizes our acquisition capability and our proven track record, we're excited about the growth in emerging opportunities with increased adoption of workplace safety regulations.</p>
          <p>In terms of timing, things are progressing towards what we expect to be a mid-September closing on the transaction. It's received U.S. Federal Trade Commission approval. It still needs EU anti-trust clearance, but we expect to receive that, we don't see any issues there and as you'll recall, the Sperian board of directors unanimously recommended the Honeywell offer. We anticipate the transaction to be dilutive to our second half by approximately $0.04 per share. Most likely most of that all in the third quarter and importantly, it will be &#x2013; the transaction will be accretive in 2011.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the next business, Transportation Systems on Slide 9. TS sales were up an impressive 30%, segment margins increased a full 810 basis points to 11.3%. The negative impact of foreign currency was more than offset by higher volume. Now Turbo was up 41% in the second quarter, reflecting favorable macro trends with another strong quarter of European light vehicle production and improved diesel penetration and the benefit of Turbo's robust new platform launches. As discussed earlier, the industry is expected to slow down in terms of light vehicle, European light vehicle production sequentially, reflecting the typical summer shutdown and also the fact that production rates in Europe will be more in line with forecast sales.</p>
          <p>However, we expect Turbo volumes to continue to benefit from their industry position and the market share wins that they experienced. CPG sales were up 2% with improvements in sales across most of our retail brands and the pass-through impact of higher ethylene glycol pricing, all of which contributed to another quarter of double-digit margins in CPG. TS segment profit was up $90 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher volumes, productivity, benefits from prior period repositioning actions. Again partially offset by the benefit of labor cost actions that we took last year. This quarter's performance reflects a margin rate that we haven't seen, the 11.3, since the second quarter of 2008, before the economic downturn. So it's indicative of the very impressive conversion rates in Transportation Systems.</p>
          <p>Now on slide number 10, Specialty Materials. We're also seeing general end market recovery. As you can see on Slide 10, SM executed another strong quarter. Sales were up 20%. Segment profit was up 43%. Margins were 17% in the quarter for SM. I mean, who would have thought that as little as two years back that we would be receiving that kind of performance. Sales at UOP were up 6%, driven by a large petrochemical catalyst reload, partially offset by lower licensing revenues in the project's businesses. Overall, UOP is seeing their markets stabilize and they're seeing a growing pipeline of global energy products. In the second half, we're expecting projects growth to outpace catalyst sales creating some unfavorable mix and some pressure on margins.</p>
          <p>However, as always, there is going to be variability from quarter to quarter in catalyst shipments and the mix of licensing revenue at UOP. Resins and Chemical sales were up 27% in the second quarter, benefiting from improved global market conditions, particularly in emerging regions and the favorable impact of higher pass-through material pricing. Fluorines and Specialty Products again had impressive quarters, up 26 and 32%, respectively, reflecting improved demand and further penetration with new products. The business is also benefiting from a snapback in the consumer electronics business driving a sharp uptick in electronic materials.</p>
          <p>Now the profit for special materials again up 43% to 214 million in the quarter taking margins up 270 basis points to 17%, reflecting the higher sales volumes, strong commercial and plant performance and continued cost discipline, and again, offset by the absence of last year's policy labor-related actions. So overall, another terrific quarter for Specialty Materials.</p>
          <p>With that review of the businesses, let's go to Slide 11 and look at the 2010 sales outlook. We thought this would be helpful for you to give you some insight in terms of what we're forecasting for the second half of the year. What we're showing here on Slide 11 are the actual and forecasted first half and second half sales on a reported basis for '09 and '10, intended to highlight the expected linearity in each business.</p>
          <p>So we're incorporating as I said earlier, foreign currency headwind in the reported sales figures with the euro at 1.20 on the low end versus an average of 1.46 in the second half of '09. We're still planning to show good year-over-year growth as you can see in the second half. Let's take a couple minutes just to highlight for each businesses.</p>
          <p>For Aerospace, we expect second half sales to be up 3 to 6% year over year driven by sequential improvements in Commercial aftermarket activity. I referenced that earlier as well as the seasonal improvements that we always see in the Defense business, so in Defense spending. Overall, the decline in the first half of 2010 reflects both the impacts of the inventory correction within business jet OEs as well as the result of the economic recession and the high levels of parked aircraft and maintenance deferrals by our major customers. However for the year, we anticipate continued improvement in Commercial aftermarket activity and we're looking for Aero revenues in the range of 10.6 to 10.8 billion for the full year.</p>
          <p>At ACS on the top right of the chart, you can see we're expecting continued strong momentum in the industrial short cycle businesses, coupled with higher conversion of energy projects in the Solutions businesses. We're anticipating the significant foreign exchange headwinds to be offset by the net impact of M&amp;A, assuming the Sperian close in mid-September that I referenced earlier. That's built into the sales guidance here. Again, these are the anticipated reported numbers.</p>
          <p>Moving the Transportation Systems there at the bottom left. We saw the most pronounced increase in volumes as I said in the first half, driven by higher production rates, the favorable impact of diesel penetration, and share gains with a high volume of new platform launches. We're anticipating second half growth to moderate, but still be up three to 7% driven by the summer shutdown schedules of major European auto manufacturers, partially offset by new growth in new launches and the improvement in diesel penetration.</p>
          <p>As you can see, given the strong sales volumes in the first half, we have raised our full year sales guidance for TS to now 3.9 to 4 billion for the full year. And lastly, building off their first half momentum, Specialty Materials expects to see similar end market demand in the second half, sales were growing 12 to 15% and anticipated sales for SM of 4.6 to 4.8 billion for the full year.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to Slide 12 and give you a little bit of insight in terms of our guidance for the second half and the full year by giving you some side-by-side comparisons on some key measures. Again, we saw terrific volume leverage in productivity in the first half, growing segment margins 150 basis points over 2009 levels. Our second half volume conversion and as you can see on expected, it's still very good and continued very strong organic growth in the second half. Our second half volume conversion will be lower than the first half given the tougher year-over-year comps in the second half due to the impact of the large labor cost actions we took last year that are not repeating. Again, those consist of work schedule reductions or furloughs, absence of merit and also reductions in our incentive compensation or bonus accruals and payouts.</p>
          <p>Also it's important to provide you an update on our tax rate assumptions. As you'll recall, the first half tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the charge for healthcare legislation in the first quarter. While there are a number of puts and takes in the tax rate assumption for the second half, it's important to note that we're forecasting a higher effective tax rate. In the third quarter, we expect that to be about 29.5%, which we expect will be offset by a lower rate in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we're expecting tax rate to be approximately the average targeted rate of 26.5%.</p>
          <p>Lastly, a reminder, we contributed shares valued at 200 million to the U.S. pension plan in the second quarter as part of our previously disclosed plan. We'll contribute another 200 million of shares by year-end and while these contributions are not required, we think it's prudent to continue to voluntarily plan and pre-fund pension plans.</p>
          <p>So with that framework for the second half, let's go to Slide 13, just to give you a highlight &#x2013; quick highlights on third quarter sales outlook. We're planning for total sales in the third quarter to be in the range of 8 to 8.3 billion. You should see that on the bottom of Slide 13, up 3 to 8% from prior year, reflecting good organic growth. We anticipate Aero sales to be in the range of 2.6 to 2.8 billion, up on a year-over-year basis for the first time since the start of the recovery.</p>
          <p>For ACS, we expect sales in the range of 3.3 to 3.4 billion, sustaining the positive momentum from the first half reflecting a good growth in the industrial segment, new products as well as emerging region penetration. At Transportation System, sales are estimated to be in the range of 900 million to 1 billion reflecting the impact, as I mentioned earlier, of the European OE summer shutdown and also the lower euro assumption that I referenced.</p>
          <p>Finally, at SM, we anticipate sales in the range of 1.1 to 1.2 billion with growth driven by continued end market improvement, projects growth in UOP and the commercialization of new products in the remainder of SM. So in summary, looks like we're set up for another nice quarter and we're expecting growth in each of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 14, let's take a moment to review our third quarter EPS guidance. As reflected, we have given here a walk from our second quarter just to give you some insight. Obviously, I think you will see the take away is our guidance for the third quarter again reflects strong operational performance. If you start with the $0.60 reported EPS for the second quarter, if you lay on the normal seasonality and the end market recovery we're expecting, we're forecasting 3 to $0.07 higher operating earnings in the third and as I mentioned earlier, we're also expecting a higher than average tax rate in the quarter.</p>
          <p>This translates into a sequential $0.02 headwind which we expect to be offset in the fourth quarter as I mentioned earlier with a lower tax rate. If you net these items in the third, we've walked to an initial guidance range of 61 to $0.65 excluding the impact of Sperian. Depending upon the timing of the close, I mentioned the mid-September expectation earlier, we think the EPS dilution associated with the closing of Sperian to be in the range of 3 to $0.04 in the quarter, that is dilutive in the quarter due to transaction costs and acquisition accounting which includes the step-up of inventory and intangibles amortization. Therefore all in, we arrive at a third quarter guidance of 57 to $0.62, but again, on the operational strength it's pretty clear. By the way, a little bit wider range of $0.05 than we would do typically in the quarter, but reflective of that uncertainty regarding the timing with Sperian.</p>
          <p>Slide number 15, let's just conclude now and just a couple comments before going to Q&amp;A. Obviously, we're off to a strong start for the year with second quarter performance again ahead of expectations. We saw continued improvement in Transportation Systems, Specialty Materials and ACS in both the short and long cycle businesses. The businesses demonstrated strong growth in operating leverage, outperforming their industries. They were well positioned and are well positioned for this recovery. We're also encouraged by the rate of improvement and the uptick in Commercial Aerospace aftermarket orders which were up high single digits in the quarter, reflecting sequential growth in commercial spares. So while we remain cautious in light of continued mixed economic signals, it appears the back half of the year is shaping up for continued good organic growth in each of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Commercial Aero utilization rates are expected to drive aftermarket activity in the second half and by the fourth quarter, we expect our aftermarket growth to outpace flying hours. General industrial recovery in emerging markets will be a bright spot fueling continued double-digit growth. Turbo will continue to benefit from their strong industry position and their new platform launches. However, growth will be at a slower pace in Transportation Systems given the projected second half slowdown in OE production schedules.</p>
          <p>Further, as a result of the difficult cost actions we took last year in the downturn, we will have tougher comps in the second half of 2010, and again as a reminder, the labor related headwinds include the impact of plant shutdowns, furloughs, lower incentive compensation and the absence of merit increases, salary increases in 2009. By taking these actions, we preserved our industrial base and we're reaping now the benefits of having an organization that is fully primed to deliver for improved market conditions, and better able to meet the commitments that we've made to our customers while continuing to invest in the future.</p>
          <p>And finally, while we expect to have foreign exchange headwinds in the second half and some disparity to our normal EPS linearity profile due to the tax rate variability quarter to quarter, third quarter to fourth quarter as I referenced, we're raising our sales, earnings and cash flow outlook for the full year. Again, expecting sales in the range of 32.4 to 32.9 billion. Earnings in the range of 2.40 to 2.50 and free cash flow in the range of 3.1 to 3.3 billion. So with that, Elena, let's turn it back to you and go to Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Overall, good presentation. The one thing- I hate to do this to you guys but I think a year ago the same quarter, you gave a little bit of a forward guidance on pension for the following year. Obviously, lower discount rates and it's a headache for everybody, but can you give us a sense, Dave Anderson, where we kind of stand if we mark things to market right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, so what you're saying is, tell me a little specifically what you're asking about is the forward pension expense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct for 2011, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, let's &#x2013; I think it's probably instructive to go back to the framework that we reviewed with you in February. You know, that's still intact. What we said at that time is for Honeywell, pension expense is clearly going to be a headwind in 2011 and it's probably going to continue to be outsized in terms of our peers. That just has to do with our shorter smoothing and amortization periods.</p>
          <p>The chart that I showed you, though, and I think this is very instructive and helpful and would be good for you to visualize is that chart that showed 2011 &#x2013; 2010, 2011 and then out to 2015, I dubbed it my Bode Miller chart, and what it showed is that the pension expense continues to rise in 2011 -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You got to love those New Hampshire boys</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. That's right. Pretty good performance this year. Peaked and then decelerates and in fact, creates relatively significant tailwind for us. That's essentially built in. I mean, the fact that we're going to have headwind in 2011 we're going to have tailwind in 2012, both of which, by the way, are going to stand out relative to our peers. That's kind of a given.</p>
          <p>The other thing that we talked about in the numbers you know well, Scott, are the guidance or framework, the matrix, if you will, the intercept between discount rate and asset returns. Just to revisit those numbers a little bit. At the time, we talked about a 5.75 discount rate that is essentially the rate &#x2013; that is the rate that we used at the year-end of '09. Talked about a 9% return on assets. That's the targeted return. If you do those intercepts and look at those in terms of our actuarial numbers that's about $200 million of headwind on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>Now the sensitivity is every 25 basis points and this is the biggest sensitivity, 25 basis points of change in the discount rate equates to about $50 million of pre-tax. So you know, it's either 6% would translate to $50 million less expense and 25 basis points lower. Let's call it 5.5 would translate to $50 million more of expense. One point change in the return on assets equates to about $10 million. So again, you can take that 9% return if it's 10 or versus 8, add or subtract $10 million. So that's really the framework.</p>
          <p>The numbers are kind of where they are today, probably low single digits in terms of return on plan assets. Certainly lower than 5.75 in terms of discount rate. Those will all be marked at year-end. That's the framework. You can do the sensitivity analysis from there. Now the other thing to tell you is that we will clearly do everything right in terms of the intelligent pre-funding of the plan, every dollar that we put in on an accounting basis contributes 9%, so a dollar of additional funding contributes 9% of that in terms of income. So that will be something that will mitigate assuming that we do more funding and we'll continue to evaluate funding in the pension plan through the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>The other thing to keep in mind, too, is the stronger than operational performance. There's other things that will mitigate pension. If you look at just our performance this year and how we're doing against that "$800 million" of guidance for pension expense this year. I mentioned, for example, 63 million of repositioning on a year to date. That is going to generate higher income than we anticipated for 2011 when we began 2010. So all those things are in the mix. Hopefully that's helpful to you in terms of thinking about pension for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is. Just while you were talking, I was just doing back of the envelope. It sounds like the $0.20 additional headwind hasn't really changed much from the last update last quarter. That's really what I was kind of getting at.</p>
          <p>Can we move on to Sperian and kind of future free cash flow or cash reinvestment. I mean, what are the rating agencies saying? I think Sperian is a little bit larger of a deal than maybe you were planning for the year. I mean, does this mean, you know, you're not going to be able to do share repurchase or forward deals, or is there still some cushion really without losing your credit rating?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, Scott, you're unlikely to see us doing much in the way of stock repurchases but I'd say at the same time, we're always going to be aware of and looking for the potential for deals that make sense for us, like Sperian because we think that really does make a lot of sense for the share owner and I think that's the best way to think of it.

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple quick questions on ACS. It's a little unusual for ACS not to have a sequential margin lift, and you did have a pretty good sequential revenue lift in the quarter. Can you just give us a little more color on what's going on in the mix there that might have contributed to that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am quite proud of what they did, Jeff. I'm not sure. I had a tough time finding any bad news with anything that they did. I have to admit, I haven't really thought much about it that much that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, if I could just comment a little bit. The big change here I referenced this as I went through my remarks but may not have made it perfectly clear. We really initiated significant labor cost actions in the second quarter of 2009. That's really when -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's true</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's really when we saw the market began to turn. Dave had all of us on our toes with preparedness in terms of the actions that we would take. So we commenced furlough actions, work schedule reductions, and other actions significantly in the second quarter of last year for all of our businesses as I cited. That is a headwind for the second quarter. That is the answer fundamentally to your question in terms of what took place for ACS.</p>
          <p>We had &#x2013; if you look at it kind of setting that aside, as I said, operationally, tremendous performance in our Products businesses. Solutions were not up as much but, but were good performance in the quarter. Really, if you point to a single item, it's really that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That's it. When I talk about the sequential, the second quarter is when we commenced those actions. That's the same answer. It's the same answer as year over year as you have sequentially.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the dynamic of spares versus flight hours finally flipping the other way, can you give us some idea of the magnitude of your thought there? And you know, just kind of the state of inventories in the channel, as best as you can read it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just give you some numbers of what we're anticipating for the fourth quarter. As I mentioned, by the way, we're looking at flight hours in the range of about 3.5% for the third quarter to about 3%for the fourth quarter. And that ties out with the actuals for the first half, ties out to that 3.5to 4.5 range that I mentioned to you earlier. What we're expecting for the fourth quarter, we're expecting that we'll see revenue growth in our ATR aftermarket business, total aftermarket business at about double the flight hour growth. So call it in the range of 6%. And for the total commercial aftermarket, we're going to see about 8% growth, so almost three times the flight hour growth in the fourth quarter. In other words, that total that I referenced would include our business aviation business as well as the ATR business.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yeah. That's exactly right. Yeah. We're seeing it in schedules. We're seeing it in other activity, we've got forecasts in terms of utilization, et cetera. So, it's in that kind of range. We'll see plus or minus on the flight hours and plus or minus on the aftermarket revenue, but we feel good about those kind of directional numbers.</p>

          <p>So quick question on pension. I don't want to kind of keep banging on about pension, but it looks like you've taken down the full year by $100 million, which is sort of interesting. Can you maybe comment on that, Dave?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't done that. We have taken it down moderately from the prior starting point. And we always get a fine tune on our foreign plans as we progress through the year. Nigel, that's just kind of the state of play. And that's mostly what is reflected in those numbers. A good number to use now is around $800 million for full-year pension expense.</p>

          <p>Another thing that you are probably looking at and you might be combining is OPEB and when I talk to pension number around 800 that excludes other post-employment benefits. Those OPEB numbers have improved over the course of the year as we have gotten the benefit of curtailment gains from some of the plan design changes that we have successfully executed over the course of this year.</p>

          <p>You probably saw in the earnings release this morning that we had another billion dollars over their expected program line of wins in Turbo in the second quarter. That brings the year to date wins to $2 billion approximately. Turbo is just, as Dave said, it's just executing very, very well.

          <p>I would say the majority of that is European, but it's a nice mix. It includes Asian business and it includes also North American business. But the majority just given the significance of our European business which represents about 65 to 70% of our total Turbo revenues, the majority of those wins are for European OEs.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then just one more quick one. You gave some color on segment margins in February. And any big changes to those segment-by-segment targets based on year to date performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think those numbers are, you know, those numbers are very much still in range. I'd say the one thing that we have is a little bit of upside in the Transportation Systems, just as a result of their enhanced volume leverage. As I mentioned earlier, we have taken up our Transportation Systems revenues for the full year and that will translate into some improved margins and it's TBD on the foreign currency. We'll see how that plays out</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, just on the quarter, if you could have any &#x2013; do you have sense for the restocking impact on the sales that you had over the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not so much. It's certainly not happening in Aero. I'd say ACS would be the next one and the same thing. It's tough to see into what those inventory balances are out there. So I would say most of what we're seeing is flow-through, we believe. Maybe some restocking, but I wouldn't say restocking is a big number yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you anticipating that that would, other than the discussion this we just had that that would be continuing through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Steve. I'm not I follow. Are you talking about Aero?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, non-Aero. Outside of Aero for the rest of the year, you're saying you haven't had much restocking driving the 8% number in the quarter and would you expect that to be the case going forward when you were giving us the numbers for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and stimulus impact that you talked about coming down, I guess the first question I have is did you actually see the benefit of stimulus then in the numbers in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More in orders than anything else. Orders have started to pick up, but I wouldn't say we have seen big spending from it yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say clearly the benefit we've seen there is on the energy efficiency side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, and we're seeing a nice flow-through and we're just very, very well positioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and you have been kind enough before where you have broken out &#x2013; to break out margin for us a little bit in terms of where that &#x2013; you had that130 basis points overall improvement in terms of how to think about that and what was driven by productivity versus volume? Any other breakout of that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, volume was obviously a key driver. We really benefited in terms of volume leverage in the quarter. That's really the key driver, and then I'd say the other thing is just we would sort of contribute a portion of that to what we would call commercial excellence, just executing very, very well, and then we have the offsets, as I mentioned earlier, in each of our SBG, in each of our businesses offset from the labor policy cost actions so it's not recurring both sequentially to Jeff's question earlier as well as year over year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The big item, Steven, and we talked about this in the past is growing volume and controlling fixed costs. It's really as simple as that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Just not able to quantify the different categories at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I'd say the only thing I would add to Dave is the big item, just think about it as volume leverage and then the other thing is productivity as a result of the repositioning actions that we took in prior periods. That's all living through in terms of that volume leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, well, maybe at least on the ACS side, that 90 basis point margin expansion, how much of that was mix?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and finally on Sperian, do you have any more visibility through the diligence process, et cetera, to that 6 to 8% sort of thinking on cost synergies as you look forward? Are you still thinking about that range? Is that going up?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. First as a clarification, the 2.40 to 2.50 map to 61 to $0.65 in the first quarter or 57 to $0.62 in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It maps to 57 to 62. That's a good question, John, and just to clarify what we did in that walk is just said, okay, here's going to be the reported 57 to 62, but we wanted to just show you the strength of the underlying operational performance that's really driving it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand. It wasn't clear. The third quarter, the $0.02 of higher tax, is that washed in the fourth quarter roughly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So the 29.5, again, I'm giving you kind of a precise number. It's going to be plus-minus in the third quarter. That same number is going to be 22 and change in the fourth quarter, so we'll be at around 6.5 for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and all in without splitting hairs, 2.40 to 2.50 does include the $0.02 related healthcare charge in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It absolutely does. It includes the additional healthcare charge. It includes the Sperian acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it includes the higher repositioning that I mentioned earlier. All of those are baked in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then Dave, corporate expense, meaningfully was higher sequentially. Was there &#x2013; what was going on there and what kind of a run rate would you expect for that segment, or I'm sorry, for that line item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Corporate expense runs in the neighborhood of 50 million, 45 to 55 million per quarter. It depends in terms of things that we may want to recognize or accrue for in the quarter. I think Elena talked a little bit about some of those things. We talked about some of those things previously. It's always going to kind of in that range. If you use the guidance of somewhere in the 190 to 200 range for the full year for that, it's a pretty good number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there's nothing- I'm sorry. I'm not sure if you talked about this. Was there something unusual in the second quarter in the corporate expense line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No. No. Nothing unusual. We're always just looking at &#x2013; we anticipate things like accruals for incentive compensation. We anticipate all kinds of things and those will always move around depending upon the period. So comparing that year over year, it's going to always be in that kind of a range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John, I think that's why we're tracking on target to the 190 to 200 million that Dave referenced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I know. The first quarter was a little lighter and the second quarter a little heavier. Dave, said Europe you are now expecting it to slow. I guess my question is, did you lower any of your European segment revenue targets? Because I mean, you suggested that transportation was going to be higher. Is that more of a commentary around you are not going to get too excited even though Europe for a lot of companies is actually accelerating right now, or did you actually change some aspect of the rollup of your forecast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't really change any aspect of the forecast. It was really just pointing out for you from a planning standpoint, we continue to be, we think, prudent &#x2013; appropriately prudent or conservative. We didn't have a lot of expectation built in for European growth for the year. We have some recovery obviously in the automotive market, Turbo related. We're seeing better than anticipated performance there, but we're being cautious as we look forward to the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember, our expectations were never that high for Europe in the first place</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hopefully, John, we'll see better than this, but we're maintaining, call it a flat to up slightly range for Europe expectation in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In other words and I forget what you said, Europe was up 9%? In other words, the trend of Europe in the second quarter, you're not expecting to be sustained in the back half, is that the way to think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's stated very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just lastly. You know, Turbo really never got the benefit, if you go back to last year, of Cash for Clunkers and I know that your guidance had always presumed that build rates were going to be lower, right, in the second half of this year? And I'm trying to reconcile the fact that you never really got the benefit of that and that's really sort of driving the lower build rates. So how &#x2013; ultimately, if you kind of pinpoint this down to builds, is that material of a drag associated with Turbo and lower build rates just based on where you guys are penetrated on larger vehicle models?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say it had more to do with the Cash for Clunkers in Europe really drove low-end gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And diesel pen dropped a bunch and as soon as that went away, diesel pen has been growing very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in other words -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're right. We're both affected by the overall production rates and in some respects, we're disconnected from the overall production rates because of our strength in terms of Turbo penetration and that we're not on the lower end vehicles, which are more subject to the influence of the scrappage programs, whether they were there in '09 or gone in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe a way to ask this is, all else equal, once we get through a little bit of the first half, second half dynamic and incentives and so forth, given the win rate, I mean, Turbo seems like it's set to accelerate next year. Is that a fair statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends on what the markets end up doing, but I'd say certainly when you look at the dynamics of diesel penetration and new launches around the world, we're in very good shape.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks you guys, got two detailed question, one big picture question. On Process, you talked about sales were down but the orders and backlog were up. When would you expect to see the backlog convert to sales growth for Process Solutions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Second half of this year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Second half of this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question is, you talked about the business jet market improving or outlook improving. Could you give me a little insight on what you're talking about in terms of size of jets, timing of jets, what really is the color there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, the color is that we had a pretty precipitous decline in the second quarter as you recall, Bob, and we went through the numbers. And it's really the timing of deliveries and the overhang of prior orders in 2000 &#x2013; first half of 2009, we're now at a more stable level and what we're seeing now on the OE side is an uptick on some of the higher-end platforms. So we're seeing improvement in terms of Gulfstream, Falcon, some of the Bombardiers, et cetera and that's all driving, as well as Embraer, and that's all driving our performance outlook going forward. And it's against very, very low numbers so it's very, very easy comps that we're talking about on the business jet side. But that business will now have turned and we'll see improvement in terms of year-over-year beats, positive beats in the second half of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are the easy questions. Here's a tough one. Some of the companies are talking about difficulty in dealing with China. China is becoming a difficult market to serve and you guys have, again, been working in there with COMAC and you mentioned the HPS win. Are you finding it more difficult to work there? Are you having to give anything away with regard to technology? I mean, give us some color around just, you guys have been in China in the Process business for decades. I mean, how do you see that market evolving in terms of receptiveness to U.S. manufacturers and players?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Bob, every market has its ups and downs and they evolve over time and every company has to be able to evolve with it. China's going to continue to be a big and growing market. Nothing ever proceeds in a straight line, so I'm sure it will have its ups and downs also. It's important to be there, to be the lawful Chinese competitor and not just the multinational coming in from overseas. And we work pretty hard on that, and that's not going to change. I'd say everything has its ups and downs. You work your way through it. We're very good at, I think, at not giving anything away but rather working with partners and making sure we develop the market. So yeah, I mean, there will be ups and downs but all in all, it's a place we're going to stay and a place we're going to continue to do well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the COMAC wins, you mentioned wheels and brakes and avionics and so forth. Is the pressure to share technology higher now in those businesses than you might have seen, like three years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I would say nothing beyond anything that we've ever expected. As the market evolves, you have to find a way to work with the local guys, the local partners, and I think we've come up with a very effective way of doing that. I don't see that changing.</p>

          <p>We're off to a great start as you have been able to see and I think that reinforces our ongoing strategy having great positions in good industries, the focus on One Honeywell, our five initiatives and that continued focus on seed planting and I think it's also a demonstration of what happens when you stick with a strategy over a period of time, good times and bad times, you stick with a smart strategy, and it really is surprising that in the relentless execution of that strategy, day by day, quarter by quarter, year by year, it's amazing where you can get to. So we've executed well. I think we continue to execute well, and you can count on us to continue delivering in the future. Thanks.</p>
