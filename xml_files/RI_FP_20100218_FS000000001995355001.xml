    <section name="MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Denis, and good morning to one and all. I am going to present the half-yearly results, but let me begin by saying I think that the results were in line with our expectations. Last year, the first half year, was particularly good, because the financial crisis took some time to filter through to consumption. And at the very end of 2008, certainly the first two quarter of 2009, the situation was exactly the opposite, very difficult from a consumption point of view. So we are comparing our results with the very, very strong half year last year. So we are on line or in line, should I say, with the profile we expected as regards the market on the one hand, but also as regards our business and activity.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I'd say that we have had good, strong, resilient results. And very importantly, we did not accept any price compromises. That would be in evidence in our gross margin and thanks to that, we have continued to reduce our debt and can now confirm our full year guidance. So let me take you through that in some greater detail.</p>
          <p>Sales of almost &#x20AC;3.5 million, that's internal, negative internal growth of minus 3%. Profit from recurring operations of 1.06 million &#x2013; 0.06 billion rather, which is stable. Group share of net profit from recurring operations, 648 million, which is minus 5% on the face of things, but plus 6% at constant foreign exchange rate, and you'll see that exchange rates played an important part in the half year. We believe the worst is behind us, but we'll talk about that later on.</p>
          <p>Group share of net profit was 604 million, that's down 2%. They are the published figures, haven't been restated in any way and finally, the generation of free cash flow was strong and the net debt EBITDA ratio was below the 5.5 mark at the end of December. The sales, down 3%. Remember that the base of comparison worked against us. That said, the trend was good. By that, I mean that the first quarter from July to September was down 4%, that was the trend. The second quarter from October to December was only down 2%. So we were on a positive trend and maybe I might add that January was very good again. Remember that the basis of comparison that is January of 2009 was not a particularly good month.</p>
          <p>What about the economic environment? Well, difficult environment situation, quite contrasted from one region to another. France resisted well, particularly year end sales, the festive season was a good one for us. You will see that France fared well, particularly by comparison with its GDP.</p>
          <p>Conversely, Western Europe and the U.S. were in a more difficult situation, now to mention markets like Spain which will take some time to turn around. But you'll see that we're winning over market share in this part of the world.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere, the emerging markets continued to perform in a very vibrant, dynamic way. You might remember that growth picked up in China. I think we can now say that China is going full steam ahead, not to mention countries like India, Korea, the Duty Free sector, which is also picking up. We've also found that countries where we do a lot of business where we generate a lot of profits like Russia or the Ukraine are also picking up. So there are very, very favorable signs in the various economies.</p>
          <p>Okay, operating income, profit from recurring operations was unchanged. The price mix effect worked in our favor, overall. That's important. In other words, we did not accept any compromise as regards price. On the contrary, we actually increased prices, as you will see with Absolut, where we repositioned the brand at premium prices. Now I've mentioned Absolut, but there are many other examples that I will talk to you about later on.</p>
          <p>We continued strong advertising and promotional expenditures, 17% of sales, which I think leads us absolutely at the top of the elite table as a percentage of sales. Anyhow, remember that our objective for the second half year, where we &#x2013; when we reduced our advertising and promotional expenditure in the second half of last year, we will be increasing our marketing expenditure in the second half of this year. Finally, structure cost, well controlled, well contained and of course, the exchange rate effect was very negative, significantly negative, but that I will comment in greater detail.</p>
          <p>Let's begin with an analysis of our sales. Now I am talking about the half year, remember, organic growth was negative, a negative 3%, exchange rates also had a negative impact of minus 4%. Of course, with the acquisition of Vin&amp;Sprit in terms of Group structure, that is, which was a premier plus 1%, but in July, we sold Wild Turkey and subsequently sold Tia Maria, which had of course a negative impact on sales.</p>
          <p>Now in the first half year, there were a number of technical items or technical effects, I mean technical. First of all, the fact that the Chinese New Year was later this year, this year, it's the 14th of February, last year, it was the 26th of January. You may say, that's only two weeks later, but in fact, this year the shipping was carried out in January, whereas in the previous year, we shipped out produce in December of the previous year.</p>
          <p>Then as regards Chivas, we &#x2013; the distribution was taken back in Japan as of October the 1st. So we had no deliveries whatsoever to Kirin in during the first quarter of this financial year. That's an important factor and again, I'll discuss this a bit later on. But we had a number of difficulties with the Duty Free operator in the America, quite simply because he wasn't paying the full amount owed to us. That has since been sorted out, as a result of which we slowed down shipments or reduced shipments to that particular importer.</p>
          <p>Now Mumm was positively affected by restocking. You may remember that we've limited stock allocations about 15 months ago, the result of which champagne was doing particularly well.</p>
          <p>Then there was an increase in excise duties in a number of countries including France, Russia, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Estonia, among others. Again, technical effects which increased the sales figure, not always very significantly. In France, let's say distribution in France didn't really build up stocks to offset that. Let's say that's already been built into the &#x2013; our market. Of course, China as well, remember that in the first quarter of '08-'09, all on-trade outlets were closed down for the Chinese Olympics, karaoke clubs, among others.</p>
          <p>So broadly speaking, particularly the first two, the fact that the Chinese New Year takes place later this year and the discontinuation of distribution to Kirin, I think were the most important single technical effects.</p>
          <p>Regarding the second quarter, the second quarter, first of all, organic growth was minus 2%, Remember, in the first quarter, it was down 4%, in the second quarter, it was down a mere 2%. However, the exchange rates had a more significant impact, largely due to the devaluation of the Bolivian Bolivar. I won't dwell on that because Gilles Bogaert will explain that in much greater detail later on.</p>
          <p>Furthermore the dollar, the ruble, and the Chinese renminbi all weakened. Of course, the renminbi quite rigidly and though not officially pegged, but very closely &#x2013; tracks the dollar rate very closely. Our group structure, as I mentioned earlier on, had a significant affect.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at the sequence of organic growth. On the top, you have organic growth quarter-by-quarter for '08-'09, that's the top half of the chart. In the first quarter, we posted positive growth, plus 7%, the second quarter was plus 3%. These are the basis of comparison with the &#x2013; for this year, we were down 4% in the first quarter, this year, down 2% in the second quarter. So you see there is a catch-up effect gradually taking place.</p>
          <p>And of course last year in the second half year, our first quarter was down 12%. Remember that two-thirds of that was due to stock depletion, or de-stocking as we sometimes call it, which is something that happened between January and March 2009. And that depletion was entirely contained within that third quarter of our financial year. So it will now be much easier for us to perform favorably because the bases of comparison are much easier to outperform.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to our top 15 brands that we will review. Well, volumes were down 5%, revenues down 3%. Now I think that clearly shows that what I've been telling you is true. We do not accept any compromise as regards prices. We actually increased the gross margin on our top 15 brands.</p>
          <p>Maybe I should remind you that the top 15 account for 58% of group sales. You'll hear later on that we invested on average 23% of our top 15 sales in marketing. That's about 70% of the total marketing spend. So the top 15 is really at the very heart of our strategy. I think the conclusion we can draw from this slide is that premiumization is still ongoing. There hasn't been &#x2013; we haven't let &#x2013; relinquished our efforts in any way, on the contrary.</p>
          <p>Okay, let's take a look the Top 15, one by one. Absolut Vodka, volume up 3% sales up 5%, so Absolut actually posted growth in the first half year. That to my mind is excellent news. You'll see that sales or revenue if you prefer rose faster and higher than volume and this is because we significantly increased the price of Absolut all over the world, with the exception of the U.S., where the brand is already positioned as a premium brand. But elsewhere in the world, we increased the price of Absolut. We even accepted volumes declining in countries such as Germany or the U.K., but to us, it was absolutely essential to reposition the brand.</p>
          <p>So, the half year will be a good one on whole. Shipments of Absolut were mainly in the second quarter, but rose 13% in the second quarter. They were actually down 10% in the first quarter. But let me remind you that the first quarter of our financial year was the last quarter where we did not have a distribution. Maxim was still handling distribution of Absolut. So I think they may have sold out to substantially more than in the past, hence the 10% fall off in shipment. Positive price mix effect despite the price pressure in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We came back on the October 2008 price increase. We came back to the price. Remember that the duties are not the same from one state to another, but we repositioned the price at 18 to $20 per bottle of Absolut. But we discontinued all unscheduled promotional sales. But this is why I think fared reasonably well in the U.S. Now the U.S. is the only market in which we had any particular difficulties. Our sales were down 5% in fact in the U.S., but remember that the vodka brands that fare best in the U.S. are low-cost vodkas. Again we will talk about that later on, if you like.</p>
          <p>However, growth was very strong everywhere else, in France, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Greece, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and elsewhere. I think that's perfectly clear. Absolut is an absolute priority, if I may put it that way, for our entire sales network. That has to be perfectly clear.</p>
          <p>I'd say that there was great enthusiasm behind that brand. I even recall meeting customers who told us that with Absolut, you have actually changed the profile of the group. You are a different group with Absolut. Your range was marvelous, but with Absolut, you have a new jewel in the crown, the flagship product and your portfolio is all the better for it.</p>
          <p>I mentioned the U.K. and Germany, so I won't dwell on them. Very importantly, we have taken numerous marketing initiatives right across the board. An example on the top right of the slide here, a poster advertising, organized with a very well-known fashion photographer. We've taken a number of digital initiatives, what we call the Drinkspiration application on iPhones.</p>
          <p>And this is a premiere. Absolut sponsored a short Spike Jonze movie, a 20-minute movie by Spike Jonze. So with the exception of the trailer to the film, where we say that the firm was sponsored Absolut Vodka, with that exception, and of course the film, by the way, was shown at the Sundance Film Festival and in indeed, the Berlin Film Festival as well. But this is a film that will be mostly distributed over Internet.</p>
          <p>This is expected to create what's known as a buzz for the brand. So through this initiative, Absolut is repositioning itself, becoming once again its tradition as a brand at the cutting edge of artistic creation. Now I'm describing all that, I'm telling you about all that just to show you that there is not just great enthusiasm about the Absolut brand. There is also amazing creativity put into the marketing of the brand.</p>
          <p>Chivas, volumes down 13%, revenue down 6%. Again, we didn't accept to reduce our prices. Now half of this shortfall in volumes was due to two factors I mentioned, Japan on the one hand and a Duty Free client in the Americas who wasn't paying the full amounts due.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in Europe, the situation was &#x2013; varied considerably from one country to another. Spain and Romania didn't do particularly well, nothing new there. And we recovered very well in France. Indeed the brand was very good in Poland, too.</p>
          <p>In the Americas, the difficulties continued. I mentioned the Duty Free issues we had with a given customer, but in the &#x2013; and also in Asia, I mentioned that we shipped less to Japan, as well as difficulties in Thailand. The Duty Free market picked up very vigorously in the second quarter. And of course, finally in China, our sales were stable, despite the fact that the Chinese New Year took place later this year. January posted a growth for Chivas in China.</p>
          <p>Now without going through all the details, I think you're familiar with our advertising platform called Live with Chivalry. Everybody knows it except people in France, because we can't broadcast this in France. And there is also the film you know well, the 'shadows' press campaign in evidence on the top right and the initiative that we took with GQ Magazine, with our event called Man of the Year, obviously a Chivas drinker.</p>
          <p>Ballantine's saw its volumes fall 11% and this is the only brand where the mix effect was negative, because our revenue fell 13% and this is the only brand with which revenue fell more than volumes. This is because there was a major impact on the 17, 21 or 30-year old brands, which fell 21%, whereas Ballantine's Finest only decreased 9%. Now what we call the other qualities, they fell largely because of the Asian markets. What we did was we repositioned the price of Ballantine's, Plan B Ballantine's, which had been somewhat removed from comparable brands, but we absolutely have to give priority to Ballantine &#x2013; or to Chivas brand.</p>
          <p>This was a mechanical effect and of course, in Duty Free, that's Duty Free in Asia, the other older whiskies saw volumes fall, but the pick up is very, very clear cut in the second quarter of the year. I think we have every reason to believe that in the Asian Duty Free market, the second half year will be good. And that's the older Ballantine's Whisky.</p>
          <p>But come back to our Ballantine's Finest, which was down 12%, some of our markets fell in Spain in particular, but we did nonetheless defend market share well, in fact we outperformed a certain number of competitors and achieved good levels of performance in France, Brazil, Poland, and even in the Asian markets, where we've rolled it out.</p>
          <p>Here again a big marketing innovation was a new campaign, a variation on the theme of Leave an Impression, it's called Plan B. This is golf the way I like to play it, it's very hard to miss the hole and you can see this is the in top center. There is a whole series of variations on this theme, the goldfish jumping from one bowl into another where there are no other fish.</p>
          <p>Plan B, and a very flexible campaign, again with the digital variation. We are in digital advertising because that's the place to be. And of course, we have our own event, the Ballantine's-sponsored Golf Championship, which is one of the official &#x2013; on the official tour and is held in April. Next April, we will see the second version of the Ballantine's Golf Championship in South Korea.</p>
          <p>Martell, volumes down 3%, revenue up 3%. Now you are familiar with our strategy. VS is still falling, this is down 21%. This is because we want to reserve our spirits for the older whiskies. Noblige up 30%, Cordon Bleu up 6%.</p>
          <p>Remarkable growth in China with plus 16%, despite the fact that in December, we still hadn't shipped produce for the Chinese New Year, so China didn't disappoint us from it, but I'd mention, should also be made of a number of other countries such as Vietnam which is becoming quite a big market for the Group. It's an expanding market. We also did well in Taiwan and the Philippines. Philippines, where we opened a subsidiary just three years ago, the outcome of our investment is very positive. As for the quality mix effect, well, you know it's continued to be very positive. We have a new television campaign for XO. I am sure you've seen the last visuals here. The emphasis is on the arch of the bottle. And this is top right, if you have the slides.</p>
          <p>New press campaign in Russia as well. Don't ask me to explain what's written in Russian below, but some of the Russian speakers among you will help the others. And we have received a proposal from the Hong Kong airport, which has reserved a dedicated marketing area for us in the airport. I think it's 35 square meters or about 350 square feet which is entirely dedicated to Martell. This is of course positioned to ensure that all flyers pass by, so an amazing number of initiatives taken to boost our sales.</p>
          <p>Jameson; volumes up 4%, revenue up 7%, so once again, a very good progress from Jameson. Continuing very strong growth in depletions, that's 21% in the U.S. in evidence in the Nielsen panel figures, which were up 14%. In Europe, we experienced difficulties in Ireland and in France, but Eastern Europe, Russia in particular, and Scandinavia, all fared well. Jameson is a very strong brand in Scandinavia.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we &#x2013; the market picked up very sharply in one of our growth markets, namely, South Africa. Now the first quarter wasn't in line with our growth expectations, but in the second quarter, we picked up, this is a very, very good market, South Africa. We also have a new campaign that where John Jameson jumps into the sea to save his barrel of whisky that's floating away. And this is a campaign that's doing particularly well.</p>
          <p>Now we also sponsored the Dublin International Film Festival, but in other cities such as Berlin <mark type="audio gap" />. This is an excellent way of conducting a very high level of customer relations, because Jameson is rated one of America's 20 hottest brands by the magazine called Advertising Age.</p>
          <p>For Havana Club, next, you see the volumes down 6%, sales down 1%. The minus 6% figure here for the volume is connected with three major markets for us, Cuba, Spain and Italy. Unfortunately, they are three markets that were hard hit, particularly hard hit by the crisis, by the downturn, but big increase in France, Eastern Europe, Canada and Germany. The growth is strong too. And currently, Germany has become the leading market in value terms for this brand and we are the out and out leader in that segment of rums.</p>
          <p>So really, it's a major resounding success, I would say, that we have achieved &#x2013; that our subsidiary has achieved there. And among other initiatives, you can see here the visual showing you the campaign where you see here on the slide, the new seven-year old product, as it's going to be dressed, so of speak, part of premiumization, of course.</p>
          <p>Glenlivet, well, volume down 1%, sales unchanged. In the U.S., sustained consumption growth that we see with depletions at plus 3% that you see in the &#x2013; in line with the Nielsen figures and the shipments are stable. So we hope the upturn's ahead of us. Asia and Africa, strong growth from low bases, because we have our strategy to internationalize the brand, but we did have a slight dip in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Ricard, volumes unchanged, sales up 2%. Now this is quite a good performance, especially in France. Consumers have remained faithful to the brand, because as you see, we even gained market shares, Nielsen Volume of plus 0.9% in a flat market and in the European markets overall, well, we put in a good performance with overall stability. In Africa &#x2013; North Africa, we lost a bit, so overall, it's stable.</p>
          <p>Beefeater, volumes down 5%, sales down 2%, great value creation there. In Spain, well, we're minus four, but we're nibbling away additional market shares. In particular, this campaign you see here for Beefeater that is being ruled out within the promotional concept that's called Londonize.  It was a major success on that market. And I won't go into the details. I would like to do it, but really for Spain, here we are bolstering our brand franchise here and gaining market shares to be the leading brand in the Spanish market. Now in the U.S., minus 6% though, and the Forever London campaign, that's been extended. That's continuing to be rolled out further.</p>
          <p>MaliBoomBoom, well, now as you see on the slide here, there's a new campaign being rolled out there. Small films, but short ones shown on the Internet. They are not intended for TV broadcasting. It's really reaching our target audience, the young adults and when you see it well, the humor is what, maybe strange, but it's in line with that target audience. And in the U.S., our shipments were stable, but then we saw the depletions were up 6%, so it's in the U.S. that the campaign was set up to start off with and we see that the brand is responding very favorably to this campaign.</p>
          <p>The other markets in Europe, well, we see a drop, but we're in the phase now  where we're currently setting up the campaign, preparing the campaign and starting to roll it out. So we hope it will turn around the sales for us in Europe, as happened indeed in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Kahl&#xFA;a, well, unfortunately here, this is negative. Kahl&#xFA;a isn't an exception to the category, which overall is negative and you see the negative figures for Kahl&#xFA;a here, apart from Japan, which is faring, let's say, pretty well.</p>
          <p>Jacob's Creek, volumes down 10 and down sales 6%. In wine, particularly in the U.S. &#x2013; in the U.K. sorry, there is a price war going on and we decided clearly &#x2013; made a clear decision not to go into unprofitable promotional deals, buy one get one free and that kind of thing, special deals, three bottles for &#xA3;10, that we are not going to do. We are not going to go for that kind of special bargain price. And we lost substantial volumes in the U.K., but we reflected that in our procurement plan, our supplying plan, because there is no question for us of engaging in that kind of price war in a market that's down so much. We have a value strategy.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, you can see that we progressed very well in Australia, in the U.S. and in China. So the brand is being bolstered and developed in value terms and we have a new advertising campaign that's very novel, very innovative. Instead of talking about wine, we are &#x2013; David here, the true character, he is &#x2013; David is yourself or myself. He is a man of the street, really and he talks about wine and the different style is the man of the street style. It's not the wine specialist or the terroir and so on. So this campaign is really appealing to people a lot.</p>
          <p>Montana, volumes down four and sales down four with stability in Oceania and a sharp decline again in the U.K., but we are not comprising on price. So we've just got to live with the fact of volumes going down there, but we are not in the race for volumes. That's not on for us.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. however, the brand is faring well, Nielsen plus 5% and we are currently rolling out a new printed media and TV campaign, the creators of Malborough. Now you all know that Malborough is the place that Montana comes from, it's the valley of origin. It's a very conducive climate for Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir, a climate that's really, well, a bit cold and very conducive to growing those grapes and very fine wines are produced there, so Creators of Malborough campaign.</p>
          <p>Oh, I nearly forgot champagne, of course, how could I forget Mumm? First off, volumes down 13%, sales down 11%. We are doing a bit better than the category. In France, you have a drop of 12% in shipments. That's mainly due to the on-trade difficulties. Mumm, it's half and half, half on-trade and half off-trade. So the on-trade encountered lots of difficulties in this country, but we put up a good performance in the off-trade sector.</p>
          <p>And especially at the end of the year, when our business activity according to Nielsen, not our shipments I am talking about here. As per Nielson, they saw almost 4% up, no compromise there on price either. And I just want to comment on that, you know, everybody talked about champagnes less than &#x20AC;10 a bottle and so on. Now I looked at the statistics and they're 3% of the shipments only. So it's good probably to get &#x2013; to draw the crowds into the store, but that's all. So if you look at the major international brands, including Mumm, for example, those brands did not compromise on price. However, they recorded increases at the end of the year, so that's a good performance we put in.</p>
          <p>However, in export markets, clearly champagne has suffered more. Champagne is really a part of French customs and habits. People drink champagne more readily, but it's a bit more exclusive in other markets.</p>
          <p>On Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t, well, that's the other brand with Ballantine's where the sales are evolving more unfavorably than the volumes, but there is a mix effect here. Grand Brut down by about 10%, but Cuv&#xE9;e d'Epoque  is going down much more, in line with the Cuv&#xE9;e Prestige and the Cuv&#xE9;e Prestige, it's everything that's sold beyond &#x20AC;100 a bottle, so obviously upscale, really upscale champagnes and these Cuv&#xE9;es were hard hit.</p>
          <p>But one thing I would point out is that we've seen a progression in a certain number of markets. so France, U.K and in Japan , Belle Epoque, we've resumed distribution of the brand in Santorik, which is quite a big network and we went back there a year ago and started doing business there and that brand has just continued to progress over the last year in Japan, thanks to that. That's a very good performance, because Belle Epoque is consumed in really upscale places and for us, is the entrance door for Chivas and Glenlivet in particular, that we can use that open door to enter with other products.</p>
          <p>So with champagne, we shouldn't be too depressed, champagne is a very cyclical, almost pro-cyclical category. It tends to accentuate the fluctuations of the economy more than other products. It concentrates those fluctuations, but over the last 60 years, we look at the cycle of champagnes as a category that grows. It's just growing and growing, even though there were dips here and there because of the business cycle at the time.</p>
          <p>So there are some local brands, of course, that I mustn't leave out too, some key local brands. Our strategy consists of operating local brands that give us critical mass, critical size. And we need critical size, because with the choice of having our own proprietary distribution network and these local brands, in fact, played their roles of stabilizing, having the stabilizing effect stability in the first half year, so they are like shock absorbers for, I guess, the downturn, and sometimes, they are growth drivers as well, strong growth drivers. Our Indian brands, Royal Stag and so on have, I mean, 30% growth over the half year. I mean, it's really phenomenal.</p>
          <p>And also in Korea, Korea is turning around. As I said, Imperial, which is a Scotch whisky there, sold only in South Korea, is getting back to growth figures now in South Korea in this half year. But we have seen some difficulties in Royal Salute in Asia. But we are very much connected with the Duty Free market there, very much dependent on the Duty Free market. And the end of year sales were good in Royal Salute, so for me, the turnaround is ahead of us.</p>
          <p>So 30 key local brands, representing 22% of our total group sales. The 15 key brands that we saw a while ago is 58%. So if you do the sums, you'll see that, that's 80% of our total revenues accounted for by those brands, all told. So in terms of profitability, it's 90% or so. So we've covered the bulk of our Group's business when we briefly review those product lines.</p>
          <p>I think at this stage, I'll give the floor to Gilles now.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pierre. Good morning, everybody. I suggest we should run through our income statement, start off with this summarized consolidation income statement here. As you have seen, we have stable profit from recurring operations on a like-for-like basis with business down minus 3% for the revenues, offset by a better mix. We'll go back to that.</p>
          <p>We have maintained our advertising and promotion expenditure at a high level, 17% of sales and strict control then of structure base costs. The profit from recurring operations on the face of it is down by 11%, mainly because of the currency effect, the ForEx effect.</p>
          <p>So let's have a look now for a minute at the scope effect and the currency effect for the half year, minus &#x20AC;30 million in the profit from recurring operations, minus 2%, favorable impact because of the Vin &amp; Sprit input for the 22 days in July and then unfavorable impact because of the disposals we made over the last 12 months, Wild Turkey, Tia Maria, Glendronach and Bisquit in particular. So we have a ForEx impact that's quite negative in the first half, about &#x20AC;100 million, minus 8% because of Venezuela largely. We'll go back to that in a minute and also the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, the ruble and the Mexican peso.</p>
          <p>However, we estimate that the ForEx impact for the full year on the PRO will be to the tune of between 100 and &#x20AC;120 million worth, all told, not much more than the ForEx impact we've seen at the end of December for several reasons.</p>
          <p>The Venezuela impact is very much focused in the first half because of the seasonality in that country. Also on the basis of the current rates, we see a favorable trend in the dollar parity and the dollar-pegged currencies or ones that tend to follow the dollar and some technical reasons that were unfavorable in the first half will become favorable once again in the second half.</p>
          <p>Now Venezuela, the background to this. As you know, there was a devaluation in January of this year in the Venezuelan currency, going from 2.15 to 4.30 for US$1 for non-essential products. There are two official rates at the moment, one for the essential products and for the non-essential products, non-staple products, so the brands are in that category, the non-essential products. We've seen also increasing difficulties in accessing foreign currencies in that county.</p>
          <p>So the consequence of all that is in the first half. We decided to use a rate of $1 equals VEF5.89, so more unfavorable than the new official rate. We took on board what we noted in our group in the first half for foreign currency transfers outside of Venezuela. So we summed up the impacts here for you on the chart.</p>
          <p>The first half you see shows up a negative impact on the profit from recurring operations, &#x20AC;40 million and &#x20AC;30 million negative in the net profit from recurring operations for the group share, that is. And for the full year, we anticipate a negative impact on the net profit from recurring operations as you see here, 50 for the profit from recurring operations in the group share and net profit from recurring operations at 40.</p>
          <p>So logistics costs, the gross margin after logistics costs, the depression of 30 basis points for this margin ratio, it would even have been much more, 80 at &#x2013; on a like for like basis. So that reflects the mix effect and the price effect, in spite of the crisis. But fundamentally, we see here that we were capable of protecting our price positioning of our brands and the margins of our brands in a difficult economic context. So we haven't compromised its prices &#x2013; on prices, as Pierre said a minute ago.</p>
          <p>Regarding the advertising and promotion expenditure, next, you see in the ratios here, we stand at 17%; 17.3 last year in the same period, that is. So we boosted our spending last year and now we kept a substantial level of expenditure. Regarding the top 15, it's almost 23% of sales for A&amp;P expenditure. For technical reasons, there will be an offset in certain investments as they'll move into the second half rather than the first half because of the Chinese New Year, for example, or the Plan B Ballantine's campaign coming to market as of January only.</p>
          <p>Also, we've targeted the investments on the priority brands and market combinations and of course, Absolut in the U.S. is the first ranking on that.  And we confirm our objective to increase the advertising and promotion expenditure over sales ratio over the full financial year, 2009 and 2010. The logical upshot of what we've just seen is that after the A&amp;P expenditure, the contribution remains stable and up 70 basis points, as you see.</p>
          <p>Now structure costs, organic growth in structure cost limited to 1% after no change stability in '08/'09. So we've kept structure costs under a tight range, so to speak. That resulted from the continuing structure downsizing in many mature markets. There were about ten countries where the head count was reduced. Wage restraint policy, a wage restraint policy too and also, we've strengthened our distribution network in emerging markets. Now structure costs is not just SG&amp;A and overhead, it's our sales forces too that are resources made available to our brands in key markets. So, on that part, it's an investment in the future and growing our brands.</p>
          <p>Profit from recurring operations, stable, steady and at constant foreign exchange, the operating margin increased by 90 basis points to 29.3%.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the geographical regions next. You can see that the internal growth in the profit from recurring operations shows up that we were driven by Asia and the rest of the world, &#x20AC;21 million you see. We're resilient in France thus far, so to offset the persisting difficulties in Europe, minus &#x20AC;21 million and to a lesser extent, in the United States, for the Americas, minus &#x20AC;8 million.</p>
          <p>Here you see the key figures for the Asia and rest of the world zone, plus 3% in organic growth and for sales and up 8% from the &#x2013; in the profit from recurring operations. So internal growth remains quite sustained, in spite of the fact that the Chinese New Year was later, driven by China with Martell, India with our local brands; other emerging markets that are growing very well, Vietnam in Asia, South Africa and Turkey, that are markets which are still small markets for us, but showing substantial growth, that will have a lot of potential for the future for our group. And the development of Absolut in nearly all of our markets in that region, where the brand wasn't developed very much before the acquisition took place.</p>
          <p>Now on the positive signals, we see improvement of the situation in &#x2013; over the period in South Korea and in Thailand and in Duty Free. The shipments, the sales of our Duty Free customers went really back into the green in the latter part of the half year. Now we saw a decrease in the advertising and promotional expenditure ratio, due to technical reasons, as I said. Firstly, the increase in the share of local Indian brands, where our expenditure level is lower than for the global brands and also, expenditure that was shifted to the second half of the year in Chinese Asia, because of the Chinese New Year being later.</p>
          <p>In the Americas, well, you see the figures for yourselves, minus 2% and then growth minus 22% as a face value. In the United States, the markets remains overall very difficult. There is a trend to down-trade, especially in Vodka and Champagne. Depletions, that is what comes out of the wholesalers to the retailers, they were slightly negative in the first half, even though &#x2013; although they were slightly positive in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Now we've increased our advertising and promotion expenditure over sales ratio in this key market given its potential, and we also have brands that are continuing to behave very well for us. Jameson is a leader there, double-digit growth and Glenlivet and Malibu, quite resilient too.</p>
          <p>Overall, a good half year in Latin America, good resilience in Canada, where the market improved second quarter and on the face of it, the profit from recurring operations goes down because of &#x2013; mostly because of the ForEx impact in Venezuela we talked about and the dollar parity going down too accounted in part for that.</p>
          <p>Europe, overall, difficult half year, down 10% in terms of organic growth and sales. France doesn't &#x2013; isn't included in these figures of course and minus 5% therefore in the profit from recurring operations. The situation remains difficult in Spain, which is an important market for us, but we've been gaining for the off trade markets for Beefeater, Ballantine's and Absolut, difficult though in the U.K., especially in wines, and in Ireland.</p>
          <p>Among the signs of improvement, we see signs of improvement in the second quarter in Russia and in the Ukraine. The gross margin rate was improved, thanks in particular to a smaller portion of wine in regional sales and also, the marketing spend was adjusted based on each market situation and the potential. But as you will see, there was enough swing in the second &#x2013; there will be enough swing in the second half in our forecast, anyway and a reduction in structure cost and the media costs, of course, that went down helped us to reduce our promotional cost.</p>
          <p>The structure costs went down in Europe and we maintained the operating margin above 27% of sales. So, France, a good half year, up 4% in profit from recurring operations. The organic growth, sales went down by just 2%.</p>
          <p>Ricard fared well. Absolut, good in France, Chivas, Havana Club, too, good. Mumm went down for the half year, but we talked about that. The brand put in a good end of year performance and was quite resilient in the off-trade segment and we kept a tight lid on investments in France and structure cost, so that the operating margin went up quite considerably.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the breakdown by geographic region, which is increasingly well balanced. If you look at the breakdown profit from recurring operations by region, you will see there is very comparable to the breakdown of sales by geographic region. Okay, new savings, well, only fell to about one third of sales, one-third of revenue, one-third of our profitability. So this is just as good as our mature markets, in new economies, in mature markets, and despite the fact that the Chinese New Year is taking place later this year.</p>
          <p>So a lot of pressure in emerging markets, which is something that really sets us apart. It's a great asset and a year after the start of the crisis, I think we can clearly agree clearly that it's the emerging markets that have fared best, that have picked up quickest, while we repeat the fact that we are well established in these markets.</p>
          <p>Let's go now below profit from recurring operations, we're going to look at the financial income or expense from recurring operations. Average cost of borrowing was 4.15% compared to 4.5% last year, which confirms us in our belief that we will have an average cost of borrowing of less than 4.5%, as we announced last &#x2013; in September.</p>
          <p>This is because of a reduction in financing costs, of which about two-thirds stem from the lower average rate in margins and a further third being brought about by the deleveraging of the Group. Also, good cash flow, disposals and capital increase. Other financial income and expenses from recurring operations are down. These include income and expenses relating to our pension liabilities.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow of 526 million is unchanged by comparison with last year. So a good half year in terms of cash flow. Cash flow from recurring operations was down in line with sales because of exchange rates. We have reduced our industrial investments and the half year saw a number of receivables disposed of. So 265 million disposed in the first half year. Now over and beyond the impact of these disposals, which already had an impact in the first half of last year and of course, the first two quarters of this year.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was up close to &#x20AC;100 million by comparison with the same period last year. Here is the change in net debt by comparison with June 30, when our net debt was 10.9 billion. It's down to 10.3 billion at the end of December, which is a significant reduction of our debt, largely due to the 500-plus million in the free cash flow disposal of Tia Maria. So &#x20AC;65 million, which is the net impact of disposals and the pension liabilities.</p>
          <p>We also have the dividend payout. That was &#x20AC;133 million over the period and this time, we had a positive currency translation adjustment on our debt as a result of the euro trading at 1.51 against the dollar at the end of the year. This gives a net debt to equity ratio below 5.5 at the end of the year, meaning that our margins on syndicated loans are stable at 120 bps.</p>
          <p>A few words about our debt and the maturity of our debt. At the end of December, we had 700 million in cash, &#x20AC;700 million and 1.9 billion in undrawn credit facilities. These are syndicated credit facilities. Now we have major outflows in 2013, again in 2011. The plan is to gradually rebalance between bond debt and bank debt between now and 2013. The breakdown is currently 25% in bond debt, 75% in bank borrowings. Here you have the breakdown of the debt by type of rate, but 37% in variable rate debt, the rest even being in fixed rate or equivalent. 32% of our debt is in dollars, the remaining 48% being in euros.</p>
          <p>As for corporate income tax, corporate income tax on recurring items is 19.3%. The effective rate is in line with expectations and is very close to the same rate last year. For non-recurring items, the corporate income tax is down and a positive impact of &#x20AC;110 million is mainly due to non-recurring expenses, in this instance, losses and gains on currency translation. Also, the positive impact of deferred taxation on the disposal of assets, in this particular instance, Tia Maria.</p>
          <p>Minority interests as you will include Havana Club and Corby in Canada and this gives us a group share of net income that is down facially at 5%. Factoring out currency translation, that would have been plus 6%. Of course, exchange rates had a major impact on our performance for the first half year.</p>
          <p>A few words about non-recurring items. Non-recurring operational items include a 93 million total expense, last year, it was &#x20AC;133 million. So we have improved the total operating expenses, largely due to the fact that last year, we had a lot of expense items arising from the acquisition of Vin&amp;Sprit. The 50 million on the first line, 51 million, are due to the capital loss on the disposal of Tia Maria, but largely offset by the tax deferral I mentioned earlier on, and the number of restructuring costs also I should mention due to the downsizing of our structures in mature markets, as I mentioned earlier on.</p>
          <p>Non-recurring financial expenses and income, last year, was an expense of 46 million, this year we have financial income of 18 million, so a big improvement there. This gives us a group share of net profit of &#x20AC;604 million. This is after recurring and non-recurring items. Now that is down 2% on the first half of last year.</p>
          <p>Let me give the floor back to Pierre Pringuet for the conclusion and outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gilles. So the first half was in line with the guidance. Sales were down, in organic, 3%. Remember that there have been number of unfavorable items in the basis of comparison, but the pick-up has been very good since the start of the second half year. As I said before, it's absolutely essential that we defend our prices. This is &#x2013; our future hinges on our ability to defend our prices, and of course, we must continue our marketing spend on key brands.</p>
          <p>28% operating margin with the positive price mix effect. I think that's particularly important, because our profitability hasn't been weakened despite the difficult environment and asset costs have been reduce significantly, and of course, we have continued to reduce our debt. I think that all reflects the merits of our achievements over the first half year.</p>
          <p>As for the outlook for the year, as I told you, the third quarter beginning in January has shown strong growth and of course, admittedly, the basis of comparison is much weaker, so it's easier to achieve growth, but it's still good news. Geographically speaking, Western Europe is still experiencing difficulties on the whole, but the French market has been quite resilient. The U.S., well, the visibility is still quite low in the U.S., maybe that is the little cloud on the horizon.</p>
          <p>You''' have read in our press releases that in the first quarter, we saw depletions increase, but as Gilles explained, that was now confirmed in the second quarter. Conversely, our economic growth figures seem to be stronger than in the Europe, so maybe this will filter through to consumption with time.</p>
          <p>Then there is a whole series of positive signals coming from the Duty Free markets. Now I've dwelt on the Asian Duty Free market in particular, but our sales have picked up in South Korea as well, but also Eastern Europe and these are highly profitable markets, because they consume a lot of super-premium products and even above that. And of course, the very strong vitality of the emerging markets, that has been confirmed. That, I think, is the way I would sum up the outlook for the full year.</p>
          <p>As a result of all that, we are confirming our guidance of one to 3% organic growth in profit from recurring operations, while increasing our advertising and promotional expenditure and so on. We could, of course generate higher profits by investing less. That's not our strategy, because we believe that it's absolutely essential to maintain or continue to support our brands financially on the one hand, but I hope I'll have convinced you as well when I review the different brands by the quality of our marketing, which, I think, is a very innovative form of creation.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, that is the end of our presentation. You now have the floor.</p>

Could we improve the lighting, maybe increase the lighting in the room, so we can see one another, possibly? I have a question in the third row here, if you could get this gentleman a microphone.

        <plist>
          <p>Simon Hales from Evolution. Two questions please, if I can. Firstly, just on Chinese New Year. I wonder if you could just sort of give us some form of quantification as to the impact that's going to have on Q3 and versus what &#x2013; the negative impact it's had on the second quarter? How big a skew of sales or the loss of sales in the second quarter that will have? And I appreciate the Chinese New Year was only last weekend, but can you give us any idea about what trading was like running into Chinese New Year and over the event itself?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, could you just give us some guidance at all on the overall structural impact or the scope of impact you expect to see for the full year? Obviously a big hit in the first half, how do see that developing in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gilles Bogaert. We believe that the impact will be about 50,000 cases in China. You know the products that sell best. Let me give you some idea of the impact the Chinese New Year will have. It is a bit early to drawing any &#x2013; to be drawing any conclusions on the Chinese New Year, which really began on the 14th of February and so our figures aren't very complete yet.</p>
          <p>As for the structure effect, it was minus 130 million in the first half year. Let's say if you take that effect and multiply it by two, you wouldn't be very far off the full year impact. Now, it won't be quite the same. We heard about the exchange rate impact, but we expect to be in line with the effect at the end of December, should be very similar in the second half year. A question from the second row?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Francois Digard from Natixis Securities. By comparison to one of your large competitors, there is quite a striking difference. They focus on market share. You focus on defending your prices. Now what is the strategic vision of market recovery? Why these different approaches? And maybe you could tell us a few words about what your view is of the underlying growth profile in the industry over the next two or three years?</p>
          <p>The second question on the cost of debt, already mentioned in the press that you wanted to structure your debt with some more bond borrowing and less syndicated credit facilities. What will the impact be for the average cost of debt? Will you expect it below 4.5% this year, will that be closer to 5% next year, maybe 5.5 the following year, is that a reasonable estimate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll answer the first question, and let Gilles Bogaert to take your second question. Broadly speaking, you know we don't talk about our competitors, but what I will do is tell you about us. I think you will maybe acknowledge that we invented the whole concept of premiumization of spirits. We believe that this is a clearly established long-term trend.</p>
          <p>This, I believe, stems from the fact that global consumption and not just of spirits, consumption in general, whether you look at fashion, electronics, consumer goods, consumers are increasingly attracted to premium brands. Now, let's be very clear about this. Brands are only aspirational if they are premium brands. There is an intrinsic link between the two. But any gain, short-term gain in market share at the expense of price is, I think, building without foundations. We want to build our franchise, our brand franchise for the long-term through innovative marketing, through support to our brands and once again, by staunchly defending our prices. This is something we have a great belief in and what's more, it works.</p>
          <p>As you saw, we improved our margin. Remember the Cassandras telling us that premiumization was something of the past. Well, no. It's still working and working well. We succeeded in increasing our gross margin in the first half year. That, I believe, is a very good performance.</p>
          <p>Clearly, when a country's economy picks up, the volumes of our brands pick up straightaway. There is a very close link between the two. We are a cyclical business. We are very closely correlated with GDP growth. So when consumers have disposable income through economic growth, well, they come through back to these premium brands. So this is a strategy that we have not departed from in any way, one I believe that will be a winning strategy with a view to the long-term.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gilles Bogaert. Concerning our debt, cost of debt, I'm not going to make any hazardous forecasts as regards the cost of debt for the years to come. We've given you one for this year, which is 4.5% which we will &#x2013; can now confirm. We can also confirm we'll be rebalancing our borrowings with greater emphasis on bond borrowing or bond debt over the months and the years to come.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you all the same that our credit default swap is listed at about 80 basis points, which shows that in the current context &#x2013; of course, the markets will not make the spread any higher. There is a difference admittedly, but a very manageable difference. Maybe I might also remind you that two-thirds of our debt is at fixed rates, fixed or equivalent rates and with one-third at variable rates. That said, there is nothing particularly new for you all here. I think we can have every reason to expect that in the years to come, interest rates will increase somewhat. But let's wait for the impact which we will hopefully be <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Ian Shackleton from Nomura. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen, and three quick questions around financial items. Firstly, could you give us some idea of where you think net debt EBITDA will be by the year end? Secondly, how much will you be looking for in terms of total disposals? I think you are now up to about 800 million. And thirdly on the other financial charges, the 90 million you report in the first half, how can we think about that going forward, particularly vis-&#xE0;-vis the pension charge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer your question on disposals and then Gilles answer the other two. On disposals, as you said, we've already achieved 800 million. Remember that the goal is one billion. We will be carrying out of these disposals in the fullness of time at our own pace. The policy is very clear-cut.  We will never have our hand forced. Either the assets we have on sale or for sale find buyers at a price that we find palatable, acceptable given the quality of the assets, in which case, we conclude a deal.</p>
          <p>If the price proposed does not meet our expectation, then we do not go through with the deal. So that's the policy. We will take whatever time it takes. Remember that when we announced this disposals program last September, incidentally, we said that it might take us up to 18 months to complete that program. We still have plenty of time ahead of us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Turning to net debt to EBITDA, unless I am mistaken, we haven't given any guidance on that ratio, but what we did say is that EBIT will achieve somewhere between one and 3% organic growth over the full year. We also confirmed that the free cash flow from recurring operations would be &#x20AC;3 billion over the three years, including last year, this year and next year.</p>
          <p>Well, at the end of December, the ratio was below 5.5, but remember, the end of December is usually the high point in terms of working capital requirements, certainly much higher than at the end of June. Also remember that the ratio is calculated on the basis of the 12 previous months EBITDA, which include the 12 months have been most severely affected by the crisis.</p>
          <p>Now if I could give you some idea, organically speaking, organic growth of 2% of our result would reduce this ratio by 0.1% and the 200 million improvement of our debt also has an 0.1% impact on the ratio. There are organic impacts, but a certain number of non-recurring items, including exchanges rates, can also have an impact, especially with the dollar debt. And of course, disposals as well, sometimes the cash arrives on our accounts at a different time staggered by comparison with the loss of revenue. So I think with these items, you should be able to work out what the level might be at the end of June.</p>
          <p>Your final question was on financial expenses in other financial income and expenses from recurring operations. As we've said for the first half year, we improved from an expense of 19 million last year to 27 million this year. So a slight increase of &#x20AC;8 million. This is largely due to pension commitments.</p>
          <p>As you know, we have the net yield of our assets plus the cost of discounting are down and of course, the yield expected was revised downwards as a result of the crisis. This meant that the expense item increased slightly. But over the full year, I think you could multiply that impact by two, for the full year. That will give you some idea of what the impact will be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone, Melissa Earlam, UBS. Three questions please? First of all, can you give us an update on the delivery on the Vin &amp; Sprit cost savings? I believe you were at 110 million when you last reported. Can you give us your cumulative savings number so far?</p>
          <p>Then on the pricing outlook for 2010 calendar year, are you expecting in the second half of your fiscal year more pricing opportunities and could you give us an idea of which regions those would be in? And then finally, you mentioned in the release that the ANP to net sales pick-up will be particularly in the U.S. and in emerging markets. Can you give us an idea whether you are also planning to increase A&amp;P in Europe in the second half or whether given the weaker top-line outlook there, you will be holding back on A&amp;P still in that region? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the investments, yes, there are no exceptions, but the fact that we'd be reinvesting. That said, Europe is one of the regions where we significantly reduced our A&amp;P. We've, of course, planned to reinvest in A&amp;P in Europe this year. Some of these investment plans are already underway.</p>
          <p>Maybe I should mention that in Spain in particular, before investing in the media and media buying, we were waiting for Ballantine's new Plan B campaign. So, yes, certain A&amp;P expenditure was deferred to the second half year, but that's a program that's beginning now. In the U.S. our A&amp;P spend was very high even in the first half year. So we will continue our efforts over the full year.</p>
          <p>This brings me to prices. Well, each market operates in its own way and some price increases were implemented in France at the start of the year. In other countries, it tends to be in the autumn. So the price increases vary over time from one country to another. One has to be realistic nonetheless about the fact that in the current environment, our price increases tend to be small. Broadly speaking, we keep abreast of inflation. So we have more than offset our increased production cost, but our gross margin, as you will have seen, has increased. I'm not going to say any more about the second half year. And Gilles, would you like to say a word about the synergies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the Vin&amp;Sprit cost saving synergies, Melissa, you're correct. We had &#x20AC;40 million worth of cost savings still to generate. We think there are about 30 million going to take place in the current year and at the end of December, the favorable impact was about 15 million, so marginal compared with the Group's total results. But that's to be found partly in the production costs, in the gross margin and also in the structure costs, so broken up in those two items.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Trevor Stirling, Sanford Bernstein. Two questions, please. The first one the U.S. and the slight deterioration in depletions, would you care to give a bit more color? Do you think, is that due to brand weakness, to increased activity on promotions by your competitors, maybe a little bit more color around what do you think might be going on there? And the second thing, as you mentioned, about improving trends in Duty Free Korea, is that trends that are less negative or trends that have actually turned positive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second question the answer is very simple. I'm talking about positive trends, positive, yeah, that will be borne out, corroborated, for that we've seen from the start of the year onwards in this half. So that definitely is the answer on that, no doubt on that point. It's quite vibrant here at this turnaround.</p>
          <p>However, regarding the U.S. market, it's a whole variety of factors that we've seen. We weren't the only ones, that Thanksgiving wasn't as good as it might have been. Consumption overall is not running at a very buoyant level in the U.S. and this is a segment where trading down or down trading is very marked. So as I intimated, I think, on Absolut, Absolut have seen a trend at minus 5%, which is totally captured by the low cost brands. That's the ones selling at $10 a bottle something like that, retail price.</p>
          <p>So the best description I can give you of the situation in that market right now, so &#x2013; or as it has been. So there was no &#x2013; it's not stock movements or anything, I mean, for us, shipments equal depletions, that's our reasoning. We reflect the demand at consumer level. There's this mixture of down trading. And the rest now change and don't forget, is a brand which is really booming, booming with not just the extension of distribution outlets, but we're improving the rotation there, the turnaround, the roll over of stock and we've been making marketing investments of course in the brand. There is a new TV campaign that seems to really be bearing fruit very well, excellently.</p>
          <p>Glenlivet is more than just being resilient, plus three in positive trend, so all of that, in spite of the fact that it's a category that should be impacted by the down trading, Glenlivet has a very strong image and it's doing well. And Malibu, that had some difficult times in the previous year, in this half year, in terms of depletion, is positive. So there we do see that the marketing, if it's targeted, can in fact achieve quite a lot.</p>
          <p>And this MaliBoomBoom concept that we have, it's a digital concept. Fundamentally, it's not conventional media, it's digital, fundamentally and it's really in line with the target audience it's trying to reach. And I think the trend I indicated is quite encouraging there. We'll have to see if it's borne out of course in the coming few months, but it augurs well.</p>
          <p>So in terms of the market situation, well, it remains a difficult market over there, but nonetheless, there are examples of brands there that can fare very well and hold their own and even more than hold their own in that market. As I said, gentlemen, the Glenlivet, we can't say they are just standard brands. Far from it. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Laetitia Delaye from Kepler Capital Markets. I have a couple of questions, please. Firstly, you said that over the last 20, 25 years, when markets came out of crisis, there was a faster and stronger recovery for super and ultra premium brands. Now do you see the first signs of that happening now? And you think we're going to come out of the crisis in the same way as you have observed over the last 20 or 25 years? And secondly, could you tell us, please, what was the organic growth of the emerging countries for you in the first half, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the latter point, we said that, did we, Gilles, while, the organic growth in the emerging countries in the first half was 3%. 3% with a technical impact that was negative, because of the later Chinese New Year. So the underlying growth seems to me to be higher than that, of course. Mid single-digits, mid to high single-digits as we might say sometimes in English. Here is Mr. Pringuet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will see when we have the final figures in. But on the effect of coming out of the crisis faster and more strongly than other categories. Now, in countries that have come out of the crisis, we have seen premium brands and super premium brands in fact are developing very well. So, but I can't say when we'll come out of the crisis, of course, in Western Europe or in the U.S., when the downturn will start looking up. We just don't know yet. But the same cause to produce, same effect, there is no reason why it wouldn't happen in those markets for the premium brands when the time comes.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Nikolaas Faes from Exane BNP Paribas. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. I couldn't 100% follow your explanation on why A&amp;P in Asia was down so sharply, so could you try then for me? And then secondly, could you also tell me about how much of your sales and profits are now coming from China? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just to make sure there is no doubt about our marketing spend, our investments, we said quite clearly that we have a carryover in China, in respect of China, because of the later Chinese New Year. I mean, there was a carryover in time, I mean, because the Chinese New Year was later. It isn't that we dropped our A&amp;P expenditures, just that it took place a bit later because the Chinese New Year was happening later in China. And I mean, it's been done and we had a very active and intense program that was rolled out there, but a bit later than the previous time.</p>
          <p>And as Gilles said also, if we gauge this as a ratio of the revenues breakdown, so as a percentage of the revenues, if you look at the sales in India, they posted strong growth, our brands, Royal Stag, Imperial and so on. These are brands that we're structurally less invested in than the strategic key brands. The investment rate there is lesser for the Group if we &#x2013; the average investment is 17% of revenues, for the strategic brands, it's 23%. And you can do the sums yourselves to find the investment rate for the other brand. So there is that technical effect as well to do with the context of our sales, but there is no intrinsic underlying drop in the investment in marketing in Asia and we will see that when we publish the annual figures. Monsieur Bogaert?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the second question, we won't give you our profit in China, but what I can say is that China is nearly among the top three markets for us in terms of revenues. China is about to pass out Spain, about to overtake Spain and that's a substantial percentage of the Group's revenues. High single-digits, I suppose we could call it, really.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And it's a market, this is Mr. Pringuet, where our profitability rate is not different to the rest of the world, it's the same profitability ratio. So you can supplement Gilles' sentence then.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Jamie Isenwater from Deutsche Bank. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, just a couple of questions from me. First one, can you just remind us, Gilles, the total amount of receivables that have been factored now cumulatively? I think you've given the number for the half, but in total, I'd like that? And the second point, you talked again about rebalancing the amount of bank debt versus bonds. Your previous assets thought about 50:50 split. Has your view of that changed or is that the same sort of ratio we should be looking for? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding trade receivables in disposal, at the end of December, if we aggregate the figure, it is a bit more &#x20AC;600 million, so I would say that it's the uppermost level of the program. I would say at the end of December, the highest &#x2013; it was higher than the end of June because of the seasonal factors. Regarding financing, as we said, our objective by 2013 is to balance the bank debt and the bond debt. So that means moving as close as possible to a ratio that would be 50:50 or thereabouts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wondered if you can talk a little bit about Russia, I mean, you talked about an improvement in trend in the second quarter. Now where is that coming from? What categories and maybe at what price point you're seeing that recovery? Is it a lower price points than you were selling at pre-crisis?</p>
          <p>And then secondly going back to the U.S. market, I wonder if you could just sort of say something about how trading started from promotional standpoint in the third quarter? Have we seen a reduction in the very high levels of promotional activity in the industry as we've moved into what is a relatively quite period through January and February?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on Russia first, firstly, we sell mainly premium brands and super premium brands there. Our portfolio is not all focused on the standard, let's say, brands. And Russia is indeed a market that's extremely profitable. And the recovery in Russia, well, we can say it's largely started at the time when the &#x2013; took place last year.</p>
          <p>So we are starting to see in the second quarter I would even say around about November, December, we started to see that turning around. And everything at the moment points to consumption in Russia for our brands anyway picking up momentum going forward. That seems to be borne out by the data we have on the macroeconomic factors in the country. There seems to be a resumption, I mean, renewed confidence in the economy there.</p>
          <p>Now regarding the U.S. market, once again, I don't want to talk about our competitors or anything, but it would seem that the strategies, promotional strategies based on price have kind of reached their outer bounds and we never really entered that arena ourselves. We think that our approach to the market there is a correct one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. We talked about Russia picking up. Now there are signs that in the U.K., things are picking up as well I think, as well as Russia. Have you seen any indications that in the U.K., the economy is starting to recover more recently? And regarding Indian whisky brands, could you share with us please roughly the level of profitability of those Indian brands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the U.K., first, no is my answer. I don't see encouraging signs in the short-term. I'm sorry. I haven't seen any. Some brands doing fairly well, but I think it's too early days yet to talk about a recovery there. Don't know, maybe when bonuses are paid or something like that, people will start buying more, I don't know. But for the moment, I haven't seen signs of recovery, really. On the profitability of the Indian brands, Gilles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the Indian brands, lower profitability of course than the global brands. But having said that, we are talking about local brands that by and large premium brands and we invest less of course in marketing on those brands than is the case for global brands, so after the investments, our margin ratios there are fairly high, are high, lower than for the global brands, of course but fairly decent ones. There is no falling off or anything. It is not a ratio of one to two or anything in terms of the percentage of margin, there. No, no, no, they are doing &#x2013; doing very well.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Matthew Jordan from Matrix. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
          <p>Please hold on. We have a question from Mr. Thomas Russo from Gardner Russo. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
          <p>Please hold on. We have a question from Mr. Service Arik from ING. Sir, please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Service Arik, ING. Three questions, if I may. The first question is on your third quarter or your January, February recovery. Can you put that into a context versus what we have seen last year? Probably January, February were most terrible in the minus 12% third quarter organic decline. Are you fully recovering that or is that only a partial recovery that you are seeing?</p>
          <p>The second question is on your tax rate, still in the first half below 20% and can you give a guidance for the full year, because I expect already something above the 20% level? And the third question, that's on your interest rates and your caps and hedge rates. That is around 60%. What happens if in one year time, you're &#x2013; the &#x2013; on average, the interest rates short and long-term are 1% higher, what's then the impact on your interest line? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the trend for the start of the year this year, this calendar year, I'd just like to not comment on the revenues month-by-month, I won't go into that level of detail, or week-by-week, I am sorry. But overall, we can say that the trend we see looks very good. It's trending very well in January and February. And I would refer to our communication on our revenue figure for the third quarter, where we could perhaps dwell a bit more on the comparisons compared with last year and the previous year, maybe you can't see on the webcast, but I'm smiling and I'm very happy about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can ask &#x2013; this is Gilles, is that last year, what we said is that in the 12% drop, two-thirds were due to depletions and one-third &#x2013; well, I mean, it was the rest so &#x2013; depletion was a lot there, it was two-thirds, but it won't happen again.</p>
          <p>It doesn't mean that we are going to restock either. But the tax rate, the effective tax rate, well, we said in September and we reiterate that the effective current tax rate for this year should be between 21 or 22% or so, increased compared with the end of December rate, but given the trend in our mix, in our results country-by-country, that should &#x2013; it should level out at that.</p>
          <p>On the interest rates, I would say, I think you've got &#x2013; you also have to do some analysis yourself. We've got one-third of our debt that's at a floating rate at the moment and floating rate, that means it's short-term financing, one to three months, short-term.</p>
          <p>And given our margin ratios, we obtained financing for that part of the debt at 2% currently, knowing that for the whole of the debt, in the first half it's 4.15%. So there is &#x2013; I mean, if there were to be a change in the rate in that part of the debt. It would have an impact, of course. But having said that, that's part of our daily job to hedge against interest rate changes.</p>
