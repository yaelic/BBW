          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is EADS Nine Months Earnings 2010 Conference Call. Hans-Peter Ring, our CFO will be presenting our results and answering your questions. The call is planned to last a bit less than one hour and we will conclude around 12 Continental Time. This includes Q&amp;A, which we will conduct after the initial presentation. It is also webcast to access on our homepage with set of special banner for nine months earnings 2010.</p>
          <p>Playback of this call will also be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicated phone replay service. The supporting information package was emailed to you this early morning with slides, which we will now go through and financial statements.</p>
          <p>Throughout this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contained a Safe Harbor statement, which applies to this call as well. We believe you should read it carefully.</p>
          <p>Now, to Hans-Peter Ring.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nathalie, and welcome. Good morning to everybody to today's call. I think we can be efficient today because a lot of you will meet us in a few days in Toulouse. So let's right jump into the presentation. So I will present our nine months results to you with our main business highlights, as well as some observations about the current market environment and our strong delivery pattern throughout 2010.</p>
          <p>Thanks to good work of our teams, we are heading towards another record delivery year in our commercial aircraft business, and also deliver on our other businesses. After a close look at our Safe Harbor statement on the next page, on page two. Let's go straight to page four and let's begin with our Group Highlights.</p>
          <p>We continue to see clear signs of improvement in the commercial aircraft environment in both passenger and freight markets. This is confirmed by the net order intake of 328 aircraft, more than double the nine-month 2009 level. It includes a strong increase in wide-body orders.</p>
          <p>Delivery and backlog levels confirm this uplift in commercial aircraft momentum and consequently we are raising our long range production rates to nine aircraft per month from the first quarter 2011 onwards. Although the order intake in our helicopter business is also above the nine months 2009 level, we do not see the same recovery in this market due to the high level of second half helicopters on the market being more than much more than double of what it was before the crisis.</p>
          <p>Our strong delivery pattern continues. 380 commercial aircraft were delivered to customers in the first nine months, as well as 367 helicopters. In the same &#x2013; in the third quarter, Ariane 5 recorded its 38th consecutive launch success for Astrium.</p>
          <p>We have concluded negotiations on the overall A400M discussions. Negotiation on the Export Levy Facility scheme is expected to be finalized before the end of the year. Once parliamentary approvals have been obtained, the agreement will be binding.</p>
          <p>The 2009 A400M provision calculation remains valid. In the meantime, the A400M test flight program is progressing better than expected. The ultimate load campaign is completed with the static specimen and the fourth aircraft will join the flight test campaign before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>A brief comment on our net cash position before we move to the financials in more detail on page six. Cash generation is better than expected over nine months at a positive &#x20AC;800 million, with no significant investment in customer financing, and I think that's good news. Reported net income for the nine months was &#x20AC;198 million.</p>
          <p>If we then move on to the financial highlights on slide six. The nine-month financial highlights demonstrate revenue growth of around 6% when compared to the same period last year. The growth comes from both volume and mix effects across our core businesses, which more than offset a negative foreign exchange impact of around &#x20AC;600 million.</p>
          <p>The percentage of completion methodology was resumed on the A400M program based on the allocation of internal milestones. This has resulted in revenues of around &#x20AC;500 million being booked on the program with zero margin, due to the associated provision utilization.</p>
          <p>The EBIT before one-off stands at around &#x20AC;830 million for EADS and around &#x20AC;280 million for Airbus, it benefited from good performance in Airbus legacy programs and our core business activities in other divisions. Compared to '09, EBIT before one-off was mainly weighed down by the deterioration of hedge rates of about 0.8 billion and higher R&amp;D of about 0.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Gross order intake of 379 aircraft for the nine months was significantly above the 2009 level, driven by the higher level of commercial aircraft orders at Airbus. Net orders of 328 aircraft include 32 380s and 53 A350XWB.</p>
          <p>Our order book stands at a robust &#x20AC;426 billion, mainly reflecting increases at Airbus Industrial. The Airbus Commercial backlog benefited from a positive revaluation impact of around &#x20AC;18 billion due to the U.S. dollar closing spot rate that has strengthened since year end.</p>
          <p>Slide seven shows the underlying performance of the business. The EBIT before one-off margin is at 2.6% on a Group level. As expected, the underlying performance of the single-aisle and long range aircraft at Airbus is weighed down by A380 by roughly the same amount as last year.</p>
          <p>In Eurocopter, roughly &#x20AC;70 million of negative one-time effects weigh on the underlying performance in the nine months 2010 as in H1. So there is no change to the first half. A program charge and margin adjustment of around &#x20AC;50 million has been booked against the NH90, reflecting the continued technical complexity on the program.</p>
          <p>A restructuring charge of &#x20AC;40 million resulting from the implementation of SHAPE, as well as a positive impact from the recognition of a technical milestone on the Korean Utility Helicopter program are further one-time effects.</p>
          <p>At Airbus, the PDP mismatch and balance sheet revaluation had a negative impact on our results by around 10 million to the end of September, so very low. The revaluation of our loss-making contract provision in the nine months has a net impact of zero.</p>
          <p>Up to slide eight, now. R&amp;D rose versus last year driven by increases at Airbus due to a ramp-up in A350 activity and increasing product investment in Cassidian for the UAV and Systems businesses, as well as in Eurocopter across the product range. The interest result mainly reflects the decline in interest rates on the financial markets. A large part of this line is related to interest for refundable launch investments.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the other financial result improved considerably by &#x20AC;250 million year-on-year due to the positive revaluation of our U.S. dollar and British pound cash assets, and the revaluation of financial instruments.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter '010, we completed restructuring of the options put in place during the summer of 2008. We have continued to implement some new options into our hedge portfolio in the third quarter. Going forward, we can expect further effects in the other financial result from the revaluation of those option premiums paid. This line also includes the unwinding of discounted provisions. The tax rate for the year 2010 is 32% as expected.</p>
          <p>On to the hedging portfolio update on slide nine. During the third quarter, we have continued to hedge at a healthy pace. During the first nine months of the year we have taken advantage of the strengthening U.S. dollar by implementing $25 billion of new hedge contracts at an average rate of $1.33 versus euro without collateralization. Over the same period $13.3 billion of forward contracts matured at a rate of 1.35. Our hedge book increased from $60.8 billion at the end of 2009 to 71.8 billion at the end of September 2010.</p>
          <p>During the second and third quarter 2010, EADS invested in foreign exchange options, as well as forward contracts. Options consume less hedging capacity while allowing for a potential upside from more favorable market rates.</p>
          <p>As our net exposure is hedged for the next two years, we are slowing down the pace of our hedging activity, reducing the overall size of our hedge portfolio overtime. This should enable us to increase our level of flexibility and to control the hedging capacity with banks in the forward market. Quarterly rates for 2010 are provided on page 26, as you know, we suffer significantly this year from hedge rate deterioration.</p>
          <p>Up to cash flow now on slide 10. Free cash flow for the nine months has benefited from good commercial order intake, a high volume of commercial deliveries, including 14 A380s, as well as favorable phasing and receipts from governments for development programs that roughly compensate payment delays.</p>
          <p>At Airbus, inventories remained roughly stable in the first nine months. The improvement in the third quarter is driven by the higher number of A380 deliveries. The nine months 2009 included a ramp-up on the A380, but a low level of A380 deliveries as well as a mismatch between production and delivery rates for both single-aisle and long range aircraft.</p>
          <p>The inflow of advances linked to Airbus Commercial activity is higher than one year ago, reflecting the increase in deliveries and commercial aircraft orders. This is more than offset by lower advance payments from Astrium and Cassidian.</p>
          <p>The net customer financing outflow is lower than expected in the nine months with around &#x20AC;90 million, due to a combination of appetite from lessors and banking market recovery. The third quarter included the sell down of three A320 operating leases.</p>
          <p>Investing activities consumed around &#x20AC;1.3 billion, reflecting an increase in capital expenditure, mainly as investment ramp ups on the A350 program. The 2009 figure included a cash inflow from the sale of certain aerostructures last year.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure is expected to ramp-up significantly in the third &#x2013; in the last quarter to reach &#x20AC;2.3 billion by the end of the year. This year the Board has decided on a cash contribution to pension assets of &#x20AC;300 million which is already done.</p>
          <p>Now, I will talk you through the performance of the Airbus Division in more detail and that will start on page 12. Airbus delivered good commercial results in nine months 2010. 328 net firm commercial orders were booked, as already said, including orders for 32 additional A380s and 53 A350s bringing the A350 order total to 558 aircraft. The new orders demonstrate continuing appetite for growth in emerging countries and a market return by the leasing companies.</p>
          <p>380 aircraft were delivered at Airbus Commercial to the end of September, including 14 A380s. With seven A380 delivered in the third quarter, we are on track to deliver the 20 this year. As expected, the program is stabilizing and we are making progress on the learning curve.</p>
          <p>The Commercial backlog stands at 3,436 aircraft or &#x20AC;358 billion. The order book benefited from a positive valuation impact of around &#x20AC;18 billion, due to the strengthening value of the U.S. dollar against the euro at the end of September versus December 2009.</p>
          <p>Production on the A350XWB program is moving forward. In the third quarter, manufacturing commenced for the upper wing cover, the lower wing cover and the center wing box. The landing gear systems test facility was also opened during the year. The development of the program is still challenging. We are considering an entry into service in H2 2013, and at this stage we would expect to manage this without significant financial impact.</p>
          <p>On A320 NEO, the assessment is ongoing and decision should be made before the end of the year. Airbus Military booked orders for nine aircraft in the third quarter, eight CN235s for France and one 295 for Finland, bringing the order total to 11 for the nine months, 13 deliveries were made by the end of September.</p>
          <p>At Airbus Military, as we have said the A400M test program continues to advance. Considerable progress has been made in the Tanker business. The A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport aircraft has obtained military certification from Spanish authorities, paving the way for the first delivery to the Royal Australian Air Force. A successful first flight for the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft, FSTA, for the British Air Force was conducted in September.</p>
          <p>Up to slide 13. Compared to a year ago, Airbus Commercial revenues reflect the favorable volume and mix effect, which includes a higher number of A380 deliveries. The negative impact on revenues from foreign exchange is around &#x20AC;600 million.</p>
          <p>Two single-aisle and two A330-200 aircraft were delivered under the operating lease in the nine months and thus do not count for revenue recognition and margin recognition. Three of the five single-aisle aircraft delivered under operating lease in H1 have now been sold down to the market, triggering revenue and margin recognition in this quarter and bringing the total deliveries to 131 aircraft for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The reduction in Airbus Commercial EBIT is driven by the negative impact from foreign exchange effects of around &#x20AC;0.5 billion. The favorable impact from higher volumes, favorable mix, price improvement and cost savings was reduced by higher R&amp;D, non-series costs which include a less favorable phasing effect compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>The A380 continues to weigh on underlying performance in line with last year as expected.</p>
          <p>Airbus Military revenues were lower compared to 2009. They benefited from higher revenue recognition for A400M, but lower revenues in Tankers and Medium and Light were recognized. Consistent with the return to the percentage of completion methodology, the internal milestones passed during 2010 have triggered revenues of around &#x20AC;500 million for the A400M, compared to &#x20AC;400 million last year.</p>
          <p>Airbus Military EBIT reflects good underlying military aircraft business activity. On the A400M program 2010 related losses reflect a negative currency effect and the under recovery of fixed costs.</p>
          <p>Now we will pass on to Eurocopter on slide 14. Eurocopter has seen the start of a positive trend of bookings and cancellations versus 2009, but recovery in the civil market is still slow, in particular due to the number of helicopters available for sale on the second-hand market. Eurocopter has proactively started to adapt to this challenge by launching its SHAPE program in April. Good progress has been made so far on the reduction of temporary workforce and overheads staff.</p>
          <p>Net orders reached 230 in the nine months, contracts booked in the third quarter include 12 EC725 for Malaysia MOD. The cancellation trend is slowing with 38 cancellations to the end of September compared to 79 for the same period last year. 367 helicopters were delivered in the nine months. Significant progress was made on the NH90 with 10 deliveries in the third quarter. Revenues also reflect a favorable mix from higher support activity and milestone progress on the Korean Utility Helicopter, but are weighed down by lower deliveries on commercial helicopters.</p>
          <p>EBIT declined 27%, compared to the 2009 level, driven by a charge and margin adjustment on the NH90 program and a restructuring charge, as well as higher product investment. A positive one-time effect was booked linked to a technical milestone on the KUH program.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter has successfully performed the first flight of its X3 technology demonstrator opening new long-term perspectives to customers looking for long range and high speed. And you probably have seen the pictures in the press.</p>
          <p>Astrium now on page 15. In the first nine months, revenues reflect positive volume effects across core businesses driven by a strong delivery pattern. The 38th consecutive successful Ariane 5 launch was achieved in the third quarter, as well as the launch of the ALSAT-2A earth observation satellite for the Algerian Space Agency, the first from Astrium's AstroSat-100 product line based on a micro satellite platform jointly developed with CNES.</p>
          <p>The M51 Acceptance Launch was carried out successfully. The volume growth compensates the one-time catch-up effect for in-orbit incentive schemes booked in 2009 of around &#x20AC;200 million. EBIT reflects growth and productivity in military and institutional activities, partly offset by lower activity in navigation satellites and earth observation services.</p>
          <p>Order intake for the nine months reached &#x20AC;3.8 billion, which reflects continued order momentum for both commercial and institutional customers so far despite increasing competition across all business segments. New orders booked in the quarter include the M51.2 contract award from the French DGA.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; on now to Cassidian on the next slide. Revenues have increased by 5% versus the nine months 2009, reflecting higher volume from core and export in Eurofighter and in Missile programs.</p>
          <p>EBIT reflects margin growth in mature programs that is more than outweighed by significant growth in self-funded R&amp;D. Investment is focused mainly on UAV and secure communication. The successful test campaign of the Barracuda UAV demonstrator is proving our strong capabilities in the field of unmanned aerial systems.</p>
          <p>We continue to investigate requirements and funding solutions for Talarion with customers. We are stressing the need for a timely commitment to the program by governments. Looking forward, revenues in Cassidian should be stable. There should be a limited impact on EBIT resulting from higher R&amp;D, a less favorable mix and government budget constraints.</p>
          <p>The order book of &#x20AC;7.8 billion is solid, order intake for the nine months reached &#x20AC;2.6 billion. Cassidian acquired U.K. based Regency IT Consulting thereby strengthening its capabilities in the cyber security market.</p>
          <p>In missiles, the MEADS final system Critical Design Review has been completed, while in electronics development of a new Active Electronic Scanned Array radar system has begun, which will improve the Eurofighter export potential.</p>
          <p>Now on to the other businesses on slide 17. Revenues increased by 11% in other businesses compared to the first nine months '09, driven by a higher number of deliveries at ATR and the ramp-up in LUH deliveries at EADS North America.</p>
          <p>EBIT was negative at the end of September, as the positive contribution from Sogerma was offset by a negative FX impact at ATR. At ATR, the market and financing environments are improving, 63 firm orders and 33 options were booked at the end of September. ATR delivered 35 aircraft, compared to 30 in the first nine months of 2009. The 2010 delivery outlook remains stable with lower production rate as expected.</p>
          <p>Now I will comment on our guidance and that is on page 19. Our guidance is based on an assumption of &#x20AC;1 equals $1.35 for Q4 2010, average rate and year-end closing rate. In 2010, Airbus gross orders should be up to 500, thanks to the commercial aircraft upturn and aircraft deliveries or Airbus deliveries should be slightly more than 500. EADS revenues should be more than 44 billion, a slightly more than 500 deliveries EADS confirms EBIT before one-off guidance at around 1.2 billion. Going forward, the EBIT performance of EADS will be dependent on the Group's ability to execute on the A400M, A380, A350 programs in line with the commitments made to customers.</p>
          <p>At a dollar rate of $1.35 EADS increases EBIT guidance to at least &#x20AC;1.1 billion. EADS is also increasing its free cash flow guidance, provided a sustainable year-end cash inflow of institutional and government business, the free cash flow before customer financing should be around 1 billion and free cash flow after customer financing should be above 800 million, compared to the previously expected free cash outflow of minus 600 million on customer financing.</p>
          <p>So, I think, it is fair to say that EADS has entered the last quarter of 2010 in sound condition and with good prospects for the coming year. The further strengthening of our cash position, which Standard &amp; Poor's characterizes as being exceptional is a key asset for our development. This gives us quite a bit of flexibility for any investment actions. The earnings picture remains in line with our past projections. Yet the trend is one of positive forward momentum as commercial sales grow. We know we need to improve profitability. Looking forward beyond 2011, the upturn in the commercial aircraft business should drive profitability improvement of the Group.</p>
          <p>In the mid-term, at the current exchange rates Airbus should significantly improve its underlying profitability, thanks to better volume and pricing and further economic improvement of the A380 performance. Next week, we will have a change or a chance to go into the business evolution of our businesses a little bit more in detail at our Global Investor Forum and we are very much looking forward to seeing a lot of you there.</p>
          <p>And now, I think it's time to take your questions.</p>

          <p>We now start our Q&amp;A time. Please introduce yourself and your company when asking a question. Please limit yourself to two questions at a time. And we will try to satisfy everyone's compulsion to take part in this short session. Also as usual, please remember to speak clearly and slowly to help all participants particularly ourselves understand what you're asking. So, Heike, please go ahead and explain the procedure for the participants.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Olivier Brochet from Exane in France. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Hans-Peter and Nathalie, I have indeed two questions? The first one is very simply an update on the outlook for the R&amp;D budget for Airbus and the Group for 2010 and the year after. And second is on the A350, if we could have more color on the reasons behind the delay of the entry in service date, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, let's start with your first question, on R&amp;D. So, on R&amp;D for this year, I mean, not a lot has changed. So, the outlook is around 2.9 billion and out of this, we have a bit more than 2.2 billion coming from Airbus. Now for the following years 2011, '12, so far we were giving you a bracket of between 2.8 and 3 billion. We have not concluded on our operating planning yet. But as of today, we would expect that we are rather at the higher end of the bracket or probably a little bit above. So, it means, R&amp;D levels would probably for 2011 and also 2012, a bit higher than we have said so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, slight above 3 billion for both 2011, 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't give you a more precise figure today...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>... because as I said, we are not yet at the end of the planning procedure, but dependancy goes into this direction. And that is also valid for Airbus by the way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if we then come to your other question on A350. We are, if you like we are more cautious here. We want to be transparent with all of you about the challenges which have to be mentioned -- managed. So, and so far, we say it will be the second half. So, it will be somewhere, certainly, I wouldn't say July, because July was probably the envisaged date so far or around July, so it will be a bit later and we are not more specific at this point. But within the current bracket second half of 2013, we can manage, we think the program with in the current frame, obviously challenges are behind that and need to be and mitigation actions need to be found.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But can you be more precise on the reasons behind the slippage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that the major reason is certainly that the transition phase from design to manufacturing is a bit longer. And this has a &#x2013; I would say a second reason behind, because what we want to achieve is a robust design for the manufacturing. So, we take here a little bit more time to get a solid base or more solid base for the manufacturing, if you like, that is the current status. And certainly you will hear a lot more, if you are there next week, on our forum in Toulouse, where we have an extensive presentation and also Q&amp;A on that subject.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Good morning. And I have two questions as well. The first one is, if you could give us a little more of a sense on how you're thinking about the re-engining decision, and I know you're not going to make something formal by the end of the year, but some of the things that you are considering in that, I know resource availability has been very important. So, perhaps if you could give us a little more insight into how you're thinking about this decision process?</p>
          <p>And then second, could you talk about acquisitions? And I know, you've discussed the potential to do acquisitions in the U.S. on the defense side. But could you describe a little bit about the types of assets you might be looking for in terms of size or market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So let's start with NEO. We &#x2013; I mean, we said recently, Doug, as you know, we want to conclude on the decision by the end of the year. It's not a magic date, but that's the current plan. And indeed, behind that is the struggle with the resources over the next years, so the trade-off between the different programs and the question, can we secure 350, 400M and all the other programs in our program portfolio. Can we secure them and do the NEO on top? This is a question which turns &#x2013; turned out to be more difficult and I mean what it shows, I mean the delayed decision on that, is that we are very serious about this question, so, we really dig.</p>
          <p>And Tom with his team is digging deeply into the subject, and really wants to make sure that there are no problems afterwards. That is the reason for the delay and nothing else for delay, I mean for the December date. This is the reason, so nothing new on that. I think, at least, nothing dramatically new. Acquisitions, we will have &#x2013; again I don't know, Doug, whether you will join the forum next week. Marwan Lahoud will have a presentation talking about also this subject in a little bit more detail. I mean, given the cash position we have reached now. We certainly think that it can be also obviously sizable transactions.</p>
          <p>So, it's certainly in an order of magnitude of a billion, but there is &#x2013; again, there is no magic number. We have certainly headroom, given our current rating. We have &#x2013; as you have seen, we got the rating upgrades by Standard &amp; Poor's. So, in so far, I think the headroom has increased, and we are looking to the segments we have mentioned. Obviously, we have number of targets on our list, some are not for sale, unfortunately, sometimes at this point at least. Some others, there are discussions ongoing, and I wouldn't give you any concrete outlook when we might conclude on something, but we are certainly more concentrating, even more concentrating, on that question now then we have done in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can on the A320, when you talk about the R&amp;D numbers or talked about the R&amp;D numbers before, are those assuming a re-engine or are those without that in them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, in the near-term, the 320, that means '11. The 320 re-engine would not have such a big impact. It would start then in the years after. At this point, as I said, the plan is not ready yet, so it's still a discussion point. And that's the reason why I need some flexibility here, and in so far, I come back to that with our formal guidance for 2011, Doug, if you allow.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Rupinder Vig from Morgan Stanley, U.K. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, Hans-Peter and Nathalie. I've got two questions as well. The first one, sorry to go back to A350 again, but could you perhaps just give us a bit more color as to how &#x2013; why you're confident that the most recent slippage you've announced, which is very small, won't escalate further? I guess investors will be looking at the situation with the Boeing 787 and just wondering why that doesn't translate across. So any color you can give us there would be helpful as to why you're confident that it can enter service in 2013?</p>
          <p>And then a second question around something you said before, Hans-Peter. You said that in the medium-term, you can significantly improve underlying performance. Can you just kind of quantify that a little bit more for us? I mean, what does that mean in terms of margins, et cetera? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rupi, thank you for your questions. First, A350 and confidence that we can achieve that program within the frame I've mentioned. Again, I can just say if you want to get a feel, a better feel you talk to our operational guys next week. So, Fabrice will be there, and will show you the achievements we have on the program so far, which I think are pretty impressive.</p>
          <p>So, if you look to what physically was done in the meantime, that we have started to produce the wing covers and the wing box and all the really critical and big parts of the aircraft, I think that's actually not bad. So we are currently, more or less, with some deviation, we are sticking to the program. And again, I mean, you will see physically also a little bit more next week in Toulouse, if you are there, and you get, I would say, a better feel probably, as I said, from our operational guys Tom and Fabrice and probably some others.</p>
          <p>On mid-term, I'm sorry that I will not give you now precise numbers on what it might mean, but it's clear that at current dollar levels, there should be significant improvement of Airbus margins over the medium-term. We always said that 2011 is going to be another similarly difficult year than we have in 2010. So don't expect big jumps next year, please, but for the years after, there will be bigger steps in the underlying profitability of Airbus. But also, we should not always look only at Airbus, we also see improvements, for example, in Eurocopter. They are coming back based on our current market expectation. We would see recovery in Eurocopter.</p>
          <p>So, all the forecasters see the commercial helicopter market coming back in 2012 and the following years. Astrium has a very &#x2013; I would say a pretty stable growth path. There are no big steps, but this is continuously year-over-year. We have now &#x2013; over the last six or seven years, we have delivered and have had improvement of margins and profits. And Cassidian, our defense business, there we have probably a discussion or we are sensitive, obviously, to the development of the government budgets. This is one point where, to be honest, we today cannot fully envisage what this might mean, so not all of the governments are yet specific.</p>
          <p>We see already some impact coming into the more short-term contracting on, for example, their MRO activities. So if you retire a Tornado fleet, for example, partly or fully, then obviously you lose that kind of business. So we see some smaller impacts probably already for next year, but what it means really for the big programs is unclear today.</p>
          <p>But still we see global revenue growth also in the defense business, particularly in the security area, where obviously we will need some cautiousness at the beginning in terms of, I would say, learning curve and in terms of understanding the business, margin trading, et cetera. But over the medium-term, also in defense, we certainly think we can do margins we have seen in defense and we will see this year, which are around 8% and probably even beyond. So these are currently, in I would say broad view, the mid-term expectations.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Harry Breach from Barclays Capital, U.K. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Can you hear me Hans-Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can hear you well, Harry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello, hello. Hello, Nathalie. From me, my two questions are these. Firstly, when we look at the A350, can you tell us to what degree the move in the entry into service date reflects you rebuilding margin in your schedule, rebuilding contingency, and to what extent it just reflects the schedule moving to the right, shall we say, without any improvement in the contingency?</p>
          <p>My second question relates to the A380 program. Will there be any delay in delivery of Trent 900 powered A380s due to the recent events on that, or are you currently continuing to deliver on schedule with those and do you expect that to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the last one, it's due to the ongoing development, not yet fully clear what it means, to be honest. Currently, in our expectation, we still think we can do the 20 aircraft. We still have to deliver four aircraft to reach that, three of which have Trent engines. So this is, I would say, what needs to be managed until the end of the year, and there certainly we cannot exclude that there is risk at this point.</p>
          <p>But normally, contract wise, it should be possible to deliver. But obviously, we will have a constructive dialogue with the airlines, to manage the current situation, and that, by the way, is also valid for next year. So at this point, we don't really see exactly what it means, because if you have seen the Rolls Royce release of this morning, they are obviously working on solutions. And the question is &#x2013; so replacement of the relevant modules.</p>
          <p>So the question is how quickly they will deliver those modules. We don't have plans for that yet and so far there is some kind of uncertainty next year, as well. What we have next year is roughly a 50/50 split between the two engine manufacturers, so that gives you a little bit probably the risk. But currently, I mean, if everything goes well and we are able to retrofit the engines to manage, I would say, all the very short or rather short maintenance in the works we have currently, and have enough spare engines, I think if that is given, I think we still might reach the targets. But as I said, I mean, this is a very recent development, and it is managed really on a daily or hourly basis, nearly, currently, and insofar I think we need to wait.</p>
          <p>And then, on A350, and I think the question was will we use it, what we just said before, will we use it to rebuild margins. I mean, certainly we will try to, Harry. I cannot commit that we will, I would say, rebuild significant margins here but it has to be managed globally, really, on the technical, on the commercial, on all fronts, and certainly, we have still time. I mean, we are three years ahead of the first deliveries, around three years, so that's a lot of time to go. But what we wanted really to do here is to be really transparent about the challenges as they have to be managed. So we could probably have said also we are broadly in line with the previous commitment, but we have challenges and we want to discuss them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify Hans-Peter, does that mean that there is no formal change to the schedule you've notified to customers for first delivery, but you are just being a little bit more cautious with us, or there has been a formal change in the schedule communicated to customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are &#x2013; I think, I mean with the customer side, we &#x2013; I mean the technical delivery dates were not the same as the customer commitment dates. So, insofar, this is a little bit of margin but that is the only thing I can say today, Harry. I mean, we try to manage that on all front. As I said, we try to find mitigation actions, and we try to stick to something which is within the current frame, overall frame of the program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Ben Fidler from Deutsche Bank, U.K. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. First question is just on your delivery guidance, the increase to that seems pretty marginal in the context of looking at the end of October data, which shows that I think you've delivered 18 more aircraft year-on-year? Are you just being conservative or is there something that I'm missing about the rate of deliveries in November and December? But it would strike me that slightly more than 500, you should be able to do better than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think we are &#x2013; we have a less strong quarter in terms of deliveries than we had last year, certainly. It's not a question of being conservative. It's a question of the outstanding delivery program, Ben, and I mean it's the expectation I would say. There is upside, which is possible, certainly. But it's not only depending on us, it's also depending on customers. So, you need to give us a little bit of flexibility here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question I had was just, if you don't deliver those three Trent-engined A380s, just to understand from a pure accounting issue, will that be positive for your 2010 earnings, in that loss-making aircraft go into inventory rather than run to the P&amp;L statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It wouldn't change the earnings, but it would impact the cash flow, obviously, because of inventories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One more final one, if I could squeeze it in. On wide-body production rates, can I just clarify, when you talk about the nine a month, are you talking just 330 or do you include the 350 in that, which will then be in production by 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just 330, Ben. It's not 350 which is included here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Edward Stacey from Execution U.K. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, two questions. Firstly, on the cash flow, I'm really trying to get an idea what has changed in the last three months to change the outlook quite as much as it has. And in particular, I'm sorry if I missed this if you said it before, but the A320 operating leases sell-down, is that a big factor in terms of what's changed?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, on Airbus military and the change back to percentage of completion, and it looks like there was a big contribution in Q3 from Airbus military. Is that something &#x2013; are we going to see a steady run rate now of kind of meaningful contributions from Airbus military in your guidance for this year and next year? And in 2010, would that mean that if you hadn't had this accounting change, you wouldn't be on course to meet the original guidance, if you see what I mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not completely, Ed, but I'll try to give you some flavor probably on cash flow. I think the good development on cash flow is certainly that the pre-delivery payments are robust, probably more robust than we thought. Inventory levels are coming down, particularly in Airbus. It's on one side related to the good delivery performance, particularly on A380, but also due to Power8 cash saving actions. So, I think on the cash side this is really delivering results.</p>
          <p>The same in Eurocopter, Eurocopter also has seen better inventory development than foreseen. So also there we are working on a &#x2013; on a program, so, this is one side of the story. Then on the customer financing, we had some fell downs. Yes, three aircrafts is not, not such a huge number honestly, but it just shows that on this part of the cash flow, we are using much less of our own capacity than we thought, and as I said it confirms that banking and also leasing markets are back and take on the delivery commitments we have with our customers.</p>
          <p>So, on the Airbus military part, yes, there was some contribution from the underlying activity on Airbus military, and there was on top of this an FX move in 2009 in Q3 on the LMC of A400M of around &#x20AC;120 million. So if you compare the two years obviously there is a big step here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to focus a little bit on the A380, the significant cost still that you have, and what I wanted to know, please, was how does the year-on-year look like on that i.e. the first nine months cost that you've incurred this year versus what you incurred in 2009? Was there a big difference? Was there a big reduction in those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Its pretty stable, Zafar. No big change.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you going to see some positive development there in the next 18 months or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in the next 12 months. In 2012, yes, there will be significant steps following &#x2013; including 2012 and the following year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on the A350. Obviously, one of the big issues that Boeing have faced with the 787 has been the level of outsourcing that they did on that program. Could you just please tell us how the outsourcing on the A350 compares with the position on the A380?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first, the level of outsourcing is lower than on the Boeing side, and now, I am talking particularly about more the aerostructures part of this, because that seems to be the big topic now. In our two subsidiaries we carved out, Aerolia and Premium AEROTEC, we are -and in our facilities in the U.K, we are building a big part of all the composite parts.</p>
          <p>And I think that probably should be an advantage, because first of all obviously you manage it yourself. The level of transparency is much better, and I would say the reaction potential insofar is much better, if there would be anything. So in so far, we would think from that side we have a different set-up than you see it on the side of Boeing, where obviously the big trouble is with some of the suppliers, if I understand well what is written in the press. So, insofar, we think it is better under control at this point, certainly. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just wondered, I guess it's going to be more than you outsourced on the A380, but you don't have any numbers on that?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
