          <p>Welcome to the Barclays 2012 Full Year Results Fixed Income Investor Conference Call. I will now hand you over to Chris Lucas, Group Finance Director.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for joining our very first Fixed Income Results Call. We plan to make this a regular feature at the full and half year so we can address relevant topics for fixed income investors in more detail and provide further insight into our thinking on the key issues at Barclays. I'm here with our Group Treasurer, Benoit de Vitry. I'll make a brief introduction and then hand over to Benoit. Together we'll talk for about 15 minutes then we'll move on to questions where we'll be joined by a number of people: by [Carlo Tenucci], who's responsible for funding and liquidity management; Jennifer Moreland, Managing Director within our Treasury Execution Services team; and Rupert Fowden, co-head of Capital and Balance Sheet Management.</p>
          <p>As you know, we announced our 2012 financial results yesterday and Antony Jenkins set out our plans to become the go to bank. This included the criteria against which we expect to be judged and the specific commitments you can hold us accountable for. More details can be found on our investor relations website.</p>
          <p>I'd like to start by briefly summarizing our 2012 results. On an adjusted basis, profits increased to &#xA3;7 billion. Adjustments to the statuary numbers include a &#xA3;4.6 billion charge on own credit, a provision for PPI of &#xA3;1.6 billion, an &#xA3;850 million charge for address on interest rate hedges and again on BlackRock. As a result, statuary profits were &#xA3;246 million. Our core tier one ratio at the end of 2012 was 10.9% on a Basel 2.5 basis. Our total capital ratio was 17.1% and risk weighted assets were slightly down at &#xA3;387 billion.</p>
          <p>On the basis of adjusted profit, the business has generated capital of &#xA3;1.6 billion under CRD IV definitions. This represents a 35 to 40 basis point increase in our common equity tier one ratio. We're also starting to see the resolution of legacy issues and we do not expect anything of the magnitude of PPI to affect us going forward. You've heard us say before that Barclay's financial strength remains a source of competitive advantage. Maintaining this strength is central to how we run the business and you should not expect this focus to change.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Benoit to talk in more detail about funding, capital, balance sheet, and liquidity management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Chris. As this is our first fixed income results call, I would like to start by saying something about how Barclays Treasury has changed over the last 18 months. We have made a number of changes in order to create a single treasury function across the group. Our goal has been to create a function that takes a holistic view of the needs of the group, and that implements cohesive capital, balance sheet funding and liquidity plans for the benefit of all our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of these changes, decisions are made in a tighter, controlled environment where commercial opportunities are identified in partnership with the business. We have a forward-looking approach to managing the impact of regulatory change that allows us to identify pressure points quickly and better mitigate any potential impact. As a result, we are better able to address the fundamental challenges currently facing the banking sector. Let me discuss each in turn, starting with funding, then capital and balance sheet, and liquidity before commencing on the regulatory environment.</p>
          <p>During the last 18 months of heightened market volatility, Barclays has been successful in consistently accessing both short-term and long-term funding at highly competitive rates and in all major currencies. We have at no point had to stress our key funding or liquidity metrics. We have been strategically reducing our wholesale funding requirements and reducing our reliance on short-term money market funds. And our loan-to-deposit ratio has reduced in 2012 to 110% from 118% last year.</p>
          <p>Our approach to funding remains unchanged. Retail and business banking, corporate, and wealth and investment management activities continue to be largely funded with customer deposits. The loan-to-deposit ratio of these businesses is 102%. The loan-to-deposit and secure funding ratio is 88%.</p>
          <p>The investment bank principally funds itself with wholesale debt. At the end 2012, our total wholesale funding outstanding, excluding repos, was &#xA3;240 billion. 42% of this funding matures in less than one year. We expect this proportion to be broadly stable throughout 2015, albeit on lower outstanding volumes.</p>
          <p>Over the last 18 months, our proportion of secured funding relative to unsecured has increased as we've utilized assets for diversity of funding and cost management purposes. Our encumbrance on customer loans and advances is currently 17%. We think that encumbrance levels up to 25% have a benefit for all bond holders in terms of funding costs and stability. However, we do not plan to be much above 25% by 2015.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact of our &#xA3;150 billion liquidity pool, our outstanding wholesale funding has a weighted average maturity of 61 months. We expect this number to reduce slightly over the next three years as we rebalance the behavioral duration of our assets and liabilities. Lower levels of unsecured wholesale financing and greater emphasis on customer deposits and also secured financing will reduce funding costs at nearly by about &#xA3;400 million to &#xA3;450 million by 2015, that based on current market conditions. For our other funding needs, we are committed to maintain a highly diversified funding by product, currency, geography, jurisdictions and investor base in order to maintain our financial stability and efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Turning to our funding plans, the bank's funding plans are managed dynamically throughout the year, both with reference to a set of clear principle that determine our approach to issuance. The group has &#xA3;18 billion of term debt maturing in 2013, and a further &#xA3;24 billion maturing in 2014.</p>
          <p>Compared to previous years, our wholesale unsecured funding volumes will reduce and the mix of funding sources will change over the 2013 to 2015 period, mainly as a consequence of: one, the continued sell down of legacy assets; and then the continued higher growth in customer deposit inflows relative to growth in customer loans and advances. Our approach to funding, however, means that we remain committed to the annual issuance of public benchmark of both secured and unsecured debt to insure outstanding on-the-run notes to a level to maintain market access and our investor franchise. Our funding plan will remain adaptable and adjust to factors such as our liquidity risk appetite in deposit growth from Retail, Corporate and Wealth businesses.</p>
          <p>Moving to RWAs, as you can see from this slide, &#xA3;387 billion of RWAs as of December 31, 2012, results into a pro forma CRD IV RWA position of &#xA3;469 billion at January 1, 2013, an &#xA3;81 billion increase. This is the result of CVA increases, securitization and other impacts, such as IFRS 10. The accelerated run down of legacy assets between 2013 and 2015 and ongoing RWA optimization initiatives mitigate these increases to leave RWAs broadly flat. This gives us head room for growth in selected businesses and/or a buffer to absorb additional regulatory changes or market volatilities.</p>
          <p>Barclays has nearly doubled its core Tier 1 ratio since 2008 despite stricter application of RWAs for Basel II and Basel II.5 and other regulatory developments such as commercial-related slotting and sovereign HED floors. We have increased core Tier 1 capital in absolute term by 75% to over &#xA3;42 billion. We have total regulatory capital of &#xA3;66 billion.</p>
          <p>Barclays has been pricing its products and allocating capital on Basel III basis for some time. While the precise timetable of CRD IV is not yet defined, we were prepared for January 1, 2013 implementation. And for planning purposes, we currently assume implementation on July 1, 2013 although we fully expect the actual implementation date to be later.</p>
          <p>Even after substantial provisions for conduct issues, our core Tier 1 ratio has stayed broadly constant compared to 2011, largely as a result of &#xA3;1.8 billion of returned earning capital, returned capital generated from earnings. The strong capital generation has been offset in 2012 by movements in our currency transition reserve that had netted against RWAs and pension movements.</p>
          <p>As shown in the capital bridge, at December 31, 2012 our CQ1 ratio was 10.9%. Assuming CRD IV impacts on RWA of about &#xA3;81 billion and including around a &#xA3;400 million reduction in CT1 as a result of IFI's 10, our transitional CEG1 ratio would have been 10.6% on January 1, 2013.</p>
          <p>The more aggressive management of legacy assets and continued RWA optimization will boost our transitional CET1 ratio by 200 basis points over the 2013 to 2015 period. This effort would be partially offset by CRD IV transitional adjustment to CET1. We expect our transitional CET1 ratio to be 11.7% by December 2015, well above our 10.5% target. To be clear, this number and this chart does not assume any RWA growth in the businesses or retained earnings for the next three years. And, therefore, we are confident that we do have sufficient head room to absorb additional regulatory adjustments and more importantly, grow businesses as we consider necessary.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to capital structure. Our reported core Tier 1 ratio of 10.9% at the end of 2012 is 3.9% above the 7% trigger of our recently issued CoCos. Central to our thinking about capital management is the transition of our current capital structure to the one we consider efficient and compliant with new regulatory requirements. We have defined our end state capital structure to allow a CET1 ratio of a minimum 10.5%, 1.5% above the CRD IV requirement for a 2% G-SIFI bank, and this excluding any contra-cyclical buffer.</p>
          <p>As communicated during the investor road show for our integral contingent capital transactions, we also intend to raise 2% of RWAs in CoCos form with a mix of AT1 and Tier 2 hosts. While our end state goals is for 1.5% AT1 and 50 basis points of Tier 2 legacy, Tier 1 positions and the desire to develop this market further may change the proportions in the short term as we transition to the preferred end state. A viable and scalable market in CoCos is important for Barclays and the banking sectors more widely, and we intend to continue to play an active part in it.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the topic of bank capital, we sent announcements by the Financial Policy Committee, or FPC, of the Bank of England have led the FSA to look at a number of items, the calculation of RWAs using advanced models, expected future losses on commercial-rated assets and conduct issue provisions. Our discussions with them on these topics are already advanced as our PVA disclosure at Q3 demonstrates. We continue to remain engaged with the FSA to help them to produce the report in time for their March deadline. It is our hope that the report's finding will move the debate on the adequate capitalization of the U.K. banks forward. In the same vein, we continue to work with the FSA and the Bank of England regarding the Basel's committee work on market risk RWAs modeling for theoretical portfolios.</p>
          <p>Moving on to balance sheet management, we continue to proactively manage the size and the composition of our balance sheet to meet commercial objectives. To enhance our approach, we now manage our balance sheet to average limits rather than managing month-end targets that allowed for higher volatility.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the slide, this approach has sharply reduced volatility in the balance sheet during the last quarter. Over time, we are planning to reduce the average leverage ratio as balance sheet growth is forecast to be below Tier 1 capital growth. For 2015, the average leverage target is 19 times.</p>
          <p>Based on our current interpretation of the rules, our CRD IV leverage as of December 31, 2012, was within the 33 times indicative limits, allowing for transitional relief to Tier 1 capital. On an end state measure of capital, we expect leverage to be within the limit before the end of the transitional period. Further detail on our CRD IV leverage ratios will be provided in our 2012 PL3 disclosures.</p>
          <p>Looking at liquidity risk management's now, since 2008 Barclays' liquidity pool has increased from less than &#xA3;50 billion to a peak of &#xA3;170 billion at the half year 2012. The &#xA3;170 billion peak reflected voluntary and temporary growth beyond our internal risk framework requirements to reflect our cautious approach in then volatile markets.</p>
          <p>We define our liquidity pool by reference to our own liquidity risk appetite framework which, while aligned to the FSA and Basel III prescribed test, leaves us with liquidity liquid assets in excess of regulatory requirements. We estimate that recently announced Basel III changes will benefit our 103% Basel III defined liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, by 23 basis points &#x2013; by 23 percentage points, sorry. In 2013, this allows us to reduce level of liquidity by holding a lower surplus to our internal requirements and still be 100% compliant with the LCR.</p>
          <p>You can expect to see the liquidity pool reduce in size to approximately &#xA3;125 billion to &#xA3;150 billion before adjustments are made for changes in the size of our balance sheet. We are also changing the composition of the liquidity pool to move some of the cash held at central banks towards highly-rated government bonds. We will maintain our very conservative approach to liquidity management despite these changes. We only hold very high quality and liquid assets, mostly in select government securities, the details of which can be found in our results announcement.</p>
          <p>Importantly, we do not hold securities as equities, CDOs, CLOs or CDS positions within the portfolio. And we will continue to monitor the portfolio for concentration risk by issuer, currency, asset type and country. This, along the way, will manage the size of the buffer, will result in the annual costs falling to &#xA3;300 million by 2015 from around &#xA3;600 million currently. These reductions in the liquidity buffer costs does not take into account the benefits of reduced funding costs mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Finally, to regulation; as I look forward, one of the biggest challenges we face is the ongoing uncertainty about structural reform. We understand the concerns that this raises within the debt investor community. The industry faces a number of different regulatory pressures, mainly from the U.K., European Union and the U.S. The good news in my view is that over the last &#x2013; the past 12 months there has been more commonality between the views of regulators and more clarity in their response, albeit there is further to go. That said, we still cannot say that regulation is wholly consistent but is at least more highly correlated.</p>
          <p>With respect to ring fencing in the U.K., as you know, our intention is to design a ring fence around the minimum required liability cut-off for individuals and small businesses that will be set in reg &#x2013; in the legislation. We plan to complement those liabilities with assets that will fully satisfy the letter, and more importantly, the spirit of regulatory requirements.</p>
          <p>The primary concern for U.K. banks to address is where within the group structure the ring fence entity should be located. Our preference is to operate the ring fence entity as a subsidiary of our principal operating entity, Barclays Bank Plc. We are confident that this structure is just as resolvable as any other. However, we are also very confident that if the outcome of this debate on corporate structure requires us to do so, we could upgrade the ring fence entity alongside Barclays Bank Plc, that without material incremental costs or negative impact on our stakeholders. We will be able to meet our recovery and resolution requirements in any scenario.</p>
          <p>Moving to the U.S. and Section 165 of Dodd-Frank in particular, we anticipated the direction of the proposed rule and recognize what the U.S. authorities are seeking to achieve. We are currently assessing the potential impacts of the proposed standards and based on our preliminary assessments, we believe that we would be able to meet the said requirements through a range of management actions over time. As the proposed rule is still in the comment phase and in the absence of the final rule, it is premature to comment on what combination of management actions will be taken.</p>
          <p>With respect to the legal report, it's also too early to say what material &#x2013; incremental impact, if any, this would have. It is hard to see at this time what it would deliver that the ICB ring-fencing and Dodd-Frank's worker rule do not. We expect that it will be less relevant for U.K. banks.</p>
          <p>Finally and importantly, we continue to work closely with regulators on our recovery and reservation plans. We made our first formal recovery and reservations plans submissions to the U.K. and the U.S. regulators in mid-2012 and have had regular discussions since. Our current processes and our comprehensive liquidity framework will enable us, the regulators, and administrators to manage business liquidity needs in a reservation scenario.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, under Antony's leadership, we have renewed focus on the organization's strength and how we build long term stable performance. The financial strength of Barclays as defined by our position in capital, funding and liquidity remains a critical priority for Barclays' management. Our approach to funding remains unchanged. Although our needs have reduced and the mix of funding shifted more toward customer deposits and secured sources, we remain committed to benchmark issuance and meeting the needs of investors.</p>
          <p>Our capital position remains strong as we approach the implementation of CRD IV. We have started to transition our capital structures with the issuance of CoCos and remain committed to developing this market. We are reducing the volatility of our balance sheet and planning to continue over time to reduce leverage. Currently our liquidity buffer is in excess of internal and regulatory requirements, but we are taking steps to reduce its overall size and cost to the business, albeit within a stringent risk framework as the current market environment is more benign.</p>
          <p>Finally, we remain engaged with regulators in all jurisdictions in which we operate to insure that we correctly anticipate and adapt to change. We have a high-quality business that is capable to generating resilient earnings. Barclays has an established track record of innovating and market leading benchmark insurance across key markets, and we are committed to maintaining our fair approach to investors. Thank you for listening. Chris?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Benoit. And with that I'd like to open the call to questions. As a reminder, Benoit and I are joined here by [Carlo Tenucci], Jennifer Moreland and Rupert Fowden. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker>
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And the first question this afternoon comes from the line of Corinne Cunningham of Autonomous. Corinne, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple of questions. One about the PLAC buffer and the other one about the core capital; I guess both about capital, really. The first one on the PLAC buffer, I've been under the impression originally that it was supposed to be made up of senior debt as well as subordinated debt. But from what we're hearing from other U.K. banks, it seems the pressure is on more to have that made up of specifically subordinated debt. Can I just check on that question what your understanding is in terms of the composition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. For &#x2013; I think the starting point is we are currently running a 17.1% capital base. We have also the demand to grow the CoCos market in the next few years. For what we do anticipate for the next &#x2013; for the foreseeable future is that any maturity or core Tier 2 debt would be replaced by AT1 form or Tier 2 form CoCos. For the foreseeable future for us, we expect that ratio to be maintained.</p>
          <p>Also it's too early for us to determine the final shape of the composition of this buffer. It's unclear yet how the billing rule will work and then we'll make the final decision at that stage. But we want to ensure that we're going to make a marked difference between senior debt and the debt included into this buffer for we will make a decision at that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. The second question was along similar lines. You keep mentioning the need to issue additional Tier 1, but if you get to the target 10.5% core Tier 1 and indeed your forecast there was showing, excluding growth in earnings, you could get to 11.7%, why do you need to issue additional Tier 1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the 10.5% Tier 1 as end state target is a fully absorbed Basel III limit and don't forget, our understanding of the CRD IV is as follows; you have to have &#x2013; it's much more efficient for us to have an AT1 core for a number of reasons. I mean, you're right. You don't have to issue AT1, you could have common liquidity Tier 1 instead, but the &#x2013; a couple of articles on the CRD IV, Article 87, for example, or Article 131 make it more valuable for us to have Tier 1 form CoCos.</p>
          <p>The first article I mentioned is referring to the 6% minimum commodity risk you have to have. You can use AT1 against that target. And the other article I mentioned is if you don't have AT1 forms, CoCos, your &#x2013; if your common equity Tier 1 is below 10.5%, you're entering into the restrictions in dividends and payments. For those reasons, it's much more efficient.</p>
          <p>Also, let's not forget the economic side of the equation. If you follow the pricing of this debt, it should be cheaper than equity for us to have that for both on a regulatory front but also on an economic front it makes sense for us to have this issuance. The question is how fast do we do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The way that you describe that in terms of your G-SIFI buffer, so it sounds like your &#x2013; the way that you think it works is almost as if you need to add your G-SIFI buffer to the capital conservation buffer. So if you start to dip into the two of those combined, that's when you think the dividend restrictions would start to take effect, not when you hit the 7%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. That's our current understanding, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's very clear and helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Ivan Zubo of BNP Paribas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. I just had a question regarding also on slide number nine, the role of traditional Tier 1 instruments going forward and in particular the non-step instruments. We see the structure going from today to where you aspire to get to in the future, but I guess one, would like to have a better idea how long do you think that's going to take? And two, especially with regards to the non-step Tier 1 instruments, wanted to see if you would also aspire to retire those as soon as possible, i.e., as soon as the call day arises? Or whether it's possible that these instruments could even be considered a Tier 2 in the new regime given that in the U.K. we do have a resolution regime?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our understanding is all these Tier 1 instrument for most of it will be grandfathered for ten years. The non-step of preferred shares could be viewed as a Tier 2, but all the others will be grandfathered and then it wouldn't expire &#x2013; it will expire worthless for us for capital purposes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Ron Perrotta of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>... call. You kind of alluded to this but on the timeline of layering in the additional continued capital securities you were talking about, is there kind of a timeframe of when you think that will happen? Or is it driven in part by what comes out on the new regulations for Tier 1 securities, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before, we haven't declared that our issuance requirement for 2013 is &#xA3;14 billion. We don't precise &#x2013; we don't give details which portion is foreign debt or none in it. We have &#xA3;25 billion of Tier 1 and Tier 2 debt. Therefore, you should expect that every year we have some of them either maturing or could be callable. Therefore, you should expect those would be replaced by new issuance at the time. I don't know if I give you a response to your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you would be looking for, as securities do become callable, those could be opportunities where you could choose to exercise the call to replace it with a continued capital security?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We don't have an absolute rule to call any debt we have. We are very cognizant of the different treatment between retail and also banking. We will &#x2013; on retail preferred share bonds but we would not call them, but historically, we have called any Tier 2 that can be callable. Our intention is within our constraints and within the current situation is to continue that, but we cannot formally commit to that.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Understood. And you mentioned in the progression of the capital and the RWAs that part of it will be driven obviously by true sales of assets, some legacy assets, but then some other additional optimization. Any color you could give on that? As well as you're planning on reducing a lot of the RWAs and improving capital in the investment bank but there also will be an impact on growth and other regulatory changes which absorb some of that. Any color you could give on those two items would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I &#x2013; did you want me to give more description on what we expect &#x2013; on the &#xA3;75 billion optimization we are planning to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. What would that entail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you want to look at that, there are three big buckets. So the first big bucket is what we call legacy CME, legacy sales, <mark type="indiscernible" />. That's about &#xA3;23 billion pounds on a Basel III equivalent that we will remove the next three years. And of that bucket, there's three big pieces of it: there's the CDO Super Senior; there's a commercial risk portfolio on Crescent; and then there is the rundown of the leveraged portfolio. For &#x2013; on all three of them, we are very confident on the great quality of the portfolio, for as you know, we sold most of the other commercial asset portfolio at a gain and the quality under this clearly is very strong; same thing for the leveraged balance group.</p>
          <p>The biggest block &#x2013; part of this block is the leveraged balance portfolio. And we have very good quality name like <mark type="indiscernible" />. I mean, we're not worried at all on the credit quality of this portfolio, and the maturity of the debt is 2014 and 2015 for that big block will disappear automatically over the next two years. Also to put in perspective, in asset size it's &#xA3;9 billion, and if you look at the &#x2013; when we started with the CME portfolio we had &#xA3;43 billion to sell. We've sold three-quarters of the portfolio successfully the last few years.</p>
          <p>The second block of the &#xA3;75 billion is what I would call the legacy fixed income FICC portfolio for a number of trades that we've done a long time ago pre the Basel III rules. We have stopped this type of product a long time ago, and that's about &#xA3;20 billion worth of RWAs. The maturity of this trade is also a very short duration trade so when they were done four or five years ago, they were anywhere from five to seven years. There's not been much &#x2013; many years left on this portfolio. For on this one there's a very high degree of certainties on the reduction of RWAs.</p>
          <p>On the other two buckets, which is &#xA3;18 billion &#x2013; &#xA3;19 billion on investment bank and &#xA3;13 billion on the non-investment bank, it's quite difficult to give you specific details because this is really a series of one and twos. We have roughly about, let's say, less than 100 different sub project on those and some of these very small things make a difference.</p>
          <p>After the call, we're happy to give you more color, but once again, this is very much in line with our performance the last few years where we have been able to reduce anywhere from &#xA3;20 billion to &#xA3;25 billion pounds of RWAs under Basel 2.5 equivalent which is less <mark type="indiscernible" /> than Basel III equivalents on this portfolio. And the number looks big because it's Basel at three years horizon and specifically before we have not spoken about three year horizon, we've only spoken of one year horizon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. So I guess is it fair to say, then, given the color on those first two buckets that the vast majority of this will really be driven by actual risk reduction as opposed to things like model improvements and things like that, which you would get a RWA benefit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Even &#x2013; the same could apply, by the way, for the other two buckets. A lot of it is actual size of &#x2013; actual reductions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for holding this conference call. I want &#x2013; I have a number of questions. First of all, yesterday during the earnings call, Chris had promised to give some options on what happens to the U.S. business under Section 165, Tarullo, et cetera. Looking through all the transcripts, I don't actually find anything that was given. So my question about this is if there's going to trapped liquidi &#x2013; if there is going to be a separate U.S. subsidiary under which a lot of the IB activities will sit, does the fact that there'll be trapped liquidity and capital change your &#x2013; would it change your plans regarding where you see the liquidity calls and where you see the capital buffers? So I don't know if you want to take questions in sequence or shall I go on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's do one question at a time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, you want, I mean, I'm not going to respond to that. In my script, I just said it's too early for us to comment on what management action we can take as the rule is still in draft form and for comments and not a final rule. We have been anticipating this ruling for quite a while. We are very well &#x2013; we have very good discussion with the U.S. regulators and we believe that we can take management action to mitigate all risks and all costs, most of the costs for us on this under our current understanding of what's going to happen on Section 165. I think that's all we can say at the time. I mean...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's right. I mean, maybe I promised a little bit early the different scenarios we're looking at, but they would include using the U.S. balance sheet, reorganizing U.S. structure and then increasing capital, which would be our least preferred option. So there's a range or things. We're working on it and as soon as we got something tangible, we'll let you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to take that a bit further, and it's probably not so much of direct relevance to you but some of your peer issuers, is the possibility that you still have a U.S. branch continuing alongside a ring-fenced, capitalized subsidiary? Is that a possibility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a possibility. Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks. Secondly, on what's been alluded to about PLAC and the ring-fenced structure, the &#x2013; I understand perfectly that your preference is for a parent-and-child structure, i.e., that the ring-fence sits under the non-ring-fenced Barclay OpCo rather than a sibling that sits under the HoldCo. Does &#x2013; if you have the sibling structure, i.e., under the HoldCo, does that mean that you will have to have external issuance by the ring-fenced entity?</p>
          <p>And so particular relevance to covered bonds because my understanding is that if you can have the ring-fence under the OpCo, the whole issue of having a large leverage ratio or a smaller leverage ratio by having all the covered bond issuance out of it comes into play. Would it mean that if you've got it alongside the main OpCo, i.e. under the HoldCo, you will have to have some of the covered bonds still out of the current OpCo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a lot of pieces to your question. Let me try to answer them in order. On the first one, we believe based on our current interpretation of proposed rule and recommendation that we are able to satisfy the U.K. ring-fencing entities on a narrow ring-fencing. For just to put that in perspective, we expect &#x2013; assuming that structure, it's likely that our ring-fence entity will have balance sheets of about &#xA3;150 billion. Just to put it into perspective, &#xA3;150 billion is 10% of our &#xA3;1.5 trillion balance sheet. And if we do that we believe that it would be for the basis &#x2013; it's a smaller impact on our total balance sheet as a lot of people expect.</p>
          <p>On the second question you have, which is the &#x2013; on the sister, what will be the additional financial cost, we view that the two main driver of the potential cost on SisCo, also OpCo is an increase of cost funding of the non-ring-fenced entity and the transformation costs are the two biggest block to get there. But if you look at my first response as we are now ring-fencing, the non-ring-fenced entity will remain as diversified and almost as large as today, so we do not expect any change in that funding cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally, in terms of back to slide nine, as everyone else, the envisaged structure with T2 and AT1, does that at all &#x2013; when planning this, do you at all look at the ratio that was floated by the CMD, by the crisis resolution directive, resolution recovery directive, i.e., I currently calculate that you've got basically as a senior bond holder, as a percentage of funding, there's like 7% of loss taking ahead of me in the form of core Tier 1 &#x2013; either Tier 1 or Tier 2. Do you look at this ratio at all? Do you have a &#x2013; I mean, do you think this matters at all? How much ahead of senior unsecured there will be and would there be a &#x2013; would this current target translate to something bigger than the 7% I calculate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For your first question, do we look at it? We don't believe it's a constraint for us and we don't look at it. No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Lee Street of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello and thank you very much for holding the call. I have three quick questions, I think. Firstly, how do you define encumbrance and if you were to take it up to the 25% that's been suggested, presumably you've discussed this with the agencies and do you think that's consistent with the current ratings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The encumbrance is based on the percentage of secure financing versus the loan advances to customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine. Okay. And consistent with your current ratings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, just a question, really, what level of core Tier 1 is the bank being managed to because in the presentation yesterday, I kind of got the impression it was a management target at 10.5%. And the reason I ask is because the 10.5% I think gets you less than 400 basis points over your CoCo trigger, which under the S&amp;P criteria and your current standalone rating wouldn't be compatible with investment-grade ratings, so I'm just trying to square exactly what level of core Tier 1 we're looking to manage to over the, I guess, over the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our target, our internal target for core equity Tier 1 is 10.5%. The requirement we have on the regulatory side is 9%. For &#x2013; I'm not sure I understand your questions. Is it not what you're looking for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just the S&amp;P criteria for rating CoCos; you need a 400-basis-point headroom above the trigger level to have an investment-grade rating as your standalone rating, so I was just checking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Currently, until CRD IV as implemented we are measuring on the CET1 basis and we're currently running around 11%, which is 400 basis points above the trigger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the 10.5% we've indicated is the minimum we intend to keep at all time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And finally, just a quick point of clarification, in response to an earlier question, did you say that you thought if preference shares were left outstanding at post-grandfathering that they could count as Tier 2 capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much indeed.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for holding this call. You mentioned earlier you're cutting history on Tier 2s and <mark type="indiscernible" />.

          <p>Exactly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So they are step ups rather than non-steps?</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And can you comment on your approach towards future calls?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So any Tier 1 which has step features in it will not be viewed as a Tier 2 instrument going forward.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>For it will be grandfathered but it will extinguish and then it &#x2013; but it will not be extinguished in a Tier 2. It will be extinguished as a senior debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your broader question in terms of whether we would set out our plans for future legacy management exercises, I'm afraid the answer is no, not at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we do continue to view leverage management as an important business tools available to us to match funding and liquidity &#x2013; it would depend on market conditions. But we never disclose, as Chris says, in advance our regard our intention in regard of that.</p>

          <p>The next question today comes from Kana Norimoto of Fidelity via the webcast, who asks please could you give us a breakdown between organic growth and the regulatory changes for the &#xA3;47 billion RWA growth expected between now and 2015?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We cannot provide that detail at this time; we won't provide it as we have the detail at this time. There is details in Antony's presentation yesterday on capital allocation where we intend to allocate it. As you can see from &#x2013; it's well spread around the bank. It's not &#x2013; investment bank has about roughly a third or a quarter to a third and the rest is spread around business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I regard it as an indication as to the relative quantum of available RWAs for either, say, business expansion or regulatory change. I wouldn't go beyond that at this stage in terms of trying to allocate it, but it does give you a flavor of the quantum relative to our &#xA3;440 billion December 15 RWA target.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The final question this afternoon comes from Cindy Harlow of Imperial Capital via the webcast, who asks regarding the contingent capital structure issued in November 2012, is the CT1 ratio trigger based on fully loaded or phased-in calculation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the CT1 ratio &#x2013; this issue &#x2013; the trigger is based on CT1 ratio on Basel 2.5 until CRD IV is implemented, and once CRD IV is implemented, it's based on the CET1 ratio transitional phase. It is not based on Basel III fully loaded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it's based on the actual reported ratio, not one that's calculated on a pro forma basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's the last question that I heard so on behalf of all of us, thank you very much for joining. We hope you found that helpful, and if there are follow-up questions, the team are ready to help out. So thank you very much indeed.</p>
