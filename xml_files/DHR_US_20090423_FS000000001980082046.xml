      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start this morning by providing some color around what we are seeing across our businesses and end markets, to provide some context to the results we delivered in the first quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>We are clearly operating in a difficult economic environment. Geographically, both the U.S. and Western Europe are extremely soft. And most of the emerging economies have also experienced significant declines. For us, the exception was China, where our business was down, but only modestly in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, most of our Med Tech businesses, which we did not own during the last economic downturn, had solid performances in the quarter. In addition, both our Water Quality and our Consumables businesses are holding up pretty well. Finally, despite an overall softer top line, we delivered solid margin performance in the quarter, while continuing to invest for the future.</p>
          <p>Our Motion, Test &amp; Measurement and Cable businesses have been the most significantly impacted by the global downturn. But none of these businesses have been immune. On the whole, discretionary corporate and consumer spending remains weak, particularly at higher price points or commitment levels.</p>
          <p>So we're obviously in a share gain game right now. And we are accelerating our cost reduction actions. In addition to the 2008 cost reduction efforts and the $50 million of ongoing restructuring activities built in to our 2009 plan, the economic outlook has us digging deeper. Accordingly, we've begun taking 100 to $120 million of additional restructuring actions throughout the Company. In total, these initiatives are expected to generate annualized savings of approximately $140 million.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report that cash flow, the hallmark of Danaher, was once again robust as we generated over $280 million of free cash flow in the quarter, down only slightly versus the same period a year ago. Despite the economy, we expect strong cash flow for all of 2009. Financially, we are in terrific shape with more than $900 million of cash on hand and over $1 million of availability under our CP program. During the quarter, we completed a 10-year $750 million bond issuance, the proceeds of which will help ensure we are well positioned to be active on the acquisition front.</p>
          <p>While we are not expecting a near-term improvement in current economic conditions, we do believe that our solid portfolio of businesses rooted in the Danaher business system, which is the backbone of our operating model and the foundation of our culture, coupled with our seasoned leadership team, will allow us to out-execute our competition, and as a result, take share in the markets we serve.</p>
          <p>So with that as backdrop, I'd like to move now to the details of the quarter. Today we reported first quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.72, representing a 13% decline from last year. Earnings per diluted share declined 19% as compared to last year on an adjusted EPS basis.</p>
          <p>Despite the challenging economic environment, we were able to deliver EPS within our guidance range, primarily due to the savings generated by the restructuring actions initiated last year, as well as the ongoing hard work at driving material costs and operating expense reductions across the Company in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Revenues for the quarter decreased roughly 13% year-over-year to $2.6 billion with core revenues down 10%. The impact of currency reduced revenues by 5.5%, offset by acquisitions, which contributed 2.5% to sales growth. Revenues also benefited from four extra days in the first quarter. The corresponding off-setted days will be realized in the second and fourth quarters of this year.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year gross margin for the first quarter increased approximately 110 basis points to 47.9%. Excluding the impact of prior year Tektronix charges, gross margins were up slightly despite the revenue decline. This was primarily due to the impact of recent restructuring activities and lower raw material costs. SG&amp;A expenses decreased 7.5% but as a percent of sales were 28.8% compared to 27% last year, primarily due to reduced leverage on our SG&amp;A cost base as a result of the lower sales volumes. For the quarter, research and development spending as a percentage of sales was essentially flat year-over-year at 6.1%.</p>
          <p>Operating profit for the quarter was $340 million representing a 17.5% decrease over last year. Operating margin in the first quarter was 12.9%, a 70 basis point decline from 2008. Core operating margin in the first quarter was down 130 basis points compared to the prior year period due to lower revenues across most businesses and partially offset by the benefit of recent restructuring and other cost reduction actions. Despite the tough top line environment, we continue to make significant progress on the cost front across Danaher.</p>
          <p>Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 25% as compared to 26.5% in the prior year period. For the balance of the year, we anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25%, absent the impact of anticipated favorable discrete tax items.</p>
          <p>Net earnings were $238 million for the quarter, a decrease of 14% compared to the prior year, a result of softer revenues and the negative impact of currency translations.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flows were $317 million in the quarter, a 5% decline year-over-year. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $280 million and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 118%. We anticipate that our conversion ratio will remain strong over the balance of this year. And as a result, we are optimistic about our ability to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for what would be our 18th year in a row.</p>
          <p>Subsequent to quarter-end, we completed the acquisition of three companies, comprising about $50 million of annualized revenue to strengthen our Environmental, Test &amp; Measurement, and Sensors and Controls businesses. We believe the acquisition environment is becoming more attractive and that we are well positioned to capitalize on strategic acquisition opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the operating segments, Professional Instrumentation revenues decreased 12.5% for the quarter with core revenues down 11.5%. Operating margin for the first quarter was up 120 basis points to 17.7%, reflecting the prior year impact of inventory and deferred revenue charges related to the acquisition of Tektronix. Core operating margin declined 45 basis points in the quarter as significant restructuring and cost reduction activities helped to offset core revenue declines.</p>
          <p>Environmental platform revenues declined 1.5% in the quarter with core revenues up 1%. Water Quality core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate in the quarter; at Hach Lange core revenues were essentially flat as solid growth in Consumables and aftermarket service helped offset soft instrumentation sales. Despite the flat top line performance, Hach Lange's operating margin expanded more than 100 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Trojan's core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter as we continued to see solid demand from China for our waste water and drinking water UV disinfection products. During the quarter, we began shipping products to the New York City drinking water project which should positively impact Trojan's revenues for the balance of the year. Trojan exited the quarter with a robust backlog of more than $85 million. At ChemTreat, revenues were up at a mid single-digit rate as ChemTreat's shares gains across multiple vertical markets continued.</p>
          <p>Gilbarco, Veeder-Root's core revenues were essentially flat year-over-year, a strong performance given the economy and a difficult prior year comparison due to a large tender in India. Veeder-Root grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter due to strong sales of its enhanced vapor recovery solution. Gilbarco enjoyed solid growth in our Passport Point of Sale System, where we continued to take market share but that was offset by lower dispenser sales. Of note, in March we recognized a significant achievement when we installed our 5000th Passport POS System. Subsequent to quarter end, Gilbarco, Veeder-Root completed the acquisition of Postec, a New Zealand based provider of automation solutions and outdoor payment systems used primarily in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Moving to Test &amp; Measurement, revenues declined 23% in the quarter, with core revenues down 22%. Fluke and Tektronix both declined by approximately the same amount. At Fluke, lower overall demand for our core test products and inventory reductions in distribution drove the majority of the decline. At Tektronix, we experienced lower sales across all product categories and geographies, as customers continued to delay investments. Electronics and computer end markets were particularly soft. The team has accelerated further cost reduction efforts to help offset this broad based market decline.</p>
          <p>The bright spot in Test &amp; Measurement was Tek Communications [Tektronix Communications] our network management business which continues to perform well as telecom system providers rely heavily on our technology to keep their fixed and mobile networks running smoothly. We've seen especially strong adoption of our test and optimization solutions in the mobile space.</p>
          <p>Subsequent to quarter end, Tek Communications completed the acquisition of Aran Technologies, a Dublin-based supplier of customer experience management solutions for wireless carriers, enabling those carriers to provide high quality uninterrupted service to their customers.</p>
          <p>Moving to Med Tech [Medical Technologies], revenues for the quarter decreased 5.5% compared to last year with core revenues down modestly 1.5%. The addition of this segment to our portfolio since the last recession has clearly helped protect our top line during these difficult economic times. Med Tech operating margin for the first quarter was down 70 basis points to 10.8%. Absent the acquisition impact and restructuring activities in the quarter, year-on-year operating margin was relatively flat.</p>
          <p>Within our dental business, core revenues declined at a mid single digit rate in the quarter. Sybron grew at a low single-digit rate led by higher sales of our SybronEndo Twisted Files and Total Care's disinfection products. We also saw some modest sequential and year-over-year improvement at Ormco.</p>
          <p>Cable revenues declined at a low-teens rate in the quarter as expected, with a general slowing across all major geographies and product categories. The economic downturn continues to significantly impact sales of new dental equipment, as many doctors are postponing capital investments in their practices.</p>
          <p>Leica core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, driven primarily by sustained demand in life science research markets, as well as low double-digit growth at Leica Biosystems, our pathology diagnostics and consumables business.</p>
          <p>Industrial market demand slowed in the quarter. Clinical demand also softened due to reduced capital spending budgets and customer delays as hospitals attempt to better understand potential stimulus plan benefits.</p>
          <p>Radiometer's core revenues grew at a high single digit rate for the quarter, driven by continued strong consumable sales, primarily in Europe and Asia resulting from past success in growing our installed base.</p>
          <p>Moving to Industrial Technologies, revenues declined 18.5% for the quarter with core revenues down 12%. Operating margin for the first quarter was 13.7%, a 110 basis point decrease compared to the same period last year due primarily to lower sales volumes across the segment.</p>
          <p>Product ID revenues were down 16% in the quarter with core revenues declining 8%. An increase in our service business and a modest decline in Consumables was more than offset by weak demand from new equipment at Videojet.</p>
          <p>Despite the soft -- the top line being soft Videojet's operating margin expanded by more than 100 basis points in the quarter. Our medium and low price point continuous inkjet printers, which we launched late in 2008 are continuing to capture market share as we have now placed more than 1,000 printers with our customers in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Motion revenues were down 31% in the quarter, with core revenues down 23.5%. While we expected Motion to be impacted as a result of the industrial downturn, we did not foresee a decline of this magnitude. Our elevator business was down more than 30% in the quarter, and flat panel display revenues were down more than 50%. We expect this softness to continue, and as a result, we are deploying significant cost reduction efforts here.</p>
          <p>Post quarter's end, we completed the acquisition of Diagnostic Monitoring Systems in the Industrial Technologies segment. Headquartered in Glasgow, Scotland, DMS is a leading manufacturer of diagnostic smart grid technology used by electric utilities to better manage and monitor their large grid-based assets.</p>
          <p>Finally, moving to Tools and Components, revenues for the quarter decreased 21% with core revenues down 20.5%. Operating margin for the quarter was 6.6%, a decline of approximately 510 basis points from the prior year largely due to lower sales volumes particularly in our higher margin Matco and Hennessy businesses.</p>
          <p>The impact of litigation settlements also negatively impacted operating margin. Absent planned restructuring charges, we anticipate operating margin improvement in Tools sequentially as we move through the year.</p>
          <p>Mechanics' Hand Tool core revenues declined 14% in the quarter, primarily due to lower sales to both the consumer and professional channels. Sales of our domestic China tool brand SATA were also soft, although we saw sequential improvement through the quarter. In March, we were awarded a new multi-million dollar contract from the U.S. Marine Corps to supply tool kits, which we will begin shipping in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>So to wrap up my prepared remarks, as we are all aware, these are unprecedented economic times. But it is during times like these that we believe we have the ability to outperform. And when the economy and our end markets improve, we do believe we will emerge an even stronger and more competitive company. As I mentioned earlier, given the environment, we are accelerating our cost reduction and restructuring activities, which now total 150 to $170 million this year. These initiatives will result in the elimination of 2,300 physicians and 16 facilities and provide annual cost savings of approximately $140 million. This is in addition to the more than $100 million of savings we discussed with you during our year-end call.</p>
          <p>In addition, we anticipate a reduction in our tax reserves of approximately $100 million resulting from the favorable settlement and/or statute expirations of certain international and domestic return years.</p>
          <p>Our expectation is for the second quarter core revenues to be slightly worse than the first. And for the full year, we are forecasting core revenue declines approximately in line with our first quarter decline of 10%. The 100 to $120 million of additional restructuring charges are expected to reduce EPS by approximately $0.08 per share in the second quarter and $0.25 per share for the full year. We expect the reductions in our tax reserves will increase EPS by approximately $0.18 per share in the second quarter and $0.30 per share for the full year.</p>
          <p>As a result, our earnings per share guidance for the second quarter will be in the range of 0.85 to $0.95. For the full year, our earnings per share guidance will be in the range of 3.30 to $3.70. These ranges include the tax and additional restructuring items just mentioned.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Larry. That concludes our formal comments. Cecilia, I believe we're now ready for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And our first question today comes from Bob Cornell with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. A couple of things; one is in the volume declines, you didn't mention anything about destocking. I know it's hard to measure it but maybe give us an idea of what you see there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, good morning. We certainly saw, I think, both our channel partners, where we go to market through distribution and a number of our OEM customers take stock down during the course of the quarter. I think given some of the uncertainties out there, I don't think we would declare that today, that that resetting, that destocking that has been going on is finished. I suspect we're still going to see the effect of that in our order books and in our shipments during the course of the second quarter and perhaps some of that will play out in the second half. But it certainly had a -- it had an effect. It's hard to say when that will conclude but we saw that in many businesses to be sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You didn't make a specific comment on the impact of price on the volume in the quarter; maybe you could comment there, and are you seeing an increase or decrease in price competition and how are you on the whole price cost issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think with respect to price we had positive price in the first quarter, about a point and a half, a little less than we saw, obviously, in the fourth quarter and during the course of last year. So it's clear in many markets given the volume declines that competition is heating up. But, I think by and large there are lots of ways to manage price and I like the work that we're doing. But I -- as we look forward, certainly mindful that competitive pressure will remain if not heightened we would expect that the price will be a lesser positive impact for us, but a positive impact for us as we go through the year.</p>
          <p>With respect to cost, obviously a lot of prepared commentary, maybe some additional follow-on questions relative to the additional restructuring. But the other cost activities whether it's around procurement, commodities, other things that we buy, and the like, I like where we are, I think you see that play out both in the core margin performance, down 130 bps on 10% revenue declines I think is indicative of that progress as is the cash flow performance. But--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One final question for me Larry, I think you said just now the organic growth you saw in the second quarter will be worse than the first, but the year will end up at 10, can you just flesh out that thought please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, I think given that -- given the way the year has started, and given what we see here in the near-term, I think the idea that we're going to not benefit as we did perhaps from a couple of extra days in the quarter, and a number of our businesses still wrestling with tough demand conditions leads us to offer up that guidance today relative to the sequential decline or the increased decline.</p>
          <p>But for the full year Bob, I think as we wrestle with the second quarter, we know we have a couple of offsets there, it is our toughest comp given we were up 5% a year ago. Obviously, that's less of an issue for us in the second half, we get to the first, the fourth quarter, where we have I think the easiest comp that we will work against. So that's what we think we'll wrestle with in the second quarter. I think that's the way the second half will play out at this point. So net it all out for the year, we think we'll be in and around that core performance that we registered in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Larry. Lots of other questions, I'll let other people ask them. Danny, a thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just say, with the guidance of, the full year being down in line with the first quarter, we're basically not sort of, expecting any sort of recovery here in the second half. It's very difficult to call, I mean, I think if we do get some stabilization in the second half, we obviously would do better than the numbers we just talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, lots of questions, I'll let other people ask them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just wanted to pick up that thought from Bob, we don't know how much inventories impacted the first quarter performance, but let's assume they did. So and basically flat lining the organic growth of, for full year assuming some benefit from comps in 4Q, you're not really seeing any moderation in inventory declines or are you saying that some of the stronger performances such as Leica and Radiometer will start to turn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think again it is hard to call the inventory resets, but we have to be closer to the end of those than not given what we saw play out in a number of our businesses, many of which go to market in part or largely through distribution. So I don't think that we would claim to have a clear crystal ball at this point, Nigel. But I do think that that moderates for us during the course of the year, particularly so in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Obviously, it's difficult to forecast in this environment. But can you just give us a bit more color on how the quarter trended in terms of core growth and maybe on top of that, throw in some book-to-bill ratios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, Nigel, in terms of bookings, it was pretty linear during the quarter, not much of a change. In terms of shipments, January was a little bit better, just because we had a little bit of backlog. As you know, we're primarily a book and ship business but we do carry some backlog here, and that benefited us in January. But in terms of overall orders, it's been pretty steady.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then just one more from me, the tax rate of 25%, I think, Larry, you called out some discrete items in that number. But the $100 million you talk about in the 10-Q, that's not within the 25%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. The 25% is our expected ongoing provision. The 100 million is a discrete item that we expect to book this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Just to put a finer point on the sales comps, the four extra days, do we think about that as on a calendar basis, or a kind of work, selling day basis, just want to understand if we're kind of calling, kind of really the core of Q1 down what, 14 or 15%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, I don't think it would be that much. It's very hard to tell on a number of our businesses, I think, just how much impact we would have had. But it's probably a couple hundred basis points, in that range, which is part of I think what we're suggesting here that will continue, not worsen, as we look at the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for two-thirds of our business being kind of equipment and instrumentation, days tend to have less of an impact. We also had January where we had so many customers just shut down. So it is, I think, harder in this environment to sort of kind of quantify the impact. I think with our consumables roughly a third of the portfolio, that's where we probably saw some impact, Jeff, from the extra days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there was a couple consumables comments laced through your prepared remarks there, and it sounds like except maybe for Videojet they were up across the board, but could you give us a little more color on, is there any inventory destocking, or anything going on as it relates to consumables also that kind of colors your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that Jeff, you got a pretty good bead there, you look at Med Tech where we had, I think good performance particularly with consumables, principally at Radiometer and at Sybron, to a lesser degree at Leica. I think we did see -- those are largely direct businesses, we did see, I think hospitals or even specialty dental professionals reducing what they've got in their stockrooms and their closets. But nonetheless, I think we enjoyed good performance there.</p>
          <p>In Environmental, instrument sales were soft as you would expect, people were still running plants, still complying with clean water rules, that was a pretty steady business for us. And even in Product ID where we saw plant shutdowns as Dan just alluded to and I think some destocking in inventories just as the year got off to a sluggish start, that held in pretty well, again despite some of the capital equipment purchases being pushed out a bit. So I think where we have that consumable exposure, that one-third that we referenced, very, very good performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just finally from me, I know there is a lot of macro questions but to drill on to something micro here. This small deal in Motion that you said plays into the grid and smart grid, where are you going with that? And are we opening the door maybe to a new sub platform here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll walk before we run there, Jeff. What we're really doing is adding some additional remote diagnostic and monitoring capability to our Qualitrol business, one of our really nice niche instrumentation businesses inside of Sensors and Controls. They've got an excellent worldwide position with the electrical utilities, particularly around transformer instrumentation. And this gives them a nice additional play, obviously, as the smart grid initiatives play out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the -- getting back to the price cost, you said that raw material costs were actually down in the quarter. I think you got about a point, point and a half of price. Can you just maybe talk about how you see that playing out for the rest of the year, maybe how much of a benefit was it to the margin this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Steve you saw that our -- if you factor out some of the Tektronix noise from a year ago, our overall gross margins were flat, which was pretty impressive performance given the top line. I think that's a reflection of both getting some price, the commodity reductions and particularly our Q4 restructuring benefits. As Larry indicated, we think price will be positive but I think it will decline somewhat during the course of the year. But both because of the restructuring and the commodities, we should do pretty well in the gross margin line throughout the year. But I can't quantify more than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then free cash flow, there were some relatively big swings in receivables and payables. Is anything going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Primarily, I would say, it's just a reflection of the lower core growth. I think I've also noted, we funded about 50 million of restructuring in the quarter that was part of the Q4 expense but actually got funded in the first quarter. So actually year-on-year, absent restructuring, our free cash flow would have been up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then one more just on Tektronix. How is the business, from a profitability perspective, running relative to where you ended the year last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were slightly north of 15% in the first quarter, which was down from the high teens we were running in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the volume we had terrific margin performance in the quarter but clearly getting impacted by volume there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you would expect that to kind of bleed lower through the rest of the year or you expect to sustain that profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we could be at that sort of level which would be a decline year-on-year but nowhere near what you would expect given the revenue declines since they've done such a good job on the cost side and we are working on other actions as we speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Scott. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any way -- I know it's hard, but is there any way to kind of quantify the payback time period of the restructuring, when you think about maybe the tail wind you could see in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that certainly when we talk about spending the 150 to 170, we're still trying to pin down a few things. But as we've accelerated that list of projects, Scott, clearly we're incorporating a few that have a little longer payback in them. But again I think it's probably 140 million that by and large, we should walk into '10 with. We're clearly not going to try to get too far ahead of ourselves. We typically talk about the next year in December, not April. But I think, when I step back and look at what we will have accomplished on the cost side, exiting 28 facilities, 4,000 physicians between what we did last year and what we teed up for this year in addition to all the other cost reduction measures that have put in place, couple that with some of the revenue dynamics that we've talked about, the channel destocking, some of the share gains. And note, we're not a big backlog company. So, we're not working off a lot of backlog here. I think the reality of the economy is kind of front and center for us right now. Not to mention the billion dollars of cash sitting there, earning less than 1%, that I would hope that we'd deploy this year in some smart acquisitions. So whenever this economy flushes itself out, I like where we're going to be. I think when those end-markets come back we're going to be well positioned to be full beneficiaries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, it's obviously early but our best look at what we plan to do through the balance of the year is, as Larry mentioned it will be about 140 million annualized benefit. We think we'll get about 50 of that primarily in the second half, so a net benefit going into 2010 and our best look is around 90 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good precision. And maybe I'm just dense here on a Thursday morning, but I'm still -- I didn't understand the tax credits. Can you just maybe remind us where they come from again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, we've kind of highlighted on our filings a potential reduction of tax reserves for the last couple of years and in our K, we thought we'd have up to about 150 million of reduction of tax reserves. These relate to the expectation of a favorable settlement of prior year audits or the statute of limitations on audits and other reviews. We've been able to sort of kind of fine tune it, and our best look is -- and obviously this could change a little bit, over the next couple of quarters, we think we'll book about a $100 million after tax benefit of reduction of prior year tax reserves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question just more specifically on Product ID, the 8% down volumes, wasn't really that bad when you look at your comps, better than comps. Was there any timing issues of contracts or share shifts, anything that kind of explains your out-performance there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it would appear -- it's early obviously in looking at the full comp set. I think the Calypso printer is doing well at VJ. I think our consumables business seems to have held in better than perhaps it has elsewhere. And it was a positive quarter for us at Accu-Sort relative to the timing of some of their programs. So, I'd really roll those three together, Scott.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. So Dan, you called out the linearity of your order trends, but if you guys were to look at the more cyclical components of Danaher, so call it Motion, some of the other companies have called out economic or end-market stability in March and April. Are you seeing that kind of a trend of stability in some of the more economically sensitive or non-consumable pieces of Danaher? Just maybe talk a little bit about that progression through April.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John, I think we're optimistic about where we stand from a competitive perspective there. But I'm not sure we would declare stability given the storm that we're in here on the back of a couple of weeks' worth of orders. But I think the rate of decline clearly seems to be moderating. I think the sense that we have particularly in those businesses as we sit here in mid April is different than it was in mid January. That may well be more a commentary John frankly on January, where it was very hard to determine where things were. Budgets weren't set, shut -- folks were shutting down, slashing inventories and the like. So, I don't want to suggest that we're going to call a hard bottom here and now. But, because we don't work through a lot of backlog, we think we are dealing with the reality of things here and now in our shipments. We like the fact that we see some of that, those declines moderating. And if that indeed continues for a while, then perhaps we have found that bottom. But again, as you see in our guidance, we are expecting the Corporation at large to decline through the course of the year on balance with the rate that we registered in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So -- okay just to make sure I understand what you're saying. You're basically, we know you're conservative. You are effectively saying the rest of the year is going to be based off of what you saw in the first quarter, but that if -- would it be fair to say, if the trend toward the end of the quarter continues maybe you'd do a little better, is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that that's certainly possible, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I want to ask you just about Videojet. I guess Dilbert (39;28) talked about the prospects of improvement in that business, going into the second half. And I know that you guys have called out some sort of push back on higher ticket items, but a lot of those equipment, a lot of machines aren't that expensive. Do you think that business as you think about your businesses stands a better chance of improving as the year goes on or perhaps there's some other businesses you'd like to call out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are a lot of things that team is doing with respect to new products. Some things we're doing in the channel, some very smart tactics around pricing, some things that we're doing internationally that give me confidence that we're going to continue to out execute during the course of the year. We've got to do that and we certainly have some good competition, which we respect, but I feel good about our ability to execute. The macro backdrop there should I think be more clear as things play out and budgets are set, factories are running at more normal rates, but that all still needs to play out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, if you look at the last downturn and obviously it's probably a more different downturn but it's at least a plausible theory, because if we look back at our Videojet business, we did have three, four quarters of very weak instrument sales about the time we were buying the business but it did bounce back and pretty quickly, probably quicker than some of our other kind of equipment type businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's what I was leading to -- so there is nothing really different about this time around versus those other times, if the economy plays out similarly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again that was our -- the experience last time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me just ask one more here, more strategically. I really want to hit on the Tektronix acquisition. Larry, one of the hallmarks of your tenure as CEO has been to generate a portfolio or shift the portfolio to become less cyclical. Clearly you couldn't have anticipated this recession. On the other hand Tektronix has put up some pretty weak performance, that debatably makes Danaher more cyclical at the margin with respect to that acquisition. So I'm curious, as you think about your healthy balance sheet and these opportunities, have you shaped or reshaped possible opportunities within Danaher to think somewhat differently about where you want to be focusing your resources?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John I think that we've always said that the focus on the acquisitions will be around our high growth, high margin businesses with particular emphasis around Med Tech, a business we've built from scratch since the last downturn. Obviously, T&amp;M is a bigger and I would argue stronger business over the long haul with Tek on board, Environmental, still a key area of interest for us and while it's small, I'd like to think that Product ID continues to garner attention for us, because we think the secular trends there are important, attractive and just have lots of legs going forward.</p>
          <p>So I think that frame is something that by and large is intact as we look at how we spend the next billion, next $5 billion, that we've got. Clearly, John as you highlight, we want to make sure that we have growth that is sustainable, growth that is predictable, and is less cyclical, less volatile as we can, but it's one dimension, not the only dimension that we look at relative to how we create value for our shareholders over the long haul. And while I appreciate you saying that none of us could have predicted what we've seen here, I think when we get to the other side, what Tek and what Fluke are going to be able to do on a global basis in the markets that they serve are going to serve our shareholders very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just the way to also frame that is simply, has there been a lesson learned given this downturn -- I mean Tektronix was the biggest deal you'd ever done, as you think about other acquisitions that may apply to perhaps shaping some of those future transactions or the thought process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I certainly think that we -- I'd like to think that we learn from every deal and we learn from every toss and turn of the ship in this storm, whether be that business or others. So certainly as we look at assets, John, that we may want to bring in, how they are performing, both at the top and at the bottom in this storm is something that we are analyzing very carefully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>And our next question comes from John Baliotti of FTN Equity Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Larry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It seems like as we're listening to other companies report and kind of what John was alluding to earlier, it seems like lot of companies that are maybe calling the bottom or calling some stability to a degree actually supply into OEMs, some of them like you and also distributors that you sell into. I'm just wondering, is that inconsistent, I mean you said the rate of decline in the quarter lessened -- is that consistent, what you are hearing -- I'm sure you guys are monitoring some of the other quarters that are coming out from other companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that again, we are not going to try to get out too far here on the macro call, I think that we know we got hit disproportionately with some of the -- I don't want to call them one timers but, the sorts of negative hits to volume like the channel destocks and the like, that should moderate and the sooner we get back to end use demand the better off, I know, our company will be.</p>
          <p>But as to when that occurs -- and we are certainly closer to it than not but I just don't think we're going to say that, in the third week of March things have stabilized, but again I would share with you that I think just the tone and the visibility, to contrast mid-April here to mid-January, is better. Doesn't mean we're still not looking at declines, we talked about the second quarter already; but I do think that a little bit more clarity here, though it isn't great, is going to be helpful to the psychology. And again I think as we work through the quarter, I'd like to think when we're talking here at 90 days forward that we do have a better handle on that. But I am cautiously optimistic in that regard but not going to pound the table that we found that hard bottom in mid-March.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you'd obviously like to see a more sustainable trend than what you've been seeing more recently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and maybe John was right relative to our posture being a bit conservative. It's certainly not the way we operate. Again, I think that as we look at the environment there are a lot of things we can control that we're pleased with. It has been a rather fluid start to the year. I think there are some uncertainties still out there; a number of you have written about those. But by and large we know at a minimum those destocks are going to -- are going to play themselves out here over the next quarter or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I think it's, I think given the environment, I think the right way is not to expect things to dramatically change given what you've just seen, especially given the history that your company has, and I don't think you want to change that playbook at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, just a few questions. First; back to Tek, could you lay out in a bit more detail, how you're performing versus -- in terms of DBS implementation, savings estimate and margin expansion in light of the volume deleveraging there. How should we think about that, sort of from a return on capital perspective, and where you're headed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, a couple of points would be -- if you look at the first quarter, I think just to try to put it to the Street numbers and then try to talk to some other points, we met the top-line by 60 million and clearly, that was the lower core growth. But, our earnings came, we were a penny short of consensus but included in that was $0.03 of restructuring, we also had about a penny from litigation settlements and expense as well. And our decremental margins were in the low 20s, and with the business' gross margins in the mid 40s, I think it gives you a sense of kind of the benefit of what the Q4 restructuring. I think overall we were very pleased with sort of the payback we're getting out of what we did in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But, and then diving into sort of the DBS implementation at Tek and how it's on track. And I was also looking at the 225 basis point takeout on the acquisition related cost for professional instrumentation that would have changed how I thought about those margins. I'm just trying to get a sense for, is this on track and to what at Tektronix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, the 225 million was the one-time charges from Tektronix a year ago --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'm not sure that's really <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but I'm looking at sort of the fact that it was, you were saying that it was sort of performing better versus last year, and once you take that out from last year, I'm just trying to understand is -- to what extent is any part of the DBS implementation at Tek off track or on track given the much tougher top-line environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I would share with you that with respect to the integration and the embrace and the use of DBS at Tek we are ahead of where we could have ever hoped to be at this point. Again, a difficult sales environment for the business. But I think across many functions at Tektronix, at senior levels, at lower levels in the organization, this team has done a fantastic job really learning the tools, understanding the methodology and their implementation and have done a -- I think just a terrific job really putting them to good use at Tektronix.</p>
          <p>I was out there just a few weeks ago at their engineering conference, we saw lots of examples where their new product development processes have been improved, certainly within manufacturing, within selling and the back offices. Just -- we could take the rest of this call talking about the job that they've done to improve deliveries, to improve efficiencies, reduce costs, be more innovative. I just -- I like the way that business is performing from that perspective. We'd obviously like more revenue, it'd be more impactful on a call like this. But I think you should have no worries about where that team is with respect to DBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the restructuring, additional restructuring dollars, how are you thinking about -- how should we think about allocating that across the different businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that, again, we bit off quite a bit last year, Steve, and the execution has to date been very good. So the further acceleration, I think, is timely for us, not to mention the economy. I think that as we look at the execution, all businesses are going to be impacted in one way or another. But as you might expect, those businesses that are feeling the brunt, the full brunt of the downturn, are going to be more active in this next wave of cost reductions. So the spend and the benefit will correlate pretty well with the revenue that we've turned in here in the first quarter, and in turn what we're talking about for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just one final sort of more micro question in terms of the spending in municipalities on water quality and water infrastructure, how do you view sort of the trade-off between financing problems, lower tax base et cetera, and potential additional stimulus coming out there in your businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly where we see that playing out today, we have really seen no impact whatsoever at Trojan, those big programs, which by and large are hard to stop, have continued well. I think we've seen some trimming, some postponing, some uncertainty around muni budgets that have impacted some of the instrumentation sales. And I would say that's not only a U.S. phenomenon, we saw a bit of that in Europe as well and in parts of Asia. But consumable sales have stayed very steady. All those businesses, I suspect, will be beneficiaries, not in big chunks but in more subtle, more persistent and consistent ways from any stimulus spending that we may see, again, not only here but elsewhere around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Richard Eastman of Robert Baird.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Larry, just a quick follow up again on Tektronix. Did you say or did Dan say that the operating margin in the first quarter was 15%? Does that exclude any restructuring costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's actually -- that's before the non-cash intangible amortization but, yes, that was the operating margin of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And could you just size the network management piece of Tektronix just in dollars roughly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Give me a second, I can give you a gist.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Roughly. Larry, just maybe, in the meantime, just in terms of -- nice work on the capital structure here early in the year. And the question would be as you look forward and you look into the acquisition pipeline that you have, do you feel more comfortable at this point with your ability to assess the target company's EBITDA that you're looking at? I mean, we talk about stabilization in the economy and the business models. Are you feeling increasingly confident that you know what you're going to be paying for here going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the short answer there, Rick, is yes. Again, we're not trying to call a hard bottom here. But with the fourth quarter and the first quarter behind us, we've seen a lot of the noise that's going to impact any potential business we would like to bring on. And we can see how it has played out, come to a point of view obviously as to what is to come. So it's a bit of a pressure test, a stress test, if you will, to use the popular term that every business has taken here. So I think that is a constructive part of the analysis as we look to deploy that capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does it lead you down the path of larger potential acquisitions, given that the risk maybe is minimized -- is more minimized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's the -- I think you could have a good debate around whether that's true or not for a company like ours. I mean, small companies like the three we've just brought in, you could argue that that sort of spending mitigates risk in one way, obviously a large company that we understand well, that fits well for us, where DBS is going to be applicable and add value, that's certainly a possibility and we're going to look at those just as we will the dozen or so smaller bolt-ons we typically do in the course of a year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, on your question, in '09, we expect Tek Comm to be a little greater than 25%</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of Tek.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of all of Tek. Which has obviously grown as they've kind of outperformed the general Test and Measurement space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then did you also say that Accu-Sort was up year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They were up slightly given the timing of some projects. Given, obviously, some cutback in spending here, we think they will be down in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But they were up slightly in the first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first, all right, well, finally. All right, hey, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And due to time constraints, our final question comes from Nicole Parent of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our final call and maybe your final question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is. Thanks, Larry. Two final questions, could you give us a sense -- I mean you talked about U.S. and Western Europe being soft. Could you give us a sense just in the context of the incremental restructuring, how much is happening in the U.S., how much is happening in Europe, and where you think we are in Europe relative to the U.S. deceleration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that with what we -- to take the second one first Nicole. I think when you look at what we saw in the quarter, Europe and the U.S. were down pretty much in lock step with each other. I think that the way '08 played out, my own view is that the U.S. will come back sooner than Europe will, or at least the moderation in the declines will occur here first in all likelihood.</p>
          <p>With respect to the additional cost actions, as we look at the U.S./non-U.S. split there it's actually pretty well balanced again. Where we have some of our cost imperatives in Europe, I think accelerating the list will allow us to take some rooftops out that are not wildly economic for us. But there are some things that we can still do in the U.S., which we are going tee up as part of this acceleration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one last one, I think over the last 12 to 18 or 24 months, you guys have really benefited from some strong new product introductions, you stepped up the R&amp;D, how do we think about R&amp;D as a percentage of sales for the remainder of the year, and as you look into 2010? And how do you kind of think about investment in new products in this type of an environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think as we reduce cost, the way we talk about it internally, is we want to make sure we're dynamically allocating resources to protect the real growth drivers and to fund fully to the extent possible the good out year contributors. So you saw us hold R&amp;D as a percent of sales in line, that suggests a decline in the first quarter by and large that was an FX effect, a little bit of the Tek restructuring and resetting there going on. And a couple of the bigger programs like Calypso at VJ, AQT at Radiometer slowing their rate of spend. But I'm headed out Monday night to our innovation conference, where we're going to bring that group together. I think that's a group that's very important to us, those investments are ones by and large protected even in this environment.</p>
          <p>And I think if you look at the first quarter, where we've outperformed, I think you can attribute it to a number of the innovations that have come to market; whether we talk about some of the new Med Tech products, like the Twisted Files, Sybron, we talked a bit about Calypso and Product ID, Gilbarco doing very well in the payment space and obviously, in California around enhanced vapor recovery. So that's an important part of this business and our strategy no less today than it was a year or five years ago. And that will be the case through this year and next and going forward. No changes there.</p>
