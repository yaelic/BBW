          <p>Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call.  I've been looking forward to this call.  Revenue this quarter was 438 million, and growth was 69% year-over-year.  According to our research, only two other enterprise software companies have grown at or more than 50% year-over-year after  they hit 1 billion in revenues.  We're pleased to be heading this way.  To the leadership we have in the industry and the strategy and execution across all aspects of the business, we plan to continue at approximately this growth rate through 2008.</p>
          <p>For 10 years now, VMware has demonstrated the ability to deliver superb quality and market-expanding solutions well ahead of the competition.  We now have the benefit of a well-developed multi-tiered distribution model, and with our new solution areas gaining traction, can see our way to continuing this sort of growth well beyond 2008.  We're leading in virtual desktops and virtual data centers.  We're leading in applying that virtualization to business continuity, automation and management, security and software application delivery via virtual appliances.  Moreover, customers are in the early stages of transforming their data centers, ultimately into compute clouds that leverage both on premise and off premise resources.</p>
          <p>VMware virtualization is enabling this vision of cloud computing and we're making it a reality.  Many size today's virtualization market by just the consolidation opportunity, and that is a very large market.  This is good for VMware because as servers become consolidated through virtualization, customers progressively adopt more of our products.  We see customers moving through five distinct stages of deployment.  There's an even larger opportunity for VMware's higher value products, and I'll discuss this later in the call.</p>
          <p>While there could be short term fluctuations, we're re-affirming our 50% guidance for the year, and in the interest of providing more transparency, are guiding for approximately 55% growth in Q2.  I'll now turn the call over to Mark. He'll provide more details on our results for Q1 and our outlook going forward, and then I'll close with a discussion of the business.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Diane.  Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today.  This was another strong quarter for WMware and we're very pleased with our Q1 results.  Our balance sheet remains strong.  We ended the first quarter with $1.3 billion in cash, up 75 million from the prior quarter.  Deferred revenue, representing revenue for future periods that we have not yet recognized, increased 88% from a year ago to $641 million and is up 16% from the end of Q4 2007.  We clearly have the resources to continue investing in the long term growth plans we have to further secure our leadership in this exciting and expanding new industry.  Let me emphasize, once again, that investing in our long term leadership is exactly what we intend to do.  As we begin Q2, we have over 5,700 people around the world.</p>
          <p>Despite turbulence in the US economy and increased competitive noise, our operating results reflect strong customer demand across all geographies including the US.  They reflect both an increased adoption of enterprise agreements by our large customers and an increase in the number of smaller transactions delivered through our strong channel partner network.  As you know we measure our operating results both on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis.  The non-GAAP results are what we use to measure our specific business operations.  We've reviewed the differences in these measures together on prior calls and are pleased with our results by either measure, but I will speak here in non-GAAP terms.</p>
          <p>In our first quarter, revenue was $438 million, operating profit was $106 million and diluted EPS was $0.22. These numbers represent increases of 69%, 62% and 38% respectively over Q1 of 2007. In considering these percentages let me remind you that EPS comparisons with quarters during which we were wholly owned by EMC do not take into account the dilution from the IPO, sale of shares to Intel or dilution associated with our important employee equity programs which now involve use of our own stock.</p>
          <p>Geographically, US revenues for the first quarter were $225 million, representing 51% of total revenues, an increase of 65% over Q1 of 2007. International revenues increased 74% to $213 million. Our international markets were particularly strong for us this quarter with triple-digit growth in bookings in Australia, Brazil, Russia, India, China and others.</p>
          <p>License revenue, revenue which is primarily recognized when we ship our products, was $294 million, an increase of 73% compared to the first quarter of 2007. Service revenue, revenue that we recognize over time and consisting of support, maintenance and professional services, was $144 million, an increase of 62% compared to Q1 2007.</p>
          <p>Our reported revenue is affected by changes in deferred revenues from quarter to quarter. At quarter end deferred revenues of $641 million consisted of $32 million of license and $609 million of services revenue. We're pleased with the increase in deferred revenues this quarter as it is consistent with our enterprise agreement strategy.</p>
          <p>Our most comprehensive volume license offering, the enterprise agreement, serves the purpose of establishing and building long-term relationships with our customers as they commit to our infrastructure for their data center architecture. We're pleased by the increased demand that we are experiencing for enterprise agreements. Over the course of the past year we have changed how we structure these agreements to put more revenue into services to create a recurring annuity. A typical agreement includes the right to use a specified set of our products under a perpetual license, three years of support and maintenance, professional service credits and training. We generally limit the number of licenses which may be deployed and we expect the renewal of the agreements to result in further license and service revenue as customers extend virtualization in their data centers and onto their desktops.</p>
          <p>Under an enterprise agreement a portion of the revenue is attributed to the license and recognized immediately, but the majority is deferred and recognized over time which we classify as</p>
          <p>deferred services revenue.  As this program gains momentum you will likely expect to see some mix shift in our revenues from license to deferred service revenues.  These agreements drive our recurring revenue which provides us with greater visibility and predictability into our future revenue.  We also have future growth opportunity in renewals of service revenue, additional license revenue and up-sell of additional VMware value-added products.</p>
          <p>During Q1 enterprise agreements were approximately 20% of total bookings, more than triple a year ago.  Another area in which we see increasing momentum is our expanded channel network which consists of distributors, re-sellers and OEMs and is now one of the largest in the industry.  In February we introduced new programs for these channel partners to help them quickly establish and expand their virtualization practices and drive new customer acquisition.  The programs provide channel loyalty, allow us to reach additional market segments and acquire new customers.  We are seeing these programs gain traction and we are encouraged by the long-term opportunity.</p>
          <p>Turning now to non-GAAP expenses, cost of revenues for the quarter were $56 million or 12.9% of revenues, up from 11.9 in the sequential prior quarter.  This reflects a slight mix shift towards professional services as part of our enterprise agreement program.  Research and development was $102 million or 23.2% of revenues from 22.6 of revenue in the sequential prior quarter and reflects our continued determination to advance and improve our products.  Sales and marketing expenses were 137 million or 31.2% of revenues compared with 31.4% in the prior quarter and reflects the costs of our channel execution with which we are particularly pleased this quarter.</p>
          <p>And general and administrative expenses were $37 million or 8.5% of revenues compared with 8% in the prior quarter as we continued to build our global infrastructure.  Taken all together we earned non-GAAP operating income of $106 million.  This represents a 62% increase over the same quarter of the prior year, a result with which we are very pleased.</p>
          <p>A report on operating results would not be complete without a word or two on our cash flow this quarter.  As a reminder our non-GAAP operating cash flows, which exclude adjustments for capitalization under FAS 86 and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation were 152 million for the quarter compared to 98 million for Q1 2007, growth of 54%.  On a trailing 12-month basis these operating cash flows were $559 million compared to 258 million for the 12 months ended March 2007, or growth of 116%.</p>
          <p>Diane has provided our top-line guidance and I'd like to say a few more words about next quarter and the balance of the year.  In the first quarter, our operating margin of 24% was down from 25% for the same quarter of the prior year.  Because our sales occur in US dollars, but we have operating expenses in local currency, the weakening US currency, which has declined 5% against the euro since our last quarterly update, was a significant factor here.  The effect of currency reduced our operating margins by approximately $10 million or 225 basis points compared to a year ago.  While we are exploring strategies to mitigate this, these involve complex international implementations that will take time.  You should not expect to see our operating margin exposure to the weakness of the US dollar change very much in the next several quarters.</p>
          <p>What we call net interest income and other this quarter was $2.6 million, a decrease from 6.8 million in the prior quarter.  This decrease is due to $2 million less interest income on certain inter-company balances with EMC, as well as a declining interest rate on our investment portfolio.  I expect the lower amount in the first quarter to be representative of what you might expect in the second quarter after taking the impact of what interest rates may do into account.  First quarter average diluted weighted shares were 398 million and we are expecting a similar number in the second quarter, somewhere around 400 million shares.</p>
          <p>A number of factors affect our results including an uncertain domestic economy, seasonality, particularly between the third and fourth quarters, customer demand for enterprise agreements and the rate at which we invest in our business, particularly products and channels.  We fundamentally believe, and are supported in this belief by a variety of independent surveys, that our products remain first choice as companies make their IT investment decisions.  This, we believe, will continue to represent an advantage over our competitors.  This does not necessarily mean, however, that our customers will not slow their spending if economic conditions continue to deteriorate, particularly in the US.</p>
          <p>Considering these factors, we continue to expect that our revenues should grow approximately 50% in 2008.  Right now, we do anticipate a solid second quarter based on our early view of global demand with revenues growing approximately 55% compared to Q2 '07.  Once again we are very pleased with Q1.  We delivered great results, have a strong balance sheet and are really looking forward to executing on the opportunity in front of us.  With that, let me turn it back over to Diane.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark.  VMware's strategy from day one has been product and innovation driven.  We focus on quality and partner-based delivery of the ultimate customer experience.  The strategy's working very well.  Our customers use phrases like, "It's just amazing the kind of benefits," and "constantly finding new uses for it all the time."  At VMware we find these kinds of customer responses to be highly motivating.  We like delivering this kind of value, and it is a strategic and competitive imperative for us.</p>
          <p>Our partners like VMware's strategy as well.  I was recently on the East Coast meeting with partners.  They were talking about why they value their VMware partnership.  First, the brand value of VMware is significant.  Customers know that VMware is the technology leader and far ahead of the competition.  It makes it easier for them to sell complementary products and services, and this drives their average deal size up.  Second, our partners see us continuing to distance ourselves from the competition. And third, they have a long-term view of how the partnership with VMware will help them continue to grow their own customer relationships and offerings, particularly in the services area.</p>
          <p>We've been expanding our hardware-vendor partnerships, including the hundreds of certifications and also the co-development projects that deliver joint value and differentiated products to our mutual customers.  An example of this is in the announcement we made with IBM at VMware Europe, our first European Virtualization Conference held in February.</p>
          <p>VMware and IBM announced a world record for exchange scaling.  We were able to announce hosting 16,000 mailboxes on a single server, 50% higher, we believe, than any previous record.  This is why customers like the University of Plymouth in the UK use VMware to virtualize their 50,000 exchange mailboxes.  This is the largest virtualization of exchange resources that we're aware of.</p>
          <p>In order to transform their data center and move to a VMware architecture, customers are increasingly standardizing on VMware across all of their applications.  This strong trend keeps us well positioned competitively.  Once a customer standardizes on VMware, our field and partners have the opportunity to grow with them.  On an ongoing basis, they can help them get even more value from virtualization by integrating our steady stream of expanding data-center products in business continuity, desktop virtualization, app delivery, security and automation and management.</p>
          <p>Let me now take you through how these opportunities generally develop.  The adoption path generally maps to five stages that we call separate, consolidate, aggregate, automate and liberate. These five stages correspond to VMware innovations and also VMware offerings. Our field is working quite successfully with our partners to deliver on these stages as appropriate for the customer.</p>
          <p>The first stage is separate. VMware Workstation lets one computer do the job of multiple computers by separating the logical function of a device from the physical device itself. One computer can act as many different computers and run multiple OSs. Workstation is sold principally through the channel and the web and it opens up data center opportunities by giving people the VMware experience.</p>
          <p>The next stage, stage two, is consolidate. Clearly, server consolidation has been our initial killer app. It began with another VMware innovation, GSX Server, which was the first virtualization software that enabled businesses to logically partition their Windows-based servers into multiple virtual servers. Seven years later, VMware ESX Hypervisor is the runaway market leader and is the core VMware virtualization technology in use by more than 100,000 customers, including 92% of the Fortune 1,000.</p>
          <p>We're taking aggressive measures to proliferate the high-quality ESX Hypervisor through a new, ultra-small and secure footprint in our ESXi Hypervisor. ESXi is expected to ship with all the major x86 vendors this quarter, eventually enabling every new server to arrive supporting server consolidation and giving VMware and our partners the opportunity to up-sell to VMware infrastructure and much more customer value along with, again, a higher deal size.</p>
          <p>If you really want to optimize your data center, then you need stage three, which is to aggregate your servers and pool the resources and deliver capacity on demand. Many of our customers at this stage also discover that with a virtualized data center they have the best insurance policy for business continuity and disaster recovery. Some customers work towards it in stages, but others are moving right to it. We see mid-market customers move immediately to this stage. They're smaller and more agile so they can just deploy a virtualized architecture from day one. In fact, this last quarter we further segmented our field to address this opportunity.</p>
          <p>The same is true in emerging countries. I was recently in India and also China where companies are definitely in a hurry.  What this translates into for VMware is that they are skipping the early stages and just moving directly to deploying of VMware architecture as fast as they can roll it out.  This includes both desktop and server.  Security, manageability, reliability and minimal power usage for desk top deployments have very high value to our customers in the emerging countries.  More over the legacy, physical and social structure are just not an issue.  So we see this as a large growth opportunity.  In fact in Q1 we had triple-digit growth in 15 countries that would fall into the emerging category.</p>
          <p>Increasingly customers across the geographies are extending virtualization and adding desktop resources to the pool.  Workers using VMware virtual desktops get a full PC experience both online and off line. This allows them to work from anywhere and on multiple devices.  They also get the highly manageable, scalable and reliable VMware infrastructure backing the productivity of their PC users.  The desktop is an area that VMware is investing in heavily and we are innovating at a rapid pace.  We plan continued leadership in this area.</p>
          <p>Stage four is the automation phase.  This is an exciting and fast-moving opportunity.  Automation is the next transformation area in the virtual data center.  This quarter we're shipping an automation bundle that includes products for managing virtual machines across their entire life cycles, automating the lab environment for test in dev, automating the application life cycle and automating disaster recovery processes, bringing disaster recovery to applications that before just weren't candidates.   These products work on top of VI and work with all of our major storage partners.  The interest in them has been very high.  Our partners are excited about the opportunity that the automation product provides for them to deliver more services offerings to their customers.  We're excited about how together with our partners these new products and services will increase VMware's momentum.</p>
          <p>The fifth and final stage is liberate.  This means as virtualization becomes pervasive it will be available across corporate boundaries with virtual machines distributed both on and off premise, well secured and well managed.  It is the age of the cloud and this presents another opportunity for VMware.  The proof points can be seen in our increasing traction in hosting and with service providers.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to execute on other fronts as well.  SMBs are an area where we already do a significant amount of business.  The foundation and standard editions of our VMware Infrastructure 3 suite, provides the best TCO for small and medium businesses embarking on virtualization.  Our newly introduced SMB-targeted virtual infrastructure acceleration bundle gained great traction in Q1.  And finally, we complement our innovative product strategy with our also innovative multi-tiered distribution strategy with partners.</p>
          <p>VMware has a unique win-win approach to partnering and we're in the fortunate position of having products that complement and interoperate with hundreds of offerings from our partners.  Q1 was another solid quarter of strong execution with our technology, consulting and channel partners.</p>
          <p>So to wrap up, let me reiterate the key strengths driving VMware's strong position in the marketplace.  VMware is doing what few companies have achieved in terms of revenue growth.  And we're clearly maintaining our excellent product and go-to-market execution as we grow on all these fronts.  Demand for VMware solutions across all geographies is very strong, as is our customer and partner following.  Our partners don't hit customer objections when selling VMware and they appreciate the growing suite of services resulting from our broadening VMware portfolio, particularly in management and automation.</p>
          <p>VMware has more than 6,000 employees, passionate about making our customers and partners successful.  And VMware has more virtualization expertise than any other company on the planet.  VMware has the lead in virtual desktop, business continuity, automation and management, virtual security, and software applications as virtual appliances.  Thank you for listening, and now Mark and I would like to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  And we'll take our first question from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Diane, first question I have for you really is tied to kind of the trends and what your customers' feedback was in the quarter.  Obviously, there's a lot of concerns on the economy.  Obviously increasing concerns on competition.  As you'll think about kind of the feedback from customers, your long-time customers and new customers, what was the general kind of commentary on why they were buying or why they decided to pause the plan of virtualization in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Brent, as you know our product suite has a very high ROI, and so that puts us in a really good position for getting wallet share as the economy gets a little more uncertain.  And I would say that we see that in our customers, where they're going ahead.  We increased the number of big deals we did, we were able to close deals, big deals in the financial sector.  People are definitely talking about the economy, but we don't see hesitation with our customers.  They're pretty eager to deploy the VMware infrastructure as an architecture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and on the desktop side, was there any kind of acceleration there, or pause on the desktop side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  The desktop, as we've thought for sometime, it's a major infrastructure change, and so we don't see that happening immediately, but we were pleasantly surprised to see a big uptake in the number of pilots.  So 2008 seems to be the year of the pilot, and we've got hundreds of thousands of deployments in pilots that we're starting to see, but we believe 2009 is going to be the year they roll these things out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Mark, on the operating margin decline this quarter, can you just give us a sense -- is that something we should expect as a trough level in how to think about the rest of the year with the 24% base you set up in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Brent, as I mentioned on the call we were hit pretty hard with currency.  We have consciously gone to invest globally as a business, and we're selling only in local dollars, and so we were hit hard this quarter, and we see that continuing on for the next couple of quarters.  It's an important point, as we've always said, is that we're really looking to invest in this business, and we're not trying to optimize for quarter-to-quarter operating margins.  That said, we still think the mid-20s is the right intermediate place to think about our operating margins. But regardless of troughs that we might see, be it from revenues or increases in costs for whatever the reasons, we're not going to optimize for operating margins.  We're going to continue to invest in the business, in our products, in our channels, and in the infrastructure to support it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much.  Mark, last quarter you noted that the November and December OEM revenues obviously flow into the first quarter and I think last quarter the deferred license number was somewhere in the area of 54 million and I think you noted it as 32 million this quarter.  Could you just give me some, I guess, just background?  Is that what we should expect sort of normally from a seasonal point of view?  Did you see any sort of deceleration?  I mean it didn't seem that way, but did you see any deceleration February, March because that actually doesn't show up until the second quarter?  Could you just try to frame that for me just so I understand some of the volatility in that number?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure Kirk and you need to disconnect deferred revenue from the recognition on the OEMs because the OEM revenue that we recognize in arrears isn't on the balance sheet.  And so we see some seasonality from the x86 system vendors.  We are recognizing their shipments towards the end of the fourth quarter and our first quarter and then the seasonality that they have in the first quarter will be recognized in our second quarter.  With respect to deferred revenue, overall, we look at the number in total and we're really pleased with the growth that we had, 88% year-over-year in total deferred revenue.  The deferred license revenue is, it's really based on product shipment and so it's going to have a certain amount of volatility to it but the deferred service revenue is part of our strategy with entering into long term enterprise agreements and it's much more predictable and gives us a lot of visibility into the quarter and the year ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys.  I noticed that R&amp;D significantly jumped as a percentage of revenue, it's the highest going back the last couple of years.  Within the engineering organization where are most of these bodies going?  In other words, is a lot of this porting and certifying on new hardware units from new partners?  Is it new releases of the core Hypervisor engine?  Is it enhancing existing management products or is it net new sort of greenfield development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know R&amp;D is sort of a key strength of VMware's differentiation and we've got quite a great track record of continual innovation, pretty amazing innovation coming out, which has got us to five phases of virtualization deployment. So we do continually invest in our R&amp;D and they are doing all of the above. We are certifying for more platforms, we're significantly broadening our product portfolio and we did come out with a new small footprint, highly secure Hypervisor. So all of the above, great investment because of the superb competition lead that VMware's got.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on your revenue outlook for next quarter? Your guidance implies about 5% sequential revenue growth, that's actually a deceleration in the sequential revenue growth that you experienced this quarter, and it's dramatically lower than the 20-plus percent sequential growth you've experienced in Q2 over the last two years. So the question is, ultimately, what are you seeing or what might be changing that appears to be calling for a relatively dramatic deceleration in your revenue run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Toni, there's a number of factors. One is that we're providing several new data points. First 50% revenue guidance for the year, which we gave back in January, and now we have the Q1 results and then providing the 50 -- approximately 55% growth in the second quarter. As I've already mentioned there is some seasonality from the OEM business and that we're recognizing revenue in our Q1 from the OEMs late Q4 shipments and then we have their seasonality affecting our Q2. Some of it's related to product cycle and the shipments that we had in Q1 from Q4 deferred license revenue, but importantly is really the shift that we're seeing in enterprise agreements, and the ability for us to develop long-term relationships with our customers.  Now that growth year-over-year was quite significant, it tripled during the first quarter from Q1 of last year, and we expect that trend to continue and we're really excited about it.  As Diane mentioned, it was a conscious strategy on our part to create the annuity of more service revenue, and it gives us the opportunity to sell more into those organizations both with value-added products, with renewals and with additional service offerings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, if I could just follow up on that last point.  I appreciate the change in the model from moving from license revenue to deferred-services revenue.  At least on the, for this quarter, we actually didn't really see much impact on license revenue.  They were pretty close to normal sequential patterns.  So the question is, why would we start to see that dramatically in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well part of that is from the effects on this quarter of the other items I mentioned, the OEM revenue, license revenue coming in on seasonal shipments, and that's -- just that this program is continuing to build and to ramp up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we should be thinking about the OEM revenue recognized in Q1 as being lower than the OEM revenue recognized in Q2 despite the fact that total licenses went up sequentially and despite the fact that you've been pushing OEM partners more and more?  So the -- effectively what you're saying is the revenue recognized by OEM partners in Q1, or in the back half of Q1 was lower than it was in Q4?  Is that what we should be taking away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  We're seeing some of the same, the seasonality from our OEM...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Toni, if I could just &#x2013; Toni, I think you want to look at the total revenue and the total deferred revenue, and if you look at those numbers and then look at your changes in deferred revenue, you'll see that it's not quite as strong an affect as you're saying.  But we feel very good about Q2, but when we look at it, we're looking at how's the market growing, we're looking at the economy, and then we are, as Mark points out, seeing an increase in the large deals, which we see as a very good thing.  But we did see an increase in transactions, and that, and the increase in transactions is also continuing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you.  I actually had a follow-up to Toni's question, and I was wondering, I guess two questions, to follow-up on Toni's, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, you mentioned, Mark, seasonality you called out in particular 2Q to 3Q expectations.  And I guess I'm just wondering if you could share with us given your sequential growth expectations for the second quarter, your seasonality does appear to be changing versus what you've seen over the past few quarters.  Can you give us any qualitative commentary that might help setting expectations in Q3 given that that's a normally a seasonally weak period for sales in Europe and the US for most software companies.  And the follow-up question would be just on head count plans for 2008 if you could share with us where you expect headcounts to go.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Heather.  Again, as we provided guidance for the second quarter that was really to help you frame and think about the entire year in relation to the 50% guidance for the year.  And you need to think about the seasonality between the third quarter and the fourth quarter as you look out to the second half of the year.  If you look at last year the overall change in bookings -- license plus the change in deferred revenue you see that the second quarter and the third quarter were quite similar a year ago.  And so just as you look ahead to the second half and try to break revenue into quarters, that was just designed to give you a little bit of help there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I guess the question is is that if you're looking at about 5% total revenue growth or sequential revenue growth in 2Q, I believe -- I don't have consensus open but the Street's double that, more than double that for Q3, which is usually a seasonally weaker period, again, having you want us to focus more on total revenue than licensed revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  We, as we gave guidance at the end of January, at the end of the fourth quarter, we didn't break it out by quarters and so we feel really good about the first quarter and also really confident about how the year is shaping up and so we wanted to put just a little bit of a bridge as to what we thought the first half was looking like.  And I think some of the estimates may have come in a little lower in the first quarter and a little higher in the second quarter.  Overall it was like, we were just like really pleased with the demand that we've seen.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just so I understand the Q2 license revenue guidance correctly and correct me if I'm wrong, you did have the benefit of OEM bookings from the December quarter that helped your March quarter.  And also when I look at the deferred revenue license component it looks like it went down from 54 million in Q4 to 32 million in Q1; so it's easy to see how you kind of had the strong license revenue quarter that you did in the March quarter.  Just so I'm sure about this, in light of that, you want to be a little bit more conservative about your Q2 license revenue assumption because as people seem to be coming to the conclusion the growth rate sequentially seems to be a little bit anemic, but is the reason for that, primarily what we just talked about, the OEM bleed through and you're still catching up on the seasonality of that and also the deferred revenue license component that went down 54 to 32, so you need time to rebuild the pipeline and then it sounds like you're optimistic about the year, but a bit of a pause in rebuild in Q2, is that the way to characterize it or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's a combination of factors and what we're really driving towards is to look at the overall bookings and the overall deferred revenue that we are driving as our relationships change, as customers become more mature and go towards enterprise agreements.  There is some seasonality from the OEM business that is a little bit different than you'd expect from the hardware manufacturers because we're recognizing in arrears.  But as we enter Q2, we're really happy with the pipeline and just really happy with the overall growth in deferred...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you exclude the ELAs, we had great license growth regardless.  And if you factor out the ELAs it was even better.  And then with the ELAs, you have to remember that we are consciously changing our model and that those ELAs are becoming 50, 60% services.  Okay?  The enterprise -- well not just the ELAs, volume agreements, enterprise agreements, we have three kinds of high volume agreements that we do do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Diane, actually, what you seem to be hitting on seems to be a very important aspect of your business model that I think we should pay closer attention to.  So what you're saying is that in a typical data license to maintenance split is changing, that it's becoming, really a maintenance license and emerging what you'd call subscription revenue, it sounds like, because when you say services, most people seem to think of services as time and materials using consultants but when you say services, you're...</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon everyone.  Regarding pricing, can you talk about your pricing assumptions for the remainder of the year as some of the competitors come out to market with new pricing models?  Clearly as some of these competitive offerings mature we're probably going to start to see customers start to look at some of these other vendors.  So just kind of walk us through some of your pricing assumptions please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Izzy.  We have now segmented our offerings somewhat to correspond with those different stages of virtualization where you have the foundation SKU on up to the enterprise SKU.  And as you know our strategy for years now has been to increase the value in that enterprise SKU.  We keep -- that's a bundle and we keep adding value and that strategy is working extremely well so we haven't had pricing pressure there and that just continues.  So we're adding bundles for the SMBs and we're continuing to raise awareness around the different offerings that we have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Sorry I'm going to go back to the topic Kash was talking about.  Diane we understand that now you're going to recognizing services or maintenance like revenue over time.  But you're also, the way I understand it anyway is you'll recognize the cost of those services as they're also incurred and as you recognize the revenue.  However your cost of services has gone up as a percentage of services revenue.  It was actually higher than we thought it would be and it's higher than it's been. It's actually gradually gone up, I think, every quarter over the last five. Just curious, you would think that that would sort of level off at some point or go down, I'm just curious how we should be modeling this going forward and actually, and why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, what you're seeing right now in the services gross margin is the fact that although our professional service offerings are small as a relative part of our business they have been growing. We also are, once we enter into an enterprise agreement with a customer, want to spend a lot of time with them to make sure that their deployments and their strategies are, they're able to achieve what they want to achieve out of it, and so there's a certain element of us having ams in those accounts and working with those accounts. So we're seeing an uptick there as well as partially a currency effect from the PSO organization in international countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Mark, you have been signing more enterprise agreements, but I guess, can you give us any kind of guidance as far as how we're modeling it out? I would expect at some point anyway that would sort of level off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at this point we're still at the very early stages. It was about 20% of overall bookings this quarter, which is certainly an acceleration; and we're seeing a lot of interest as customers begin to do &#x2013; to get more and more comfortable and decide to virtualize their data centers. So at least for the foreseeable future we believe that will increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the other point also to take into account is, this is great when customers move to a VMware-based architecture because of our ridge pipeline for new products which actually really increased the value of the virtualized architecture and we're rolling out pretty steadily this quarter a whole slew of management and automation products in a bundle, and you'll see more and more of that. So as we get more footprint out there that's pure goodness.</p>
