        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome to Biogen IDEC's Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go the Investor Relations section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. We've also posted slides on our website that outline the topics discussed on today's call.</p>
          <p>As usual, we'll start with the Safe Harbor statement. Comments made in this conference call include forward-looking statements about our expected future results, our long term operational and financial goals, the sales potential of TYSABRI and other products, the potential markets for our products, pipeline advancements and regulatory actions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. You should carefully review the risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release, and in the risk factors sections of our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligations to publicly update any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Today on the call, I'm joined by Jim Mullen, CEO of Biogen IDEC; Dr. Al Sandrock, SVP and Head of our Neurology R&amp;D organization; Bob Hamm, our Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Clancy, CFO and Executive Vice President of Finance.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn the call over to Jim Mullen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Eric. Good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be able to report another solid quarter continuing on our Q2 performance. Not only was our financial performance strong, but we also made significant progress in our pipeline. Total revenue grew to more than 1.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter 2009 was up 14% over last year to $1.12. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve our full-year operating plan.</p>
          <p>AVONEX revenues were $580 million, supported by the long-term safety and efficacy profile. In the U.S., AVONEX continued to see market share decline and we're working towards improvements here, as our COO Bob Hamm will detail in his comments, and we think this performance can be turned around. In addition, AVONEX performance has been impacted by growth in our Access Program that provides free drugs to patients who cannot afford the therapy. As we have discussed before, this correlates closely with unemployment trends.</p>
          <p>Internationally AVONEX has picked up market share and continues to grow in volume. This is important because the international MS market is both larger and growing more rapidly than U.S. markets. We are pleased to have our Method-of-Use patent issued in the U.S. covering AVONEX through 2026, and Bob will discuss the implications.</p>
          <p>TYSABRI patient growth continued through the summer. Nearly 3,000 net new patients were added in Q3, for a total of approximately 46,200 patients currently on therapy; we're at 30% growth year over year. We achieved TYSABRI global in-market net sales in the quarter of more than 282 million, up 19% year over year, resulting from the continued success of our marketing and sales efforts focused on TYSABRI's compelling efficacy. We booked $207 million of this, net of hedge, on our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Internationally, we saw some expected seasonality over the summer as net new patients add dipped in August and then recovered in September. We continue to look forward and evaluate methods and approaches to further identifying risk factors for PML [Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy], which Al Sandrock, who leads the neurology R&amp;D organization, will speak to later. Revenues from the RITUXAN unconsolidated joint business was 284 million on net U.S. sales of 670. Bob Hamm will also take you through an update on our commercial franchise.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline progressed nicely during the quarter. Strategically, our pipeline is focused on first-in-class or best-in-class specialty products in diseases with high unmet need and global applications. I'll provide a couple of examples of recent positive developments and upcoming milestones.</p>
          <p>Yesterday, we and our partner Biovitrum announced the positive readout on our Phase 1/2 study of our long-acting Factor IX for hemophilia B, and plan to advance the program into registrational trial in 2010. Last week our partner Acorda had a successful FDA Advisory Committee on Fampridine-SR in MS, and we plan to file with the EMEA in early 2010. We completed enrollment in the third quarter for CONFIRM, the second of the two Phase 3 trials of our oral BG-12 in MS, and we're especially pleased with this accomplishment, given the size and complexity of the BG-12 Phase 2 program. And finally, readouts are expected by year end that will include Phase 2 study of Ocrelizumab for MS. Al Sandrock will give you update on a number of pipeline programs including these and others.</p>
          <p>We are reiterating our 2009 non-GAAP earnings per share to be above $3.85, and we continue to expect cash flow from operations to exceed earnings. Our CFO, Paul Clancy, will give you additional financial details.</p>
          <p>Also this morning, we are announcing a share repurchase. Related to our approximately $3 billion cash balance, our Board has authorized a share repurchase of up to 1 billion in order to return excess cash to shareholders. We expect to implement this buyback over the coming months to reduce the share count over time. This program does not impact our ability to execute against strategic or external growth opportunities, but represents the strength we see in the ability of our core products to generate significant cash flow for the company. Paul will discuss this in more detail during his comments.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the third quarter was a successful one and we are reiterating full-year 2009 guidance. Our main focus was maintaining TYSABRI patient growth and we accomplished that goal. We have strong franchises, cash flow on the balance sheet, ending the quarter with approximately $3 billion in cash and marketable securities, and we continue to focus on products, pipeline, performance as drivers of long-term shareholder value creation.</p>
          <p>I will now hand the call to Dr. Al Sandrock, Senior Vice President, Neurology R&amp;D. Al?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. Today I'll be providing a number of updates on our pipeline, with an emphasis on neurology, my area of responsibility. I'll begin with our MS portfolio. As we have said in the past, our goal with MS is simple but powerful: slow, stop and eventually reverse the disease. With AVONEX, we have made major progress on slowing the disease. Based on a growing body of unprecedented efficacy data, we believe TYSABRI goes a long way towards stopping disease activity in relapsing MS patients.</p>
          <p>Let me start with a brief remark on the benefit TYSABRI brings to patients with relapsing MS. Every day, we hear from physicians and patients about how TYSABRI has made a significant positive impact in their lives. They are corroborating the benefit that we have observed in our clinical studies on a wide array of measures of efficacy and quality of life. This drug was approved because it offers hope for many patients with this devastating disease.</p>
          <p>I would also like to provide you with the recent updates on TYSABRI safety. As I have mentioned before, TYSABRI is one of the most intensely monitored drugs on the market today. We share and discuss these data with regulators around the world on an ongoing basis, and work with them to keep healthcare providers up to date.</p>
          <p>Biogen IDEC and our partner Elan currently believe, as the recent FDA update indicated, that the risk of developing PML increases with the number of TYSABRI infusions received. We continue to believe that the overall rate of developing PML with TYSABRI remains consistent with the rate implied in the label. We have proposed, and are currently discussing with regulatory authorities, a potential label change to reflect this increased risk of PML with increased duration of TYSABRI exposure.</p>
          <p>Stepping back, it is important to remember that PML remains a rare adverse event. Outcomes have been better than previously expected and we believe the overall benefit-risk profile remains favorable. Real-world patient and physician experience continue to establish TYSABRI as a compelling option for the treatment of MS, bringing hope to many patients and transforming the care of MS patients.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we continue to allocate significant time and resources to identifying PML risk factors and in developing ways to stratify, mitigate and manage the risk. We are working on this internally, and we are also working to set up a consortium of other interested collaborators. The premise of our work is that PML in TYSABRI treated patients results from a convergence of factors, including the presence of JC virus, immune compromise, viral mutations, duration of treatment, and perhaps other factors, such as risk alleles in the host.</p>
          <p>With respect to the presence of the virus, recent published data in larger cohorts using more refined serological techniques indicate that seroprevalence is, in fact, less frequent than the textbook dogma of 80% or 90%. We have analytically validated a serological method with the goal of one day offering a commercially available assay that may inform about the relative risk of developing PML.</p>
          <p>Now on to some Neurology pipeline updates. The Neurology pipeline achieved some important milestones during the third quarter of 2009. I'll start with Fampridine-SR. This oral small molecule is a first-in-class selective blocker of voltage-gated potassium channels. It is thought to improve nerve conduction in demyelinated nerve fibers. Our partner, Acorda Therapeutics, met with an FDA Advisory Committee last Wednesday, October 14. The Advisory Committee voted 12 to 1 that clinical data on Fampridine-SR 10 mg twice daily demonstrated substantial evidence of effectiveness as a treatment to improve walking in people with MS, and voted 10 to 2 that this effect is clinically meaningful.</p>
          <p>Next, I am happy to mention that in the third quarter, we completed enrollment and confirmed the second Phase 3 trial for BG-12, our oral compound for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. As you may recall, DEFINE, the first Phase 3 trial, enrolled its last patient at the end of the first quarter of 2009. This is a significant accomplishment, especially when considering the scope of the trials, which involve more than 2,500 patients in over 25 countries.</p>
          <p>Another MS program advancing is Daclizumab, made by a high-yield process, which we call Daclizumab HYP, a humanized antibody that acts against the high affinity IL-2 receptor. During Q3, we and partner Facet Biotech made the decision to advance Daclizumab to a Phase 3 trial. This was, in part, based on the results of a planned interim futility analysis of the ongoing SELECT study. An independent safety monitoring committee analyzed a subset of the data from this ongoing trial and recommended the continuation of the SELECT trial. SELECT remains a blinded study, and will serve as one of the two trials for registration. We expect to start the Phase 3 trial during the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>On our anti-LINGO program, we have completed our GLP toxicology studies and remain on track to file a clinical trial application by the end of the year. The anti-LINGO antibody has been shown to remyelinate nerve fibers in our animal study, and thus, we hope it will help to reverse some of the damage done by diseases like multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>In terms of other pipeline updates, there are some interesting developments going on there as well. In mid-September our partner Roche announced positive data from the Phase 3 PRIMA study of RITUXAN in follicular lymphoma patients. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in patients receiving RITUXAN and standard chemotherapy, followed by a maintenance schedule of RITUXAN monotherapy, compared to patients with no maintenance treatment. The positive study was stopped early after a pre-planned interim analysis, and results will be presented in an upcoming scientific meeting.</p>
          <p>Returning to RITUXAN in rheumatoid arthritis, on October 16, the FDA issued a complete response to our sBLA seeking to attempt extend the RITUXAN label to a broader DMARD-IR [disease modifying antirheumatic drug] population. The FDA expressed concerns relating to the prolonged nature of RITUXAN mediated B-cell depletion and the risk for PML in a less refractory RA population than our current label. We expect to meet with the FDA to discuss risk-benefit for RITUXAN and then determine the appropriate next step.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, RITUXAN remains an important therapy for TNF [tumor necrosis factor]-inadequate responder RA patients. In the TNF-IR population, the FDA approved additional language to the label in October to clarify that patients being treated should receive subsequent courses every six months. Previously, there was no guidance in the label on retreatment beyond the first course, and the average retreatment interval has been seven to eight months. RITUXAN's ability to improve physical function and slow joint damage for up to two years, as demonstrated in clinical studies, has also been added. Taken together, this will allow new promotional messaging around lasting efficacy and regular dosing.</p>
          <p>In addition, there is regulatory concern about an apparent imbalance in opportunistic infections among ocrelizumab-treated RA and lupus patients in these clinical trials. Based on our recent safety review of ocrelizumab data in RA and lupus nephritis clinical trials, the ocrelizumab FILM study in methotrexate-na&#xEF;ve RA patients has been placed on clinical hold and dosing was stopped. We also decided to close the ocrelizumab BELONG study in lupus nephritis. The other ocrelizumab RA and relapsing-remitting MS studies remain ongoing. We'll work with regulators to determine the next step for these programs.</p>
          <p>Next, in October, after a strategic review of the program, we determined that the LUCID trial with lumiliximab in CLL [Chronic lymphocytic leukemia] and the TARGET trial of galiximab in NHL [non-Hodgkin's lymphoma] will not support registration. Accordingly, we decided to stop recruitment in the lumiliximab LUCID trial and prematurely end the galiximab TARGET trial. Neither decision was a consequence of any safety concerns. We are evaluating our options for these programs and are working on a path forward.</p>
          <p>On a more positive note, we were pleased to announce yesterday, with partner Biovitrum, a positive readout on our Phase 1/2 study of our Factor IX for hemophilia B and plan to advance the program to registrational trial in 2010. The trial was an open-label, multi-center safety dose-escalation study that evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of Recombinant Factor IX in severe, previously treated hemophilia B patients. We believe this compound could potentially improve the standard of care in hemophilia B, which typically requires retreatment every two or three days. If our Factor IX trial meets its primary endpoint, it may extend the interval between doses to once a week or longer.</p>
          <p>We made recent progress on several other early-stage programs as well. For example, we started a Phase 1 trial of neublastin for neuropathic pain, enrolled the first patient in a Phase 1/2 study of Anti-IGF-1R in hepatocellular carcinoma, and made progress on dose excalation on our Phase 1 studies of our Anti-TWEAK antibody in RA and Anti-cripto-DM4 toxin-conjugated antibody in solid tumors. Our discovery research efforts remain an important strength.</p>
          <p>Finally, data readouts expected by year-end include the Phase 2 study of the ocrelizumab trial in relapsing-remitting MS. In addition, we expect to fully enroll two other proof-of-concept trials by the end of the year, our trial of BG-12 in RA and interferon beta in ulcerative colitis.</p>
          <p>So, in conclusion, we continue to make progress in our pipeline and we look forward to continuing to update you on our progress in the quarters ahead.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll hand it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bob Hamm.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Al. During the third quarter, our global revenue was 1.1 billion, up 3% year over year. Third quarter RITUXAN U.S. net sales were up 2% year over year to 670 million. RITUXAN revenues on our P&amp;L were 284 million, down 5% year over year, with 6% growth in our Q3 U.S. profit share offset by a 28% decline in international RITUXAN revenues, as our ex-U.S. royalties continue to expire.</p>
          <p>Our product revenues of 802 million grew 6% year over year, with nearly flat AVONEX sales buoyed by a 21% year-over-year growth in the TYSABRI business. TYSABRI added approximately 1,000 net new patients per month during the third quarter and posted its second quarter in a row at a blockbuster run rate, with Q3 in-market sales at 282 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to the RITUXAN and CD20 franchise, a highly penetrated lymphoma market, coupled with the general downward economic pressure meant slower revenue growth overall for RITUXAN in Q3. Units declined by 1% year over year. Price growth of 5% year over year was balanced by a 27% increase in discounts and allowances, yielding an overall 2% year over year revenue growth. Operating profit outpaced revenue growth, however,, at 4% year over year due in part to discipline in spending and improved margins during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Front-line adoption and maintenance use of RITUXAN remains steady for labeled oncology indications, especially in diffuse large B cell and in Indolent Follicular NHL. Biogen IDEC and Genentech submitted two separate sBLAs in May this year for the CLL8 study in previously untreated CLL and for the REACH study in previously treated CLL. Both sBLAs were accepted and granted Priority Review status by the FDA, with a PDUFA date in November of '09. CLL launch planning activities are on track. As Al mentioned, Biogen IDEC and our partner Genentech will discuss the preliminary results with regulatory authorities worldwide for possible update of the product label.</p>
          <p>Moving to the global neurology business, AVONEX's 580 million in global revenue for Q3 is up 1% year over year. With a run rate of over 2 billion and approximately 139,000 patients on therapy worldwide, AVONEX is the foundation of our market-leading franchise in neurology. U.S. AVONEX revenue was up 8% versus prior year, with price increases taken earlier in the year mitigating underlying decline in unit volume of 8%. In the U.S. we did see an increase in the number of patients in our Access Program, as Paul will detail.</p>
          <p>During the same period in international markets, AVONEX revenue was down 8% with a 1% increase in unit volume offset by 9% decrease in net price, largely due to foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>We believe the U.S. market can perform better and have taken steps to improve that trajectory, including our expansion earlier this year of the AVONEX field force and a change in leadership of the U.S. business. We are confident that this is possible, since we are holding our share of the ABCR market in international markets and we see no reason why we can't bring the same performance and results to the U.S.</p>
          <p>Approximately half of the U.S. prescribers are now aware of the 10-year CHAMPIONS data, which demonstrate a sustained benefit over 10 years of treating patients with AVONEX from their first MS attack. This is compelling data. Of physicians who have been exposed to it, one-third have indicated they would increase their use of AVONEX in CIS patients and a quarter said they would also increase their use of AVONEX in relapsing-remitting patients.</p>
          <p>AVONEX pioneered early treatment of MS and now, with the CHAMPIONS 10-year follow-up data, we demonstrated compelling long-term benefit in patients treated after their first attack. The message is simple: AVONEX's proven efficacy and best-in-class adherence demonstrate that AVONEX has the power to work early and keep patients active longer.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are pleased to have our AVONEX method-of-use patent issued last month. The U.S. patent covers the use of AVONEX for immunomodulation, including the treatment of MS, and extends through September, 2026. The biosimilar pathway in the U.S., as we know, is still to be defined. Outside the U.S., we continue to expect biosimilar competition, but we do not see evidence of clinical activity for any biosimilar competitors at this time.</p>
          <p>Turning to TYSABRI, we had global in-market revenues of 282 million in the third quarter, a 19% increase compared to the prior year. With an over $1 billion run rate, TYSABRI is the growth driver of our Neurology franchise. We continue to see growth in the number of patients on TYSABRI, with approximately 46,200 patients receiving TYSABRI at the end of September. Of those, approximately 13,400 patients have now been on therapy for over two years. During Q3, our estimate of the average weekly net new patient growth moderated somewhat, driven by seasonality in ex-U.S. markets.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., net weekly patient add has continued to accelerate. Internationally, our estimate of net weekly patient growth slowed somewhat from prior quarter. This was driven by seasonality in Europe during the summer holidays, with lower net patient adds in July and particularly August, followed by renewed strength in September, which internationally was only down 7% from the prior quarter average.</p>
          <p>We continue to work with the global neurology community to improve their confidence in using TYSABRI safely. For instance, in Germany, Biogen IDEC has, over the past 12 months, partnered with the local neurology community to formalize relationships between more academic Reference Centers and many of the larger MS clinics, so that TYSABRI prescribing can occur in a more structured environment and according to a common protocol developed and published by the Medical Advisory Board of German MS KOLs. To date, 250 top German MS treatment centers are linked to 40 Reference Centers.</p>
          <p>We also continue to communicate with physicians about TYSABRI's unprecedented efficacy, and market research confirms that physician confidence with TYSABRI continues to improve. During the three months from June to August in the U.S., TYSABRI became the number one switch-to therapy for the first time since the first half of '08, with protaxin patients being the primary source of switches.</p>
          <p>We continue to strengthen TYSABRI's efficacy position through physician awareness of data presented at this year's ACTRIMS and AAN that demonstrates TYSABRI's ability to provide many patients with freedom from disease activity, as well as improvement in physical and mental disabilities. Based on the stream of evidence, TYSABRI is changing the treatment paradigm from failure-based to improvement-based for MS patients.</p>
          <p>Our newest program, Fampridine-SR. is progressing well. Biogen IDEC is responsible for non-U.S. development and commercialization of Fampridine. Regulatory filings are targeted in Canada by the end of this year, and in Europe during the first quarter of 2010. The recent FDA Advisory Committee on October 14 underscored the burden that walking difficulty presents to MS patients and the importance of this new therapy. We hope Fampridine-SR will become the first oral therapy to show efficacy in improving walking ability of patients across the spectrum of MS disease states, including patients with secondary progressive MS and progressive MS, for whom there has been previously no indicated treatment.</p>
          <p>On another note, finally, we're in the process of reviewing our manufacturing strategy. As many of you know, we continually look at our biologics manufacturing capacity based on the projected volumes of our marketed products, projected demand and commercial potential from our clinical programs, process improvements and other strategic considerations.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Mr. Paul Clancy, to walk you through Q3 financial statements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. Our results for the third quarter were in line with our full-year operating plan. We're pleased with this performance, especially in the context of a number of challenges this quarter, including normal seasonality, a stronger dollar year over year, and reduced RITUXAN rest of world royalties.</p>
          <p>The GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 is a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. Our Q3 GAAP diluted EPS was $0.95. Our Q3 non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.12, an increase of 14% on a year-over-year basis. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $51 million related to the amortization of intangible assets, 8 million for employee stock option expense and offsetting 13 million impact related to those items. Our amortization of the AVONEX intangible assets was lower this quarter, due to an increase in the expected lifetime revenue of AVONEX following the issuance of the 775 patents in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&amp;L operating performance of Biogen IDEC, which we believe better represents the economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally to set operational goals.</p>
          <p>Q3 total revenue was 1.121 billion, representing a 3% growth over the same period last year. Year-over-year growth was somewhat muted by foreign exchange, which had a negative impact of approximately 4%. Going through our product revenue, I'll begin with AVONEX, Q3 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was 580 million, up 1% versus the same period last year. Q3 U.S. AVONEX product revenue was $348 million, representing an 8% increase versus last year.</p>
          <p>AVONEX units in the U.S. declined approximately 8%, which was offset by price increases. In the U.S., we did experience continued increase in the number of patients supported by free drugs, which we refer to as our Access Program. The impact from supporting Access patients accounted for approximately 2 to 3% unit decline. We ended Q3 in the U.S. with approximately 2.2 weeks of inventory in the channel, down from 2.3 weeks in Q2.</p>
          <p>Q3 international AVONEX product revenue was $232 million, representing a decrease of 8% on a year-over-year basis. Remember, Q3 2008 was a strong quarter, due to the German wholesaler buy-in, which impacted the comparison this year, resulting in a small year-over-year unit increase. The unfavorable FX impacted the year-on-year comparison by approximately 25 million on AVONEX international sales. Nevertheless, AVONEX gained share outside of the U.S. in both a quarter-over-quarter basis and year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>Q3 TYSABRI worldwide Biogen IDEC product sales were 207 million, a 21% increase versus Q3 2008, and 10% increase sequential quarter. In-market sales were $282 million. More than three years after the relaunch, TYSABRI continues to deliver double-digit growth on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year basis. U.S. end-user TYSABRI sales totaled $131 million. We booked 59 million of this amount. International TYSABRI sales totaled 148 million, and this number is net of a $4 million currency hedge loss; gross international TYSABRI sales totaled $151 million.</p>
          <p>The total unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on AVONEX and TYSABRI versus Q3 2008 totaled approximately $37 million.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues referred to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We recorded 284 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a decrease of 5% on a year-over-year basis. This is broken down to three components. First, our share of the net U.S. RITUXAN profits. Net U.S. RITUXAN sales were 670 million in the quarter, up 2% versus prior year, and our Q3 profit share from that business was 203 million, up 6% versus prior year. Year over year, we benefited from price increases and lower operating expenses in the collaboration.</p>
          <p>Second, we received revenues on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. and in Q3 this was $65 million, down 28% versus prior year. This is driven by the continued expiration of rights to our royalties on a country-by-country basis outside the United States and Canada. For the majority of European countries, the first commercial sale of RITUXAN occurred in the second half of 1998. We therefore expect a sequential decrease in royalty revenues moving into Q4,, bringing this full-year number to approximately $250 million.</p>
          <p>And third, we were reimbursed $16 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN.</p>
          <p>Q3 royalties for Biogen IDEC were $35 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn to the expense lines in the P&amp;L, which include the non-GAAP adjustments that I described earlier. Q3 COGS were $93 million, representing 8% of revenues. On a year-over-year basis, we witnessed a meaningful decline in COGS as a percentage of product revenue. Our manufacturing group has been successful in implementing operations excellence initiatives, which has resulted in lower write-offs and favorable production variances this year.</p>
          <p>Q3 R&amp;D expense was $299 million, a 13% increase on a year-over-year basis, and approximately 27% of revenues. The drivers of this increase included a $20 million milestone payment to Cardiokine on the continued progression of our late stage pipeline with investments to support lixivaptan, BG-12, PEG interferon program and galiximab and lumiliximab.</p>
          <p>Q3 SG&amp;A expenses were $221 million, representing 20% of revenues and a 2% decrease in overall spend versus prior year. The year-on-year decrease benefited from the strengthening dollar and G&amp;A efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Continuing down the P&amp;L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $61 million in expense for the quarter. This represents our payment of 50% of profits outside the U.S. to Elan and the reimbursement a third party royalties incurred by Elan outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>Other income and expense for the quarter was a gain of approximately $9 million, primarily driven by realized gains on the sale of marketable securities and strategic investments as we've de-risked our portfolio in a favorable environment.</p>
          <p>Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27.7%. The decrease in the third quarter non-GAAP tax rate was due to recognizing a one-time discrete benefit associated with certain intercompany charges and foreign related taxes in conjunction with filing our 2008 tax returns. This resulted in a favorable impact of approximately 160 basis points for the quarter. We expect our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 30%.</p>
          <p>This brings us to Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.12.</p>
          <p>Our full-year guidance is essentially in line with prior communication. Full-year revenue growth is expected to be in the mid to high single-digits on a year-over-year basis, modestly changed. Operating expenses are unchanged, with full-year R&amp;D expected to be between 28 to 30% of revenue and SG&amp;A between 19 and 20%. This results in operating expenses, excluding collaboration profit share, to be between 2.1 and $2.2 billion. The non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be between 28 and 30% for the full year, and GAAP tax rate between 29 and 31% for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be above $3.85, unchanged from prior communications. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be above $2.97, which now includes the favorable impact of lower amortization of intangible assets. Our capital expenditure outlook for the full year is in the range of 150 to $160 million, modestly lower. This guidance excludes any significant business development activity in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So, Q3 kept us on course to achieve our 2009 full-year operating plan, as we drove operating margin improvement in the quarter and delivered 14% non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I'd like to provide some detail on the share repurchase program Jim alluded to in his opening comments. You may recall that Biogen IDEC has a 20 million share repurchase authorization, which was authorized by the Board in October of 2006. This program has approximately 6 million shares remaining, and has been, and will be used for annual share stabilization.</p>
          <p>Over the last few months, we've carefully reviewed three key factors that heavily influence the deployment of capital, mainly our access to credit and the health of the financial markets, the landscape for M&amp;A transactions, and the underlying cash flow generation of the company. With all these factors in mind, Biogen IDEC's Board of Directors has recently authorized an additional repurchase of up to $1 billion of common stock. This $1 billion authorization is intended to reduce our shares outstanding, with the objective of returning excess cash to shareholders. Repurchased stock in this authorization will be retired. The authorization is open-ended and shares will be purchased on the open market.</p>
          <p>The repurchase reflects our confidence in the long-term value of our common stock and we believe is an effective way of returning cash to our shareholders. We believe this strikes the right balance in our corporate finance strategy. We're confident in the projected cash flows from our core products, such that we can return capital to shareholders, while continuing to fund future growth through our pipeline.</p>
          <p>We continue to review acquisitions and external growth opportunities and believe we have the cash flow and financing capacity to capitalize on potential opportunities. We'll update you on the progress of this stock repurchase program on future earnings calls.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Jim for his closing comments.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Question on the opportunistic infections that Al mentioned regarding ocrelizumab. Just kind of looking for a little bit more information on what types of infections did you see? Have you observed these in the past with RITUXAN? And why isn't the ongoing MS trial impacted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Well it's lot of questions. We're not commenting on the types of opportunistic infections. I can say that we saw a lot of these predominantly in Asia and the reasons for the imbalance right now is unknown. In terms of the ocrelizumab, our MS trial, while it's a different indication, the unmet need is different, and that trial is actually over in terms of the efficacy readout portion, and in fact we plan to be looking at some data later this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. You mentioned that you'll be talking to the FDA about changing the label in TYSABRI in terms of a higher risk of PML when you have long duration of therapy. Would you be specifying how long patients should be treated? What kind of changes are you thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're not specifying how long they should be treated. In fact, we're not, there's no, there's not going to be any mention of terminating treatment. The overall risk is still within the rate implied in the label currently.</p>
          <p>The main reason that we're implementing this label change is predominantly that our labels worldwide are roughly harmonized in terms of what it says about duration. In some locales, our label stated that the link with duration was unknown, and clearly, that's not compatible with our current thinking, so that was the main reason for asking for label change.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the overall risk-benefit, we believe it's remained favorable and nothing major has changed. In fact, we think that the risk is basically the same as that implied in the label currently.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, just a follow up to that question with respect to the label change for TYSABRI. How often will you guys update the label, and then what would you think would be the FDA or EMEA consequences, should one of the groups, longer duration groups, exceed the 1:1,000 rate?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question, so back off on the TYSABRI for a second, and perhaps you did give us some incremental information about galiximab and lumiliximab, and wondering if you could give us a sense of how much that could potentially reduce your R&amp;D spend in the future if those programs are not continued. How much of the 27% you're spending now would come out, and could we see sort of incremental savings to R&amp;D next year? Thanks.</p>

          <p>I'd say we're right in the middle of it, so not totally prepared. It is two of -- right now, kind of two out of six or seven of our large pivotal trials, so it does have an impact as we kind of roll into next year. We do want to make sure you're mindful of the fact that this thing isn't necessarily just turned off automatically. We will kind of look at the path forward.</p>
          <p>But I think it's really as we spin into next year and the next earnings call, we'll probably able to give you a lot better visibility as it relates to that impact.</p>

          <p>Eric, if you want to dig that out while I'm addressing this one. We &#x2013; I wouldn't use this call to kind of address anything on or off of that. What I would remind you is those were set of goals in totality. They actually had product goals, pipeline goals and financial goals. As we've been around on investor conferences, I think we've tried to be clear that some of those goals were on track, some of those goals we're far exceeding, particularly on the pipeline front, and some of those goals we're kind of falling short of -- the TYSABRI patient goals, obviously. But in the totality, in the spirit of those goals that we set up, we still are certainly going after those for the 2007 through 2010 time period.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks for taking the question, I was curious about the commentary regarding a commercially available assay for relative risk of PML in TYSABRI. Were you referring to the JC virus assay or is there any interest in, I guess, returning to the Silex assay to better quantify the immune system function.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. My question, you made a comment about assessing your manufacturing capacity. Does that mean you will have excess capacity? If that's a yes, is that excess capacity a result of increase of yield or is it actually a result of lower revenue projections?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Jason, this is Jim. So it's actually a combination of a number of factors.</p>
          <p>So the first and the biggest impact is simply the high titre process for TYSABRI that got approved, which is almost four times as productive as the previous commercial process and so that's now worked its way. While that approval was earlier in the year, we're into that process now.</p>
          <p>I think the other factors are just, you drop things like LT-beta out of the pipeline, and maybe some of the other protein products; there's probably a little less pressure near-term on commercial capacity.</p>
          <p>Having said all that, I think people always have to be mindful of backup capacity, so that we have dual sourcing for key programs, and that was one of the primary reasons for cross-licensing both the Cambridge and RTP facilities, as well as having a second large-scale facility. However, having said all that, I think we believe we've got certainly sufficient capacity, and probably too much capacity over the next couple of years at live scale.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Just a general question on AVONEX. Jim, you alluded to a loss of U.S. market share.</p>
          <p>Can you maybe talk about what the drivers of that might be? Is that increased competitive activity, or maybe some change of effort on your part? And can you, without giving anything away, can you talk a little bit about what specifically you're going to do to change that dynamic? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, certainly it's increased competitiveness, but a lot it comes back to old fashioned marketing and messages and discipline around that, and what we're looking to do, what Bob's looking to do, is improve and tighten up our marketing message and deliver it in a consistent fashion, much as we've done in the international markets, which is proving to be a good strategy.</p>
          <p>And the other thing is you can start to look more regionally, or almost more specifically center-by-center, to think about how you tailor some of these messages more to the individual centers or individual regions, which sometimes have slightly different dynamics.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I wanted to get an understanding, because previously you guys have said that you did not believe that TYSABRI PML risk was related to timeline drug, and clearly something changed.</p>
          <p>So you gave us exposure numbers. Is there is something new on number of PML cases you can offer us, or is there something you can offer us as an explanation as to why you saw more patients exposed to drug during the quarter than the non-therapeutic as the third generation patients drop off during the course of the month &#x2013; or the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, we're not giving out actual patient numbers, but I can tell you, as time goes on, the numbers of the patients treated for the longer duration has increased, and our 95% confidence intervals on the incident rate narrows. And as that happens, we get more clarity about the risk. And that was the reason why we decided to update the label with this increase in the risk with the length of exposure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. We recently heard from European docs that there were a few more cases of PML, and so the number of cases runs around 17. But they said there seems to be an indication between the duration of TYSABRI treatment and PML cases, and some docs tended to focus on the longer duration therapy. So when you look at the patients who have been on the treatment for 24 months or longer, PML rate runs at around 1 in 800, which is higher than what's in the label currently.</p>
          <p>So question to you is what do you think will give you the critical threshold of a PML rate where physicians or regulatory agencies would become more cautious on TYSABRI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't want to speculate what makes regulators want to do things, but I can assure you that our current thinking is that the risk of PML, even in that third year beyond 24 months, is within the currently implied risk in the label, and so &#x2013; I'll stop there.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, so, I guess I have a follow-up question to that in some regard. In Europe you saw a slowdown in sales; you're accounting primarily to seasonality. However, we know that a number of the new PML cases came from there and you are instituting changes in Germany to try to rectify, I guess, a situation where there's perhaps less control. I'm wondering if you can just expand on what you've seen in the marketplace in terms of European physicians' perception about risk and how &#x2013; what &#x2013; explain in more detail what you're doing in Germany to counter that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually at this time, as we said, seasonality, we think, accounted for July and August, and September actually bounced back quite nicely, including levels in Germany we hadn't seen for three months or so. So I think the German authorities and the KOLs there working with us have taken a very responsible approach and just making sure that appropriate use of TYSABRI is monitored and followed up with, and -- but there's no signs that they don't think anything other than this is a risk-benefit matter and that the benefits certainly outweighs the risk.</p>

          <p>Hi, yeah, just following up on those last two questions. So can you just elaborate a little bit on patient churn with TYSABRI, or even compliance? Are you seeing any changes since the FDA recent commentary on PML risk?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not seeing that. We did see that about a year or so ago with the first cases, but thus far, we're really not seeing any reaction to other information discussions ongoing.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. On TYSABRI, can you talk about what proportion of patients in your database are implementing drug holidays and how long that holiday might be? And when you think about, when you calculate your patient -- if a patient misses two doses, are you still considering them to be on drug?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, from the data we have we're seeing only very, very isolated cases of that. We're really not seeing anything more than physician practices have been in place, probably, for a year, so, no, there's been no real change in that regard.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for allowing me to jump in with a follow-up. Just some R&amp;D questions, one on BG-12: any ideas when you might be in a position to start a combination study or will you have to get the full two-year data from the ongoing Phase 3?</p>
          <p>And then on the Factor IX, good news about going to pivotal trial. Any sense of whether you might initiate a pivotal trial for a comparable Factor VIII program? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me take that last question first. The Factor VIII IND has been submitted in Q3, as we had planned, and we're waiting for feedback on that, so we're very excited about that program, as well, and we hope to initiate Phase 1 trial with that soon after we hear the FDA feedback.</p>
          <p>In terms of BG-12, we are very interested in combination therapy. We do not feel we need to complete the Phase 3 program before we start work on combination therapy, and our plan is to initiate combination work as early as early next year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks also for the follow-up. I guess, a bigger picture question for Jim, with Al's updates of the pipeline today and the developments with Addenture, you guys have little bit less late-stage pipeline assets and I'm wondering what the share repurchase says about your willingness to do deals to backfill the pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, as Paul tried to explain, what I thought was relatively clearly, I mean, we did go through the process of looking across the M&amp;A landscape, our cash flows and what the financing markets are, and we think there has been a marked change in the financing markets in access to capital.</p>
          <p>So, our willingness to do deals is certainly not -- I wouldn't take any signal from the share buyback about our willingness to do deals. I think we're being pragmatic about what is out there, in fact, and we're going to continue to be very active on the BD front, with an emphasis to things that are late-stage programs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi guys. Just tying up a loose end, a number of 17 confirmed PML cases was put forward. Is that the number you're familiar with, and when will we get a formal update from the company on PML cases next?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, as we've said previously, we aren't going to be giving everybody the count-by-count. To the extent we do update that, that'll be in the context of medical meetings. What we will discuss are things like we discussed today, things that are meaningful to either what's going on in the marketplace or the label, and I think that's probably a more appropriate way to really discuss the risk-benefit of the compound going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. Paul, I had one quick question on amortization and just one on the guidance. So, on the amortization of intangible, acquired intangible assets, it was a big drop-off this quarter and you didn't mention that. Is that sustainable going forward and into the out years?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just on the share buyback, can you give us a sense as to, is this something you want to get done over the next few months, or is it something that's going to now get done over the long-term? Because if you look at your guidance for Q4, I'm surprised you're not raising it further, because you've already done 2.93, and you're easily on track to do more than $4 this year. So, just trying to understand what's going on here. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good question; it's a couple of questions. The amortization which affects the GAAP P&amp;L, not the non-GAAP P&amp;L, every year, we will as per kind of our accounting policy, revisit the economic useful life of that asset. That asset was put on the books when the Biogen and IDEC merger came together, and we just, with the issuance of the 775 patents, the lifetime revenue of AVONEX is projected to be a bit more durable than it was in the past year, that we do anticipate that the run rate that you saw in Q3 will be the run rate for that amortization plus or minus in Q4 and spinning into the 2010. So, and then, as per our policy that we will continue to look at that useful life on an annual basis, call it a year from now.</p>
          <p>With respect to the share buyback timing, in my comments, I kind of said that it was open-ended, so we expect to do it in a very thoughtful but way, diligent way, trying to kind of capitalize on low points in the stock price within the guidelines from a 10b-18 perspective. It won't have a meaningful impact, even if we were very aggressive, kind of, in the fourth quarter; it just won't have a meaningful impact just because of the way the share counts are accounted for 2010.</p>
