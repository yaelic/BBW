        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. A few comments before we go into the presentation. Market conditions as we all know continue to be very difficult, especially for real economy banks the way we call ourself.</p>
          <p>In light of such a situation, we are pleased to see the kind of results we have been able to produce also in this last quarter. The reaction, Intesa Sanpaolo continues to react effectively and I'm saying so because I want to thank all my people in the bank despite a very negative and probably worse than expected market condition. We keep having results in the timeline with our objectives for the year. Very rapidly, the main the points, the main messages I would like to convey.</p>
          <p>Operating performance, solid, an improved vis-&#xE0;-vis last year in the same period in most areas. The reduction of cost that we have been able to achieve and we have calculated for the end of September, do not yet take into account the measures and the actions adopted and provided for in the business plan.</p>
          <p>Risk profile, the risk profile remains under control. Cost of credit has gone down. And also in terms of net inflows of new doubtful loans, the amount has gone down over the same period of last year. Liquidity, liquidity is key in a situation in the period like the present one.</p>
          <p>Our position remains very strong. We continue to provide support to the economy and we have not been forced to any kind of deleveraging for lack of liquidity. We are, as you know, one of the very few banks that are already in line with Basel 3 in terms of net stable funding ratio, and that's the strength of ours in our opinion.</p>
          <p>Capital base also among the strongest in Europe, core Tier 1 at the end of September at 10.2%. As you know, we passed both the EBA stress test in July and the EBA exercise in October quite comfortably. And we have clearly demonstrated that Intesa Sanpaolo does not need any further capital raising. Sorry, that was not the effect of what I was saying. For all these reasons, good operating performance, risk profile under control, liquidity position that remains strong and quite strong capital base, we can confirm our dividend policy.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we have recorded a significant one-off gain, &#x20AC;1.1 billion that we used for two main purposes. The first one is they are writing down of Greek government bonds positioned with the Hellenic Railways and all the related interest rate hedging derivatives we add on the group position for a total amount of &#x20AC;593 million.</p>
          <p>The biggest amount is given to &#x2013; it's been taken to charge all the cost of the 5,000 redundancy we will have in the next three years. &#x20AC;650 million will be used to finance the exit of 5,000 people. You may recall that our business plan anticipated only 3,000 reductions, but the pressure on productivity, the need, our will to increase productivity has increased. And we have reached an agreement with our trade unions that allows us to go beyond what was initially forecasted in our business plan.</p>
          <p>Last point I want to make before we get into the presentation is about the pressure that the marketplace is today putting on the Italian government bonds. This pressure has grown in recent weeks and months and spreads that have been reached are certainly a cause for concern.</p>
          <p>However, we remain convinced that our country will meet all its obligations and progressively we will reduce our overall indebtedness. Let's not forget that very few countries in Europe have like Italy already reached a primary surplus, that's very important. And we have already passed, in the parliament, a budget laws, two budget laws actually, that will guarantee a balance budget by 2013. Both these targets are very concrete, both these targets are within our reach.</p>
          <p>Certainly, the outlook and the immediate outlook for our countries looks uncertain, but I would like to stress that all the fundamental strengths of the Italian economy are confirmed. Let's not forget the very low level of indebtedness for both households and companies' business. Let's not forget how vibrant is our manufacturing sector as the trend in exports are showing. We certainly do not have any real estate bubble and the value of both private and public assets are very significant and they can certainly contribute to the management of our account problems per say.</p>
          <p>We will &#x2013; Italy will reveal its credibility on the basis of a combination of austerity and development. We're &#x2013; we know that we will have to reduce total debt and that will be done through sustainable development and the creation of jobs. We have and we are very much aware of it to send a very clear message of this commitment of ours to the European partners.</p>
          <p>So that's the introduction and we can now move to the presentation. I would like to go directly to page five, where the main operating results are summarized. Operating income up nine months versus the nine months 2010, 1.5% increase. Operating cost down fourth year in a row and as I said, the actions provided for in the business plan are not yet part of these results.</p>
          <p>Operating margin up 4% and the total operating margin after adding also the net adjustments the provision to loans, let's say, and for risks and charges, is growing nine months compared with nine months last year by more than 13%.</p>
          <p>Page six, if for just a second we want to look at the industrial results of the bank. If we take for a moment aside the financial management of the company the impairment of the Greek bonds, the profits on trading, the income from insurance business that have been quite affected by the tensions on the markets caused by the sovereign risk. We see that the trend is clearly upward both in terms of core operating margin and in terms of core pre-tax income.</p>
          <p>Page seven, year-after-year, we keep reducing our operating cost. And the cost income is down to 54%, more than one percentage points lower than September 2010.</p>
          <p>Page eight is the business plan project I mentioned before. In the business plan, we estimated staff reduction for 3,000 people and the re-deployment of 5,000 people in new customer-facing roles.</p>
          <p>We have reached an agreement to increase the 3,000 to 5,000 in terms of staff reduction. So the cost for the re-deployment will also be lower than that. We will hire during the three years 1,000 young people, but bottom-line, we will have additional 2,000 people exiting the bank. The previous estimate of the advantages was &#x20AC;300 million and this figure will obviously significantly improve because of the new agreement we reached.</p>
          <p>All the cost, all the non-recurring charges for these incentives &#x2013; for the exit incentives, are already accounted for in the third quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>Page nine, cost income vis-&#xE0;-vis and compared with our 15 &#x2013; 14 peers in Europe. We are amongst the best. And we are quite confident that after implementing all the business plan actions and projects, we can put ourself very much at the top or amongst the first three in Europe.</p>
          <p>Page 10, cost of credit. If we compare the cost of credit nine months 2011 or nine months 2010, we have a minus three basis points. It's a good performance given the situation. The annualized cost of credit on the basis of the third quarter would be 73 basis points and the figure at the end of September includes also the acquisition we made in Parma, that is a city not far from Milano where we bought recently, as more bank.</p>
          <p>The last two pictures at the bottom of the page say that both the gross inflow of new substandard loans and gross inflow of new doubtful loans have been decreasing in the first nine months of 2011. Among the few notes we have on the top part of the page right hand side, the coverage, the total coverage of our doubtful loans is very, if I can use the word comfortable, at 128%. And the repayments from doubtful loans keep remaining structurally higher than the net book value, more than 100%  &#x2013; 150% in the nine months &#x2013; in the first nine months of the year. And let's never forget the reserve that we have on performing loans &#x20AC;2.4 billion. That is almost equity, as far as I am concerned, and that we kept defending and even increasing since the last crisis. In 2007, it was &#x20AC;2.3 billion and despite what we had in the last four years is even higher than at that time.</p>
          <p>Page 11, liquidity, the bank &#x2013; our bank is keeping &#x2013; proving its strong funding capability. We have already covered 100% of the 2011 medium-term and long-term maturities. As you see on the left hand side, top of the page, 2011 was a heavy year in terms of the maturities &#x20AC;40 million, next year it will be almost half of it. Theoretically speaking, we have, as of today, an excess of medium term and the long term funding that is already in the round of &#x20AC;20 billion. But we will certainly issue some more bonds certainly through their retail networks and when possible on the wholesale market. But the message is that we can go for certainly at least the whole of 2012 without any support from the wholesale market, if necessary.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, you have the breakdown of our direct customer deposit. You see the breakdown in retail and wholesale deposits. You have all the information, but what's relevant and what is not written in the picture is that that the &#x20AC;288 billion worth of retail deposits are more or less &#x2013; actually, exactly the same they used to be three months ago, while as planed we had a decrease in the wholesale part of the customer deposit.</p>
          <p>Let's see if there is something else on this page, no. Page 12, some more details about liquidity, we have at the end of September &#x20AC;32 billion worth of unencumbered eligible assets with Central Banks. At the end of September, we had the &#x20AC;20 billion worth of ECB funding that became &#x20AC;18.5 billion in the first days of November. We have a total amount of &#x20AC;83 billion worth of liquid assets. There used to be &#x20AC;80 billion at the end of July when we discussed our June results. And as I mentioned on that occasion, we have a project underway to elevate liquid assets to &#x20AC;100 billion in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Page 13, capital ratios, we are above 8% &#x2013; sorry, 10% in terms of Core Tier 1, 11.6% Tier 1 and almost 15% total capital. These figures already in embed the impact of the acquisition of Banca Monte Parma and also include almost &#x20AC;1 billion worth of accruals for the payment of dividends in &#x2013; on 2011 results. We have assumed the distribution of the same dividend per share on the new number of share outstanding.</p>
          <p>Page 14, the EBA stress test in July. We came out as one of the strongest banks in terms of equity, but if you add these strength, these solidity, these capital strength to the other strengths of the bank that is high liquidity, low leverage and business-model focused on commercial banking activities, then you see that our bank is one of the banks best equipped to go through a crisis like the present one.</p>
          <p>Page 15, the EBA exercise in October. I don't believe that this kind of exercise has been totally wise, but nevertheless we went through it and we proved that also after evaluating sovereign risk, we are above the 9% minimum level of acquired by EBA.</p>
          <p>Page 16, leverage, we too often forget the importance of leverage and the lessons. The two crises have taught us in terms of leverage, we were and we will remain one of the most conservative banks in terms of leverage. Obviously this decision of ours as a cost in terms of overall profitability, but we believe that what is really important is that sustainable risk adjusted profitability of the bank, at least in the medium term and the low leverage, is key to reach such to the &#x2013; such an objective.</p>
          <p>Page 17, we are amongst the banks with the highest ratio between the risk weighted asset and total asset. This is a strategy, but this is also the affect our business model. Our focus on commercial banking activities is the main reason why we have and we will keep having such high ratio between risk weighted asset and total assets. In our opinion, it's another element of low risk profile.</p>
          <p>A few words on the performance on our country. Page 18, if we look at the manufacturing turnover index, we see that Italy in the first part of 2011 is performing quite well. Exports are just below rank, Italy amongst the fastest growing and then the most competitive economies in Europe. Unemployment rates are high, but certainly are not &#x2013; we don't have the highest rates in Europe. And the last point I put on this page is the evidence of the well &#x2013; of the stability of the house, the real estate market, the house price index as you know is very stable.</p>
          <p>In terms of public accounts on page 19, very important figure is the one at the top of the page on the left hand side. We already have a primary surplus. We have planned and we have committed to have a surplus, total surplus for the public accounts already in 2013, and that's quite an accomplishment. The average life to maturity of government debt, the trend in primary balance and the state sector borrowing requirements are all consistent with the commitment we took with our European partners.</p>
          <p>Page 21, the P&amp;L of the group.  Nine months as we saw at the beginning of the presentation growth in terms of operating income, decreased our operating costs. Good growth in terms of operating margins. Good performance in terms of net adjustments to loans. And then from this line downward we have the four big extraordinary items that makes everything &#x2013; make everything a little bit foggier to understand. We have the Greek adjustments. We have the fiscal capital gain. We have the very strong capital gain we had last year for the sale of the security services and we have the restructuring fund for the 5,000 redundancies</p>
          <p>Page 22, it's the list of all the details we are using to put you in the position to make the most meaningful comparison between nine months, the net income 2010 and 2011. We have tried to list all the non-recurring items both in 2010 and 2011. You see that we have a net adjusted &#x2013; net income adjusted for these non-recurring items that are almost in line between the two years, while if you take out and if we exclude for a second all the financially related activities, we are more or less in line, if not slightly growing.</p>
          <p>Page 23, quarter &#x2013; third quarter this year on second quarter this year, very good performance in terms of net interest income. It's a bit more than we expected. So it means that the repricing exercise we launched has started even if we will see all the effects only in the fourth quarter and then structurally from first quarter 2012.</p>
          <p>The net fee and commission more or less in line with our expectations. Loss on trading, not surprisingly, but obviously a quite a big change between the two quarters, the trading loss effect obviously affects also the insurance business where we lost more than &#x20AC;100 million between the two quarters.</p>
          <p>At the end, minus 15, that is a plus if we take away trading and insurance. The good performance in terms of costs, good &#x2013; very good performance in terms of net adjustments to loans and then we have the three big one-off effects of the fiscal capital gain, the Greek devaluations and the cost &#x2013; the charges for integration and exit incentives. If we take away those elements, the industrial underlying performance of the bank as certainly a positive sign.</p>
          <p>Page 24, the same exercise we made for the nine months has been made for the two quarters in order to identify all the non-recurring items, and you see the effects.</p>
          <p>Page 25, the synthetic balance sheet of the bank. In terms of loan to customers we have a positive growth at the end of September 2011 if compared with the end of September 2010. The average volumes have grown 2.1% and that's the evidence of what I said before. We could avoid the de-leveraging other banks in Europe are now engaged in. And we are supporting the economy especially households and small and medium size companies.</p>
          <p>In terms of customer deposit, as I said before, the retail deposits are stable, the decrease is totally concentrated in short-term funding from institutional clients, while both asset under management and asset under administration have neutral flows and a performance effect between 5% and 6%.</p>
          <p>Page 26, a good quarter in terms of interest income after several quarters of decrease. The comparison between the two years show an almost stable figure, actually would be a growth, if we would exclude the impact of the reduction that we had in the first part of the year on the core deposit hedging.</p>
          <p>The trend in deposits is analyzed in the bottom part of the page on the right hand side. You see large international corporate obviously is going down for an obvious competitive effect in terms of interest rates. Public finance is going according to what we had in mind. We are growing prudently in all the other segments.</p>
          <p>Page 27, the details about net interest income is the most important revenue line and you have to be put in the position to understand the different components. Let's see at the quarter results on the left hand side, operating impact very positive both in terms of volumes and in terms of spread. Hedging obviously down given the lower level of market yields, but the increase of the hedging position we have recreated more or less the position we had before the reduction of last semester. It's a dynamic management and we decided to change the position given, to change the policy given the different trend in interest rates that the ECB could have been taken, and actually they took it. Without the effect of this decision, the decrease would have been much higher than that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the comparison between the nine months '11 and nine months 2010, both volumes only marginally, but spreads obviously created a benefit for the bank. The reduction we had in the first six months has also, sorry &#x2013; has also impacted positively the net effect of the hedging facilities.</p>
          <p>Page 28, commissions. Commissions are more or less stable despite our decision not to sell other banks and other companies' bonds. We have some decrease and it's to more or less inevitable on the commissions from management dealing in consultancy activities. The rest is performing according to plans.</p>
          <p>Page 29, profits on trading. The results &#x2013; the third quarter results are affected by unrealized losses. Let's never forget that we're not talking about definite losses because we are quite sure that to a large extent, the devaluations and the mark-to-market we had to make will come back at the end at the maturity of those positions and securities. The second quarter was very much affected by two very profitable operations, the Prada, the two capital gains on Prada and Findomestic, and thanks also to those two deals, the yearly comparison is strongly in favor of 2011.</p>
          <p>Page 30, is important. It is the usual analysis, the breakdown, we give of the trading profits. What is nice to see is that the customer related revenues income keeps growing at a stable rate. Capital market and financial asset available for sale enjoyed the two capital gains I mentioned before and have been slightly negative in the third quarter. Prop trading has been negative, but as I said before most of these losses are non-realized losses and are mark-to-market exercises. And the structure credit products, you have all the details in the appendix, proves to be stable and solid despite market conditions.</p>
          <p>Page 31, income from insurance business, we lost in terms &#x2013; because the financial management again for unrealized losses &#x20AC;100 million in the third quarter and that we expect to get them back in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>Page 32, it's only to remind that the project to create a one of the, if not there, but certainly one of the leading market player in the life insurance &#x2013; in the insurance business is underway. And we confirm that the new Intesa Sanpaolo VITA that will result from the merger of the four companies or the four insurance companies we own will be completed by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Page 33, operating cost. All the elements, all the components are moving in the right direction. The only exception but is a very desirable one has to do with adjustments because we did not stop and we did not slow any investment plan while the bank is showing, as usual, a good control of all the cost elements.</p>
          <p>Page 34, cost of credit. Good quarter, year-on-year minus 3.3%. We are below the annualized cost of credit of 2010. And we hope we will be able to keep this pace also in the last part of the year.</p>
          <p>Page 35, gross past dues and net past dues are going down and the usual breakdown of the non-performing loans.</p>
          <p>Page 36, I've already given all these information before. The only one I haven't mentioned before is the box on the right hand side, the top of the page, the non-performing loans. All the non-performing loans specific coverage is going out &#x2013; is going up, sorry, and we believe it's another good evidence of the conservatives that is embedded in our figures.</p>
          <p>Page 37, the trend in all the different &#x2013; in the inflow of new doubtful loans. All the consolidated figures are clearly going down, stable as far as the new substandard loans and that all through in different divisions.</p>
          <p>Page 38, the usual breakdown in terms of products on the left hand side, very safe portfolio and balance portfolio and the breakdown by industries and by business sectors on the right hand side. Also in this case, a quite safe situation in terms of balance amongst the different components.</p>
          <p>Page 39, the details we always provide, and there are others in the appendixes, on our sovereign risks both in the banking business, in the insurance business and the relative available for sale reserves. The last column is the loan &#x2013; the loans to governments and related entities. The total reserve at the end of September was &#x20AC;1.6 billion and the increase in the last month was in the realm of &#x20AC;200 million more.</p>
          <p>Page 40, all the possible details on the impairment on the Greek bonds, you have the different maturities and the different entities on the &#x2013; in the different lines. The nominal values, the book value pre-impairment, <mark type="ph" /> day (39:10) impairment and the book value after impairment. In order to make the analysis more feasible, we separated the total amount from the interest rate derivatives that have as policy covered the different positions.</p>
          <p>One question &#x2013; one question that might arise is what if you have to go beyond the 55% you have on the devaluation you made on the book value. Take the total nominal value &#x20AC;1 billion and therefore each 5% is &#x20AC;50 more million if necessary, we don't expect it, but in case that's the more or less the amount.</p>
          <p>Page 42, the breakdown by divisions and business units. The yellow clouds clarify the Greek &#x2013; the Greek impairment effect both at the net income level and at the adjusted EVA of the different components. We can go as usual more in detail if you're interested, but I will not go through the different divisions. All the divisions are working on the business plan projects according to plans.</p>
          <p>Page 51, summary of the summary. We believe Intesa Sanpaolo is providing the sustainable and resilient profitability despite the market environment. Liquidity and retail funding capabilities are certainly strengths of ours, but the same applies to asset quality and capital base. As I said before, the EBA stress test have been passed comfortably.</p>
          <p>And the very, very last comment is about the fact that I'm very confident that our country will build a political consensus to overcome both the immediate short-term issues we are now facing and the challenge we really have, but we can certainly tackle about the structural report needed to create new growth and new jobs.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. And now I'm obviously ready for any questions from you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We take our first question today from Giovanni Carriere of Autonomous. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. So the first one in detail on the Greek bonds impairments, if I look at your exposure last quarter it was reported to be about &#x20AC;500 million. So it looks like you have done something on the interest rate derivative hedge, could you explain a little bit the mechanics as to why the number is higher than the total exposure in the Greek bonds last quarter?</p>
          <p>Number two, in terms of your expansion plans of your liquidity buffer, right, &#x20AC;100 billion it would be helpful to understand what that means in terms of increased unencumbered collateral because you have &#x20AC;32 billion available. So does it mean another &#x20AC;10 billion, &#x20AC;15 billion, &#x20AC;20 billion? I'm not really sure how to translate the increase in total liquidity to actually what you can &#x2013; what you can repo with the ECB?</p>
          <p>And then last, I mean obviously, &#x20AC;32 billion looks like a comfortable number. That said, you still have &#x20AC;12 billion I think of CD/CP. I mean what makes you comfortable that that money is going to stick around over time? How do you see that as a buffer towards any possible further stress? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you take the page with the Greek government bond position last quarter, we had a total of book value of &#x20AC;559 million and then an AFS reserve of 2000 &#x2013; &#x20AC;227 million and that goes more or less to &#x20AC;800 million. If you add &#x20AC;200 million worth of the Hellenic Railways, you get more or less to &#x20AC;1 billion. And then there is a fiscal effect that is not that easy for me to explain, but we get exactly to the figure we have on today's figure.</p>
          <p>In terms of liquidity buffer, &#x20AC;32 billion as you're saying is does not only look, but is a comfortable figure. It's the money we can get in terms of liquidity in case of need. There is no haircut to add, we have to be careful about CDs and CPs because only part of them probably will be renewed. But I mean, we have, I mean we have already provided for almost a disappearance of this source of funding for some months to come. So the &#x20AC;32 billion is the kind of buffer we can count on and we consider that a comfortable one.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for the presentation and the useful disclosure. Couple of questions also from my side. I see as you correctly point out your retail funding deposits this table, the mix is changing a little bit, understandably perhaps less current accounts, they're not yielding so much. More bonds, how do you see the mix going forward, do you see actually a more request and more a push for saving deposits as well. If you could actually comment on that and the trends. And going back to your statement on the liquid assets and the increase that you see from a &#x20AC;80 million or your aim to have to &#x20AC;100 billion, where will the investments be? So this increase in liquid assets, where will they be held? Which sort of asset classes you're looking at because frankly I'm no longer sure what is really liquid today given what used to be liquid sovereign credits? It just doesn't seem to be so much the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of retail funding mix, the new instruments that are now available have to do with saving deposits that, as you know, were very much fiscally penalized until a few weeks ago, months ago, and now are become fiscally very competitive with the other deposits.</p>
          <p>A few days ago, the bank launched a number of products in this area in order to cover the three month, 18 month, durations. That was a sort of hole until a few months ago. Bonds will keep growing because the appetite for this kind of products is still quite high. We will do as much as we need, but as I said before, we might not need to cover all the maturities given the excess of medium/long-term funding we already enjoy today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On your savings deposits, because the natural question that is going to come is to what extent you see that there will be some natural conversion of current account into saving deposits? Clearly not everybody will want to tie money in for three months or 12 months, but there may be an element of that. How do you look at the impact on your increase on your general deposit funding cost?</p>

          <p>We will obviously try to use these new instruments for attracting new customers. Too early to say what the internal cannibalization can come, but obviously old targets and the old incentive schemes in the network are designed to avoid the kind of effect you mentioned before. For certain, we will have some transfer from current accounts to very short-term time deposit. The time deposit will be mostly concentrated in the one year and 12-month category. Liquid assets is not only &#x2013; is not just a problem of creating new liquidity and where to invest it because what we are creating is the transformation of portfolios of mortgages in such a way that in case of need they can be used as eligible assets.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon to everyone. I have a three questions, please. First, if I go back to your slide 17, which shows various weightings for you and for other banks. I think it is quite impressive to see that you have got a such a higher risk weighting, and if we were to break it down and looking at the details, for example, of the risk weightings for the residential mortgages, you come out with even more of a conservative approach, you've got the risk weighting from mortgages, which is an excess of 20%. If we look at the market even where banks lost the money on residential mortgages like the U.K. The risk weighting is below 15%, in some cases it's below 10%.</p>
          <p>So what do you think drives this risk weighting? Is there really the same model for everyone and that's just the outcome or there are differences in how conservative these models are run? And then secondly, you are not included in the 29 banks which are global SIFIs and I was wondering if that is going to give you, perhaps not straight away but over the long run, more flexibility in managing your capital base? And lastly, if there is any update on Hungary, any particular on the regulation change in residential mortgages? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question about risk weighted asset. You very rightly pointed out a point of excess conservatism, let me use this word, by our regulators. The kind of risk weighted mechanism we are having in Italy are much more prudent than in many other countries of Europe and that make that ranking even more in our favor, if that was your question.</p>
          <p>As far as global SIFIs are concerned, we did our best to be excluded from that list because we see at least for a bank like ours, only disadvantages in terms of rigidity. We have such &#x2013; we have a risk profile, we have a business model, we have a relative size that was rightly not considered a global systemic risk kind of bank. And I think they took the right decision.</p>
          <p>As far as Hungary is concerned, we have the first results after the first month, and for the time being figures are very small. As of September 30, we received application you know that anything in Hungary, households are in the position to change and to their mortgage at pre-definite exchange rate that is in their favor, but only &#x20AC;20 million worth of mortgages have been received, &#x20AC;20 million, at the end of September with a loss for us in the realm of &#x20AC;4 million. At the end of October, this figure was in the realm of &#x20AC;80 million with the loss approximately &#x20AC;22 million. That is &#x2013; at least for the time being going it is for the time being going better than we expected.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I just have three questions, starting from sovereign exposure line independent from specifically but more in general. It seems somehow the new regulation is pointed to a change of the profile of the sovereign exposure from risk free to risky asset, do you see a general trend where European banks including Intesa eventually went out of the emergency we're leaving today will reduce significantly the sovereign exposure? And eventually what kind of asset can replace sovereign bonds as liquid assets in the portfolio?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the productivity, you've highlighted in the presentation that there is still more to do on the pressure to do more on productivity is going up given the environment. Should we expect more announcement as the one you did in this space about exit or staff reduction going forward?</p>
          <p>And the last point more in general on the Italian bank situation, given your balance sheet trend and the ability you prove to anticipate negative market development. Do you see a risk where you will have to use your resources to help or support directly or indirectly weaker midsize player in Italy? If not, do you see there is some of these smaller banks can bring some instability in the system? If yes, that you will support what kind of condition or constraint you will have in order to intervene? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is about sovereign risk. I believe that what European regulators are doing in terms of sovereign risk is at least inconsistent. On the one side, they say that we have to invest liquidity in sovereign risk. On the other side, they say that's more the political side that no other country but Greece will ever create default situations.</p>
          <p>And then these exercises that haircuts the portfolios in sovereign bonds and in sovereign loans. The three things do not match each other, but despite that and despite what they have created, and you're very right, they have labeled sovereign risk as a risky asset. They have destroyed, they have contributed to confirm, it's not their fault obviously, but they have confirmed that government bonds are not anymore a risk-free asset and I think it was a mistake. But despite this decision of theirs, we are not going to change our policy. I mean we will keep investing the largest part of our liquidity in government bonds, Italian government bonds that we believe are not at risk and provide the right kind of yields vis-&#xE0;-vis our cost, so no policy change on our side. As you might remember, we have in the realm of &#x20AC;35 billion worth of government bonds in our bank's book and that's more or less the liquidity we have to invest.</p>
          <p>Productivity, I confirm what I said before. The pressure on productivity is growing. The need for finding new sources of savings and productivity will grow. Do not expect any new announcement in terms of staff reductions, but do expect further and higher targets in terms of administrative cost reductions. Last point, will you play the Central Bank role for weaker banks? The answer is no. That's not our role. Our mission is to keep our bank strong and make it even stronger, so we do not consider any sort of the intervention even if as of today we really do not see any candidate for it. But even in the case a situation of that kind arises we would not be available for playing a role that would not be consistent with the stability and the solidity of our bank.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a couple of questions. The first one, I just would like to a further comment on this EBA stress test? Why do you think this stress test was done on capital rather than funding? And how in your view Italian banks would have ranked if the stress test was for instance on assessing banks or ranking bank on the stable funding ratio? The second questions is -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I interrupt to you. Can you explain it a bit better because I am not sure I understood the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We saw another stress test on capital. We saw this stress test including also married down on government bonds, which is a repeat of what somewhat we saw in the past. In the past we saw that on the capital, for instance, Dexia, was ranking number one bank in Europe. So my question is that maybe stress testing banks on funding and doing their reliance on short-term funding would have been more appropriate. So in that respect, how do you see yourself and Italian banks being ranked? For instance, if you look at the net stable funding ratio, instead of quarter one that arbitrarily was said that 9% level. So how do you see that changing for you and for the other Italian banks versus other European banks?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is generally speaking on Italy. You spend some generous worth on the country and also you show that you are committed to Italy. And in fact if I look at the table with the national sovereign exposure, this has been broadly stable quarter-on-quarter. But I think a legitimate question is, how do you see Italy being able to rollover this debt given that recent results from other banks and other insurance companies and non-Italians, we are seeing that basically almost all of them there been a net seller of Italian debt. So how do you see Italy been able to rollover this debt and what can convince investors to come back and start buying Italian government paper again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, two very, very serious questions. The first one, actually the October exercise was not a full fledge kind of stress test. I agree with you. And even the EBA has clearly said that this is not a stress test, it's an exercise to check which banks can afford a stress on their sovereign debt holdings. Again, I said before and I don't want to repeat, that in my opinion it was not a wise decision to introduce this level of risk perception on sovereign risk, but that was their decision and it was taken. And lucky enough Intesa Sanpaolo could go through the exercise quite comfortably. I totally agree with you when you say that a full in-depth stress test would have to be based, at least partially, also on liquidity.</p>
          <p>All the crisis in the past, but also the experiences in other industries, show very clearly that what makes an industry or a company weak in short-term is always the liquidity position rather than the capital position and that is the reason why we've been very obsessed with the liquidity issue. That's why we decided to keep a liquidity reserve much higher than most of our peers. That's why we still have quite a meaningful reserve also after this very difficult year. If your question is how would your bank &#x2013; our bank rank in a ranking that is based on net stable funding ratio. Probably, our bank would rank the first or amongst the very first and the very strongest banks in Europe. So if you put together the very high position in the solidity rank with the very high theoretical position on the liquidity and the net stable funding ratio ranking and you add, if you want the leverage rankings, you see what we mean by sustainable profitability. You see what we need &#x2013; what we mean by managing through the crisis that is a model.</p>
          <p>Italy, I don't know if I have been generous in describing the Italian situation. I think I've been objective, I think that the markets and also some observers, some international observers, and opinionally there is our losing part of the reality about our country. I know and it's very clear we have a creditability problem, but let's never forget some very hard facts.</p>
          <p>A country with a primary surplus, a company with &#x2013; sorry, a country with a balanced public accounts situation in two years, a country that has already gone through a pension reform that will make the system sustainable that can be even improved, but we already have a medium-term sustainable pension reform approved. A country with the level of private wealth of the level we have in our country. A country with an amount of public state assets of the amounts we have. And a country with a kind of economic structure and manufacturing strength and export position like Italy, is certainly a country with the right overall management that can cope with all its obligations and can meet all the requirements of the European partners.</p>
          <p>You were mentioning the maturities of the Italian government debt. I believe they will be met for the reason I mentioned before because there are a number of investors that realize that the level of risk is absolutely is low, that the level of yields is very much higher than what the real risk content would require. I'm not saying that we will not have maybe difficult moment if we do not provide the markets very soon with a clear plan for the re-launching of the Italian economic growth, but the fundamentals are there and that's why I believe that the deadlines and the maturities will be met.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I have three questions. The first one is on the Basel 3 negative impact on quarter one, which went from a negative 119 basis points to 150 roughly in the third quarter based on the latest stimulation. If you can elaborate on the reason why the negative impact increased compared to the last conference call?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the savings shares and my question is if in the current situation, the &#x20AC;0.5 billion of capital that you could release through the conversion of the savings, if it's still at negligible or less negligible than in the past? And the final question is on loan loss provisions. If after three quarters so you are still confident that 2011 should see a decrease in loan loss provisions compared to last year or if situation is so unclear that we have to wait for the fourth quarter data? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will try to answer the different questions. The first one has to do with the impact of Basel 3 rules on the foreseeable figures of the bank. What has changed is the amount of reserves for valuation. The AFS let's say, to make it simple, the AFS reserves that have increased, and as you know according to Basel 3, they will have to be eliminated and be reduced by the capital.</p>
          <p>Today, we have AFS reserves in the realm of &#x20AC;2.8 billion. That is probably a peak because for the reason I mentioned before, I expect the situation to come back to normality sooner or later. But if we apply very rigidly the calculation mechanism we use for page 68, those reserves have increased. And even if we believe that they will not be there in the future, we have to take them away from the capital requirements.</p>
          <p>One other point that will probably reduce the final effect is the impact of the risk weighted asset optimization that we launched. In the present exercise, we have only 80 basis points. We are now in the position to say, because we launched a number of projects, that those 80 basis points will be increased. We don't have the figure yet, but by next time we'll certainly have a higher than &#x2013; higher figure than that. So these are the two elements I strongly suggest you to consider in evaluating that page.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Saving share, no plan to do anything the cost and the mess to go through the conversions. Conversions are still too high vis-&#xE0;-vis advantages and as far as provision, the net adjustments &#x2013; the adjustments on loans in 2011 we are very happy that we are still below last year. At the end of September, we hope to be able to confirm what we have been saying, that is 2011 lower than 2010, but there is certainly an area of doubt on that. I count on it, but it's impossible to take a commitment in that respect.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Couple of questions, some of which are on the government bonds. On the government bonds, could you share with us the average duration of the portfolio spilt ideally between AFS and held for trading just to have an idea over which timeframe these negative AFS reserve may come back? And also related to the government bond, I'd be interested to know your stance linking the good yield on government bonds, which you mentioned and I agree with it, with the 13 month LTRO from the Central Bank? Any interest in building a bit of a carry trade position around that?</p>
          <p>On mitigations, is it still correct that the 80 basis points mitigation of the three mitigations is split 30 basis points insurance related and 50 basis points RWA management or within these 80 basis points you have already implicitly assumed a reversal of the AFS &#x2013; negative AFS reserve for the bonds which will mature between now and then?</p>
          <p>And final question is on liability management, which is something that no Italian bank has ever done in size, because the regulator has always taken a very conservative stance on that. Times are tough and your capital ratios are a lot higher than they used to be in the past. Do you sense that the regulator may not be so prescriptive about replacing Tier 1 and Tier 2 before doing liability management particularly on instruments, which may not be Basel III compliant or do you sense that nothing has changed and consequently it's not something you would be looking at doing? Thank you very much.</p>

If my colleagues will give me those figures, if not, we will send you. And in terms of liability management, there is nothing on the table, there is no actual constraint we &#x2013; I mean, there is nothing on the table.

          <p>Yes, yes. Good afternoon to everyone. Thanks for the presentation first. Just a final question, my answers have been already answered. Can you give us &#x2013; I mean given the surprise of the NII in the quarter, that was at least for me, a positive surprise. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of how this can evolve going forward? I mean imagine &#x2013; if we imagine that the sovereign doesn't deteriorate, of course this is a question mark. Let's see what is going to happen this afternoon and you do not need to move &#x2013; to change basically your assets, your risk weighted assets going forward, you still need to roll over some &#x20AC;20 billion of maturities next year.</p>
          <p>So I just want to get a sense of how much of the loan book you can effectively reprice going forward? There was already some comment before. How much you are already repricing on the mortgages and on the SMEs? I know this is a work in progress, but it's the first time actually that the finance there might be more aggressive on this side? Again is the repricing enough to compensate for the next year for the increased cost of funding or you need to calibrate more cost? Thank you.</p>

          <p>I agree with you on net interest income. The third quarter has been a positive quarter despite the fact that only a very limited part of the repricing effect is responsible for the result. We expect that we have a higher effect in the fourth quarter. We expect to have a relatively higher effect in terms of hedging effect, so I really cannot give you figures, but we are optimistic about the fourth quarter and the following ones. Certainly, many banks not all of them yet, but many banks in the market realize that EVA targets are important, that pricing is crucial and that liquidity has become a very precious and scarce resource. So I expect a more disciplined approach to pricing for the industry as a whole.</p>
          <p>The question was also is the repricing you have already triggered enough to compensate for the higher cost of long-term funding. The answer is yes, because we price internally at the marginal cost of funding. So, the divisions receive an internal rate of transfer price and internal transfer price that is the marginal cost of the bank for the same duration. Obviously, there are exceptions to the rules for many reasons, commercial, strategic and other kind of reasons, but as a rule, we apply marginal consolidated cost of funding.</p>
          <p>You mentioned also the &#x20AC;20 billion maturities, &#x20AC;22 billion, actually for 2012. As I said, we will probably not need to cover all of them because we are already in excess of medium and long-term funding. We will see how the market behaves. We can wait for the right timing in terms of both wholesale and retail issues. &#x20AC;20 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;20 billion sorry, is in the realm of 5% of the total deposit base, if you want to make it simple. So the net effect on the total cost of deposits is obviously quite limited, but nevertheless we have to be very, very careful about this variable because obviously cost of the overall funds, short-term and long-term is crucial for the results of the bank.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good afternoon Mr. Passera and colleagues. On NII, your net interest income, I've heard everything you said. Just to complete the puzzle from my point of view and put together all the pieces, it looks like your positioned again for further rate cuts, which I think looks likely going forward, with clearly the size of the recession being the key question, especially in Italy whether on light one, which Mr. Braghe said we should expect in Europe or a stronger one.</p>
          <p>So assuming that we have rates going down, by another, let's say, 50 basis points, 1% GDP fall in Italy as a base case, no loan growth, although I feel that your loan growth has gone up, but then we have other Italian banks, which are not as strong as you, which probably will delever, and not a lot of solid credit demand in terms of being in line with your asset quality standards. So with whatever you said before and put in this scenario, are we likely to see still a net interest income down next year or do you think that if we see the spreads on the Italian bonds actually coming down to more normal level and the re-pricing and the cherry picking on the loan growth, which you actually see clearly not a lot of growth, but maybe flat to slightly up on net interest income? That's the question number one.</p>

          <p>The ECB strategy in terms of interest rate is unknown to me. Actually, I do not expect markets yields to go, the LIBOR rate to go much lower than that, then that is reference rate ECB rates go much lower than that, but I really do not know. Minus 1% in terms of GDP, even if we do not have a definite scenario for next year, looks pessimistic to me, I expect a better figure. We don't have the scenario yet. We will other occasion to discuss that, but I would be surprised to see a minus 1%.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the definite scenario in terms of the country growth will effect in a major way both net interest income and provisions. Too early to make, to take any commitment. If I have to bet, I would be with you in saying that we can expect slightly growing net interest income for next year and provisions will be really a function of the overall country growth. So we will see that in the next few months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And my final question is on regulation, capital and risk weighted asset. You're being quite clear. I do agree with you on the &#x2013; let's call them stress test. It's quite ironic, we see Dexia up in your chart as the most recapitalized bank in Europe and we all know what happened. So because a lot of commercial banks like you, which provide credit to the economy, which as we know is a key issue today in terms of growth in southern Europe are quite unhappy on the way risk weighted asset are weighted because we change regulators in Italy very recently, the head of Central Bank, the head of the Central Bank in Europe and risk is content. Do you think there is any possibility that the focus will go to the denominator risk weighted asset, so that commercial European banks, especially in the southern part, will be less penalized going forward and there is some room to reconsider this or do you think this is impossible?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As to regulation, I agree but I tend to just clarify a little bit from my position with yours. I am not saying that capital ratios are not important. What I strongly suggest is that capital ratios have to be looked at together with the other elements of sustainable profitability, that is liquidity, that is risk profile, that is operating performance. Concentrating too much, emphasizing too much on capital ratios can really create troubles to the real economy without preventing the economy from falling &#x2013; for the preventing the industry from falling into another crisis. So very strong importance of capital ratios, but pushing too much in that direction and not in the others leverage business model and risk profile can lead to the problems you mentioned before.</p>
          <p>As to credit to the economy, I would be happy obviously like yourself to see in a number of countries, certain in ours a more &#x2013; a less stringent risk weighted asset &#x2013; a risk weighting asset mechanism for real economy lenders, for real economy borrowers and for the real economy banking activity. If your question is can we expect a relaxation in some of these mechanism, I should say no. There is no evidence of such a change in the attitude of the regulators. We will certainly push in the direction, we will certainly lobby in the direction. But our expectations are certainly not positive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Just indeed, there is some clarity on capital I share your views. Maybe I wasn't fully understood, but clearly I don't want to say capital is not important, I say yes, to be considered with all the other elements that you mentioned. Thank you so much.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Three quick questions, the first relating to rate cuts and net interest income evolution. Would the present situation does not match the scenario underlying the business plan, which you presented a few months ago, which had rate cuts rather than expectations of rate increase at that time. If I remember correctly, the plan didn't have any rate increases inside your expectations. You were disentangling the hedging and you build it up again. Hence, what should we expect in terms of evolution of NII versus your targets in the plan?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Italy you seem to give a confident message and at the same time the spreads on the BTPs are widening, are you in a position of increasing the exposure of the bank to the BTP to benefit from that and does this explain the search quarter-on-quarter in help for trading and available for selling in Q3 and if not, what is behind that? Finally, while we were speaking, the parliament in Rome approved the 2010 accounts with 308 votes, which is below the absolute majority thresholds, what should we wish for on the evolution of the political situation going on? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question about the rate cut, business plan &#x2013; our business plan as a scenario that as of today, at least as far as this year is concerned, is still consistent. When in your scenario becomes clear we will have to take all the necessary actions also in terms of business plan. Hedging is a dynamic kind of activity. When we expected &#x2013; when we were expecting a growth in terms of market yields, we decreased our hedging position, when these expectation changed, we changed also the hedging direction. Evolution of NII, I already answer to a number of your colleagues, there is not anything more I can add.</p>
          <p>Confidence in Italy, I am confident in the fundamentals of Italy. I'm not confident in the way the country is presently managed, but I am quite confident that we'll be able to show a better management of the country in a reasonable short period of time, we are not &#x2013; we don't have any plan to increase our position in BTP's. When you said that the government passed the law, you probably had in mind the parliament that passed the law this afternoon. And your question is what you wish, I cannot wish technically in political terms, but I certainly believe that our country can express a parliamentary support to a government that takes strong and clear commitments with the European partners both in terms of debt reduction, and we are already in that direction, and in terms of fostering economic growth.</p>
          <p>Economic growth is something that our country can trigger in a relatively short-period of time. It's not an easy task, but if we put together the strength of our companies on a number of industries that globally are growing rapidly and that will keep growing rapidly. If we add the investments, we can fund and we badly need in terms of infrastructures in our country. If you &#x2013; if we imagine a relatively short-list of interventions &#x2013; fiscal interventions to reward investments, to reward equity reinforcement in the companies and to reward labor vis-&#xE0;-vis real estate or other kind of financial incomes. I believe a quick change can be introduced in our country. But it's really a matter of using what we have and it's a matter of creating a consensus also with the so called social part that is entrepreneurs on the one side, trade unions on the other side, and work together with just the interest of the country in mind and have debt only interest in mind for a number of months.</p>
