          <p>Good morning. My name is John, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DuPont 2009 Second Quarter Investor Call.</p>
          <p>All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>To listen to the webcast, please go to www.dupont.com and it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investors Relations. Madam, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Good morning, and welcome. With me this morning are Ellen Kullman, CEO and Jeff Keefer, CFO.</p>
          <p>The slides for today's calls can be found on our website dupont.com along with the news release that was issued earlier today.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 2. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions.</p>
          <p>We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you please refer to the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and on our website.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have posted supplemental information on our website that we hope is helpful to your understanding of our company's performance. Please note that in discussing segment performance, comments on results are before significant items and all references we make to earnings are on a pre-tax operating income basis.</p>
          <p>In addition, all comparisons are on a previous year basis unless otherwise noted. We will also provide considerable detail about segment performance on the DuPont IR website.</p>
          <p>So with that I'll turn the call over to Ellen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Karen and good morning. Today with the economy still a dynamic yet unusually uncertain factor in overall performance, I'd like to open with comments on macro conditions before discussing our results in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We are seeing macro conditions start to stabilize versus three months ago. Last quarter I shared our view that global GDP would decline about 2.5% in 2009 and that view is unchanged. I also said our performance outlook in 2009 was based on global auto bills of about 58 million vehicles and U.S. housing starts at about 550,000 and those outlooks are also unchanged.</p>
          <p>Many of our markets showed improvement in the second quarter with an apparent end to destocking across several supply chains. Our Coating, Electronics and Performance Materials business segments all had sequential volume improvement.</p>
          <p>Our Safety &amp; Protection segment volumes were essentially flat with a weaker mix given the lagging market conditions for our Nomex and Kevlar businesses as we expected.</p>
          <p>And Ag had a strong quarter also as expected and all segments were positive earnings contributors.</p>
          <p>With macro conditions evolving about as we expected, our aggressive cost actions have served us well. Our earnings results this quarter benefited from an aggressive fixed cost reduction, new product launches, pricing discipline, as well as from lower raw material costs.</p>
          <p>Last quarter, we made a commitment to increase our fixed cost productivity with a goal of $1 billion in 2009. We delivered nearly 60% through the second quarter and are on track to meet our goal.</p>
          <p>What's more important is the productivity mindset of our business leaders. We are committed to keeping about 75% of these fixed cost reductions out for the long term. That includes benefits from restructuring, manufacturing cost reductions using DuPont production systems methodology and finding ways to keep half of our eliminated contract additions out permanently.</p>
          <p>I want to emphasize however, that even in these difficult times, we have demonstrated that innovation and cost discipline cannot only co-exist but together can enhance our competitive advantage in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>By continuing to invest in our differentiated market driven science, we launched 316 new products in the quarter, up 20% from the second quarter of 2008 and when you look at the combined total for the first half, new product launches are up 46% over last year.</p>
          <p>Particularly in a downturn, customers have greater interest in assessing the merits and value of new products. We're seizing the opportunities in today's environment to bring value to our customers using new products to help them differentiate their own offerings in the market place.</p>
          <p>We believe this emphasis positions us well for eventual recovery. The strong sales and earnings growth from our Ag segment this quarter, despite significant currency headwind, is a great example of our innovation investment paying off.</p>
          <p>The success of our Y series launch in soybeans, the continued improvement in seed germplasm and nutrates and growth of Rynaxypyr insecticides are example of our robust pipeline contributing to bottom line results.</p>
          <p>Overall, we expect economic recovery to develop slowly. We continue year-over-year weak demand in our outlook and we remain laser focused on the customer to assure we are ready to meet their needs as demand picks up.</p>
          <p>Our priorities are clear throughout the organization and everyone is working with the right sense of urgency that will carry us through the remainder of this extremely difficult period and into eventual recovery.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn things Jeff to review our financial results and later in the call, I'll comment on our full year outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ellen and good morning, everyone. We had a solid quarter in an environment that continues to be very challenging.</p>
          <p>Our results for the quarter were modestly better than the midpoint of our planning range. The global teams executed well, delivering fixed costs and working capital improvements with pre-tax margins expanding sequentially in four out of the five platforms.</p>
          <p>While volumes remain weak, we did see some sequential improvement in the quarter which we'll cover in a few minutes. Our teams aren't waiting for recovery but instead are capitalizing on their strong market positions by gaining share in some of our key target markets, executing value based pricing while simultaneously transitioning to a lower cost structure.</p>
          <p>As we look to the next couple of quarters, the timing and the pace of economic recovery remains uncertain. As a result, we are leaving in place our full year outlook and continuing to focus on the things we can't control, including a relentless pursuit to serve our customers well, driving costs and working capital improvement and maintaining tight capital expenditure controls.</p>
          <p>We are on track to meet our goals and emerge stronger when economic conditions improve.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 3, which summarizes earnings per share and sales results. Second quarter reported earnings per share were $0.46 and included a net charge of $0.15 for significant items that include the 2009 restructuring charges, hurricane insurance recoveries and reductions to previous year hurricane and restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>Excluding significant items from the quarter, earnings were $0.61 per share down 48% from prior year. Consolidated net sales of $6.9 billion were down 22%, compared to the prior year reflecting 19% volume decline, 5% unfavorable currency and 1% sales reduction from portfolio changes, which more than offset 3% pricing gain.</p>
          <p>The sales highlight of the quarter is clearly the outstanding performance of our seed business in the North American planting season. Karen will cover the details but the teams delivered share gains in both North American corn, and soy reflecting our strong product performance, as well as flawless execution by our sales teams of right product, right acre strategy.</p>
          <p>Excluding sales to agricultural end markets, segment volumes were down year-over-year in a range between 20 and 30%. Looking sequentially, there are examples of seasonally adjusted improvement which include about 15% demand improvement for titanium dioxide products with particular strength in China, about 20% demand improvement in Engineered Polymer products and about 20% demand increase in electronic products with a transition from significant first quarter de-stocking to some restocking.</p>
          <p>We view these trends as encouraging yet not enough to call a turn because the sustainability is unclear.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 4 for a review of sales by region. Second quarter had two noteworthy regional results. Europe market conditions were still among the most challenging globally as sales of $1.7 billion were down 38% versus same period previous year.</p>
          <p>Slight pricing gains were more than offset by broad based volume declines of about 27% and 13% unfavorable currency. Asia on the other hand showed a considerable improvement in the rate of decline, posting sales of about $1.2 billion, down 18% versus same period last year, but about 35% sequential improvement.</p>
          <p>Selective pricing actions were more than offset by a 16% decline in volume.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the second quarter EPS variance analysis versus prior year on slide 5. Pricing gains delivered in each region contributed $0.23 per share. The majority of the contribution reflects the success of a strong seed selling season, and to a lesser extent, Coatings &amp; Color Technologies.</p>
          <p>Pricing declines incurred in those businesses with contractual pass-through pricing, such as the chemicals businesses in Safety &amp; Protection, as well as the electronic businesses with metals pass-through.</p>
          <p>Finally, Performance Materials continued to demonstrate disciplined pricing performance. Importantly, all businesses delivered improved variable margin versus the same period previous year.</p>
          <p>This leads into a discussion of variable costs. Excluding impacts of currency and volume, the net variable cost was a benefit of $0.19 per share in the quarter, representing a 5% decrease.</p>
          <p>The benefit reflects increased agricultural and nutrition inputs, the absence of a $52 million charge on open soybean contracts from previous year, as well as lower costs starting to roll through the inventories of the remaining businesses.</p>
          <p>Because of the continued <mark type="audio gap" /> costs, we are holding the outlook range for 2009 at about a 4 to 6% decline, excluding currency in volume. We anticipate year-over-year raw material cost declines will continue to roll through in the third quarter, peaking in the fourth quarter, noting that we experienced the peak impact of raw material increases in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving now to frame the volume impact on earnings. The 19% volume decline resulted in an earnings decline of $0.61 per share, compared to the same period previous year, and a related low capacity utilization headwind of about $0.09 per share.</p>
          <p>Our demand outlook for the second half for agriculture and nutrition anticipates a strong selling season in Brazil, as well as an improvement in volumes for crop protection products.</p>
          <p>For the industrial end markets, our mid-case demand outlook is for continued sequential improvement in end market demand. Looking year-over-year, we expect third quarter volume to be down versus prior year, with fourth quarter moving into positive territory.</p>
          <p>Continued low visibility makes it prudent to provide a range, which leaves room for more improved demand rebound on the upside, as well as a potential slower improvement on the down side.</p>
          <p>Covering fixed cost now. Excluding currency and volume, fixed cost was a net benefit of $0.04 per share in the quarter, which reflects increased non-cash pension cost of about $0.10 per share and continued growth investments, particularly in agriculture, more than offset by cost reduction in other areas.</p>
          <p>The estimated benefit in the quarter of our cost reduction programs was about $335 million in savings, added to the first quarter impact of about $250 million. With nearly $600 million of reductions to-date, we are confident we will deliver at least our previously communicated target for total year fixed cost reduction programs of $1 billion.</p>
          <p>The teams are executing the plans to achieve the goal with an eye towards re-designing the work to ensure much of the savings is long term in nature. This includes our efforts in DuPont production systems, related to manufacturing, as well as our streamlining efforts in corporate services. This will ensure that we retain about 75% of the savings for the long term.</p>
          <p>Let me provide a quick update specifically on restructuring actions. Last quarter, we announced plans for additional restructuring to ensure that our businesses are more streamlined and flexible to compete and win.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we solidified the plans and recorded the accrual. We provided you the charges by segment in the appendix, along with the run rates for both 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions.</p>
          <p>Turning now to currency, year-over-year currency headwind was $0.18 per share, reflecting about a 13% stronger dollar based on our sales weighted currency.</p>
          <p>We expect the impact in the second half to be substantially less than the first half, with a headwind in the third quarter changing to a tailwind in the fourth quarter, assuming currencies are stable.</p>
          <p>Other on the waterfall, is a headwind of $0.07 per share, primarily reflects lower income from equity affiliates and higher net interest expense.</p>
          <p>Also included in the variance is a $0.04 headwind, reflecting the absence of a $51 million legal settlement recorded in the second quarter of 2008. Our base tax rate was 27.4% versus 22.7% same period previous year, creating a headwind of $0.04 per share.</p>
          <p>Our base tax rate assumption for the second half of 2009 continues to be about 26%, noting that volatility in regional earnings could change this rate for the second half.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on slide six. Second quarter free cash flow was an increase of over $500 million, compared to an inflow of about $40 million in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Again this quarter, reductions in working capital and capital expenditure requirements versus the same period last year offset cash impact of reduced earnings.</p>
          <p>Our capital expenditure target is $1.4 billion, a 30% year-over-year reduction. The spending plan anticipates investment in Agriculture &amp; Nutrition, Applied Bioscience as potable tags, while aligning capital spend with the level of demand in other businesses.</p>
          <p>Our year to-date spend puts us solidly on track to meet this target. Moving to an update on year to-date dividend payments, we paid $0.41 a share in both the first and second quarters.</p>
          <p>Spot yield is about 6% based on current stock price. Our plans have been and continue to be focused on generating more cash in 2009 versus 2008 and we are pleased that we have delivered cash during a severe recession, while continuing to invest in our highest growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>Another accomplishment is the continued strength of our balance sheet, which remains strong with net debt modestly lower versus same period previous year.</p>
          <p>In summary, things played out slightly better than we expected despite the amount of volatility which still exist in the markets. The rate of volume decline eased in some areas, costs were down, pre-tax margins were sequentially flat or up in four out of the five platforms, inventories were down and capital expenditure was down.</p>
          <p>As I stated here earlier, we're not shifting gears and instead we are steadfast about delivering our cost and capital commitments. This will provide operating leverage when recovery occurs.</p>
          <p>But this is a backdrop. We are reaffirming our full year underlying guidance range of $1.70 to $2.10 per share.</p>
          <p>Our second half earnings split is typically even between quarters. However, this year, our assumptions are for sequential demand, cost of demand, cost and currency improvements, to favor fourth quarter earnings over third quarter.</p>
          <p>Aligned with the earnings per share guidance, our free cash flow target remains at about $2.5 billion. Now, I'll turn it over to Karen for a review of the segments. Karen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. Let's start with Ag &amp; Nutrition on slide 7. Revenues for the platform grew 3% to $2.6 billion and earnings were up 15% to 581 million.</p>
          <p>This reflected strong pricing across all products and regions, partially offset by significant currency headwind and higher commodity costs. Food and nutrition products' pre-tax operating margins increased by nearly 4 points on disciplined portfolio management and fixed cost productivity.</p>
          <p>Excluding currency in last year's mark-to-market charge, earnings for the segment from operations grew 23%. Growers continue to invest more in technology to protect their crops and maximize their yields.</p>
          <p>While these Ag marketplace fundamentals for growth remain relatively strong, the general economic turndown did impact currency devaluation, customer inventory management of crop protection and food &amp; nutrition product and a higher portion of credit versus cash sales.</p>
          <p>Let me share some of the segment details.</p>
          <p>As Jim indicated last quarter, crop protection sales and earnings were down substantially. Favorable local pricing was more than offset by lower fungicide and herbicide market volumes in unfavorable currency. The overall crop protection market has softened due to weather conditions in key agricultural areas.</p>
          <p>Europe saw near perfect planting conditions, despite the fact that it was a late season. North America had delayed plantings and Latin America continued to be affected by the draught. European volumes were impacted by lower cereal and corn acreage and extremely tight credit in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>In North America, insecticide growth was more than offset by lower market demand for cereal and corn herbicides. Delayed plantings due to the wet weather eliminated some fungicide and herbicide applications.</p>
          <p>Latin America price was down due to lower glyphosate pricing. Volumes declined mainly due to drought and lower sugarcane acres. Significant volume growth in Asia-Pacific was driven primarily by strong Rynaxypyr sales.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the third quarter, volume increases will be partly offset by unfavorable currency. Seasonally low earnings are expected to be down versus prior year primarily due to currency.</p>
          <p>Moving to seeds. We're proud of a 2009 milestone with Pioneer brand realizing the industry's largest North American corn, and soybean market share gains of more than one point and two points, respectively. In addition to those gains PROaccess will bring one point each of corn, and soybean market share in the U.S.</p>
          <p>These market share results are calculated off of the U.S.DA June 30 report. Driven by the strong North America performance, seed sales and earnings grew substantially; sales were $1.7 billion, up 21% from last year, with local price up 23%, volume up 3% and a currency headwind of 5%. North American seed volumes were up 7% in the quarter and European corn volumes were lower than expected on lower acres.</p>
          <p>Earnings, which reflect the absence of a $52 million mark-to-market charge from open soybean contracts, more than offset currency headwinds. Moving to the third quarter outlook for seed, currency continues to be a headwind, while southern hemisphere sales are expected to improve moderately on price.</p>
          <p>Seasonal losses are also impacted by currency, as well as higher commodity costs.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we don't expect to have a similarly high gain as the $49 million pre-tax mark-to-market benefit from settlement of soybean contracts that we had in the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>So, for the segment outlook for the remainder of this year, we expect high single-digit top-line growth with significantly improved earnings excluding the mark-to-market benefit from 2008 and continued growth investment plans in R&amp;D and sales to further strengthen our capabilities.</p>
          <p>We look forward to sharing additional updates with you in the coming weeks, including a decision from the EPA regarding our Optimum AcreMax 1 submission for the industry's first integrated refuge in a bag and reduce refuge for below ground insect protection, as well as an Ag focused investor event that we're planning in early September.</p>
          <p>Please look for further details to come.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to slide eight on Coatings &amp; Color Technologies. Sales of $1.4 billion were down 26%, primarily reflecting continued weakness in motor vehicle markets and to a lesser extent, titanium dioxide products.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax operating income of $133 million reflects lower sales volumes and unfavorable currency, partly offset by aggressive fixed cost reductions and pricing gains.</p>
          <p>Titanium dioxide product sales declined significantly and earnings were down moderately, driven by lower volume in all markets and regions. This reflects the global slowdown partly offset by moderate restocking in many markets.</p>
          <p>Higher local selling prices and lower fixed costs were more than offset by lower volume, unfavorable currency and slightly higher raw material costs.</p>
          <p>TiO2 products continued to strengthen sequentially, resolving in more than 25% increase in revenue versus the first quarter 2009, driven by markets that hit their low point and have started to rebound, especially in Asia-Pacific, Latin America and certain developed markets.</p>
          <p>Coating sales and earnings also declined substantially, reflecting a decline in motor vehicle production. North America motor vehicle production was down 48% versus prior year quarter and European motor vehicle production was down 26%.</p>
          <p>Re-finished paint products' volumes dropped substantially, driven by continued weakness in global demand, partly offset by minor restocking in developed markets. Higher local selling prices and fixed cost reductions were more than offset by volume decline and unfavorable currency.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the second half for this segment, we expect sales to increase sequentially and year-over-year comparisons to remain weak.</p>
          <p>Demand assumptions reflect the following. First, that global motor vehicle production levels will slightly increase on a sequential basis. Second, that global demand for titanium dioxide products will moderately increase sequentially as de-stocking is completed. And finally, that lower demand of re-finished paint products will be driven by normal seasonal patterns.</p>
          <p>As a result, we expect substantially lower earnings in the third quarter versus prior year with essentially flat earnings sequentially.</p>
          <p>Our team continues to be focused on delivering productivity improvements in costs and capital.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 9 for Electronics &amp; Communications Technologies. Sales of $795 million were down 26%, compared to same period last year, primarily reflecting demand declines of 23%.</p>
          <p>While moderate re-stocking began in second quarter for Consumer and Automotive Electronics, our results reflect year-over-year demand declines in all regions. In addition to the pressures from the recession, the cold wet spring <mark type="audio gap" /> and refrigerant seasonal pattern.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax earnings of $37 million reflect the broad based market weakness, as well as unfavorable currency impacts. Importantly, the results also reflect continued investment in photovoltaics, discipline pricing particularly in fluoroproducts and the benefit of lower fixed costs, all key deliverables of the 2009 plans.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the second half, our outlook is for based demand to be moderately down year-over-year, reflecting a weaker back to school and holiday electronic device season in third quarter, more than offsetting the favorable comp in fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Sequentially, sales are expected to be up significantly reflecting seasonality in Electronics, in addition to modest improvements in photovoltaic demand. Earnings are expected to reflect lower raw material costs and continued aggressive fixed cost reductions both heavily weighted to the later part of the half.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 10 for Performance Materials. Sales of $1.1 billion were down 40% reflecting weak demand in major markets in all regions, particularly in motor vehicle and general industrial markets. We believe industry de-stocking is largely completed with all regions showing sequential volume improvement versus first quarter and sequential improvement in each month of the quarter.</p>
          <p>It was led by strong pick up in Asia, although North America, Western Europe and Latin America regions also showed improvements. Pre-tax operating income of $37 million, principally reflects weaker sales volumes and unfavorable currency, partly offset by lower raw material costs and fixed cost reductions. Looking ahead to the second half, destocking is largely completed. Sequentially, third quarter sales and earnings are expected to be up, reflecting higher volumes and continued gains on those raw material costs and fixed cost reduction.</p>
          <p>We expect intensified pricing pressure, as polymer capacity gradually comes back on-line. The business teams continue to be focused on pricing discipline and delivering strong cost productivity performance in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to side 11 and looking at Safety &amp; Protection, sales of $1 billion were down 37%. Volume was down 29% reflecting the weak macro conditions, including continued destocking in our highest margin businesses.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax operating income of $71 million, principally reflects the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable mix and currency headwinds.</p>
          <p>Also included in the results is significant progress towards delivering a step change in productivity, particularly in North America and Europe. Key actions to ensure continued leadership positions and headroom for margin improvement in coming months.</p>
          <p>For the second half, we expect stable demand for most product lines, no further inventory de-stocking by customers and we expect third quarter <mark type="audio gap" /> substantially lower than same period last year driven by continued weak demand in major markets.</p>
          <p>Earnings benefit from lower raw material costs and fixed cost reductions are expected.</p>
          <p>So, that completes our segment review and I'll now turn the call back to our CEO, Ellen Kullman.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Karen. Last quarter, we provided you with a sequential view of our sales outlook for major markets, in addition to our overall financial planning assumptions for the full year.</p>
          <p>We're going to continue with this approach for the sales outlook for the third quarter. Please turn to slide 12. This is the same format that I used last quarter. I include the actual sales pattern for sequential sales from first to the second quarter followed by our outlook for sequential sales from second to third quarter.</p>
          <p>Based on market intelligence we are gathering almost on a daily basis from our customers and partner interactions around the world, following is our best assessment of how a few key markets are developing.</p>
          <p>Starting with our production Ag businesses where we expect the typical seasonal sales patterns. We expect year-over-year sales will be up, with sequential sales will be down in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>For protective materials, which include our aramid-products, Kevlar and Nomex, we expect to see an end to the de-stocking that took place during the second quarter with sales trending sequentially up in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to business materials, we look for sales to be flat to slightly up based on market forecast, which indicate U.S. housing starts have bottomed and global markets remain weak.</p>
          <p>In automotive markets, global auto builds were up in the second quarter from a very low rate in -</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="audio gap" /> and our sales were up sequentially. Market forecasts don't indicate much of an uptick in global auto builds going into the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We expect our sale of automotive coatings and polymers will be flat to slightly up, depending on the region, customer mix and the potential for restocking activity that may begin to occur.</p>
          <p>For example, auto builds in greater China were up year-over-year in the second quarter and forecast to be up in the third and fourth quarters as well. We're positioning our sales and new product efforts towards growth opportunities, such as this one.</p>
          <p>For the remainder of the business as shown on this slide, we're seeing an end to de-stocking and expect seasonally adjusted sales to be flat to slightly up. I would call your attention to the Electronics and TiO2 markets, where we are seeing a pickup in demand signals.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that both businesses are benefactors of Government stimulus packages as well.</p>
          <p>So, to summarize this slide, while most markets remain weak, it's fair to say we've seen an end to much of this de-stocking that took place, in the first two quarters.</p>
          <p>For the company, we expect total sales down 10 to 15% sequentially, primarily due to the seasonal decline in the production agriculture sales. In closing, second quarter results reflect weak but more stable market conditions.</p>
          <p>Coupling our innovation driven pricing discipline with the impact of lower cost raw materials and aggressive cost reduction work going on across the company, we drove variable margin expansion, and solid earnings growth versus the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We remain focused on what we can control and our 2009 directives are updated for you on slide 13. To be clear, we are staying close to our customers and markets, managing for cash and taking out cost and we expect to reap benefit from our actions through the remainder of 2009 and beyond.</p>
          <p>We will continue to preserve our strong cash generating capability while assuring that our businesses are competitively positioned for an eventual recovery in global markets.</p>
          <p>Now we're happy to take your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's the same volume assumptions we had coming through and shared with you in the first quarter. That, we came in the second quarter pretty much right in the middle of where we expected and that's why we maintained our estimate for the full year.</p>

          <p>Sorry, just on pricing, are you seeing any sequential pricing pressure besides what you mentioned in performance polymers?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really David. This is Jeff. I think our pricing discipline remains good. We talked about our new products and what we're seeing is in our business, excluding Ag, is principally the effect of raw materials' pass-through in chemicals and pass-through of metals in Electronics and as I said, some pricing pressure in Performance Materials but again, good pricing discipline in that business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A question on your seed gains this year, you've had a strong year, you gained share in U.S. corn seed I think for the first time in eight years, I think that's certainly attributable to narrowing a bit of the yield gap with Monsanto but that yield gap still exists, they're going to &#x2013; they've got a very competitive product in smart stacks next year. What's your degree of confidence that you can sustain this year's market share gains in both U.S. corn, and soybean as you go into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Don, thanks for your question. I am working with the Ag team and the Pioneer team as I have through the nine months &#x2013; last nine months. I guess I don't see the yield drag that you talk about that affects it &#x2013; that 2010 that we will continue our momentum in that market place and continue to see positive results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just add to that Don, we are waiting the final EPA ruling on our AcreMax product and we'll have that in a matter of days or weeks. Then it'll be added to a very diverse line up of products and it comes back to our right product, right acre strategy and working with the farmer on giving him the highest yield on his farm under his conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow-up on costs. I mean, you've had some volatility in your hedging costs this year. I know that seed costs are one of your largest inputs. Where does that go in 2010 with the broad reduction we've seen in corn, and soy prices, is that going to lead to a material reduction in your seed costs next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Don this is Jeff. Let's be clear about, first of all, what we're seeing in terms of where that hedging cost was. It was really last year that we experienced that volatility which resulted in a hedge gain in the second quarter, I mean, a loss in the second quarter and a hedge gain on soy in the third quarter and of course, for the total year, it was really a little or no impact on it.</p>
          <p>With respect to 2010, keep in mind that our commodity cost behind our seed price is for the most part determined on prior years' sales, but given our supply improvements and price increases, we do expect some margin improvement for both soy and corn.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. You did not sound as optimistic on automotive OEM production as one of your competitors. So, I'm just curious, are you looking for significant increase in production in second half as vehicle inventories come down and what is your expectation for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know I think that what we see is improvement sequentially to the third quarter and maybe even the fourth quarter. What we see is a lot of that's going to be in Asia and with continued weakness in the U.S. And Europe, and so I think we're taking a cautious approach but certainly if the market is there, we will be ready to serve it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, PJ, we were referencing some global market data that we have, that shows sequentially a slight uptick in global builds but it really is a story region by region and that's really what we were trying to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a quick question for Jeff on free cash flow, you're looking for a significant improvement in second half. How much of that improvement is from seasonality and how much of that is from lower working capital? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, P.J, you've got &#x2013; the seasonality question is really around our Ag business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we collect as you know, near the end of the year, a lot of money as a result of that. So, the range is probably over 60, maybe 70% net range Ag. The balance is the rest of the businesses, and I would tell you that we are on track in terms of our productivity targets, and our mega projects on both inventory and accounts receivable continue to ramp up.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Lucy Watson, sitting in for Laurence. Given the amount of cost cutting year-to-date, how much do you think you have improved your incremental margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would point to is, take a look at our margins sequentially, first quarter to second quarter, and I think that gives you a pretty good idea on PTOI. They were up about, I think, 3 percentage points roughly first quarter to the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And as you know, the bulk of that is the result of our cost productivity efforts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you provide a breakdown of the businesses in which you're having the most success with new product introductions and if possible, to what extent you're seeing margin expansion from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, Lucy. In the first quarter, our new product introductions were very heavily in the Ag space, where our new germplasms and traits <mark type="audio gap" />, as well as the Y series in soybeans had tremendous impacts, and I think we're seeing the result of that this quarter with our tremendous improvement in Ag.</p>
          <p>The second quarter was broad and across the board. We saw new products in Safety &amp; Protection in Nomex. We saw Coatings &amp; Color Technology, specifically our Performance Materials businesses, had positioned a lot of new products in Asia, with the increase in automotive builds there, and the new position in the emerging market growth there.</p>
          <p>We're seeing that come in. So, we do see, I think, the impact of those new products in our pricing line. They allow us to reset price with our customers, especially where there's added performance. And I think we're seeing the results of that as we come through this first half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I was wondering if I could ask about the crop chemical business. You mentioned trends were a bit weaker there, do you have any volume or price break out? And then, what's your expectations across the Ag platform, as you go into the upcoming selling season, given that futures prices on corn are about a third less than they were a year ago? Does that change the dynamic for you at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's take the second question first, and we're not sharing our pricing strategy for the 2010 season at this point. We're working that through with our sales forces and we're going to have an Ag Day, guess that's early September, so we'll be in a position to speak much more definitively around those issues then.</p>
          <p>As far as crop protection chemicals goes, certainly their volume was impacted by weather and by late planting seasons. Their pricing, I think, was still very good from that standpoint. Europe had the weather issue with less cereal and corn acres. Latin America, we're still suffering from the drought. But, we're seeing our new products, especially Rynaxypyr, getting tremendous reaction from the marketplace and uplift there. So, as we go forward, we're looking forward to a very strong Rynaxypyr result this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I might ask the &#x2013; I saw the Cozaar/Hyzaar sales were off 4% year-on-year in the second quarter. Should we expect going into the patent expiration, the continued erosion as customers de-stock, can give us any help there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, Bob, expect it to be about flat year-over-year roughly, this year versus last.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, and excellent job on the cost cutting. My question is on Cozaar/Hyzaar as well. Ellen, is that something that you think you want to manage organically, or do you feel that you may need some strategic action around that in terms of managing the exploration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No we have a team that works very closely with Merck and in this venture in terms of getting aligned on Merck's strategy around the expiration of a patent. That &#x2013; all that activity has been going on, and we're very active in that. You know, there is active management of it in order to maximize the potential earnings for both parties, and I think that's where our interest and Merck's are very well aligned in really helping us get the most out of that franchise in the end of its patent life.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my follow-up question is on the pension and healthcare, it's about under funded by around 9 billion. Is that something you expect regulatory relief from next year, and is that something that you consider in terms of how you manage your free cash flow going forward, 2010 beyond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Edward. No, we're not relying on regulatory reform. Let me just tell you from a cash standpoint and again, you know there's a difference between from an accounting standpoint versus a cash standpoint, the treatment here. And we anticipate no required payment for the pension fund in either 2009 or 2010.</p>
          <p>It's the principal U.S. Pension Plan, by the way. Outside the U.S., we pay according to legal requirements.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My first question was on Safety &amp; Protection. These segments has been holding up strongly in 07, 08, despite U.S. housing decline, but lately has a few couple of tough quarters with accelerating sales decline. I'm just curious you've run the business very closely for several years. Do you think it's inventory re-stocking or it's a weakness in some other end markets? Just as housing...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Sergey. We &#x2013; a lot of their business is what I would call a long cycle business, and so, the downturn did not even start to impact those long cycle businesses until the March timeframe. We saw a little bit of it at the end of the first quarter; saw the de-stocking heavily coming through the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Certainly, the low industrial production doesn't help, but I think the second quarter, we've seen a lot of de-stocking, and we expect that to stop in the third quarter, and we'll see sequential improvements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And secondly, on Coatings &amp; Color Technologies side, showed very strong results this quarter from, compared to the previous results, and to other peers. Do you think those kind of trends are sustainable, and should they improve even higher, as the volume in auto comes back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well certainly, a large part of their results are automotive-driven. As the external numbers that we take a look at, on auto builds don't indicate that we're going to see a tremendous amount of improvement that will not drive the improvement. So, I think for the rest of this year, it's going to be our fixed costs, and our drive around raw material improvements, are going to be positives for that.</p>
          <p>We expect to see lower seasonal demand for refinish, coming through the second half of the year and the TiO2 market itself, I think, is showing us sequential improvement. We've seen it in Asia. The question is, when will other regions come back there? So, we're not anticipating a large rebound in the automotive to help that segment.</p>
          <p>We are very focused on our cost productivity efforts both fixed and variable to continue our rate of improvement.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Next question is from Frank Mitsch from BB&amp;T Capital Market. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Could you provide a bit more granularity on what you're seeing in emerging Asia? Obviously, that's the region that was down the least year-over-year. Can you talk a little about month-to-month throughout the quarter, and how you're seeing the third quarter start out in that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we've seen improvement in the second quarter versus the first quarter, you've seen that tremendous Ag season we had in Asia. Now, granted, that's a small market for us, so the numbers look big, but sequentially, all segments were up and on a local market basis. And it seems majority of that outside of Ag is driven off of the stimulus packages that we're seeing, especially in China, where there is a very focused effort on that, and we're seeing real volumes come though on that. So, we do expect in Asia to continue to see improvement, and I think that's going to be &#x2013; that's part of our third quarter and fourth quarter story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see okay, great. And Ellen, you had mentioned before in response to a question that the volume assumptions underpinning the $0.40 range was basically in line with what you had shared back in the first quarter. What were those, if you could refresh my memory, what were the volume assumptions that you were looking for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Volume, okay, so in a year-over-year basis, we talked about the volume in the third quarter being down about 10 to 15%, largely driven off of Ag, seasonal, and then offset a little bit by the industrial markets are still going to show pretty, down pretty far year-over-year.</p>
          <p>On the fourth quarter, year-over-year we expect to see a slight improvement versus the fourth quarter of last year. If you remember, unfortunately I remember it very clearly, the fourth quarter of last year, we saw tremendous fall-off on the volumes and all platforms, all the segments outside of agriculture, and so we see this year as the sequential improvement comes through the year, it might look a little better.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Ellen, I'm just wondering how you think about protecting price in an environment like this? And I'm thinking about electronic chemicals, I'm thinking about coatings, any of the Safety &amp; Protection; you're taking your costs down, your raw materials are down, but volumes aren't going anywhere and customers are going to want you to share that.</p>
          <p>So how do you hold on, on existing products, and I understand what innovation will do, but how concerned are you about prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we work pricing very hard. We've been doing it for a number of years now. And we've seen the benefit of it. We have a corporate marketing and selling organization, who puts on training programs, weekly, monthly around the world on pricing. <mark type="audio gap" /> really focusing in on understanding the benefits our products provide &#x2013; to the customer.</p>
          <p>And the new products &#x2013; you said you understand that but 816 new products in the first half of this year. That allows us 816 opportunities to go engage with our customers around new functionality and new features that help support our price or enhance our price. So, we have a very active pricing program to support.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Following on that, Ellen, on the temporary cost cuts, as demand does come back, where are you going to face the biggest challenge in terms of the headwind from those costs coming back and how do you manage that process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I think the &#x2013; if you take a look, our structuring is pretty much locked in and that's an area that will just &#x2013; it'll just deliver on throughout this year and next year. It's some of the temporary things have to do with <mark type="audio gap" /> a variable workforce in our plant sites. And that's where the contractor loading comes in. The pop production systems, which we've implemented at a large number of our sites so far, and those implementations continue.</p>
          <p>A lot of that work is enhancing our operation's capability and the belief is that, through that, we will only need to reinstate about half of the contract workers that we had previously. I think that's going to be the area that we will need to watch very, very closely. And my concern is the true demand recovery. We're going to be bumping along the bottom for a while, where we don't want to think of it as a positive trend, when really, what it is sort of more of a sideways movement.</p>
          <p>So, that's the area where we have a tremendous amount of focus to really understand. That's where staying close to that customer is really important to understand those real demand trends and hence, then how we load our plans.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Jeff, I might add that we have a very rigorous process around the contractors in particular, and the management of them to ensure that we're making the right decisions, but importantly, that we're maintaining the costs where they need to be.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from Mike Judd from Greenwich Consultants. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just a quick one. In your discussion on the segment in the Electronics area, you talked a little bit about photovoltaic's demand, but improving in the third quarter, how significant is that overall for that segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know for the last year, photovoltaics was about 400 million in sales for all of DuPont. A majority of it is in the Electronics segment. A small piece is in Performance Materials. And we're seeing, gross year-over-year, just north of 10%, and so that's to help size both the base sales and the growth rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and what level of profitability does that have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you would see that at or slightly above segment average for photovoltaics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then just secondly, and quickly, you guys have been doing quite a bit of research and development on new, I guess enzymes or whatever for ethanol based on I think it's like switch grass and things like that. Where are we, just like in two seconds on that? Is that moving forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're on track on our commitments we've made on the cellulosic ethanol and even biobutanol. We have a demonstration unit that's under construction as we speak and the cellulosic ethanol unit should be up about mid-year, 2010 and we're on track there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the point there is we're proving out the technology to show that it's viable at commercial rates economically and then we'll look at scale up or licensing options beyond that.</p>

          <p>John, I think in the interest of time, we have time for one more question.</p>

        <plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. It sounds like your volume expectations for the second half are more or less in line with what you previously thought, but it looks like maybe your raw materials are falling a little bit faster than you expected and your overhead costs are coming out a little bit faster than you expected as well. So, why haven't you narrowed your guidance range for the year? And, do you have sort of a positive bias rather than a negative or neutral bias in the light of some of the trends you're seeing in your business in terms of your earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thanks for your question, Jeff. What I would say is, is we're trying to maintain a prudent guidance range, but clearly we are and are going to deliver on our productivity efforts, a lot of focus there and as we said, at least that $1 billion. Our outlook for raw materials has really not changed it's 4 to 6%. There is some uncertainty there, depending upon how things play out. And we expect currency to be in the range that we gave you some earlier ranges this year.</p>
          <p>The question is around primarily volumes and to a maybe just a lot lesser extent, variable cost or energy and raw material prices. And so we just think given that apparent uncertainty that's out there it really is prudent to maintain to the range we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's volume that's the issue for you -</p>
