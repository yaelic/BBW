        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Review for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Friday, April 23, 2010.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Nawi, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, [Brian.] Good morning, and welcome to the Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2010 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.</p>
          <p>Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions.</p>
          <p>Before I turn it over to Jay, I'd like to draw your attention to the following on page 1 of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, may be forward-looking statements. Specifically our earnings guidance is forward-looking, and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company's reserves, and other topics. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement resolves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention Travelers operating income which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that may be non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available on the Investors section of our website.</p>
          <p>With that out of the way, here is Jay Fishman.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today.</p>
          <p>All in, given the magnitude of catastrophes we experienced this quarter, we were quite pleased with our performance, reporting net income of $1.25 per diluted share, an increase of 13% from last year's quarter, and a return on equity of nearly 10%. Included in this number was $0.61 a share in catastrophes arising out of the multiple storms in the eastern United States as well as the earthquake in Chile. Just to put this number in context, the estimate for catastrophes for the first quarter included in our previously provided guidance was about $0.13 a share.</p>
          <p>Offsetting the cats, we benefited from favorable prior-year development, and our underlying performance from both underwriting and net investment income was a bit better than our expectations. The net result was operating income which was in line with our expectations going into the quarter, allowing us to reaffirm our previously-issued full-year 2010 operating earnings per share guidance. Also, it's reflective of our continuing strong earnings power.</p>
          <p>In an environment which remains similar to last quarter in terms of both economic and insurance market conditions, our business dynamics remain solid and were generally consistent with recent operating experience. Renewal rate gains remain positive in each of our business segments, retention was strong, and new business in total remained on par with last year's quarter. We repurchased $1.4 billion of our common stock in the quarter and announced an increase in our regularly quarterly dividend by 9% to $0.36 per share. As these actions demonstrate, we continue to execute successfully in the marketplace, generate solid earnings, and return excess capital to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Given that our operating dynamics this quarter were generally consistent with recent quarters, our call this morning is going to be somewhat different than in the past. We're still providing all of the same information in our presentation as we have previously, but we will not be going page by page with you, so as to allow more time for questions.</p>
          <p>Before turning it over to Jay, I want to take just a minute to acknowledge and thank our claim department for all of their exceptional work, not only this quarter, but over the last couple of years. In 2008, we had Ike, Gustav, and Dolly, and while there were no major storms in 2009, it was still a quite active cat year. And of course in the first quarter of 2010, we were again faced with an exceptional number of claims due to the multiple storms on the East Coast. Doreen Spadorcia and her entire claim team have been remarkably busy providing industry-leading customer service to our insureds and again demonstrating our commitment to providing high quality service to all of our insureds during their greatest time of need.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jay.</p>
          <p>There's several points that I'd like to highlight relating to pages 4 through 7, many of which you've heard me say repeatedly over many quarters. First, our balance sheet remained extremely strong. All capital leverage and liquidity measures were at or better than target levels. Even after repurchasing $1.4 billion of our stock and paying dividends of 168 million in the quarter, holding company liquidity increased to over $3 billion, almost three times our target level, due to the timing of dividends from our operating companies to our parent company. Holding company liquidity is expected to move towards its target level during the remainder the year as we continue our share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Book value per share increased once again, and on an as-reported basis, operating income for the quarter did meet our expectations. That is, operating performance X the cats and X the non-cat weather, and also adjusting for the favorable reserve development but including net investment income, all of that was in line with our expectations going into the quarter.</p>
          <p>Despite the high cat losses and the relatively low yields on short-term and non fixed income investments, we recorded a double-digit operating ROE. And finally, our results included a one-time tax charge of just under $12 million, or approximately $0.02 per share, related to the recently enacted federal healthcare legislation that eliminated the tax benefit associated with Medicare Part D subsidies.</p>
          <p>Brian is now going to provide some color about our operating performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jay.</p>
          <p>We have included on pages 8 through 16 all of the segment performance statistics that we traditionally discuss with you. As Jay mentioned, we're not going to go through each slide, but instead, speak more broadly about the significant drivers for the quarter, leaving more time for questions.</p>
          <p>Obviously, weather had a big impact on our results and will be the headline for the quarter. We had six domestic cat events, the two largest being the February snowstorm in the mid-Atlantic that paralyzed Washington, D.C. for several days, and the nor'easter in mid-March that impacted New York, New Jersey, and southern New England. In addition, there were several international events, the largest being the earthquake in Chile. So all in all, a very active catastrophe quarter.</p>
          <p>But looking beyond the near term impact of weather, our production and core underwriting results continue to perform very well. In Business Insurance, retentions remain strong and were up slightly across the business, renewal pricing improved modestly, with pure rate continuing to be positive for the segment, exposure change unrenewed accounts was still down but the rate of decline moderated slightly from last quarter.</p>
          <p>On the new business side, we feel good about the continued flow of new opportunities, particularly in middle market and the small end of Select. New business writings in the quarter were down from prior year, primarily due to the pricing discipline that we are maintaining in the larger end of the Select business. This segment of the market has been particularly competitive, and reduced writings here reflect that position.</p>
          <p>On a written basis, premiums are down, a direct result of the impact of the challenging economy on our customers. Some of that impact is seen in renewal premium statistics, but the majority comes from reduced audit premiums and increased cancellations and endorsements. These impacts either emerge over the life of the policy, or in the case of audits, aren't reflected until the end of the policy period. Since we are generally auditing accounts we wrote a full year ago, we expect this drag may continue through the next few quarters. As the economy stabilizes and eventually improves, we believe that based on our historical experience, the audit premium will rebound.</p>
          <p>There are a lot of weather and prior-year impact in the combined ratio. Excluding these, we are experiencing the modest deterioration we had expected. Frequency remains low, claim severity is relatively benign, and pure loss trend is marginally outpacing our modest rate gains. This deterioration is somewhat larger than the 30 basis point change in the adjusted combined ratio on the slide [slide 8] because the first quarter of 2009 does not include the positive impact of the adjustment we made to the full year '09 combined ratio in the second half of last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Financial, Professional &amp; International segment, net written premiums, after adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, were up significantly for the quarter. The primary driver of this increase was less ceded premium year over year, resulting mainly from changes in the structure of our reinsurance that directionally aligned retentions in our International business with the company's U.S. retention practices, and to a lesser extent, lower reinsurance costs.</p>
          <p>For the second consecutive quarter, we did see quarter-over-quarter growth in our Construction Surety book of business due to activity in our large national accounts market. In our International business, new business is up compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to growth in marine and accident and special risk products in Lloyd's.</p>
          <p>Operating earnings in the quarter were down from the prior-year quarter as a result of our exposure to multiple international events name &#x2013; named events, excuse me, primarily the Chilean earthquake. The losses we experienced were consistent with the fact that the Chilean earthquake was the seventh largest recorded and was 500 times stronger than the earthquake in Haiti.</p>
          <p>Turning to Personal Auto, agency retention remained strong and the renewal premium change continued to be positive. New business improved significantly, and it was at the highest level in the last five quarters. We believe that the new business declines that we saw in the previous quarters were due to the fact that we were ahead of the market in seeking increased rate. You can see from the change in Agency Auto's quarter-over-quarter combined ratio [slide 14] that profitability has improved, as rate gains are now outpacing loss costs. Approximately one point of this improvement was attributable to lower frequency which we believe was a result of the winter storms' impact on miles driven. After normalizing for the quarter's frequency, core Auto margins are improving and well within company targets.</p>
          <p>Within Agency Property, the story this quarter is clearly the weather. Adjusting for the weather, the combined ratio for the quarter was modestly higher compared to the prior-year quarter, a portion of which is the expected slight margin compression. This compression continues to be driven by year-over-year increases in the cost of materials, primarily asphalt shingles. Agency Property production results for the quarter continue to be strong. In spite of the difficult housing market, PIF continues to steadily grow, with strong retention and continued positive renewal premium change. New business is up significantly compared to the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>So even with an extraordinary number of catastrophic events in the quarter, we posted solid results. Core combined ratios remain within company targets, new business remains robust despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions, rate overall remains positive, and retentions continue to be strong. We believe that these results are a direct outcome of the long-term capabilities and competitive advantages we have built, as exemplified by our claim response this quarter. These capabilities are sustainable and will continue to differentiate Travelers with independent agents, customers and brokers.</p>
          <p>Now before I turn it back to Jay Benet, let me touch on an issue that's gotten a good bit of press. On page 17 we've outlined why we believe our exposure to Chinese drywall will not be problematic. First, from a business profile perspective, we have no direct liability exposure to Chinese drywall manufacturers and have virtually no general liability exposure to U.S. residential contractors. In fact, we have no general liability exposure to 37 of the 38 U.S. residential contractors identified in Bloomberg, and the one we do write has an SIR and our limits above that are minimal. On the Homeowners side, we are disproportionally underrepresented in the states with significant impacts. So we do not expect a significant number of claims, but given our policy structure limits profile, we believe any losses should be contained. Additionally, the fact that there is very strong product ID here is helpful. That is, we know where it is, where it came from, and when it got here, and all of this should help limit the spurious claim activity. To date, we've gotten 52 claims, and we are comfortable our overall exposure is not problematic.</p>
          <p>Now with that, let me turn it back to Jay Benet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Page 18 sets forth our guidance for full-year 2010's fully-diluted operating income per share, which is a range from $5.20 to $5.55, unchanged from what we've previously provided, which in round numbers should translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 11%.</p>
          <p>We're now assuming cat losses of $640 million after tax, or $1.30 per diluted share, which incorporates our actual cat losses for the first quarter and our original estimates for quarters two through four; no further estimates of prior-year reserve development, either favorable or unfavorable; a low single-digit decrease in average invested assets ex unrealized gains and losses, resulting from a reduction of holding company liquidity due to share repurchases; full-year share repurchases that are still in the range of 3.5 to 4.0 billion; and a weighted average diluted share count, after share repurchases and employee equity awards, in the range of 490 million shares to 495 million shares, which is a bit higher than what we had previously assumed due to the impact of the recent increase in the price of our shares.</p>
          <p>Before I close, let me explain, in response to several questions we've been asked, why we did not pre-release this quarter's cat losses. We write cat exposure as part of the ordinary course of our business, and cat losses are just one of a number of items that could impact a quarter's results. We think it is more informative generally to release all of our results together so that the information is presented in context. This is particularly true in a quarter like this, when the cat losses came from a number of relatively smaller events and we had losses from seven cats in the quarter, as Brian said, some of which occurred very late in the quarter.</p>
          <p>It's also our strong preference to take the time to apply our regular quarterly closing process to our results before we announce. This approach makes more sense for a company of the size that we are now, especially in a quarter when we had a number of moving pieces and our performance, on an overall basis, was generally consistent with our expectations. Finally, this approach is also consistent with the over-time nature of the company's stated financial objective and our previously disclosed intention to stop giving guidance beyond this year.</p>
          <p>So with that, I believe Jay has a closing comment he'd like to make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jay. Just one more comment before we open it up to questions.</p>
          <p>You may have noticed that a number of our senior executives have, over the last year or so, sold some of their shares, and I wanted to take the opportunity to clarify our views. Our senior executives receive a meaningful portion of their compensation in the form of performance-based equity. As a result of that, as well as our recent performance, all of our named executive officers and substantially all of our senior executives have equity positions that are well in excess of the company's ownership requirements. This actually has been the case for quite some time. The recent financial crisis underscored for all of us the importance of prudent personal financial planning and diversification. Given this, and our significant executive ownership, we don't discourage executive sales driven by personal financial decisions, as long as the minimum share ownership requirements continue to be met.</p>
          <p>And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Jay, can you talk about the expectation for continued improvement in the accident year combined ratios, X cats? We saw that in the first quarter, and just given the current environment, I'm trying to get a sense of whether you anticipate that continuing through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Jay Benet. I think when we look at each one of the segments, there's probably a bit of a different story. We had talked about some rate gains in the BI segment that had been in our written premium back in the second half of last year, and of course that will get earned in, along with the rate gains that we've seen in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Relative to loss trends, I think as Brian said earlier, loss trend, while it's running at a benign level, is still probably running a little bit ahead of where the rate gains have been, so we would expect, in terms of just the underlying trend in our business, to see some margin compression of a modest amount in the BI segment.</p>
          <p>If you flip to the other extreme and look at PI, PI is in a different position. PI has been experiencing rate gains for a period of time, and as those earn in and loss costs remain benign in that business, I think we'd see some margin expansion there, again, all things being equal. All of this is going to be dependent upon the weather and loss activity that you've heard us talk about from quarter to quarter. But I think just overall, slight expansion overall. Brian, do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. And Jay's comment there in PI is Auto.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; as I said in my comments, on the Homeowners side, there's a little bit of a margin compression. On the Auto side, we've definitely got expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jay, if you go back to the guidance, the previously-issued guidance that we issued and we are affirming this morning, what we said at the time was that we expected for the organization overall, total consolidated, that we expected modest, I think was the word we used, deterioration in the loss and LAE ratio for the organization overall. And that's still our underlying premise embedded in the guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other segment that we should comment upon is the FPII segment. Of course there's a very diverse mix of business there, but I'd say like BI, perhaps there, a slight level of margin compression as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>OK. And then my follow-up is on the expense ratio, now heading towards 33%. Are you comfortable with that level of expense ratio? And if so, maybe you can talk about what investments are driving that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I &#x2013; Jay, this is Brian. Yeah, the exact ratio is going to bounce around quarter to quarter as premium volumes move and there are other miscellaneous things going through on the expense side. But we have been making significant investments in our platforms across a lot of our businesses. Probably the most obvious are in small commercial and in the personal arena, where the product and platform are a significant part of our marketplace proposition. But even across middle market, we've been doing a lot of different things to connect the capabilities that we have in the marketplace, so that's been another area of investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I &#x2013; we always get a little reluctant in answering with respect to specific elements of the cost structure. Loss dollars are mitigated, or generated, by investment, and so expense loss ratio just can't be looked at, we don't think, in separate pieces, so we get back to returns on equity, and are we satisfied with our overall returns in our business, current returns as well as long-term prospects? And the answer's yes, we very much are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, everybody. Two quick questions here for you. First one, Brian, can you talk about PIF trends in personal auto insurance, and given that your combined ratios now are down to a more than acceptable level, should we expect to start seeing you guys &#x2013; that number stabilize and maybe, given some of the dynamics right now in the personal auto insurance market where there are some competitors with fairly high combined ratios, perhaps maybe picking up some share here going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Jay, I think we &#x2013; Brian, I'm sorry. We definitely do feel that way. Greg Toczydlowski is sitting here, why don't I throw it to him and have him talk about that a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Brian, as you indicated, we are feeling comfortable with the margins. And we watch two primary factors, that's the flow of our quote information, and we can clearly see that our quote flow is up. And then we look at the competitiveness of our quote activities, specifically in comparative raters, and we can see our close ratio is also up this quarter.  If you look at the stat supplement, you can see the output of that, that we do have sequential gain in PIF from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So as we've got those margins right in the middle of the target to where we want them to be, we're going to continue driving that growth, and you can see that in some of the data that we reported this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And then my second question, Jay, is I noticed that you said you took an extraordinary dividend out of the operating companies this quarter.  I'm curious, why'd you take the extraordinary dividend? And does that also mean that you still have your regular dividend capacity available to you this year, to the holding company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; this is Jay Benet. We ended up very, very &#x2013; in a very, very strong position in our operating companies at the end of the year.  Profitability in the fourth quarter was extremely strong and we do an analysis of what the capital levels are and decided that we were just overcapitalized, based on that profitability.  So rather than leaving it there to take out in the normal course, we went to the various <mark type="inaudible" /> that regulate us and showed them what our capital levels were, what we wanted to do, and then just asked if we could take it out sooner than later, and we did. So it's at the holding company, so we have the flexibility now going forward to just execute on our share repurchases, and we just think it's prudent management to do that when the operating companies have excess capital.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>I should say though, that that becomes &#x2013; without getting overly complex about it, this is a rolling calculation. So to the extent you get regulatory approval and increase the amount that you take out in a quarter, it'll change for the remainder of the year how much you could take out without regulatory approval. But we're confident that whatever we would like to take out of the operating companies, barring the unforeseen head catastrophe or whatever, we'll be able to do this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, everybody.  How are you?  First question, just respect to the guidance. You've maintained your projection for the year despite the incremental $0.50 a share in cats, a slightly higher share count, and even if net out the benefit of the reserve release. Is this guidance, or better guidance, driven by business trends, or is it the jump in non-investment income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually I think kind of more simple than that, which is that when you look at the results for the first quarter, the $1.25, $1.22 was absolutely consistent with what we had incorporated in our original full-year guidance of 5.20 to 5.55.  So the all-in first quarter results were very much consistent with our own &#x2013; the embedded number for the first quarter in the annual guidance, and so it's just a reaffirmation of the same underlying trends.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you'd expect for a company of our size and sophistication. I mean, we're constantly looking at what our plans are for the future, and in this particular case, as Jay said, we've incorporated the actuals for the first quarter into our revised look of investment income, looking at margins going forward, and based on hitting what we had expected to be the operating income or thereabouts in the first quarter, we haven't seen anything that would change the overall look for the rest of the year.</p>

          <p>And then just in regards to the non fixed income part of the portfolio, if you can talk a little bit about the volatility?

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Bill Heyman.  The &#x2013; I guess that begs the question of what is long-term.  We make private equity fund investments with the expectation that our capital will be out for an average of seven or eight years.  And I don't think we would make those investments if we didn't think there was a reasonable chance of low double-digit returns, although our estimates are more conservative than that, given the current climate.</p>
          <p>With respect to hedge funds, which are now only 500 million in a portfolio of 70 billion, the same hurdle is used, but for estimating purposes, we're in the mid to high single digits.  But over the long-term, we would require 12% or so to stay in these asset classes in any size.</p>

          <p>Okay, thanks.  And then, on reserve development, in the FPI line, it appears in the second &#x2013; the last two quarters, reserve development &#x2013; favorable reserve development has jumped up a bit from where it had been running, and I'm wondering if there's anything that you might be able to isolate to explain that?</p>
          <p>And then more generally on reserve development, can you talk at all about the complexion in the favorable development, and whether things &#x2013; whether the balance between reserve releases associated with case or IBNR reserves has changed over the last, let's call it six quarters or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As it relates to the first part of the question, looking at FPII. FPII goes through the same processes as the rest of our businesses. Each quarter we're looking at changes in actuarial views associated with very granular levels of our reserves, and whether it's in the International businesses or whether it's in the Bond &amp; Financial Products businesses, we'll take positive reserve development or negative reserve development when we see a need to do that.  And I don't think there's anything in particular that's been driving the reserve development in FPII, but it has been a part of, depending upon the quarter, partly Bond &amp; Financial Products and partly International.  The longer the tail associated with the business, the more we wait, so I think in the Bond &amp; Financial Products business, it's probably been more of the early 2000 type events that have been reserved for, and we've seen claim activity just settling out a little lower than what our expectations were.</p>
          <p>As it relates to just the rest of the businesses, I'm not sure I can really answer your question as to whether it's development on case reserves, versus rethinking of the IBNR, because as you know, as time goes on, there's less and less IBNR and more cases. So we tend to look at it in its totality, but it's the same phenomenon, whether it's looked at by an individual business line or a particular accident year. What we're seeing is that as time has developed on some of the longer-tail lines, we're seeing favorable reserve development that's dealing with less payments of claims than we anticipated.</p>
          <p>Some of the development is the roll-forward from older accident years to more current accident years, if in fact the reserve analysis is indicating that the original loss picks were higher than what they would seem to be.  But that's not the major driver of it. The major driver is just looking at the claim activity.  I hope that's responsive to your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I interrupt for a second? I want to go back and just actually clarify an answer that we gave previously in response to the question about the expense ratio. Just as I've been reflecting on it, and I said, were the returns in our business generally consistent with our expectations to produce long-term mid-teens return on equity? That was the sort of shorthand that I was giving you. And I said, yes, they were.</p>
          <p>We always have lines of business, always have lines of business, where the returns are not at levels that we want them to be, and we have been consistently public about seeking rate gains where we need them.  So I didn't mean to imply by that answer that every product that we have met hurdles in every specific way.</p>
          <p>In a very general sense, in responding to the question about the expense ratio overall, we feel pretty good about the overall returns that our portfolio of products generate. But it certainly doesn't mean that we don't have products where the competitive environment is such that strategically, we're seeking rate, so that we can bring those products either into the range of acceptability, and there's a number of those that are not, or further up into the range of acceptability to meet our long-term hurdles.</p>
          <p>I hope that's clarifying.  But it was really a complex question asked in a very simple way.</p>
          <p>We can go back to the questions, operator. Thank you.</p>

Is that because that renewal rate is calculated based on policy count?

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; what you're missing is what we had disclosed in the fourth quarter in a bar graph that we presented, what's the impact of exposure, changes, cancellations, endorsements, and audit premium. And that's what gets you to the dollar amount of the premiums in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So if you were to do that with Business Insurance, what you'd see is about 82% net retained business, another 19% new business, approximately 1% of rate, all of which would have been a 2% increase in net written premium. And what's taking place is about a negative 6% relating to exposure, cancellations, endorsements, and audit premium, that translates into the negative 4% overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very &#x2013; and just one last question, if I could.  On leverage, how important is operating near that one-to-one premium to reserve loss? Is that a target, or is that more just a result of other things that you're doing?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's absolutely the result.  What I've indicated before is that we have the various rating agency models that we apply, along with risk-based capital, and whether it's A.M Best  to par or the S&amp;P or Moody's models or Fitch models, we evaluate what the operating company capital requirements should be for a strong AA company, as we are.</p>
          <p>And from that, we then look at the leverage of the holding company, the holding company cash, to come up with the actual capital position. And the fact that premiums to surplus is approximately one to one is not something we look at. It is absolutely the result of that process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add a comment, and Brian, make sure I'm right on this, about the &#x2013;  because we tend to lump them together, this exposure, audit premium, and it's a function of the way that our arithmetic is done.</p>
          <p>There are two &#x2013; there are several different dynamics operating there, but the two principal ones are audit premiums, which one should think of as retrospective in nature.  Clients make estimates of what their ratable factors are at the inception of a policy.  At the end of a policy, we come in and we do an audit. It turns out the ratable factors &#x2013; it might be payroll, it might be sales, it might be trucks on the road &#x2013; but it turned out to be less than they had originally anticipated because of the speed and depth of the decline in the economy, and so we have an audit premium. They return a previously written premium to us.  We think of that as a &#x2013; as almost a retrospective adjustment.</p>
          <p>Then there's embedded in our renewal business change in exposure on a renewal basis, which is not always entirely factual, because once again, clients make estimates of what their ratable factors will be, and it wouldn't surprise any of us if in fact, given the economy, that there's a tendency at the moment to continue to overestimate, if you like, the impact of the economy.  And so it becomes difficult to -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Understate the exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And understate the exposure, which is something we believe is happening today but we can't prove it and we can't obviously find it in the numbers.</p>
          <p>And it'll be interesting, as the economy levels out and ultimately returns, to watch the &#x2013; our sense is that the retrospective audit premium dynamic will be the first to change, because in fact, the catch-up will occur, and then we'll begin to see the renewal dynamic of exposure a little slower and a little bit longer.</p>
          <p>But those are two very different dynamics of the economy that just tend, given our arithmetic, to be lumped together. I mean, maybe that's helpful in thinking about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean one of the other interesting thoughts here, as you look at our data, and probably across &#x2013; broadly across much of our business, but certainly in the Business Insurance side, we're growing our customer base.  It's hard to see in the premium, because -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just number of customers is growing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Because our typical &#x2013; and I'm not just talking about, we're writing a whole bunch of small ones, so the numbers are larger. We're, in the aggregate, growing our customer base.  The premium is struggling because our typical customer might need a little less insurance than they do in normally robust times, and that typically comes through on the AP side, audit premium side. So it's an important note, though, that we feel good were about the business growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's a bit forward-looking and obviously may not happen, but if in fact we come out of this with more customers than we had coming into it, when the economy does recover, we think we'll be reasonably well positioned to anticipate a growth in premium. But a lot of factors got to happen, obviously, for the economy &#x2013; forget recover, has to continue to stabilize first.  But it's &#x2013; at the very basic core of it, we're &#x2013; we think we're going to be coming out of this with more Business Insurance customers than we went coming into it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  On the Personal Auto front, you had a sequential PIF growth quarter over quarter.  Could you give us a sense for what the competitive dynamic is within the industry, and how you're managing to grow the business now versus the last few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. Vinay, this is Greg Toczydlowski. I think in Brian's comments, he talked about us being in front of some of the rate cycle in late 2008 into 2009, and you can see that in our RPC statistics.  We spend quite a bit of time really looking at filing activity across the country and understanding what the competitors are doing in terms of simple metrics like the ratio of increases of filings to decreases, and we see an environment where increases are still outpacing decreases and by quite a bit, closer to 4 to 1 right now.</p>
          <p>So as we moderate some of our rate, as the market moves with some of theirs, probably to the levels that we were at in 2009, again, as I talked about our quote and close ratios, we can see we are becoming more competitive in the marketplace and feeling very good about our margins underneath that.  And that's driving some of the sequential PIF growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, when you just said "becoming more competitive", it's easy to come to the conclusions from that statement that we're lowering price.  What you really mean is that the pricing that we've established, is that the market seems to be catching up to it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure, fair enough.  And your margins have also improved this year versus last year.  Could you give us a sense of whether this is a purely because of rate, or do you think that there's some elements in the loss cost trends, either frequency or severity, that's also helping you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination of both.  We've been very disciplined in our pricing at a very segmented level, and you can see that in the RPC trends.  And the loss trend we're watching very closely, and I &#x2013; some of the mileage driven data and information that's out there is showing that there's been a slight improvement in frequency in the first quarter, and it's &#x2013; the loss trend is right where our expectations are and we're going to continue with our very focused and disciplined pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, that's great.  And one last question, if I may.  On the &#x2013; some of the excess and surplus lines players have said that the competition among the standard players is growing.  Could you give us a sense how Travelers is ensuring that you're not writing business that is normally being written by the excess and surplus lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we look &#x2013; we watch very closely who we're taking business from, where it's coming from, and are very confident that we are not out there writing any significant number of accounts that belong in the E&amp;S market.  The one place that I'll comment, that sometimes some competitors who are in that space will talk about people taking accounts. Sometimes there are accounts that are in that marketplace because the agent, that is the only way, in the small commercial side, that they can access markets.  And so one of the other reasons why business moves out of excess and surplus lines, wholesale businesses, into traditional distribution, is the agents, hopefully for all appropriate reasons, get appointed and come directly to us, and so that's one &#x2013; but that's not I think the issue you're talking about, which is, there are accounts that belong in that marketplace because they're complex risks and shouldn't be written in standard markets, and we're very comfortable that we're not taking that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And from time to time, we will have a program, because we've talked about these before, where it's written both in excess and surplus markets as well as in admitted markets, in standard markets.  And so we do have an amount of business that we have had for a long time that's been around here, programs in particular, that are also written in the E&amp;S market.  But again, to Brian's question &#x2013; Brian's answer, there has been no effort on our part to aggressively move business that has historically been in the E&amp;S markets and move it over to us, quite &#x2013; just no.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everybody.  I was curious if you could just comment on the reinsurance changes you made internationally?  And I guess specifically, just clarify whether, when you say you're changing the retention, the retention is at a similar level to &#x2013; like the U.S. excess of loss treaty, which I think is 500 &#x2013; or excuse me, the attachment point is there &#x2013; or relative to capital you've scaled the attachment point similar to where it is in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's Alan Schnitzer.  Neither, actually.  This is on a per-risk basis.  We have been keeping lower net retentions internationally than we had in the U.S., so really just conforming that up a little bit.</p>
          <p>And then we've got some individual cat treaties related to our Lloyd's businesses that attach at much lower levels, and we move those up a little bit, but from 35 to 70. Nowhere near the numbers that you're relating from the U.S.  So really a direction -</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I just was &#x2013; just wanted to make sure that you weren't expanding your gross appetite in concert with this, or whether it was truly just a net/net without the gross line changing. That was the only reason I was asking the question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's worth including just given how accounting works, that this change is disproportionate between gross and net in this quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; in this segment, we've got a significant portion of the reinsurance that renews and all the CD premium gets booked in the quarter that it renewed, so it's got a significant impact in this quarter. It'll earn in over the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's not &#x2013; there's a &#x2013; tends to be a presumption that these things happen ratably, and actually, it's not how it works.  The requirement is to actually cede the entire amount from the gross at inception, not over the policy period, so this impact -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; for written. And so it looks like a bigger impact than on an annual &#x2013; it &#x2013; what you're looking at is the annual effect all being evidenced in one quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That makes sense.  Just wanted to make sure.  And then I guess, with respect to the Industry-Focused Underwriting segment, are there any particular segments that you would highlight as being disproportionate drivers of the pressure in that segment?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; you've seen &#x2013; it looks like the economy's having a bit bigger impact, given the rate trends there don't look dramatically different from the rest of the BI segment, that it just looks like it's suffering a little bit more. So I was just curious if there's any industry classes or segments that you would highlight as disproportionately driving it, or if it's just kind of consistent across everything in that segment?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Bill Cunningham.  The two that come to mind are Construction and Oil &amp; Gas.  The amount of construction activity on the Commercial side is down fairly dramatically, so we're seeing that impact both payroll and revenues for our contractors. And there's obviously less drilling on the Oil &amp; Gas side.  So those two classes are certainly disproportionate.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Good morning.  Two questions.  The first is, if you could talk more about the new business environment?  New business was up year-over-year and commercial accounts down.  You made some comments, I'm wondering if you can flesh that out a little bit as far as competitive environment for new business?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, one topic we haven't talked about in a long time is asbestos.  I hate to just cross it off my list as something to worry about. I'm wondering if you can give us an update of what's happening there.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi Jay.  This is Brian.  I'll tag team a little bit with Bill Cunningham on the new business side. And I assume you're talking specifically to Business Insurance there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So a couple of different stories.  I think the broad one is, we've been doing a ton of things in the marketplace over the last three plus years to drive more flow and more opportunities, and a bunch of different fronts.  We've talked about them in the past.  That has continued.  We feel great about the amount of business that we're seeing in the marketplace and our ability to go through that in a pretty sophisticated way and find opportunities.  So broadly, middle market, we feel great about it.</p>
          <p>On the small Commercial side, on the small end, the platform that we've rolled out in Select in our Travelers &#x2013; I mean our Express platform there has driven a lot of volume, as we would have hoped, and we're seeing a lot of opportunity there.</p>
          <p>The challenge is the gap between those, and by that I mean what we typically call the higher end of small Commercial, where the marketplace is more competitive.  And that's the area where we're taking some pricing actions and seeing lower volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, pricing actions upward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, upward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Upward.</p>

          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  On the Commercial insurance business the &#x2013; what's happening to your hit ratios, just to follow up on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the hit ratios are down.  I mean, the overall comment would be the new business environment remains competitive. As Brian mentioned, our flow of opportunities is up, continues to be up year-over-year, month &#x2013; month this year compared to month last year.  There's been a consistent increase each month, each quarter.  We've worked through more opportunities. Our quotes ratios -</p>

          <p>Quotes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">

          <p>&#x2013; about consistent. Our hit ratio -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quotes. You got an increase &#x2013; we just &#x2013; we got an increase in quotes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our hit ratio's down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We got an increase &#x2013; so go through the pieces.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So flow -- flows today, just to give you some perspective, is up twofold compared to what it was three years ago.  So we're seeing <mark type="inaudible" /> increase in new business volume in terms of number of account opportunities as we did three years ago.  But &#x2013; and we're maintaining about the same quote ratio.  So the number of accounts that we're quoting is about double compared to what it was three years ago.  The percentage that we're actually getting an order on is down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Jay Benet.  The environment that we've seen in the first quarter has been very much the same environment that we've seen in recent quarters.  There's literally been no change.  We all would welcome the day when we could watch a sporting event and not see an advertisement from a plaintiff's attorney talking about asbestos.  So that continues in the marketplace.  But there really haven't been any major new developments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you.  I've &#x2013; they asked my question but I didn't know how to get off the queue, but &#x2013; so I'll ask another one.  The advertising spend. How do you guys think about the payback in advertising spend, and is it meeting your objectives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The advertising spend is really &#x2013; you can look at it in two separate pieces.  There's an element of it that's pure brand, and the spending that we've done on that over the last several years has been long-term investment-oriented, not action-driven.</p>
          <p>The ramp-up that we've had in advertising has been very specifically behind our direct-to-consumer business, where we're doing a lot more.  The short story on our direct-to-consumer personal lines initiative is that it's a long-term program.  We said we would lose money along the way. We continue to lose money on it.</p>
          <p>In terms of driving customers from media to a quoting process, that's been actually pretty encouraging. So in the context of the effectiveness of the advertising, if the measure of it is the response that people have to it, that's actually been pretty good.  Then the next learnings that we've had, and we've spoken about it, next learnings we have to take on, is learning how to convert that response into higher numbers of quotes, and then ultimately into higher number of sales.  And in that arena, we still have &#x2013; about consistent what our expectations, we have a long way to go before this becomes a successful business venture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of your competitors, very few of them, say that they have a brand advantage in the commercial lines.  Do you think that the advertising can help with that for Travelers?  Do you see any indication from your customers that they're identifying with the brand on the Commercial side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the best way that we can answer that, and of course this is all anecdotal and could be wrong, but if you sit with a group of agents, particularly those in our Business Insurance arena, they all are aware of the advertising effort that we've undertaken, they all comment on it, and they all say that it makes their job easier.  Now, they could just be talking that &#x2013; they could just be telling us that and not have it be substantive.</p>
          <p>But it is pretty clear to us that the agents do indeed see it, they appreciate it, and at least as they describe to us, it's helpful to them.  I don't &#x2013; I don't know, is the specific answer, with respect to customers.</p>
          <p>I do -- if you do watch Brand Tracker data, and we do, but again, this is a very long-term venture for us and I don't want to overreact to either good news or bad news in that regard. But Brand Tracker data would suggest that our advertising is being effective in terms of customer recognition.  Now that's predominantly in the Personal side.  But again, these are all long-term efforts to accomplish something over time.</p>

          <p>Hi.  I guess, two questions.  First one is, can you talk a little bit about the decline in non-cat weather? I guess that surprised me. I thought when you have snow in all 50 states at the same time, and not all 50 of those states were cat events, I would have thought non-cat and cat weather would be up this quarter. But you and Chubb both were saying that non-cat was down, so can you &#x2013; is there a categorization thing, where last year, things were just below the cat threshold, and this year, there were a lot of events just above, or?</p>

I think the fundamental dynamic is the last point you're making, which is, this quarter the little tiny silver lining around the big dark clouds was the events were so bad that they all flipped into the &#x2013; getting categorized as a cat event. So our normal first quarter flow of weather events is always there, 'cause there's always snowstorms and there's always a little bit of wind and there's always some of that.  Most of that got lumped into a cat, and therefore we've got a offsetting benefit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Ian, that was the primary reason why we try to be very transparent on the fact that there was favorable non-cat weather.  We think it's important for you to understand what the underlying dynamics are in the business and be able to look at combined ratios with that in mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, exactly. That's why I just wanted to make sure that, when we're looking at opportunities or X cats, that &#x2013; yeah, that there's a little bit of moving pieces in there, so no, appreciate that.</p>
          <p>My other question is on Auto. I guess, can you help me get more comfortable that the 95 &#x2013; this quarter is sort of that you're sustainably back below 96? And the reason I ask it that way is, each of the last couple years you've been at 98, 99, and there's been a quarter in there that's below 96, and then you go right back up. And to be honest, when I look at your reserve triangles for Auto, you've had a adverse development the last couple years, your paid and IBNR trends, frankly, look a little weaker than your peers. But on the other hand, obviously you've got pricing coming through.</p>
          <p>I mean, sort of where are we? Are we comfortable that we're below 96? Or is it that we're hopeful and we need a couple more quarters to see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So a couple of pieces, Ian, and then Greg, you can chime in.  As I said in my comments, we got about a point of good news running through there because of the weather impact on frequency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the 95 and change is, we think, from a run-rate perspective, a little bit understated.</p>
          <p>We are seeing &#x2013; we have been taking some rate actions, as we've talked about, and we are seeing now that that rate is exceeding loss costs.  So we are expanding our margins there and we feel good about it.</p>
          <p>There also is seasonality in how the ratios come through, and that's one of the reasons why they do bounce around a bit. But Greg, if you want to -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, just to comment on that seasonality. We typically see in the first quarter a little lower relativity, and we certainly talk to you about the fourth quarter about a much higher relativity. And so when you consider all of that, and to Brian's comment on the rate offsetting some of the loss trend, and Jay's comment about we have target ranges of a return on capital for this line, based on all that, we feel like the product is right in the middle of where we want the &#x2013; of those targets.  We feel comfortable with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Is maybe a fair way to say it, that it may not be below 96 every quarter, but hopefully it's at 96 for the year, as your earned keeps &#x2013; the earned price keeps coming through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at the &#x2013; we certainly price the product on a longer imputed basis, yes. It's very difficult to do it at a quarterly level.  And &#x2013; but the ranges that we look at overall in terms of profit targets for the product line is closer to the 96 to 99 range.  So when we consider all of that, we feel like we're right in &#x2013; inside those targets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it.  Yeah, I was just &#x2013; I'm not sort of questioning can you get there. I guess the one thing that surprised me is, even if I take Brian's comment and adjust the 95 back to a 96, I guess the &#x2013; and some seasonality, just seemed a big drop from where the full '09 year was, and I would have thought the earned pricing would have come in a little bit &#x2013; more gradually.  Unless there were some other benefits you were seeing possibly.  You see what I'm getting at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think what might distort it though, is if you're look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis, particularly sequentially -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; we do have the fourth quarter which has the higher loss content associated with it, and then you flip into the first quarter, which has, by its nature and the seasonality factors, the lower loss content, so -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; I think you'd see &#x2013; you'd have see it develop over a few more quarters, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's a little bit complicated when you're looking at quarter over quarter of this year, for the 2009 period, we did have some adverse activity in the first quarter of 2009 for the fourth quarter of 2008, so when you adjust some of that, which we really look at more in an accident year, the health of the business, the trends certainly come through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the bottom line here, Ian, without giving you a precise number for what we think the full year Auto's going to be, we feel better about the Auto line.  There were some unusual seasonal things going through, but we feel good about the rate we're getting and the loss costs are controlled, and relative to where we've been, we've seen &#x2013; we see some real improvement here.</p>

          <p>Hi.  Guess there's no prizes for being last.  I just had a question about your Lloyd's businesses, and I was wondering how much hard and soft capital supports your Lloyd's businesses? And explicitly, how much in the way of LOCs do you use to make up that &#x2013; those amounts?</p>
