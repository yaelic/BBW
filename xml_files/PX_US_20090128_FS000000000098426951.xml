          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone.  Today's presentation materials are available on our website at www.praxair.com in the "Investors" section.  Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page three for a summary of our full year results.  Please note that our discussion of earnings for both the full year and the fourth quarter, including year-over-year comparisons, excludes the charges taken in the fourth quarter for restructuring and other actions and the pension settlement charge taken in the first quarter.  These charges are detailed and reconciled to GAAP reported numbers in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.</p>
          <p>Our 2008 full year results were very strong, with sales up 15%, earnings per share up 16% and record operating cash flow of over $2 billion.  These results reflect strong sales growth in the first three quarters and a sequential decline in the fourth quarter due to sharply lower volumes in November and December and negative impact from currency translation.  2008 sales reached $10.8 billion, sales growth came primarily from volume growth and higher pricing.  In addition several core business acquisitions we made during the year contributed 2% to sales growth.  Currency added 3% for the year, significantly below the 6% we had in the first three quarters, because of the significant weakening of foreign currencies in the fourth quarter.  We grew operating profit 16% to 2.1 billion.  Strong pricing gains, productivity programs and cost reduction contributed to the overall improvement in operating margin to 19.2% for the year.</p>
          <p>Full year net income was $1.3 billion, 14% above net income in 2007.  Earnings per share of $4.20 grew 16% versus prior year on a lower share count due to primarily to our stock repurchases during the year.  Our return on capital for the year was 15.3% in line with 2007.  We started up a record number of new projects in 2008, which increased our capital base, but the high project returns generated contributed to the strong earnings growth.</p>
          <p>We generated over $2 billion of operating cash flow, which was a record.  This was primarily a result of the growth in net income, higher depreciation due to new plants that started up during the year, and improvements in working capital.  Capital expenditures were 1.6 billion, supporting a large number of growth projects that we're building under contract for customers.  We spent $76 million on acquisitions net of divestitures.  Our acquisitions were primarily North American Packaged Gas distributors.  We continue to be very selective about acquisitions and highly disciplined in terms of risk and returns.</p>
          <p>In 2008 we purchased $892 million of stock net of issuances.  622 million of this amount was completed under the $1 billion authorization we announced in July, as we opportunistically took advantage of lower share prices.  We also paid 468 million in dividends.</p>
          <p>We announced this morning that we are increasing our quarterly dividend from $0.375 to $0.40 in the first quarter of 2009.  Additionally, we plan to continue our stock buyback program in 2009, using the remaining 378 million of the 1 billion authorization approved by the Board of Directors last July.  This is a strong indication of the confidence we have in our ability to continue to grow our cash flow, while funding our backlog of large growth opportunities despite the currently weak environment.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page four for our fourth quarter results.  Our results in the fourth quarter reflect two significant changes in the business trends we had been seeing through the first three quarters.  First is the currency headwind resulting from the sharp and rapid appreciation of the dollar in response to risk aversion in the global credit crisis.  Secondly, as economic conditions worsened and led to the steep drop in commodity prices globally, many customers significantly reduced production rates beginning in November.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter sales of 2.4 billion were 5% below 2007.  Excluding currency, sales rose 2% as higher pricing and a small contribution from acquisitions offset a 4% overall decline in volumes.  The largest volume declines occurred in three markets: electronics, chemicals and metals.  These industries are going through significant inventory destocking, due to declining demand and falling prices for their products.  The volume declines we saw in these markets were partially offset by higher sales to energy, food and beverage and healthcare.  Business trends in general manufacturing markets have continued to slow sequential volume decline we had seeing all year, in line with the slowdown in industrial production.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of 491 million was slightly above prior year, but lower than the third quarter due to primarily to the volume and currency effects I mentioned.  A portion of the negative currency impact was offset by 17 million of net currency hedge gains.  As we said last quarter, we've been hedging net income and foreign currencies one quarter forward on a rolling basis.  This net gain is the mark-to-market impact of those hedges and largely offset at the net income line the impact from weaker currencies.  Operating margin increased to 20.4% as we increased operating profit despite the decline in sales.  In addition to the hedge gains, which helped offset some of the negative currency impact, we were able to quickly realize some benefits of our cost reduction program, which we announced last month.  The amount of the charge in our reported numbers was 177 million on a pre-tax basis.</p>
          <p>This amount included 118 million related to severance and non-core business restructures in order to achieve about $100 million of run rate cost savings to offset the impact on our operating profit of the global economic downturn.  Because we moved quickly back in October, we expect to realize 80% of this amount in 2009.  This is one of the main reasons that we expect to be able to maintain our margins in 2009 versus 2008, despite the decline in our volumes.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter net income was $314 million, slightly below prior year due to the higher effective tax rate.  Our effective tax rate this quarter, excluding the restructuring charge, was 28.5% versus 26.5% last year, which is in line with our guidance for the year. Earnings per share, excluding the charge, were $1.01 as compared to $0.98 in the prior year.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations in the quarter was a record $640 million from net income depreciation and a net working capital benefit coming primarily from lower levels of receivables due to strong collections and lower sales.  Cash flow primarily funded CapEx of 482 million and five small packaged gas acquisitions.  Debt increased a bit primarily to fund $177 million of net share repurchases in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, I will review our results for North America, which are summarized on pages five and six.  Sales in North America were 1.36 billion, 2% above the prior year quarter ex-currency.  Strong pricing gains of 6% and a 2% contribution from acquired packaged gas distributors offset 6% lower volume.  The largest volume declines were in electronics, chemicals and steel, the industries which have significantly cut their production levels to work down excess inventories.  Also, because of weakening demand, many large customers closed plants down ahead of the holidays, and these closures have extended into January.  Sales to general manufacturing markets were about 5% below prior year, continuing the slow sequential weakening we saw throughout the year.  A bright spot is energy. Our sales to this market were 23% above prior year due to strong demand for hydrogen biorefiners and strong demand for nitrogen for enhanced oil recovery.</p>
          <p>Overall on-site sales were about flat with the prior year.  On-site hydrogen volumes were up 11%, which offset a 12% decline in atmospheric volumes.  Merchant liquid sales were up 1%, with 6% pricing gains offsetting about a 5% volume decline.  We signed new business during the quarter for food, energy and environmental applications.  For example, last week we announced a new hydrogen supply contract with Dynamic Fuels.  We will be supplying this company hydrogen, which they will use to produce synthetic fuels from non-food grade animal fats.  These fuels are expected to provide performance and environmental advantages over petroleum-based fuels.</p>
          <p>Packaged gases sales in North America were 2% above the prior year ex-currency. Higher pricing and acquisitions offset lower volumes.  In PDI, our U.S. and Canadian business same-store sales declined 1% versus prior year.  Gases same-store sales were up 5% and hard goods down 10%.  Pricing was strong and offset negative volumes in gases and hard goods.  Lower gases volumes reflect declining industrial production, and lower hard goods sales reflect reduced capital spending on machines and equipment by customers because of lack of credit and the uncertain economic outlook.</p>
          <p>Our early read for first quarter is very cautious, as January sales have been weak coming out of the holidays.  Our business in Mexico had another very strong quarter with underlying sales up 22%.  Manufacturing is slowing there sequentially as the economy is tied very closely to the U.S.  We expect our energy business to remain strong as oil production is the government's main source of revenue.</p>
          <p>North America operating profit grew 5% from prior year to 267 million and the operating margin increased to 19.7%.  Higher pricing and cost reductions more than offset the impact of lower volumes.  Our outlook for the first quarter is for volumes to remain at a low level due to weak demand, extended holiday shutdowns by our customers, and several planned plant maintenance turnarounds by refiners.  New proposal activity for large customers outside the energy sector has slowed.  As I mentioned, we continue to sign new liquid contracts for non-cyclical markets and for productivity and environmental applications.</p>
          <p>Please look at page seven for our results in Europe.  Sales in Europe of 322 million were 3% below prior year ex-currency.  In Spain, volume declines were driven by metals and general manufacturing.  In Germany, pipeline volumes declined to chemicals and steel.  Packaged gas sales were above prior year, as we believe many businesses are doing repair and maintenance work during production down time.  While base business volumes are down broadly across the continent, we have gained new merchant business for wastewater, environmental and productivity applications.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of 83 million includes a $4 million hedge gain, which offset some of the currency impact, but we're maintaining margin through pricing, productivity and accelerated cost-reduction actions.</p>
          <p>Page eight reviews South America.  South America segment sales were 382 million.  Currency depreciation reduced sales by 18% year-over-year and underlying growth was 4%.  Brazil saw a contraction in industrial production in the fourth quarter.  Rising commodity prices throughout the first three quarters of the year had fueled significant growth and investment in the country's export industries.  In the fourth quarter, many large customers cut production as much as 30%, as world prices for their products fell.</p>
          <p>Our overall volumes declined modestly driven by the large customers.  Merchant and packaged volumes were steady with strong pricing gains.  Sales to food and healthcare markets remain strong.  Our sales of LNG and CNG grew 25% versus last year, as our joint venture company with Petrobras continues to sign more contracts with customers.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of 87 million included 9 million of net currency hedge gains.  But excluding this, our margin percentage was higher than prior year and pricing and cost reduction offset the impact of lower volumes.  Sequentially for the first quarter, we expect volumes to remain low as this is the summer season in Brazil.  Longer term, we expect that growth will come from a return to a more normalized run rate by our customers and new plant start-ups from our backlog of committed projects.</p>
          <p>Page nine highlights our results in Asia.  Sales in Asia of 209 million grew 8% ex-currency versus 2007.  We had higher on-site and merchant liquid volumes in most end markets from new business and new plant start-ups, offset this quarter by a significant decline in electronics where volumes were down 14% year-over-year.  Industrial production in the fourth quarter slowed and we expect it will be in the 0 to 5% range in China and India in 2009.  So we expect that our base business will grow more or less in line with that range, supplemented by new project start-ups.</p>
          <p>Our current backlog is strong and we expect it to hold with a few projects delayed by the customer for several months.  New proposal activity for large projects has taken a pause in the short-term like it has elsewhere around the world.  But we continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business in the developing economies of China and India.</p>
          <p>Key growth areas for us include gasification projects in China.  China will continue to stimulate its economy to provide jobs, upgrade its infrastructure and become more self-reliant in basic industries, like chemicals and plastics and energy.  And these projects require significant amounts of industrial gases.  Asia's operating profit and operating margin were comparable to last year at $34 million and 16.3%, respectively.  Our outlook for 2009 is for normalized sales growth, ex-currency, in the range of 10 to 15%.  We expect the normal sequential decline in the first quarter because of the Chinese New Year holiday.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 10 for a discussion of Surface Technologies results.  PST's [Praxair Surface Technologies] results this quarter were $135 million, about even with last year, but up 4% ex-currency.  Growth was muted by lower volumes of jet engine EBPVD coatings due to two factors.  First, the delay in delivery dates for the new Boeing and Airbus plane programs has pushed out the production schedule for the next-generation, fuel-efficient engines.  As a result, GE and the other OEMs have not yet ramped up the number of parts they will send to us that need to be coated.  Secondly, the Boeing labor strike delayed the normal production of the current CFM56 engines, and this also pushed out our pipeline of parts to coat.  But we expect this business to pick up in the coming year.</p>
          <p>Offsetting the slower aviation business is growth in sales to the energy sector.  Coatings for industrial gas turbines are strong, with key end-users in China and the Middle East.  Coatings for oilfield service components are also growing.  Though oil prices are down, we do not expect to see a fall-off in this business, even if drilling declines, because we are securing a greater penetration of the parts which are coated in this industry.  Operating profit of $20 million declined due to the mix effect of lower aerospace coatings, which have the highest margin.  The margin percentage will improve as these volumes pick up.</p>
          <p>Now, I will turn this call over to Jim, who will discuss our end market trends and our outlook and earnings guidance.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Liz.  Please turn to page 11, which shows our global end-market trends.  This page shows you year-over-year sales growth for our major end markets, excluding currency, acquisitions and natural gas pass-through.  So it represents real organic growth from price and volume.  We've included the third quarter numbers next to this quarter so you can get a sense for the comparisons.  What you can see is that while sales to all our major end markets were up in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter the business environment changed significantly, such that energy, food and healthcare are up, but the others are all down.</p>
          <p>Growth in the energy market primarily reflects higher hydrogen sales to refineries.  Hydrogen demand from refiners has continued to be strong despite the drop in oil prices, because refineries need hydrogen for de-sulfurization of crude to make low-sulfur diesel and other metal distillates.  Our global hydrogen sales in 2008 were over 1.1 billion, up from 840 million in 2007.  This growth came from new business and higher demand from existing customers, with two very large plants scheduled to start up in North America in 2010.  Sales in this end market also include gas sales for enhanced oil recovery and gas well fracturing.</p>
          <p>We expect EOR to continue to be a good growth market and these projects are under long-term contract.  The fracing market has continued to be strong, but we expect to see it slow down in the near term due to low gas prices and cut backs and capital spending by some of the drillers.</p>
          <p>Electronics slowed down considerably in the fourth quarter.  Fabs and foundries cut production volume significantly in the U.S., Europe and Asia due to declining demand for PCs and flat panel TVs, emanating ultimately from the consumer.  Semiconductor chip production was down about 10% in the fourth quarter and is expected to contract significantly more in 2009.  So our near-term outlook for this market is not positive.  We expect to continue to see growth in wind business and the solar market, but this is a small part of our overall business today.  The chemicals sector, as we previously discussed, customers reduced production significantly in November and December.  We saw this in our U.S. volumes first, while our volumes in Europe supplied of our German pipeline system held up pretty well until later in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In Asia, sales were up year-over-year due to new project starts.  Sales to the metals sector declined 9% in the quarter.  The U.S. producers cut back production significantly throughout the quarter.  Following the cutbacks for the U.S. producers, we've also seen a slowdown in the rest of the world, but not to the same extent.  This sector is working through inventory de-stocking and, though we have not seen a meaningful pick up in volumes yet, we do expect it to return to a more normalized level of demand in 2009.  You can see that sales to manufacturing reflect the slowdown in global industrial production, which we expect will be in the range of negative 2 to 5% for 2009.</p>
          <p>This sector may get a boost from infrastructure spending, but that is not something we're going to be counting on.</p>
          <p>Healthcare sales are up 6%; it's not a cyclical end market and our businesses in Brazil and Spain are growing nicely as is our U.S. hospital business.  Decline in aerospace is due to lower PST volumes, which Liz previously discussed.</p>
          <p>Finally, food and beverage continues to be very resilient and shows steady growth around the world from new accounts and new technologies.  Sales were up 8% this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to page 12 for some detail on our capital spending plans.  We expect our capital spending in 2009 to be in the range of 1.4 to 1.5 billion, about 10% below our spend in 2008.  20% of this amount, or about 300 million, is for maintenance CapEx in our base business.  We will spend another 70 to 75 million for cost-reduction projects, which is an ongoing part of our business.  For example, we will be replacing compression equipment or turbo machinery at existing plants to improve energy efficiency.  We typically look for a three-year payback on these investments.  Most of our capital spend, however, is for new production plants or expansion of existing plants, which are supported by 15 to 20-year customer contracts with take-or-pay provisions and fixed-price cost pass-through provisions.</p>
          <p>We currently have a strong backlog of 42 large onsite projects, which are in some stage of construction and which are scheduled to come on stream in 2009 to 2011.  Projects are in very diverse end markets.  You can see from the pie chart on this page where the capital dollars we expect to spend this year will be invested by region.  Large percentages in North America, which may seem surprising because energy is our largest growth market and these new hydrogen projects are very large.  Our largest projects are two hydrogen plants we're building in Indiana and California.  After that, it would be two large oxygen plants we're building in China to supply coal gasifiers being built by chemical customers.  We also have a large number of projects in South America and Asia, supplying metals, manufacturing, paper, electronics and chemical customers.</p>
          <p>While the pace of new project approvals has paused because of the uncertain environment we're in, we expect 90% of the projects in our backlog to be completed and come on stream on schedule.  While several customers have requested delays in the scheduled startup dates, we have strong contracts with these customers and, in most cases, a significant investment has already been made in the customer project we're supplying.  And in addition, when the new project starts up, it will be a low-cost competitive facility, which the customer will run.</p>
          <p>Please look at page 13 for our productivity initiatives.  In 2008, we achieved 320 million in cost savings from productivity initiatives throughout the company.  As you can see, this amount increases every year as we grow.  Our target has been to achieve productivity savings each year of about 4% of our fixed cost.  This is critical to offset cost inflation in the business.  Without it, margins would deteriorate.  We've been able to increase margins by getting price increases in addition to productivity.</p>
          <p>For 2009, we've stepped up our cost-reduction program because of the impact on our business of the global recession.  We're accelerating our productivity initiatives and the severance and cost reduction actions we announced in December will give us an additional 80 million in savings in 2009.  And we will reduce additional discretionary costs as necessary in order to reduce costs enough to offset the lower volumes we expect.  Therefore, we expect to be able to hold our margins flat in 2009, notwithstanding lower volumes and lower capacity utilization.</p>
          <p>And this is what really differentiates us from companies who sell products with commodity pricing.  In economic down cycles, they feel the effect of lower volume and lower prices, and consequently, their margins get squeezed.  In our business, price is pretty well locked in.  So although we will see lower sales, our margins will not be impacted much.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to page 14 for our earnings guidance.  As we move into 2009, we expect the first quarter to be down sequentially from the fourth quarter of last year.  This is due primarily to the fact that October was actually a strong month, and it wasn't until November and December that the major currency devaluations occurred and the production curtailments began.  So we expect the first quarter to follow the trends of November and December.</p>
          <p>At some point in time, probably in the second quarter, the destocking of inventory in the metals, chemicals and semiconductor industries will slow down and production will pick up, even if only to support anemic customer demand.  So we do expect some pickup in volumes later in the year as a result of customer inventories falling to the point where production must increase.</p>
          <p>For the full year of 2009, we expect sales to be in the range of 9.5 to 10 billion, or roughly 10% below 2008 sales.  There are a number of puts and takes contributing to the lower sales guidance.  First, currency and lower natural gas prices will reduce sales by about 10% combined.  Second, we're expecting our base business volumes to be about 5% lower.  Offsetting this will be three to 4% growth from new projects starting up, and additionally, applications technology with new merchant contract signings should add another couple of percent as well.  Our earlier -- forecast for earnings per share is a range of 3.80 to 4.20, which on the low end would be 10% below 2008 and on the high end would be flat with 2008.  The range is the function of the extent and recovery of the economy and the movement of currency rates.  But the low end we are giving you pretty much assumes that we don't see any improvement in the base business from the very low level we expect to see in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We expect our effective tax rate to remain at about 28%.  We don't have any reason to believe if the overall economy will improve any time soon.  This is why early in the fourth quarter we began to reduce our fixed costs with a major restructuring.  We've downsized our fixed cost to match the lower level of demand and we will continue to accelerate our productivity projects to reduce costs further.  We are also expecting a reduction in variable costs as we negotiate with suppliers for price decreases in this deflationary environment.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, we expect our pricing to hold with the exception of pass-through of lower natural gas prices and potentially lower electricity prices.  Consequently, we are confident in our ability to hold operating margins in the 20% area.  This is what differentiates our business from commodity businesses where both volumes and margins suffer in downturn.  For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.90 to $0.95.  This guidance assumes a negative currency impact of about 8% versus the first quarter of 2008 based on current exchange rates.  The step down in EPS versus the fourth quarter is because we expect that our November and December volumes will continue through the first quarter, whereas the fourth quarter included the benefit of a strong October.</p>
          <p>Please look at 15, based on the confidence we have in our ability to generate strong cash flow, we've increased our quarterly dividend from $0.375 per quarter to $0.40 per quarter, as we mentioned earlier.  This is the 16th annual increase for Praxair, and this chart shows that we've increased the annual dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 19% over that time period.  In addition to increasing the dividend, we will continue to return cash to shareholders by repurchasing stock in 2009 under our remaining $378 million of authorization.  In 2009, we expect to generate well over $2 billion of operating cash flow and spend 1.4 to 1.5 billion to fund the construction of a large number of projects in our backlog.  Therefore, we will generate approximately 600 million of free cash flow while, at the same time, funding a record backlog of projects.  And looking forward, we still expect to sign a significant number of new onsite projects in 2009 and beyond, which will extend our organic growth into the next decade.</p>
          <p>And now, we would be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Yes, good morning.  Jim, with regard to the project pipeline, would you comment on how many projects entered and exited in the quarter?  And also what happens in the event that timelines are attenuated as your customers attempt to take advantage of lower E&amp;C cost in the future or just adopt a more conservative posture financially? Can you elaborate on how that would impact your financials, please?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me just mention first in the backlog that it did decline during the course of the quarter for a couple of reasons.  We started up a handful of plants.  We only added one new contract signing during the quarter, which is really a function of the fact that with all the uncertainty, very few people were willing to make commitments.  And we did actually bring three projects out of the backlog as a result of customers looking or informing us that they planned to delay projects, where you actually took it out of the backlog even though the customer said that they are just going to delay the project.</p>
          <p>And for example, Valero announced this morning they are going to delay the new catalytic cracker at the Memphis refinery.  That's one of the projects that we had in the backlog that we've taken out until we get further commitment from Valero that they are going to go ahead with that.  Now that was the project that had just been signed, and so, no work had actually been done on it.  But they still do have a take-or-pay contract obligation to us.  S, there are a couple of ones that were maybe signed late in the quarter where the customer for his own reasons might not build his own facility.  But there's no opportunity for customer to kind of come back and say, "Well, now we think costs are lower, and we want to renegotiate the contract."  That's just not a possibility because they are airtight contracts.</p>
          <p>And looking forward, we've still got a lot of very interesting projects that are in the proposal stage, and which I think we will sign over the next couple of quarters.  There are about 15 that it looked very close.  And so even though we had a slowdown in new signings in the fourth quarter, I think the pace of that will pick up as the year goes on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then if I may follow up on slide 11, the sales to the energy sector actually managed to accelerate in Q4 on an underlying basis, notwithstanding the declines in commodity prices.  Can you talk a little bit about why that was the case, and what your expectations for growth would be in that industry in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the main increase, the acceleration in the fourth quarter was due to higher hydrogen demand.  And with a number of oil companies who operate refineries and also make chemicals, shutting down some of the chemical manufacturing, they also lost a source of in-house hydrogen, and consequently had to buy more hydrogen from us.  And so, that was one of the drivers of higher growth there.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, we will see huge growth in 2010 and 2011 when the big SMR projects for Chevron and BP come on stream.  Otherwise, my guess is that we'll see the oil well services decline.  We've got a couple of EOR contracts that we're pretty close to signing and I think those will continue to make sense.  We are also very close with Pemex and Petrobras who are continuing to invest in improving their annual yield of energy and will be doing more EOR work.  So, in spite of lower oil prices, I expect this sector to keep growing.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Jim.  If you take a look at page 17, and given that you've just addressed energy expectations for 2009, can you just help us to see your expectations for the rest of the segments on a full year basis for '09?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just kind of generally what we expect to see in end markets?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I guess I'm just going to kind of talk sequentially rather than year-over-year.  So where all these charts are year-over-year, but I think it's easier to talk sequentially.  Energy will hold up and probably grow slightly grow somewhat sequentially.  Electronics will probably continue to go down in the first quarter.  Now, one of the issues with electronics is that we don't have any exposure to the construction or the capital cycle of semiconductor manufacturing.  We're only selling consumables into the fabs.  And so, we actually think that the rate of capital cycle in the semiconductor will be down about 60% year-over-year.  Chemicals is weak right now.  I think it'll stay fairly weak; same thing with metals and manufacturing.  I think healthcare will continue to grow; aerospace will definitely pick up; and food and beverage will keep growing.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we'll continue to buy back stock through the year, essentially using the excess cash flow we are generating and also taking advantage of where the stock happens to be today, which we think is a pretty good bargain.  But we do &#x2013; we have a huge amount of operating cash flow coming through right now.  And with lower capital spending, we'll have more free cash flow to buy back stock.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning.  With regard to your margins, it looks like clearly, even when you take out the FX benefits that you had, the margins are noticeably higher in almost all of the divisions than they've been almost ever in the fourth quarter.  And I think you've certainly implied that you expect to hold the strength of the margins.  Is there any reason to think the margins would start to drift back down when the business picks back up, or is this something where you really should hold the margins, and the leverage is really going to fall directly to the bottom line going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm optimistic that we'll able to hold the margins pretty much across the world.  It's really a function of lower costs more than anything else.  It's where we're getting benefit of our productivity programs.  And actually, if you look at variable margin, if you take our cost of goods sold and then you take depreciation out of that, you will see that our variable margins are holding up very well, north of 50%.  And it's mainly a question of becoming more efficient in production and distribution through the productivity programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just with regard to pricing, you clearly saw a continued strength in pricing, including in North America, despite the really weak volumes.  What can we expect looking throughout 2009? Do you hold the price, do you expect to give a little bit back or do you actually continue to get at least a little bit more moderate pricing, but pricing still going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for the most part, we'll hold the price.  There are still some accounts that will come for renewal this year which are below market where we can increase the price. But generally, I would say we'll hold price.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned the operating cash flow and the CapEx expectations, and obviously you got your dividend there.  It would seem that doesn't leave much room left for share repurchase, which I think you intimated might happen in '09.  So would you be comfortable taking on more debt to buy back stock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I think I mean we've been taking on debt to buy back stock.  We will continue to take on some debt to buy back stock.  We're in a very strong &#x2013; what EBITDA of 1.7 times debt and we're funding A1, P1 commercial paper at less than 0.5%.  So we have a very strong balance sheet, very strong cash flow and we can support some more debt for stock buyback.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if I might follow up, you gave some trends on the packaged gas business.  You mentioned that it's gotten a little bit weaker here in January.  Would you expect, is the environment sufficiently sluggish that you could actually go to negative gas comps there, or do you think as we've seen historically, those will still remain positive from a pricing component?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know.  I think we probably will go to negative volume growth in gases.  I don't think people realize how bad the environment is out there in manufacturing and construction.  So I think we will go to negative &#x2013; some, not huge, but some negative volume growth in gases.  And a lot of people are talking about, "Well, we'll have this infrastructure program that the government will fund."  Well.  They've got 800 billion; the first part is going to go to bail out the banks.  The second part is going to go to give taxpayers checks.  And then the third part is supposed to go to infrastructure.  But I think by the time it goes around to being allocated to infrastructure, the states are going to be in huge budget deficits and they are going to need that money just to hold their budget deficits.  So it would be nice if we see a pick up from this so-called infrastructure spending, but it is not going to happen soon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.  You may proceed</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I guess first question just on &#x2013; two questions on pricing. First, could you discuss your confidence on pricing trends by region particularly in the merchant business? And secondly, are you seeing any push back by customers on some of the contract terms in the onsite contracts, not so much on the pricing structure, but on some of the other terms in the contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, on merchant pricing, I think it will hold everywhere in the world.  I don't see any reason why one part of the world would be different than any part. We use the same contract model with five-year contracts everywhere in the world, and we have a very small amount of merchant sales are actually on spot pricing, that's something we avoid like the plague.</p>
          <p>In terms of customers with onsite contracts complaining about their contracts, well they sign the contracts with their eyes open, they know what's in the contracts, the contracts are commitments and they are what they are.  So we don't go back and say, oh, well we'll lower the contract price and take dollars away from our shareholders and give them to your shareholders; we don't do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to follow up on that, you're not seeing any deterioration in the quality of the contracts that you're signing for new customers on the onsite side?  I mean, they're not pushing back &#x2013; I mean you're able to maintain the quality of the terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually just the reverse.  Over the last five years, we have really stuck to our guns in tightening up contract terms and putting protection in those contracts that 10 years ago we wouldn't have had.  So, in fact, the ones that we've signed recently are probably the best contracts we've been signing in history.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly just on a bookkeeping question. The lower share count, was that entirely share buybacks or was some of that changing of the accounting treatment of some of the incentive comp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was mostly share buyback, but if you understand the way common stock equivalents are calculated, they are basically calculated based on the spread in the stock price above the strike price of the options.  And so as the stock price comes down, the common stock equivalent calculation gets smaller.  But you can actually see that when you look at the numbers and the real number of shares and the common stock equivalent shares.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  On hydrogen, how much of the increase in hydrogen was due to BP Texas City versus other organic growth or new projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They all &#x2013; all of our, I think almost all, if not all, of our customers on the Gulf Coast took more hydrogen in the fourth quarter than they did in the third quarter.  And we've got small amounts, small new projects coming on stream that quarter, last quarter.  But the next big slog is going to be in the big 200-cubic-feet-per-hour contracts we have at Chevron and BP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, for the fourth quarter I guess BP year-over-year was sort of a mix with everybody else or was that the largest piece?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then for 2009 EPS guidance, could you triage how much is sort of cost reductions, how much is margin expansion, volume plus or minus or just new projects? Do you have sort of a rough feel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>High end of your guidance, the 420 number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I tried to sketch it out, the sales line we have 10% lower guidance on sales and we also have about a 10% hit from currency. Okay. So that, ex-currency, we're kind of flat there. And then we've got probably about minus 5% from base business volumes going down, another three to 4% from projects starting up.  And then another two to 3% growth from new merchant contract signings and applications technology and so forth.  So if we're lucky, we'll be able to offset most of the currency and some of the organic volume decline.</p>
          <p>And that pretty much runs its way down to earnings per share, where our guidance for earnings per share is being from flat last year to down 10% last year.  I realize it's a wider guidance than we've given before, but we have a 10% headwind right off top from currency in earnings per share.  So, ex-currency, you could look at that as guidance; it goes from zero to plus 10%.  And that's going to be coming from largely from productivity more than anything else, plus the three to four &#x2013; plus the 5% or so growth from new projects coming on stream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And hard goods sales being down significantly more than gases &#x2013; is that just because there are other companies that supply those products, where there is only a few gas companies out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. They're the same customers, but hard goods has basically two kinds of things in it. It has consumables in it &#x2013; like welding wire and so forth to get consumed right along with the gases...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it also has equipment, which I would describe as capital equipment for welders, like welding machines and laser cutters and so forth, and what happened in the fourth quarter and it's been creeping in throughout the year.  But there were very, very few sales of capital equipment in hard goods because anybody who's in business is delaying any capital equipment for just until they see the volumes there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Chris Shaw with UBS.  You may proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Good morning, everyone.  I think, Jim, from your comments about I think you expected aerospace to pick back up.  Can we interpret that as we'd expect Surface Tech volumes to be up in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, definitely.  2008 was horrible for pre-OC volumes.  We actually did less engine coatings than we did in 2007, and even the new so-called GEnx engines -there's a Rolls Royce engine and a GE engine that are going to go on the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350.  These GEnx engines are more energy efficient and require more coatings.  Well, in fact we didn't coat any GEnx engines in the fourth quarter.  But they need to build those engines about six months ahead of plane deliveries and that's when we'll see the work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then just the news, I saw news that Valero was I guess taking downtime at I think its Texas City refinery, I think that's one of yours. Is that a, it's 30 to 40 days and I think that's normal, is that an impact for a quarter or I mean or is that not like even $0.01 in EPS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's kind of a normal thing in the first quarter, where refineries do turnarounds, and that's one of the reasons why the first quarter is usually not a great quarter for us when you look annually.  So, that's not unusual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And we're not seeing any more turnarounds than normal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not on the refinery side per se.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just to comment on the slides about a near-term pause in the pace of proposal activity.  I mean how should we read that?  I mean, do we know, I'm just curious I mean, I would assume there is going to be some level of proposals again that come back, but I mean is it going to be at the same levels we saw in the past few years or do you think it's going to be permanently impaired?  Do you have any thoughts on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it'll be at the same level we saw in the past few years.  I think that the rise in commodity prices, the rise in energy prices was behind the planning for new projects.  Okay. So for example, even though we're building two oxygen units for coal gasification projects in China, I don't think there are going to be any coal gasification projects in the U.S.  And we had been doing a lot of proposal work on coal gasification projects in the U.S.  So that kind of stuff, I don't see coming back, at least not for a while.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks.  That's helpful.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I just had a quick question about SG&amp;A. It had a nice down tick in the quarter.  Can you just sort of walk through the detail there?  And then also in your other income, I know there was some forex gains in there, are there any other sort of cats and dogs kicking around in the 32 million in the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well SG&amp;A being down is a function of several things.  First of all, along with the currency headwind, that impacts sales and it also impacts SG&amp;A.  So the translation of SG&amp;A in our foreign businesses was down quite a bit.  Otherwise, there's effect from our cost reduction program.  The folks that we severed in the fourth quarter with the restructuring really got notice on November 15.  So we got a month and a half of savings there.  So those are the pretty much the two impacts on SG&amp;A.  Then other things in other income, we have a partnership called Wellnight that does a lot of oil and gas work that had a very strong quarter, and we had few other smaller cats and dogs in the other income line &#x2013; some small real estate sales stuff like that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Good morning.  Mike.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You commented that packaged gas sales in Europe were stronger as a result of repair and maintenance during customer shutdowns, I was wondering to what extent you've seen that trend occurring in the United States?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely saw that in the United States, too.  When the chemical plants, steel plants shut down they do go in and do maintenance work and that does give you a temporary uptick in packaged gas sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in terms of PDI, when you guys gave your preannouncement, you were talking about gases volume being down 5% and hard goods down 20% for the quarter.  It looks like, adding in some pricing, you still came in quite a bit better than those expectations.  Can you talk about what had changed in December? And do you maybe have a slightly more optimistic outlook for the first quarter, given where you came in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually the best information I can give you is the information you gave me, which was there was a lot of surprise package gas sales associated with steel mills and chemical plants that had downturn, and so there are actually was a fair amount of maintenance spending by big companies during the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then my last question is on South America, obviously Brazil is the corner stone of that market for you, but can you talk about what's going on outside of Brazil to show the 15% organic growth rate you saw this quarter and whether that kind of growth is sustainable outside Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no that's sustainable I think.  We've got a lot of projects coming on stream.  We've got one coming on stream in Chile, some new business in Columbia, and some new business in Argentina.  So I think we're still going to see good strong growth in the non-Brazil countries in South America, and Brazil itself will be strong, too.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with KeyBanc.  You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon.  Jim, when you take a look at the global onsite business, maybe excluding the hydrogen, what level of volumes declines are you seeing, and are the bulk of your customers now at sort of that take-or-pay minimum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think on an overall basis our on-site volumes were relatively flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter.  But out of that, our atmospheric gases were down about 10% and our hydrogen was up about 10%.  Now of the atmosphere gases being down, there are a handful of customers who are taking product below their take-or-pay level.  But for the most part, the reduction is in volumes that were still above the take-or-pay level for customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, if more of your customers go to the take-or-pay level than, and there is a little bit of downside in volumes heading into the first and second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, That's hard to say. I would expect our volumes probably on the on-site to be about the same in the first quarter as they were in the fourth quarter, and hopefully pick up in the second quarter if the destocking starts coming to an end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  And last question, when you think about the 42 on-site project backlog that you've alluded to, due to the external environment, really nothing comes into the pie again in this year, that does support three to 4% growth annually through 2011, and is it pretty linear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's pretty linear, yeah.  And, yeah, even if we sign a new project today, that wouldn't start-up until 2011. Okay.  So everything between 2009, 2010 and in the first half of 2011, the die's all cast for those projects and there will be the 3 to 4% growth from the projects without any new ones coming in. And I think what you would then see, if we didn't get any new projects, is that our CapEx would start to really go down in 2010 and 2011, and we would have a huge amount of free cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi.  You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi.  Jim, you had some FX gains in the quarter that offset your top line weakness and you said that these are mark-to-market benefits, so how long are these hedges and would they continue in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the gains are gone.  What we basically do is at the beginning in the quarter, we lock in the exchange rates and that kind of locks in our earnings for that quarter.  So that even if the translation rate goes down, our sales and our operating profit goes down, we offset that by a gain on the hedge gain.  But we only go one quarter forward, so starting off in 2009, we don't expect to see any more hedge gains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But this quarter also you would hedge, put on new hedges or no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're hedged, but where hedged at rates that are pretty close to current rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's not possible to, I wish you could go, go back and tell well I really want to go back and re-hedge this at a rate that was available a year ago, but you can't do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Then a question on Asia.  Your volumes were flat in Asia, which was much weaker than what the GDP numbers would suggest.  So I guess a lot of your end products like electronics are exported out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well there is a couple of things there.  First of all, we had good strong growth, double-digit growth in every end market sector, with the exception of electronics. Okay. And then electronics was down I think 18 to 20%, something like that.  So really the growth we had in the other end markets, it was offset by the decline in electronics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then I think you said you expect 90% of your backlog to get completed on time, and that's the first time we've heard that number 90%. I guess so three months ago, what was your expectation and is that number slipping?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I put that number out because in fact we took three projects out of the backlog because of delays.  Okay. So actually the 42 projects is back to 100%. Okay. Will there be more projects that come out from delays? I don't think many, only ones that nobody's broken ground on anything yet, and even so, we have recourse under our contracts to those customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I still believe that 90% of the backlog will get built and will come on stream on schedule. And incentive or not, we're taking them out of the backlog.</p>
