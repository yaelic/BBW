          <p>Good day and welcome to the Munich Re Q3 Results 2007 Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Sascha Bibert. Please go ahead sir.</p>

          <p>Well, good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Munich Re 2007 results. Today, Nikolaus von Bomhard, CEO of the Munich Re Group, will start the call with a few introductory remarks; then J&#xF6;rg Schneider, CFO of the Munich Re Group, will lead you through the financial highlights.</p>
          <p>Please note that this conference call will be recorded and the audio files will be put on our website. With that, I would like to hand over to our CEO, Nikolaus von Bomhard, for the introduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Sascha. Good morning and good afternoon. Indeed I am very pleased to report in the turbulent market environment another strong set of results and thereby continuing a strong track record over the recent years, and the good news being that all our three pillars &#x2013; that is, primary insurance, reinsurance and international health &#x2013; contributed to this success.</p>
          <p>I am convinced &#x2013; and I've said this on numerous occasions &#x2013; that we now have built a very solid platform, a 3 billion net income platform, of which we can work and develop the group into the future. And as you will see in the presentation, we are dedicated to be an underwriting company and that is paying off very nicely. Our credit risk that we carry on our balance sheet continues to be low and the equity gearing has come down further.</p>
          <p>Certainly, I am not looking forward to any, be it speculation or, even worse, a recession, but we should be in a position should the economic environment deteriorate to fare well even through these more troubled waters. Hence, by the way, as I see it, at least personally, in more benign or better markets, of course it's very difficult to differentiate oneself from the rest of the group. And if you want to separate the wheat from the chaff this may be the time where you can.</p>
          <p>We do indeed in all our markets very well, all our clients, the different lines of business, and we have access to the interesting business and all you could summarize that as an active cycle management which is very important in reinsurance these days.</p>
          <p>A short word on Changing Gear or shifting our gears &#x2013; it is known to you the programs in May. And you will certainly in the context of Changing Gear not give up any of the virtues that we have so obviously worked for, amongst them the concept of the underwriting company. We have since May, and of course we started a little earlier within the group, but we published it in May, Changing Gear, we have since then streamlined internal process and shifted attention and capacity from central functions more into the operating functions into the business itself. And we have been working very hard on the various initiatives that we presented to you in May, and they will return value to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>All these activities are based on the principle of organic growth first. So we always will have, let's say, a more benign look when it comes to make a choice between organic or external growth, also if we develop and when we develop the company forwards.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, I should make mention here and say that mergers and acquisitions are possible. They are thinkable for us. The environment has not been too helpful over the last month. That's why we also very selectively approach the interesting targets. It may change in a more difficult economic environment going forward. Fruits may be hanging lower, but you can rest assured the discipline of our approach will not change. So its business has to fit strategically and it has to be able to generate attractive returns for the foreseeable future, and it will always be benchmarked against the possibility of buying back our own share. Businesses that do not generate attractive returns will be divested.</p>
          <p>Coming with a short note on reinsurance; I mentioned it briefly. Cycle management is what we consider the name of the game these days. We have, during the last renewals, again, seen quite some significant shifts in our portfolio. This is the consequence of active portfolio management. And we are certainly not at all shy to cut business, if needed.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we will use the strength of the entire group in reinsurance. I can summarize it, I think, as franchise value and just know-how -- risk know-how, market and client know-how &#x2013; to make sure that we can stay in business where it makes sense, be it pricing or the adequate terms and conditions.</p>
          <p>So far as to my short introduction, and I would now go on to the first slide, actually I have only two. And here on this slide, you would see the development of the net income of the group and the payout ratio. And first of all, I think I should stress again the point that all of that is not just a consequence of benign market environment. It is rather the consequence of very hard work over the last years, and this work now is paying off.</p>
          <p>We have had very few underperformers in the group &#x2013; in subsegments, I can only say because, as I said in the beginning the major pillars of the Munich Re Insurance Group do deliver up to the benchmark they should. So we are very happy about that fact and it's had some hard work that was preceding this.</p>
          <p>We have to recognize, however, that part of the result, of course, of '07 was supported by a one-time tax gain in the order of close to &#x20AC;400 million that certainly cannot be repeated in the current year. And we also have to recognize that the capital market environment for those like us who were not heavily invested in credit risk was a benign one. So our assumption of the target matrix of 4.5 -- which on an investment was clearly surpassed, actually we came out with 5.2 -- so if we now, in view of a more volatile capital market and without the tax gain I mentioned, we think that our result of course cannot stay at this level. I revert to this question at the end.</p>
          <p>Overall, capital management, the twin sister of cycle management, is high on our list of priorities. The year 2007 was marked by a very, let's say, substantial payback to shareholders &#x2013; shareholders be it through dividend, if the General Assembly will agree to our proposal, which I assume, and at the same time through share buybacks. We will continue to do and execute our tight capital management. And whenever we feel, we cannot deploy the capital at profitability levels we would like to see the capital growth be paid back.</p>
          <p>As regards the ROE development, we feel that both the group and specifically also ERGO do deliver up to the levels they should. I actually remember very well when we first came up with a 12% ROE target that I received many big smiles. Today it's much less so. And also I want to make the point here, it's delivering up to the necessary levels; actually over the last three years, they did outperform the reinsurers.</p>
          <p>It may be interesting to also compare ROEs these days with banks because we always felt there was too little consideration of risks when people looked at ROEs. Most importantly, however, we achieved our RORAC of 15%, and that is to us the most important target.</p>
          <p>That being said, I hand it over to J&#xF6;rg, who will run you through the numbers. Please, J&#xF6;rg.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nikolaus. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning to the United States. In the next 30 minutes, I will have the pleasure of leading you through the IFRS results, and for the first time in this year so early the numbers for our European Embedded Value for 2007. The appendix to this presentation contains the most important numbers from our annual report, which will come out on the 11th of March. It will contain some more detail, but certainly no surprises as it is our goal to provide you with a full picture already to date.</p>
          <p>A year ago, we forecast a profit range of 2.8 to 3.2 billion for '07. In August, we revised this number and our update of 3.5 to 3.8 billion already took into account the effect of the German tax reform and the very strong investment result of the first half year. After a reasonable fourth quarter, we have achieved even a bit more, as indicated since last November. The difference to our original expectation can easily explained, as Nikolaus did before, by the tax and investment income differences.</p>
          <p>Last week in London, we discussed our performance and strategy in property casualty reinsurance. Our combined ratio of 96.4 includes five percentage points from natural catastrophes. In primary insurance, our 93.4 is again well below the 95% guidance and this despite the effect of Kyrill.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with a return on investment of 5.2, especially in troubled times with regard to the credit market, and the RORAC was 5% higher than our commitment. So our shareholders will participate in last year's success through the increased dividend. The dividend sum is equal to a 29% payout ratio on our consolidated result, plus there is the quite-generous share buyback program of last year.</p>
          <p>The premium development, our growth premium for the group decreased slightly by 0.5%; on a currency adjusted basis, it was a plus 2.1%. The decline of currency, and it affected reinsurance, was an impact of roughly &#x20AC;1 billion; property casualty 750; and life and health, &#x20AC;275 million, mainly from a decline in the U.S. dollar/euro ratio of almost 10%.</p>
          <p>The first-time consolidation of ERGO's Turkish subsidiary, &#x130;svi&#xE7;re, took place in the fourth quarter 2006. So in 2007, the full year numbers have been consolidated instead of just one quarter in the preceding year. The impact was plus &#x20AC;280 million. This resulted in a slightly increased volume share of primary insurance, which now makes up for 46% of our overall turnover against 54 in reinsurance.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you can see the consolidated result of the segments. I would like to point your attention to one very small number. This is the standalone quarter four number of the reinsurance life and health segments. This was impacted by a write-down of the deferred tax assets. As for the sister company in the United States, we wrote down the deferred tax asset for our U.S. life insurance subsidiary, Munich-American Life Insurance Company, because IFRS 12, the respective stipulation, allows us to be extremely conservative here. And as most of you know, strong growth in U.S. American life insurance company translates into tax losses, instead of tax profit at the beginning. And therefore &#x2013; and the recovery of the tax losses is somewhat more down the road than originally expected. You can regard this as a very conservative step which impacted the results with &#x20AC;99 million. This also explains the higher tax rates for the group as a whole in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>For the full year, the results for the life and health reinsurance segment was very positive, up 164 million, driven by a good underwriting result in general, plus some positive impact from the planned withdrawal from two large treaties.</p>
          <p>Reinsurance property casualty was up 455 million, above prior-year level despite higher natural catastrophe, heavily supported by investment results and taxes. Primarily life and health up 39%, also due to strong investment results; and primary property casualty down 100 million, still on a very good high level, very good result, in line with our expectations, driven by good underwriting and good investment results. The consolidation was 147 million higher than the year before, due to our internal capital management measures. This is internal dividend and intra-group sale of share. So you saw all segments profited from a high investment result.</p>
          <p>Return on equity &#x2013; this is on the next slide &#x2013; was very good with 5.2% and the investment result was 9.3 billion. Regular income was 4.5% return on investment. And in a strong stock market, we realized a lot of investment gains on our equities, with the clear wish to bring down our exposure in this area. And therefore, you can later see that our exposure to equities was quite drastically down during the year 2007 for good reasons and this served &#x2013; this proved to be the right decision in the first stage of this year.</p>
          <p>Among other measures, we actively realized losses on our fixed income portfolio to reinvest at higher coupon rates. That made up for some 650 million losses. We intensively used derivatives. This can be seen in the outcome of the write-downs and write-ups. And these write-downs, they are also the write-downs in our sub-prime with &#x2013; of our sub-prime exposures, but mainly derivatives which are used in a very conservative way to hedge our portfolios and to protect ourselves against the reinvestment risk in German primary life.</p>
          <p>The increase of interest rate during the first half year '07 resulted in a decrease in bond prices, decrease in unrealized gains in the bond portfolio and in our shareholders' equity. This was somewhat mitigated in the second half, but our unrealized on and off balance sheet reserves went down with 7 billion. And after policy-holder participation, tax and minority, 5.6 billion, they are still at a very high level, and a solid buffer even for stormier weather. For more detailed information, I would like to refer you to the pages 54 and 55.</p>
          <p>With respect to our asset allocation, as I said before, we felt increasingly uncomfortable with asset markets during the second half of 2007. We actively reduced our equity gearing by, as you can see here on that slide on the left-hand side, 20% to 50% of our adjusted equity.</p>
          <p>We also reduced our credit exposure, especially in structured products, though we not only exchange equity market risk for credit or real estate risk, but cut the exposure of our whole investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>In this slide, we compare equities on the left-hand side and equity plus real estate structured product and corporate bonds rated below AA, divided by adjusted shareholders' equity. And in this extended view on the right-hand side, we actively reduced the ratio of these somewhat riskier assets to shareholder capital from 114 at the end of '06 to just 90 in '07.</p>
          <p>After further reducing risks significantly in the first few days of 2008, we now feel very comfortable with our conservative allocation and not too worried by continuing turbulence in financial markets. But you shouldn't be surprised to see also some write-downs from us if stock markets stay at that level, but nothing which would worry us too much.</p>
          <p>Our fixed interest exposure is shown on the next slide number 12. The loan and cash portfolio is conservatively invested with limited exposure to credit risk. By the end of December, 47% of our fixed interest portfolio was invested in government or semi-government bonds or bills. 29% was invested in covered bonds, which are mainly German Pfandbriefe or in collateralized loans to policy holders; 20% was invested in corporate bonds, bonds issued by banks, commercial paper and time deposits at banks; and only 4% or &#x20AC;5.5 billion of our fixed interest portfolio are structured credit product, of which only &#x20AC;340 million have sub-prime exposure. On slide 53, you can see the details on the rating of our structured product portfolio.</p>
          <p>To summarize, with regard to investments, no negative surprises from Munich Re. Shareholders' equity decreased by roughly 850 million due to unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities because of higher interest rates and negative impact from currency fluctuation. Of the generated earnings of 3.9 billion, we repatriated almost 3.3 in dividends and share buyback.</p>
          <p>Now, a few remarks on the segments.</p>
          <p>Reinsurance &#x2013; our net profit increased to &#x20AC;3.3 billion. Gross written premiums went down due to currency effects. The very high profitability is partially due to the favorable tax situation and strong investment return, but also due to good underwriting results in spite of the increased natural catastrophes. Operating result was somewhat down, in line with higher natural catastrophe burden. And the good results in both reinsurance segments on excellent levels of previous year. We had strong operating embedded value earnings of 11.8% of the opening embedded value and these operating embedded value earnings drive the total increase in the EEV.</p>
          <p>Premium developments &#x2013; 1 billion negative due to foreign exchange effect. This is minus 4.6%, and on an adjusted basis it is a plus 1.5%. We had lower premiums in life only due to the planned withdrawal of two large treaties and the negative currency effects. This could not be compensated by new business. In a mid-term perspective, we will stay on the path of strong growth and we will increase our <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>In health insurance, a slight increase, plus 2%, compared to last year; currency also down, but we had strong growth, for example, from the Middle-East. Also in property-casualty insurance, we had a volume decrease due to the reduction of one larger contract, which was offset by a well diversified portfolio of business from many sources.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, there is the overview of the result for the life and health segments. And first the increase in the operating IFRS results to &#x20AC;1.1 billion, the increase of the net profit IFRS are both due to good underwriting results, and as I said before, some positive impact from this withdrawal from two large treaties.</p>
          <p>Embedded value, our operating embedded value earnings increased in line with our IFRS operating results to 700 million. This translates to an operating return on EEV of 11.8%. Value added by new business increased by more than 20% to 277 million. This is above our growth target of 15% per year. This strong business was not driven by volume, however, but the result of a higher margin which increased from 4.3% to 5.5%. Total embedded value earnings of 859 million or 14.4% return on EEV is well above our target. This includes also the impact from the lower taxes in Germany and in Canada with some 150 million euro.</p>
          <p>Together with low negative currency movement and capital movement of 80 million, this results in an increased embedded value of &#x20AC;6.7 billion. A detailed split of our earnings together with all the sensitivities can be found in the backup, starting on page 58.</p>
          <p>So far with life reinsurance, now a quick look to property casualty reinsurance. Fourth quarter was good with a combined ratio of 91.7%, which is almost 5% better than in the preceding year. There in '06, we had reserve increases. In '07, there were the normal ups and downs of various segments and accident years. We further improved the profile of the reserves by allocating more to the years 2001 and prior and less to the years 2003 and 2004.</p>
          <p>Our overall reserve run-off triangle in the annual report will show reserve additions of roughly &#x20AC;90 million and this is just the amount of the accretion of the workers' compensation discount. So no major overall movement in the reserves.</p>
          <p>For the full year '07, reinsurance property casualty includes a 5 percentage point impact from natural catastrophes. Some of you might have noticed that these &#x2013; this is less on an absolute basis than after three quarters, which means that we have a negative &#x2013; we had a negative natural catastrophe impact or we had gains in the fourth quarter from the release of reserve in natural catastrophes. So over the year, we were somewhat too cautious here and we could be more optimistic at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>For the year as a whole, natural catastrophes were 3.7% higher than in 2006 and this fully explains the combined ratio increase from last year, and it shows that the underlying business is very strong and remains very strong, albeit at a slightly lower profitability level as we explained last week in London.</p>
          <p>So far with reinsurance, now I continue with primary insurance. The increase in premium is due to the first-time consolidation of the ERGO's Turkish subsidiary, &#x130;svi&#xE7;re, and due to the growth it had. The very good investment result was supported by favorable capital markets .The extremely high level of previous-year results was almost achieved again, only a little bit lower, and the difference can fully be explained by differences in taxes and here especially in the one-off effect, which were higher in '06 than in '07.</p>
          <p>Primary property casualty combined ratio of 30 &#x2013; 93.4, in line with our expectations. EEV -- embedded value &#x2013; operating embedded value earnings of 11.5%, this is lower than in the preceding year which was dominated by modeling changes. The EEV increase was also supported by cost reductions, the lower tax rate and favorable capital markets, especially the increase in interest rate which is favorable for a life primary insurer.</p>
          <p>Premium developments, almost every thing was mentioned. Let me point your attention perhaps to health. This is an increase of some &#x20AC;215 million compared to the preceding year, of which 150 are in Germany and 65 abroad. And this will be especially in Germany; these are especially supplementary product which provide a very good growth opportunity also in future under new environments with regard to the social health systems.</p>
          <p>Property casualty, our most profitable line, the premium volume increased by &#x20AC;454 million or almost 10%. German motor was again reduced, which means that we had a further improvement of the portfolio. The strong increase comes from &#x130;svi&#xE7;re and from strong organic growth in ERGO's Eastern European companies in Poland and in the Baltic State, and from an increase from our Lloyd's -- Watkins underwriting syndicate.</p>
          <p>The performance in primary insurance life and health is shown on slide 23. The increase in IFRS results was supported by the investment results. We also had increased deferred premium refunds, but overall there was a positive margin for the shareholder. And the European Embedded Value, were &#x2013; earnings were 478 million or 11.5% of the opening embedded value. In the year before, there were this modeling changes and especially the higher number was driven by the increase of shareholder's share in German primary life. Value added of new business increased by more than 30% to 164 million. This due to the better tax and capital market situation with higher interest rates and by a reduction in the German guaranteed interest rate from 2.75 to 2.25%. And in health, it is driven by a reduction in expense basis.</p>
          <p>The positive operation assumption changes contribute 135 million. Half of that is coming from cost of efficiencies in our German health business. Total embedded value earnings are &#x20AC;1.2 billion, achieved with the help of lower tax rates in Germany and Italy that contributed 338 million and friendly capital market conditions. An increased interest rate and a good equity performance led to economic variances of another 390 million.</p>
          <p>Altogether the EEV increased by 30% to 5.4 billion including the effect of a shareholding restructuring within ERGO. To explain that, the ERGO holding company bought stakes in ERGO International from its life insurance subsidiaries. And with that, the stake of the shareholders in the future profits of the international companies increased. We treated this as a non-operating sector outside of the embedded value earnings like an acquisition.</p>
          <p>The further split of the primary insurance segment into German life, international life and German health can be found in the backup on the pages 67 to 72.</p>
          <p>New business on 23, we are pleased with the profitability of the new business, but we are also not disappointed by its volume as we have already explained on the 30th of January in a short telephone conference. The new business developed favorably, plus 3.8% compared to preceding year, and in Germany even 5.2 with a strong focus on single premium. That means that on an APE basis, business in Germany went down.</p>
          <p>But the international business especially from Poland and the Baltic States grew more strongly with 18.5% on an APE basis. In Germany, there is a clear trend away from traditional life and <mark type="inaudible" /> business to Riester and unit-linked life products. So single premium again gains more relative importance, while regular premium showed this decline. This trend now seems to be somewhat sustainable and we regard this single premiums as becoming more and more of a regular item. 2006 was also influenced by the next phase of the Riester venture there was nothing of that in 2007. There will be in 2008. And adjusted for this effect, the new business even rose by 9.3% between '06 and '07.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, slide 24, the performance of our primary insurance on a very high level, very good result driven by excellent investment results &#x2013; the decline just due to one-off taxes. And also the combined ratio was 93.4 for the full year; the deterioration partly due to Kyrill. It is satisfactory. The small peak in Q4 does not seem to have sustainable reasons there; a couple of smaller one-off effect would add up here. And on a quarterly basis, it sometimes looks drastic as not a lot behind it.</p>
          <p>So overall, a very pleasing picture for 2007. And with that, back to Nikolaus.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, J&#xF6;rg. I am coming to the last slide. But before I enter it, I would like to make a few remarks on our embedded value disclosure and add some thoughts because the &#x2013; as you know, the risk models are crucial to us because we use them to value and steer our business. And the risk models we use have indeed, over the time, reached quite a fair amount of maturity. Nevertheless, we will not stop developing them further. And this will allow us to determine with more precision our risk exposure. And here just one, I think, topical example. In 2007, we have seen particular progress around our market's consistent embedded value models in our primary insurance business, leading to an improved risk modeling capability. And actually J&#xF6;rg's numbers were building on that.</p>
          <p>And building on these MCV models, we now have been able to establish replicating portfolios for our life and health businesses at ERGO. And these replicating portfolios allow us measure market risks more consistently across the entire Munich Re Group and to explicitly model dependencies between the reinsurance business and the primary Insurance.</p>
          <p>And you will remember because of the limitations of the previous approach, we did not consider the life and health business at ERGO in the calculation of the diversification effect at group level. Based on the new approach, we can change it. The old approach, the diversification benefits that we published was &#x2013; some called it meager &#x2013; &#x20AC;400 million. We always said that this is not the end of the story and we labeled it as very conservative.</p>
          <p>On the basis of the replicating portfolios, and now we have the chance to explicitly consider the ERGO life and health business in the calculation of the diversification benefit at group level. First estimates now show that this diversification is somewhere around &#x20AC;1.5 billion, maybe a little higher even. Of course, precise figures will be delivered to you in the context of our Analyst Conference in May this year. I thought this was an important information for you because we have discussed it and there have been questions in quite a number of occasions whether this 400 million really could be the right number.</p>
          <p>So, I am now coming to the last slide of our little presentation today. Once only <mark type="inaudible" />,  back again, we all here do consider 2007 a great year for the Munich Re Group for all the reasons that J&#xF6;rg mentioned in his presentation. Looking now ahead into the current year, we have come up now again with a range for the consolidated result. And if you compare the range that J&#xF6;rg mentioned at the start of his presentation, 2.8 to &#x20AC;3.2 billion for '07, you will see that we added some &#x20AC;200 million of net income that we would like to produce by developing our business going and moving forward. And that will then clearly stay north of the net income platform that I mentioned earlier of the &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>
          <p>Why are we more, let's say, optimistic as regards to current year? One of the reasons actually Torsten Jeworrek presented to you during the P&amp;C Re day in London recently where he also was referring to a change in the combined ratio assumption, which moved slightly upwards. So we'll not go into details today because it was presented. And the other reason being, of course, that the capital markets as such seem to be a lot more volatile than they were last year, so that our assumption that we worked into our metrics, if you like here that is shown on the slide as well, the 4.5 return on investment looks a way more likely this year than it was after all with the benefit of hindsight last year, where we could deliver for 5.2 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Well, so this is the target &#x2013; the target range that we try to deliver in 2008. All of the other targets remain the same. In the first place, the so-important RORAC positive target of 15% through the cycle. We'll also stick to our target of paying out at least a low of 25% of the net income or a dividend of not less than &#x20AC;1 billion. And we also still commit ourselves to the 3 billion target share buyback up to 2010.</p>
          <p>Changing Gear is the engine behind the most recent developments. We shifted gears, if you like, into the second phase of the development of the group and we want to deliver and we will deliver by 2010 &#x20AC;18 per share as a result. And of course, we have been pretty close to that number last year, but for some specific reasons that J&#xF6;rg has mentioned.</p>
          <p>Here I would like to stop and hand it back to Sascha.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today will come from Michael Huttner with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I had three questions. The first one is, can you explain, when you talk about buybacks and say &#x2013; I don't know if you said it today, but it seems to be a topic on last week, at least a billion in 2008 -- what the sensitivity is? Where &#x2013; what would drive you to say, well, definitely more and then give a precise figure? My feeling has got to do with the level of equities and equity markets and risk of impairments, but I don't know.</p>
          <p>The second one is on the 91.7% Q4 combined ratio, and how much of that very good figure was due to this kind of adjustment from the earlier part of the year, of your nat cat reserving and stuff? And linked to that, you were talking about reserve triangles. Can you say how much of the profit you would move between years &#x2013; not of profit, but how much of the reserves you move from 2003 and 4 to 2001 and before? And then, if I may &#x2013; I suppose that counts as four questions, but I am being a bit greedy -- if you're &#x2013; you had a target of 4.5% investment return. And I just wondered what the sensitivity is if the drive to lower interest rates continues in the U.S. Is that sensitivity here or are you more sensitive to corporate bonds and higher spreads, just to have an idea? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Michael. This is Nikolaus. I'll start with the first one regarding the buyback. First of all, I mentioned three billion just at the end of my little presentation. Of course, the three billion is what is left of the five billion we committed ourselves to. So three billion to grow until 2010 and we just with the one billion statement sort of evenly split it over the next three years. So what steers our share buyback of course is nothing new for you. It's the mixture of what is available as revenue reserves. You have to actively manage that. It is the rating environment. And maybe most of all it's also what's up in the business pipeline. So how we sort of spread that out over the next three years may be a reflux also to the business going forward. And in reinsurance, as we said, we doubt that we have a tighter environment soon. So this will rather leave us with more free capital at hand.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, on the international health side and the primary side, we will have to see what can be done on the organic growth side or even if the fruits will come lower on the acquisition front. But here again, the old truth is still the right truth. It's rather smaller or mid-size as of today. So that also will have an influence. But overall, we commit ourselves to the three billion to come until 2010 on top of the two billion we did. But it's a multifaceted question and there's no one dimensional answer to it. Equity as such, and our equity exposure is not the most important factor here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>First on the &#x2013; Michael, I understood your question that you wanted to know how much of the 90.1 &#x2013; 91.7% combined ratio was due to this release of nat cat reserve. Is it true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's 1.8 percentage points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lovely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And then sensitivities to investment return, roughly as a rule of thumb you can say that a little bit more than 40% of our investment return on a proportional basis in primary and reinsurance go to the shareholder and to the bottom line. And that can perhaps help. So if we do &#x2013; redo the calculation what Nikolaus did before that we had a return on investment of 5.2 instead of 4.5, a difference of 0.7 percentage points of which 40% go to the shareholder, then it's some 2.8% difference here, bottom line effect. Then the equity ratio at the moment, we are now at roughly 8% equity ratio after hedging a lot of our equity portfolio, and that gives you an indication for our exposure here. But as I said before, you shouldn't be too surprised to see some impairments if equity markets stay as they are at the moment. Does it answer all your questions?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello there. Three questions, please. The first one is on the primary P&amp;C business and on the other income and expenses which were 279 million last year versus 208 million the previous year. Now, in the absence of sort of more disclosure on this, if I add those expenses into the primary P&amp;C combined ratio, I end up with about 101%. I wonder if you could give me a sense of, I guess, what's actually in there and also, I guess, any expenses that you would see that are not related to the business. For example, there might be interest income or interest expenses.</p>
          <p>Second question is just on the PVNBP [present value of future business premium], which looked to be down by 6% for both primary reinsurance, and I wondered if you could just give me a bit more detail around that. And then thirdly, following on from Michael's question, I wonder if you could give us the liability combined ratio for last year and highlight whether there are any shifts within classes of business, say for example from property into casualty as well as within years. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is currency effect. They have some currency effect from the investment side, and it has nothing to do with underwriting. Then second P&amp; -- the present value of new business -- What was your question there? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We're just looking &#x2013; you can sort of work out the PVNBP from the margin. And if you look at it both for reinsurance and for primary, they both look down 6%. The PVNBP is down by 6%. So I was just wondering what the reasons are for that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I have to look up; sorry. And the last one, I don't have combined ratio for liability. But it's in the draft now with some question mark still because all quality assurance have to go through it. But you can safely rely on being somewhere around 111% in liability reinsurance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And does that mean that effectively we're seeing reserve reallocations between lines of business? So I presume when you're talking about reserve releases on '03, '04, you're not talking about liability reserve releases there. It's more presumably coming from the property side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Also casualty business which was reallocated from a later year to a preceding year because we could no longer afford to keep them at the extremely high level. But it's the short-tailed liability from property and to &#x2013; from property and short-tailed liability to long-tail excess of lost business liability. So this is a general tendency.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just if I can come back to the first question quickly, could you give us a quantification of the currency movements? And then I guess that does rather lead on to a separate question, which is why there are big currency movements on the assets because I presume &#x2013; surely all those assets are essentially in Germany, aren't they, or at least 90% of that.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions. Indication, the 1.5 billion that you mentioned that you think is the sort of ballpark for the benefit from having the life and health primary with the rest of the group. I was wondering whether &#x2013; where you are in discussions with rating agencies and also within your new <mark type="inaudible" /> regime, just where &#x2013; when or if or where that may ever be realized in your capital structure.</p>
          <p>And just a sort of general question on the payout ratio. You've got a &#x2013; you indicated 1% for 2007. And I was just wondering whether that 19 % of retained earnings, whether that sort of corresponds to 2%-plus top-line growth, whether those two numbers have any correlation. I appreciate different lines of business will have different capital demands. But with the business growing in the sort of direction you want it to at the moment, is that a sort of fair capital requirement for that sort of growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think starting with the second question, I think it's not too much of an academic work. But J&#xF6;rg can correct me if he thinks he should. Let me start with the first question. This is a very recent finding. So it has not been discussed in any detail whatsoever with any rating agency yet.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, some of the rating agencies still also are sort of completing their latest remodeling. So we have to wait for these answers to come in and then of course we will discuss what that means. I would not speculate as of today on any consequences as regards our own capital management.</p>
          <p>We should do one step after the other. This is the latest, so to speak, out of the workshop information that I handed out to you. But no consequences yet because we also have to see the entire picture of our risk capital, which we will publish per May, and then only we'll be as advanced in our considerations -- what does that really mean to us. J&#xF6;rg, would you like to correct my first statement or -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I would just like to add that this is not the only model change, yeah? So there will be not a major revision, but we want to make it perhaps more easy to understand, digest and therefore there could be some more. Therefore you cannot just add the one billion to the number you had before there. So it's a bit premature and we will spend some time on this topic during our analyst conference in May.</p>
          <p>And second question, there is not such a payout ratio &#x2013; target payout ratio between our payout and the retained earnings, yeah? So that has nothing to do with each other except for the fact that the retained earnings in the local GAAP accounts are a limitation for our payout, but we would not shy away from paying out 100% of what is there. There we don't need any buffers because we have enough buffers in the account itself because German GAAP is based on the realization principles. That means that all unrealized gains in our investment portfolios are still available to use them. Another example: the equalization reserve which is <mark type="inaudible" /> is still on the balance sheet here.</p>
          <p>Another question before &#x2013; I think it was from James Quin &#x2013; with regards to the amount of present value of new business premium. This is in reinsurance clearly due to currency, minus 5%. And if I take into account that the bulk of these present value &#x2013; of the embedded value comes from the Anglo-Saxon countries, then it's easily explainable with this effect.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>All right.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering whether I can come back just quickly on that question about the payout ratio and the growth. I appreciate there's lots of internal sort of cash efficiency-type situations that you have to resolve. Presumably, there is some linkage between the capital you attain and the growth of the business. And I was just wondering whether there was &#x2013; whether I can at least superficially link that 2% to the 19%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is indeed a link, but as I said maybe a little shortly in the beginning, it's not an academic exercise that upfront we &#x2013; there are huge cushions there. It's always dependent on the very business plan for the next year and accordingly we set our targets and we have to then manage, as J&#xF6;rg said, the revenue reserves and so forth. But of course, in a market that is sort of characterized now by more turmoil, of course, we have to be &#x2013; make sure that we do not act too quickly on the other hand.</p>
          <p>So no big cushion. We've always said that for business growth, but enough to be able to maneuver, but it's not an algorithm that we apply to either earnings or what have you, which is sort of fixed and runs through the years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Especially we don't need any buffers for the local GAAP because local GAAP is important just for regulatory solvency requirements and here we are well above the necessary limit. And rating requirements are mostly derived from the group account and so the retained earnings of the parent company don't play a role there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it sounds a little bit like it is &#x2013; the capital release is more about what you can do internally than it is about the growth targets at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say so. I would say for sure. As I said, in this market environment, I can't bet on anything here, but this is the way it looks as of today.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have a few questions. The first one actually relates to Michael's question earlier on the investment yield. I guess you are running at about 4.5% core bond yields for this year &#x2013; for 2007. If I was to think about it as &#x2013; how do you see that yield progressing going forward? I guess, obviously we are seeing quite a big drop off in volumes recently, and I suppose normally one would expect to think about it in terms of maybe a four-year or rolling average type bond yield, in which case the outlook for the yield should be relatively stable at least in 2008. But you mentioned that you've sort of been switching around your bond portfolio holdings a bit in 2007. So I am just slightly at a loss to sort of think about how the developments of that yield will actually take place and how your bond portfolio will develop. So if you have any thoughts on that that would be very useful.</p>
          <p>The second question just relates to your life primary business. Obviously, a number of assumption changes seemed to have been benefiting you. I suppose one thing, as I understand it, that is taking place in the primary life segment is that share &#x2013; is that policyholders are now getting, I think, around 50% share of unrealized gains. And I think some of your competitors have taken a charge for this factor. Have you taken a charge for something like this in your numbers or is that something maybe yet to come? And also if you have any comments relating to perhaps some of the outlook for the Riester step-up, what that could mean for new business value growth in '08. Obviously, you had a lot of changes in economic fundamentals which have helped your margin, but whether or not this piece of step up afford you more significant new business value growth will be interesting?</p>
          <p>My third question is just on the other income and expenses. This kind of follows on from James' question. I guess the question I have relating to it is that I understand it's all due to currency effects, but why is it overwhelmingly negative pretty much every year I look out through history, both in P&amp;C reinsurance and the primary business. It seems odd that something related to currency hedging should be so consistently negative through such a consistent period of time? And I am just wondering why we shouldn't think about capitalizing and then taking out of the valuation of your shares as a result?</p>
          <p>The final question &#x2013; I am sorry if I am tracking all of it here &#x2013; is relating to your buybacks, obviously I understand you want to have a kind of flexible approach here. Could you possibly give us some idea, though, of how much you are actually able to do in terms of how much do you &#x2013; or by maybe April, how much will you actually have sitting within the retained earnings within the parent company balance sheet that you can actually use to buy back shares because presumably that is quite a constraining factor at the moment? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the fourth one because I am the one on buyback here. And to give you a very blunt answer, right now, our drawer of revenue reserves is pretty empty. It's pretty depleted because with the dividend increase and with the share buybacks we did so far, there is hardly 200, 300 million left in that drawer. I mentioned earlier, of course, we can manage that and J&#xF6;rg gave you some examples. Well, as of today, it's empty. So the room for maneuvering, if we didn't do anything is pretty close to zero as of today. This was the fourth question. Now, J&#xF6;rg, I am not sure how you want to start it. Will you start with the bond yield question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's more or less unchanged, yeah. So you are right. On a rolling average, we expect it to stay at the current level. Second, life primary, and the assumption changes, that has to do with expenses in health business, the regulatory reforms which we call VVG-Reform and that is mainly dealt with within the policyholder sphere. It has to do with allocation of profits between the various generations of policyholders and does not have to have an impact on the shareholder sphere.</p>
          <p>The margins which are still positive are tax minimum guarantee and the interest rate environment. And this has also driven the recent step up in the IFRS step up which we showed in this calculation &#x2013; IFRS shareholders' equity in comparison to embedded value &#x2013; and this is relevant for primary insurance and for the part of the business which is written out of the German tax entity here. Other income and expenses, they are not so overwhelmingly negative as you described it. There is a relatively small difference between losses &#x2013; currency losses and currency gains. You will see that then in the annual report and it's more or less sustainable and it's just moving up and down more or less parallely. So it's not done in an unreasonable way. Last one was on buyback. So I think we should have answered all your questions, Will?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just following-up on the last one with other income and expenses. So are you suggesting that the way this currency exposure is held is that you would always expect to make a net &#x2013; I am sorry, my word overwhelmingly negative is perhaps a little bit harsh, but looking at &#x2013; you have consistently run a loss &#x2013; a net loss in the region of 200, 250 million looking at this...</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Can I just ask a few things? Firstly, could you just say something about the operating outlook for the life and health reinsurance businesses that there is never a lot of visibility on those areas, but I do remember you brought in, I think, some new management from Canada there in the U.S. and maybe you could just say something as to the outlook in the different parts of the world?</p>
          <p>And the second thing was just actually a clarification on an answer to one of Will's questions, which was the bond yield that you assume going forward, that 4.5%. How is it that you can sort of sustain that level of yield, and if you can sort of how long and what would be the sensitivities around that if we see interest rates decline going further? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start, Ben, with the question as regard to North American businesses. And actually it's true both for the P&amp;C and the life reinsurance, both areas we have seen a reshaping and a redefinition of our strategy that came along with what I would call a generational change in both entities, a change from, for example, at the Munich Re America <mark type="inaudible" /> and also for some of the entities, important entities in life reinsurance both in Canada and the U.S. where also the CEOs that we had over many, many years are going into or have gone into retirement are being replaced.</p>
          <p>So this is more of a co-incidence, but of course when you have people change it lends itself to also redefine the incoming CEO's strategy. And that's actually what is happening. Whereas on the P&amp;C side, of course, you have to be aware of the cycle, where are you. That's why we want to get ready for the hardening cycle now by implementing all that is needed for then beef the business up. But this is not a matter of today, whereas on the life reinsurance side, of course, it's more of a steady approach and it's a completely different market setup. But here we also feel that in the U.S. market for sure there is room for us to grow without risking the margins that we produce as of today. So that is what we see on the North American side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the bond yields, more or less stable, and for '08 the impact of a further decline of the current level would always not be visible because we have an average duration between five and six, and so it takes sometime until it buys into the portfolio. If we change for the whole portfolio the yields from one day to the other, I mentioned that the portfolio &#x2013; fixed interest portfolio in the order of &#x20AC;137 billion, minus 1% would mean 1.4 billion before policyholder and taxes. So the bottom line would be perhaps 200 million or so, definitely not more because policyholders have an over proportionate share, but this is just an improvisation which I did now.</p>

          <p>Yeah, good afternoon everybody. I would like to ask a question on slide 52, which is the investment mix. It's in the backup pages. I would like a little bit of explanation of why we have seen the loans increase dramatically as a proportion. I also believe that they were quite low, about 15.5% at Q3?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I would like to go into a little bit more detail of what factors are there that drove the big increase in the off balance sheet value of the in-force, which is sort of quantified on slide 59? Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The higher loans, they are easy to explain. We have a constant shift from fixed interest securities to loans.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is German promissory notes and similar stuff which have the advantage that interest rate movements don't grow to the balance sheet, yeah, because they are booked at amortized cost. That means in a quickly rising interest rate environment, you are not so sensitive with your equity to these developments. And then we also have more statutory guarantees here. We have less real estate and we have less equity. This also explains this higher share of the loans. Second question was on the IFRS uplift on slide &#x2013; could you please repeat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, before you do that, in terms of these German promissory notes, does that then feature as in rising interest rate environment an unrealized loss off balance sheet and that goes it to new evaluation...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. The second question here related to slide 59, and here you just give some detail in the increase in the off balance sheet in-force...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which has obviously grown quite significantly from, I think, about 3.7 billion to 5.5 billion this year and that's obviously disproportionate increase relative to the overall rise in IFRS equity. And I wondered if you could give some indication of what's being captured there and why there's been such a large increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is due to the good operating earnings, which do not all go into the IFRS result, but are reflected in the embedded value, and especially the lower tax rates have an enormous impact. And because what you see as our tax effect in the IFRS result is just a correction because it refers only to those assets and liabilities where the change in value goes through the profit and loss and not all balance sheet movements, where actually in the embedded value calculation we have all movement and especially for the future, yeah, as far as they are not booked at all on the balance sheet, and the increase in interest rates and the better equity performance than originally modeled in the preceding embedded value.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. thank you. I missed one question been answered, so if I can just check some numbers, if I may please. In your embedded value, slide 64 and 66, previously you've shown investment variances as a separate line item and I think you must have rolled it into something else I assume they are in economic variances, but I don't know. Could you just break out for the reinsurer and the primary insurer what the investment variances were, please?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in slide 38, I was just wondering if you could tell me in the available for sale assets &#x20AC;119 billion how much of that is equities that is available for sale, I know, you've given indications on the other slides, like I can't get the numbers to add-up. So if you got that from the notes I'd be grateful.</p>
          <p>And then finally, the deferred tax asset write-down in the life reinsurer, is that going to have a material impact on the life reinsurance tax rate. And if so, can you give an indication of what it would go from too? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will have a slight impact. I start with the last question and because it's just 100 million and it has a very long-term perspective in the U.S. we can recover tax losses carried forward for 20 years. And that gives you a guidance about this -- that this effect is only minor. And at the moment we see the tax in life reinsurance between 20 and 30%, dependent on the individual situation of the year. So we would have an impact, but it's not higher than let's say 1% or so from this effect. Second, we have to look up -- the split up of the investment variances, I don't have it at hand at the movement. And your second question referred to what slide it is?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon. I have got three questions concerning the primary insurance activities. The first question relates to the Primary Life Insurance. Just talk about the unit-linked and the corporate pension business in Germany. They are two major growth drivers. So do you have any figures for the premium volume you wrote in these two business lines last year? And the second question is on the health business. You've given a growth number of 4.2% last year. Do you have a split of how much of that is related to price movements and how much is volume driven? And the last question relates to the primary P&amp;C business. What do you expect of the price development of your portfolio in 2008? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the first question, primary life new business development. Here we have for the entire of our group in the group life insurance growth rate of the new business of more than 20%, round about 21%, and for the unit-linked it's in the -- close to 70%. With the latter of course I have to mention that we in relative terms to the share that we have in unit-linked business in Germany, we come from a lower base because the market was growing some round about 40%, so we outperformed the market, but of course we started from a lower base.</p>
          <p>This as regards primary life. In health insurance in Germany, I can give you the increase of our business in terms of premiums is a 3.4% increase, and I could even give you the split between the substituting the full insurance cover; that is 2.9, and the supplemental insurance is growing by some 5%, but I cannot offhand give you the split between what is the price increase and what is the supplemental insurance. As I can -- probably, it's round about 70% from the full cover and something price driven and the remainder for the supplemental as a rough sum rule.</p>
          <p>As regards to the development of the pricing environment in P&amp;C Primary, of course we have to actually differentiate between Germany and non-German business. In Germany, we always thought that the price competition in motor business should be over soon, and you've mentioned already that we have to give up again a piece of that book, because we felt prices weren't right.</p>
          <p>Overall, of course, private line business is less sensitive to pricing movement. It's a stickier business; faithfulness is important here and in the, let's say, smaller commercial and the bigger commercial and the industrial book of course we have seen quite some competition and we managed to maintain our selective policy. But our book there did grow indeed and it was one of the drivers of our growth in determined P&amp;C, because we managed sort of to select what we wanted. So specifically in property, commercial business, we could grow all of it.</p>
          <p>The driver, of course, to the P&amp;C growth is the non-German book; that's where most of the increase stems from. If you just take numbers and compare like-for-like, then of course we would have to duck <mark type="inaudible" />. If we leave it in, it's almost close to 50%, the increase. So it's driven by the non-German business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And two open questions, where one on the split of investment variances and the economic assumption changes, we don't do that split any longer because it doesn't make sense in a fully market consistent embedded value. And therefore I don't have it at hand.</p>
          <p>And second there was a question about the available for sale securities, how much is fixed interest, how much is non-fixed interest -- non-fixed interest, mainly share. It's 24.5, and fixed interest -- and overall, it's &#x20AC;119 billion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just one clarification on the Property and Casualty business. When you look at the business going forward in this year, and you have renewed I think a certain amount of contract already at the beginning of this year, would you expect that the price cycle in Germany has come to a halt? Or what are your observations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well actually I think we can't come up with a strong statement there. As we are a minor player today in -- when it comes to the Motor business certainly, we are not the price maker here, and I would not come out with a statement that we see a standstill already. It really depends because you always have that overlay also of changes in claims experience and this sort of the -- with the aging of the portfolios, of course, they also get higher discounts for good performance and it is &#x2013; it justifies <mark type="inaudible" /> of agreements So you have to sort of dissect that and split it into what is just competition driven and what is just the consequence of the portfolio development.</p>
          <p>As I would not risk it to come up with a strong statement here. But I would dare to say that competition in Motor has not come to a standstill yet. And as regard to the other lines of business for us at least we think it's manageable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I would like to ask three questions. The first one is on the primary life business. Here I would be interested in get a split how the premium development was in Germany and Italy, and why is it so weak in those countries? In Germany, you have probably a decline while the market was at least flat. And since you already mentioned that you have strong new business, what is the reason behind the weak premium outlook and what is the outlook 2008? The second question is on your new cooperation with UniCredit. You mentioned here that it's for Southern Europe, I suppose it's Italy mainly, and Eastern Europe and here I would like to know what duration this cooperation has? And the third question is on the duration on your bond portfolio in reinsurance and primary insurance? And although whether the duration of your liabilities in the P&amp;C reinsurance has changed over this year? You mentioned at the Analyst Day last week that you are no -- in the new portfolio going for shorter type business, has this changed your average duration of the entire P&amp;C book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the primary -- two questions referring to primary business. First of all, one has to differentiate the premium development from the new business development <mark type="inaudible" />, and on the new business development actually we are doing okay as regards to the comparison to the market. But of course we sit on the huge, existing portfolio and these premiums, since it is older and maturing business, of course they in relative terms to our market share come down, That's why we overall show a decrease in premiums which is slightly above the decrease that you would see for the entire German market in life business.</p>
          <p>So what we have to do is of course to make sure that we produce enough of new business sort to refill the business that it's sort of being running out, or canceled, but -- cancelled being less ratios has been the issue here. Tackling it and we are getting better overtime. But this of course contributes as well. But mostly it is the maturing of existing business when we do not still produce enough new business to refill if you like. This is a problem not only within ERGO a challenge it's also calling to -- for the market.</p>
          <p>As regards in Italy, Italy not so different. The problem is that we see a reduction, quite a tremendous reduction in Italy as we got single premium, business and therefore was again, we cannot refill with new business what we see as a reduction from that end. So the regular, the recurrent premium business -- new business is moving nicely upwards. But we cannot refill sort of what is being either cancelled or running out. So that is why in Italy also the overall premium is rather coming down than moving up.</p>
          <p>Then coming to your second question, and that is regards -- as regards to the cooperation with UniCredit. And first of all, it is not a cooperation in Italy, in Italy they have to two partners. We have a very tiny relation with UniCredit for specific businesses in Italy, but numbers are so small that it is not worth mentioning them here. So, it's actually not Italian. The cooperation is rather an old one in Germany, that we sort of we -- they inherited from the HypoVereinsbank.</p>
          <p>The new one is the one in the CEE countries and that is from South Eastern and Eastern Europe and that pretty much covers the entire area with a handful of exceptions, only three, four counties, where we're not the exclusive partner of UniCredit. This business is just being developed and built. It's not existent yet and the platform is being build up in Vienna, in Austria and they start with the first phase, the first rollout of countries now in 2008, and there will be a next round of rollout in 2009. So this business is just starting and the contract we have is a very long running. We never give out exact numbers but it's a nice double-digit contract in terms of years. J&#xF6;rg?</p>

          <p>On the duration of our bond portfolio and of the liabilities, the duration of the bond portfolio in reinsurance is 5.3% and including cash roughly 5. In primary insurance it's in the order of 6% overall, and liabilities in reinsurance duration in the order of 5.5 years, and older years maybe somewhat increasing, that means that the payout of old reserves should be somewhat postponed a little bit. But at the same time business is replaced, this is replaced by business of new years with in tenancy shorter duration. So I would make a very strong guess that it's still in the order of between 5.5 and 5.7 or so years, so no material change.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually Southern Europe with regards to co-operation, it depends where you put Greece and countries like this. But actually it starts rather north of all these countries and must be I think in the Balkan this is the most south you could possibly go with the co-operation. Some counties in the Balkan and then you move up and it goes up then into Russia, that is the most northern part. So the first rollout wave, if you like will be Slovenia, Slovakia, Romania, and Hungary. These are the first four countries, but still you see it's pretty much East, and not so much Southeast.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I just had one question please. On the investment yield, rather than 5.2% seeming abnormally high, 4.5 % seems low to me. It doesn't really seem that your investment gain harvesting was aggressive last year. Could you maybe just remind us, how do you arrive at the 4.5%? I think you have some assumptions behind that by asset class. And also when you put forth that target for 2008, is this what you consider to be normal or are you deliberately putting forward a target that's below normal because of maybe the difficulties in harvesting gains or maybe even recognizing impairments? Thank You.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would think that this somewhat conservative assumption of 4.5 is also influenced by the fact that the first couple of weeks was specifically difficult, and that the major stock market in these sales already lost some 16%, compared to the change of the year. So going forward, perhaps one can add a little bit on that. And I have no split with regard to returns here. In the long run, we expect from our equities and return in the order of 8%, 7 to 8%, and from the bond portfolio for the time being 4.5, with some incline to expect. And in real estate, we were very modest, but last year we had a return of 10%. We used a lot of derivatives, so somewhat -- meanwhile it's more difficult when you talk about IFIS investment return to predict them meaningfully. So, we would rather like to stay with the bulk number of 4.5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually Brian, we forecasted every now and then of course because we feel well, if you were to exceed that number every year, it looks little bit funny maybe too conservative. But in the environment, we felt we should not touch it now and it is very helpful when you set up the assumption metrics to take what we would consider a conservative approach in the first place. And for you it's not that difficult, if you see the market developing of course to see there might be coming in more, if for example; either equity markets move it one way or the other. So that is not rocket science then to see what is done. The only position of course then is will we harvest or won't be harvest. But we -- as you'd also know, we try to take a -- we'd say a reasonable approach there. So that should make us more or less predictable. But we would not like, since we want to deliver would not like to come up with a two offensively ingressive number here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. I have one question left, a follow up question on the Primary embedded value. I understand you have already monitored the impact from the insurance contract law on embedded value and there was if I understand correctly no impact at all. But I think there should be an impact from this law on the new business margin next year and I would guess it's clearly negative and at least everything else being equal. And if this assumption is right, will you react to this higher prices or lower commission rates? Or will you just let the margin decrease?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, this is one for J&#xF6;rg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No we expected to stay unchanged, yeah, so we do not intend to give up margins here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Does it mean that you will increase prices to compensate for the negative impact from the insurance contract law? Or do you not expect any impact from this law on the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The new law affects mainly the sharing of proceeds between the various generations, and affects the shareholder only to a lesser extent. And in addition, we also work quite hard on further development of our product portfolio, and so we are confident that we can compensate for any effect by a better mixture of profitable products.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you. I think we are pretty much through the Q&amp;A. So I hand over to Nicholas for some closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Sascha. Not much to be said. First of all, thank you for all these challenging questions to J&#xF6;rg, he's pretty much done now. And I had the easier part this time around. The -- to summarize it, I would say that 2007 certainly we did as we see it here present a very solid set of results. So we are very -- actually proud of what we would achieve and it's the result as I said in the beginning of quite some hard work.</p>
          <p>We go optimistically into 2008, despite all the challenges that are out there, because we think we did our homework, feel well prepared. And as I also said in the beginning if conditions get a little bit tougher that actually should play to our benefit since we did prepare ourselves. We will be in an underwriting company, we are an underwriting company and we will stay disciplined, that's why I'm actually not worried as long as things do not get extremely worse, then everybody will be affected. But what we have seen so far could be managed past and that's why we take this positive approach and the range of results that we set out today, we think isn't ambitious yes. But its achievable if you just continue our path. That would be it from my end. Thank you very much for attending the call. And I hand it last time back to Sascha.</p>
