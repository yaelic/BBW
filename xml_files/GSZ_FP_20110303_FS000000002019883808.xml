        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Sorry about starting slightly late. It's a real pleasure for us to meet you this morning with Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Cirelli and G&#xE9;rard Lamarche to present to you 2010 results as well as strategic outlook for GDF SUEZ.</p>
          <p>Last year, 2010, was a major year for our Group in many respects. To begin with, you'll see &#x2013; I believe the results really do show that our performance has been very sound indeed. At the same time, we've also made several substantial breakthroughs in all of our businesses and what we're doing is very much preparing the GDF SUEZ Group for the future.</p>
          <p>Now, of course, with the International Power operation &#x2013; that deal &#x2013; that was a key stage moving forward in our development, thanks to which we can really strengthen our standing at GDF SUEZ as a global player, able to go out, seek and find growth where it's to be had in the new world.</p>
          <p>Our strategy is clear. It's an ambitious one. Thanks to our international footprint, we are in a position to really reconcile both integration, resistance and growth.</p>
          <p>Let's look at 2010 performance now in a nutshell. I'd like to underscore two key points regarding 2010. Firstly, strong results &#x2013; our strong results; and secondly, this group has kept all of its commitments, EBITDA reaching &#x20AC;15.1 billion, up 7.7% compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>2010 therefore is yet another year of growth. Since our creation, our merger, we've seen constant growth. This is the third consecutive year of EBITDA growth in spite of the recession, which took place in the fall of 2008, so just after the merger.</p>
          <p>Now, as we can see, this group was able to weather the crisis and difficult conditions in the gas marketplace, all the while having good sustained performance and at the same time we were continuing to prepare the future, which means making investments. We also conducted the performance and efficiency program at Efficio. And we can say the results of that program went well beyond our targets.</p>
          <p>Our net income, &#x20AC;4.6 billion, is also up. Free cash flow, almost &#x20AC;8 billion. Our investments, &#x20AC;8.6 billion, that's the net amount, so the total amount over last three years, we can say that we will have committed &#x20AC;29 billion in net investments, which is in line with the plan we've given to invest &#x20AC;30 billion. So we're pretty much right in sync with that.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2010, the debt rate is below half of our shareholders' equity; 47% is the gearing ratio. Ratings agencies have confirmed our rating in Category A. That was reconfirmed beginning of 2011 by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's; A was reconfirmed and they were factoring into the calculations the International Power deal, stable outlook. So this just shows that we've continued focusing on and maintaining our sound financial footing in this group. International Power deal was precisely structured with an eye to that, to preserve the financial structure and our very good rating.</p>
          <p>Our Board of Directors yesterday decided to propose a dividend per share of &#x20AC;1.50, which is slightly up. It will be proposed to the AGM on May 2nd. This is yet another year when dividend grows, which reiterates &#x2013; reconfirms our Group's policy and commitment to have an attractive dividend payout and so we're going to have a sustainable policy here.</p>
          <p>I believe these results clearly go to show that our business model is the right one. In 2010, we substantially strengthened this business model. In 2010, of course, first of all, there was the deal, the biggest merger and acquisition deal in Europe that took place last year. It was the biggest merger acquisition in industry worldwide, in any type of industry.</p>
          <p>So within GDF SUEZ, we've created the global leader in independent electricity generation. Now, we're still growing and we're building today over 19,000 megawatts worldwide, and 85% of this is located outside of Europe. It will be in next two years bottom line added to the 113,000 gigawatts that are currently in operation within our scope, it &#x2013; really a thanks to the contributions by International Power. So, several countries, we strengthened our position, such as in Italy we've reorganized our positions, which will make it possible for the Group now to really reap the benefits of this integration.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, in Italy, we've made progress to be part of the renewal of nuclear there. We now very recently &#x2013; we had entered into an agreement, a major one to my mind, to supply electricity with major industrial players in Belgium, to Southern <mark type="inaudible" /> and others, has to do with participation in the consortium with joint investments made in new plants, new facilities totaling 800 megawatts.</p>
          <p>Let's talk now about our gas business. We've conducted discussions with our suppliers that took place last year and we got improvements in long-term gas supply for us. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will come back to this point, which is very important now clearly.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we're able to use our top ranking positions in LNG. We've signed major contracts for selling LNG in Asia, liquefied natural gas, a total of 6 million tons, with Kogas in Korea and also with the CNOOC, China National Offshore Oil Corporation. This is very important, and we consider there's a shift in the center of gravity of these activities.</p>
          <p>Another gas point; we've gone through two major stages. Firstly, in terms of exploration of production with Gj&#xF8;a, we've &#x2013; for the first time in continental Norway, we've become production phase operator. Gj&#xF8;a is a major operation, &#x20AC;4 billion. It's a small floating nuclear facility. It's a key asset, reserves around 40 billion cubic meters gas &#x2013; natural gas and 82 million barrels of oil, and we are operators here.</p>
          <p>Second stage has to do with developing our gas infrastructure activities with acquisition for 1.5 billion cubic meters of storage capacity in Germany. This means GDF SUEZ is now the number one in Europe when it comes to selling storage capacity. Gas storage, this is important for sake of flexibility in a highly volatile market. It's also clearly a way of securing supply.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, we have some great successes in services. Among other things, the four-year contract for the London Olympic Park and neighboring neighborhoods &#x2013; surrounding neighborhoods. This means GDF SUEZ is the new leader when it comes to managing urban networks for heating and cooling in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p>In the next few days, we'll be launching an operation in France, designed to further strengthen our Group's position in these urban networks. Throughout the year, we continued our dynamic management of Group assets. We circulated &#x2013; we sold some of our stakes such as Elia, high voltage lines business in Belgium, also Fluxys which is gas transport and Gas Natural Fenosa. We sold these stakes.</p>
          <p>Now, in the future, G&#xE9;rard will talk just more about this later. Regarding the future, we intend to continue with this policy of optimizing our assets portfolio on the order of &#x20AC;10 billion through the time period of 2011-2013, which is to say, we'll be keeping the same pace in the next three years as the pace that we've adhered to in the past three years i.e. &#x20AC;10 billion in the last three years and we'll continue with further &#x20AC;10 billion in the next three years.</p>
          <p>Now, again with an eye to optimizing the use of our capital and bear in mind, there is a very large number of industrial projects we are studying, we're highly selective. We study projects and we may decide to move on them or not if they don't meet our criteria. This is precisely why we gave up Cernavoda project, a nuclear project in Romania, and we also left the EPR project in Penly.</p>
          <p>So as you can see, throughout 2010, we have continued to prepare the future. The future also means the strategic priorities that we decide and set our sights on. Now, our Group has five main characteristics I think stand out in the utilities sector. You can see the characteristics here. Three of them have to do with, what I call, balance. It's the balance between gas business, electricity activities and services activities, energy and environment services, also balance between exposed activities and recurring secure income type activities.</p>
          <p>There is also, lastly, a balance in terms of diversification in the overall energy mix such as electricity, which is based on a whole range of technologies. There's not just one single technology required.</p>
          <p>Next, another type of balance, our geographic footprint, we've got a very firm domestic foundation in Europe. In addition to this, we've got a strong presence in emerging countries. And I think these are equally important or mutually important, it's not an either/or, we need both of these.</p>
          <p>Another feature of ours. We are a maneuverable Group. We are flexible, fleet-footed. We can move forward. This business model, I believe, has clearly shown its efficiency effectiveness, its resilience in difficult environment. It enabled this Group to meet the many challenges which have risen.</p>
          <p>Currently, we're going to further strengthen this business model with four priorities to underpin our strategy of profitable growth, approved by our Board of Directors at a seminar, which they held on our strategy.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we'll be speeding up our development in countries that are growing strongly, in electricity generations, in International Power, also in production exploration and liquefied natural gas. Also I'm talking about services. We must &#x2013; moving this direction, we must do this, because it's in those regions that we see 80% of tomorrow's energy needs. We must be present there and very much intend to be present there.</p>
          <p>If you look at the map, this is a good illustration of GDF SUEZ's overall development strategy. Thanks to the merger with International Power, I believe we very much have built a unique Group with attractive growth profile and strengthened our presence in markets that are developing strongly such as South America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>The second priority of ours is to optimize, consolidate and integrate our positions in mature European markets.</p>
          <p>Our third priority, and this has been a constant, all of our choices, profitable growth. Investments are going to really be focused on projects which are providing us with a long term visibility and in appropriate areas of context and regulation. Now, remember, investments in emerging countries tend to be done in secure situations such as power purchase agreements. In other words, long-term agreements, so output sales are secured for the full period during which the facilities pay for themselves.</p>
          <p>We're continuing and intensifying or developing innovative commercial offerings pulling together &#x2013; using synergy to pull together all of our Group's skills. In the end, our intention is to turn GDF SUEZ into a real benchmark energy provider in all of our areas of business will be the reference.</p>
          <p>Now, for this Group, the long-term value creation means we have to have increased presence in areas of the world where we're going to have strongest economic growth. So, our intention is to spend about 30% of the total of our future gross investments on building further positions outside of Europe where we're targeting areas in Latin America, in several countries, especially Brazil, Chile, Peru, some Central American countries, also Asia, Australia as well as the Middle East, particularly thanks to the ideal development platform, which is new International Power.</p>
          <p>What we intend is, as of 2016, this Group will be able to manage our total installed capacity of 150,000 megawatts and a third more than today, part of this has already been built and some is yet to be built, 60% of our capacity were repositioned outside of Europe at that point.</p>
          <p>We'll also be continuing with our industrial strategy which is based on partnerships. This is very much a part of our genetic make-up in this Group. This is our philosophy of partnerships.</p>
          <p>Growth drivers will hinge on more integrated situations, combinations throughout the value chain, so the system players in areas where we're already present. We've already implemented the strategy and we'll continue with it in Brazil, Chile, Peru, Thailand and Singapore, for instance.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we'll be strengthening our positions in upstream gas, exploration production as well as LNG in Elia, thanks to integrated projects working on such as the floating liquefaction plant, Bonaparte in Australia.</p>
          <p>We're developing our energy services activities and environmental services in targeted markets outside of Europe working together with other group activities providing synergy. Major contracts won in Australia by SUEZ Environment, a great illustration, think of the contract around &#x20AC;<mark type="inaudible" /> million worth for operation and maintenance of water and wastewater services in Adelaide, plus there are other desalinization projects in Australia.</p>
          <p>So these actions, well, I would say that the common thread in all these actions is that we are constantly controlling any related risks, but carefully targeting our investments and allocating them appropriately throughout the Group.</p>
          <p>To increase our presence in emerging countries, which is the priority and there is no doubt about that, but of course it doesn't mean the Group is linked with the waste side or domestic markets. On the contrary, we intend to further build and consolidate our domestic positions in the more mature areas.</p>
          <p>As I said, it's not an either/or situation, we need both. Although our priority &#x2013; the adjustment, it is more leaning toward emerging countries. So regarding more mature markets, when you're talking about Europe, United States, our strategy has been one of integration, optimization and being selective. Domestically, in France and the Benelux countries, our objectives are to consolidate our Group's position of leadership. In other markets, we'll be developing selectively, Italy, United Kingdom, Germany, Poland.</p>
          <p>Industrial development in our businesses can only be done within the confines of the regulatory framework. And that framework has to be clear and hopefully remain the same in the long-term, long-term clarity in regulations. We'll continue making active contribution to regulatory discussions to try to bring positive forward motion.</p>
          <p>To reap the objectives, we can use the complementarity of our business activities throughout this Group whereby enabling us to particular new offers and turnkey solutions that are meeting customer expectations, also effective integration of trading activities and portfolio management.</p>
          <p>With the continuing improvement in the Group's productivity, think of the Efficio 2 program, which we'll be talking about in a moment. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will explain it to you.</p>
          <p>GDF SUEZ is an international global group, but we certainly have our history. We know where we come from. The French market is a foundation, is our base and we want to develop it further and strengthen it. Let's talk about this briefly.</p>
          <p>We built top ranking positions, leading positions in France. Today we've got 9.6 million megawatts electricity generation capacity in France. Now, to talk about wind energy, GDF SUEZ in the past few weeks has built leading position in France with about 1,000 megawatts installed capacity as of the end of 2010, going well beyond the other players in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at thermal energy, gas-fired plants. GDF SUEZ is the top operator of combined-cycle gas facilities in France with over 2,100 megawatts installed capacity so far. Now, this isn't always that well known, but in the past three years, we are a company that built the largest amount of electricity capacity in France, above and beyond other investors who're well known for gas infrastructure. We built gas &#x2013; built a brand-new gas terminal.</p>
          <p>But also in electricity, we have been very actively investing. We have built over 2,000 megawatts, brought online over 2,000 megawatts of electricity capacity in the past couple of years since the merger, Gas de France and SUEZ. 2,000 megawatts, this capacity is about the equivalent of two ATMEA-type reactors.</p>
          <p>First, in next plant, we're the number two hydroelectricity producer in France with 25% of French output and 15% is total capacity through our subsidiaries CNR and SHEM. Our hydro production in 2010 was more than 16 terawatt hours. This is a strong position in hydroelectricity production, and we very much intend to strengthen it further in the next few years.</p>
          <p>Our target is to have a renewal in the SHEM concessions, firstly; and secondly, we want to renew concessions for a net gain of between 1,500 and 2,000 megawatts. To do this, the Group of course will be using its pluses, its technical expertise, its territorial approach, working through the CNR regulations. With our territorial approach and environmental approach, we've got a strong local footing in the Rhone Valley with the CNR and other areas.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we're using our global expertise, our global engineering expertise, which we've been using, for instance, in major dam projects in Brazil. Again, a point for France, as you know, the Group has proposed to the government to build a third generation reactor, ATMEA-type reactor, because we want to operate reactors that are the safest that exist. <mark type="inaudible" />. And the nuclear power committee has decided to study the construction of an ATMEA reactor in France.</p>
          <p>Now, downstream, we intend to strengthen our electricity share by developing dual gas/electricity offerings using the assets we have and using our customer base of around 10 million retail gas customers.</p>
          <p>Regarding B2B electricity sales, we intend to be the number one challenger here. To reach these objectives, of course we'll very much need to review the terms of competition in France. You know what our position is in this respect. If we want there to be competition and want that to develop and want the French consumers to benefit from existing nuclear facilities then we think price of regulated access to nuclear electricity incumbent needs to be &#x20AC;35.</p>
          <p>Now as you've seen, the Group has set its sights on ambitious targets to develop this industry and finance. But GDF SUEZ is also a company that shows its responsibility vis-&#xE0;-vis the environment and society as a whole. We've got a commitment to protect our future growth and results. We are going to be fighting climate change, we're committed here. We've got a diversified production facility, low CO2 emissions, and we're further increasing our renewable mix by 50% in 2015.</p>
          <p>We'll be acting as a responsible employer that's all very much part of our business model. We want employees to be part of all of this. We've got big objectives here in terms of hiring. We intend to hire worldwide by 2015 around 100,000 people at Elia to make up for people who are retiring, but also to underpin future growth.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about training. Our target is to train every single year two-thirds of our employees, training them on safety in all of our operational sites. We want frequency rates, accident frequencies to be brought down below six by 2015. We want to develop equal opportunity in the Group, 35% of women high potential executives, and when it comes to appointing new management directors in the Group, we want one-third of the new appointments to be filled by women. We want to also further strengthen employee shareholding, employee shareholding reaching 3%.</p>
          <p>Lastly, and talking about target, I'd like to just briefly give you our guidance, medium-term guidance. Now, this guidance, EBITDA between &#x20AC;17 billion and &#x20AC;17.5 billion in 2011, above &#x20AC;20 billion in 2013, of course these figures include International Power but only for 11 months of 2011 since the deal was finalized, closed on February 3rd.</p>
          <p>We're expecting net earnings &#x2013; net results to be up or stable in the medium term, and investments on the order of &#x20AC;11 billion per annum on average to continue positioning this Group appropriately. We'll focus CapEx in areas of strong growth. We'll be optimizing our portfolio of &#x20AC;10 billion in the period 2011-2013.</p>
          <p>We maintain our commitment to have a very strong, solid financial structure, Category A rating, and our gearing ratio to EBITDA of less or &#x2013; less than or equal to 2.5 &#x2013; 2 times five. Dividend policy remains attractive and sustainable over the long period, meeting our dividend or seeing it grow in the medium-term.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to hand the floor to G&#xE9;rard who'll give you further details about 2010 results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard. Good morning to you all. I'm very pleased to be with you this morning to present the 2010 results and the mid-term outlook for the Group.</p>
          <p>In 2010, the Group has delivered a first rate financial performance whilst continuing its CapEx program and we thereby continued to prepare the Group for the future and give visibility to our results.</p>
          <p>My presentation will focus around two main areas, the review of 2010 performance that allowed us to achieve all the goals set; and secondly, maintaining a sound financial structure, thanks to a balance sheet that is managed dynamically and sustained cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>Let's review the key figures. Revenues stand in an excess of &#x20AC;84 billion, up 6%. EBITDA, &#x20AC;15.1 billion, grows faster than revenues, 7.7%. Thanks to cost containment efforts. ROC, up 5.4% at &#x20AC;8.8 billion. Net income grows 3.1%, of &#x20AC;4.6 billion. Net income is stable at &#x20AC;4.2 billion in spite of the expected increase of amortization and interest expenses. The Group continued its CapEx program, &#x20AC;8.6 billion CapEx net over the year. Net debt remains contained at &#x20AC;33.8 billion. Net earnings per share stands at &#x20AC;2.11 per share, up 3.2%, allows us to propose at the upcoming shareholders meeting on the 2nd of May a dividend of &#x20AC;1.50, up 2%.</p>
          <p>The Group maintains an attractive policy of return to its shareholders that is sustainable, thereby all our targets for 2010 are met.</p>
          <p>In 2010, all the business lines contributed to the Group's profitability. Aside of Global Gas and LNG still impacted by the gas <mark type="inaudible" />, they all contributed to growth. As you can see on this chart, the energy activities in France and International have grown strongly. Top left, furthermore weather conditions, sustained growth of our results, because 2010 is the coldest year in the past 20 years. So in total, you can see that Group EBITDA has grown from &#x20AC;14 billion to &#x20AC;15 billion, that's a growth of 7.7%.</p>
          <p>Let's now review in detail the performance of each of our business lines, starting with Gas. EBITDA of Global Gas and LNG division is down &#x20AC;800 million. H of which, &#x20AC;418 million, top left, is linked to non-recurring effects of '09 that we discussed during our previous presentations. These contain arbitrage gains and exceptional supply conditions at the beginning of 2009.</p>
          <p>2010 results have been impacted by positive and negative price effects of the order of &#x20AC;250 million, second block that explains results growth. Negative price effects are of course the spread impacts that for the year 2010 totaled close to &#x20AC;300 million after renegotiations with our supplier and fewer opportunities in trading and lower margins in our LNG business. So these negative price effects were partially offset by some upside, of course.</p>
          <p>There was a rise in the price of oil of $62 to $79 a barrel that's favorable for the exploration-production business moved by the hedging ops for a total of &#x20AC;150 million that's positive. And then of course there were positive inventory effects, and of course that's a matter of leveraging the price differential between the period of gas injection in the summer and the offtakes in winter.</p>
          <p>As you can see on this screen, there were volume effects totaling minus &#x20AC;130 million. The sharp rise in LNG volumes sold with 39 shipments in 2010 as against 21 shipments in '09 was not enough to offset E&amp;P production that is slightly lower than expected for the transient technical reasons. And heightened competition on the key accounts segment, the Group has decided to protect its margin rather than going for revenue at all cost. And it's these last two factors that account &#x2013; that EBITDA of the B3G Branche is slightly lower than our expectations for 2010.</p>
          <p>Now in 2010, the division continued nevertheless to invest in order to prepare the future with just over &#x20AC;1 billion in CapEx, key note of course the Gj&#xF8;a platform in Norway commissioned in November 2010 which will reap its full benefits in 2011 and the full acquisition of Gaselys trading affiliate in 2011.</p>
          <p>Gas markets remain challenging with an oil/gas spread impact in line with our previous estimates around &#x20AC;500 million on the basis of 80 terawatt hours exposed early 2010. This exposure will shutdown at the end of last year, so in fact we cap the negative impact of &#x20AC;500 million. We anticipate opportunities to streamline the portfolio whereas output in E&amp;P should grow about &#x2013; to 60 million barrels in 2011, thanks to Europe.</p>
          <p>EBITDA of the division should be slightly up over 2010. Beyond 2011 now, the action plan that we're implementing should accelerate the growth of this business line. Thanks to continued contract negotiations for long-term sourcing with our suppliers. And in this rate, 2012 is an anniversary date for the majority of our contracts, thanks to increased portfolio flexibility through LNG and E&amp;P increased production and the oil price increases on the unhedged portions of volume.</p>
          <p>Early March 2011, there's still 20% of output exposed to price contingencies. We're giving this outlook in a negative spread background and volatile, and we assume that the gas, oil re-correlation won't occur before 2012, and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will return to that in a moment.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the results for France. EBITDA for France stands at a high level, just over &#x20AC;1 billion. Thanks to the implementation of a public service contract allowing the business line to improve its EBITDA by &#x20AC;300 million over a gas business, which in '09, you will recall, was loss making.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the cold weather in 2010, 26 terawatt hours to be compared to warm weather in '09 of minus 4 terawatt hours, which accounts for &#x20AC;300 million, twice &#x20AC;300 million, thanks to the rise in electricity output, which stands at 33 terawatt hours, up 12%, thanks to better hydraulics in 2009 and the growth of our installed base.</p>
          <p>The commissionings of the CombiGolfe power plant at France during the summer of 2010, Montoir de Bretagne in November 2010 for a total of 900 megawatts. Added to that 320 megawatts in wind power, bringing the installed base in France to 900 megawatts.</p>
          <p>For 2011, the CapEx program is continuing more modestly, notably the commissioning of 100 megawatts wind power, the EBITDA with the average &#x2013; average climate of the division should grow beyond &#x20AC;1 billion, because of the full-year commissionings and assuming a full application of the public service contract, gas business would account for 30% of the French division. Electricity would account for 70%. That's for France.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to international. For the second consecutive year, the division puts in an excellent performance with an EBITDA of &#x20AC;5.8 billion, up 16%. This strong growth in excess of &#x20AC;800 million is the result of our selective CapEx policy undertaken for several years now at sustained level increases, some forex upside on the Brazilian real 150 million, and on the dollar to the tune of 230 million.</p>
          <p>In Benelux, the performance was driven by the commissioning of new facilities such as Flevo in the Netherlands and by positive one-offs, whereas the electricity margins are down in '09 given the expected deteriorations of these spreads on coal and gas activities.</p>
          <p>The rest of Europe, also up 15%, thanks to good performance in Italy following the rise in availability of power stations, and in the UK, thanks to a new marketing policy that is successful. North America, slightly down given the non-recurrence of factors that favorably impacted our results in '09, dispute settlements of the unwinding of favorable hedges.</p>
          <p>Latin America, growth very sustained with Brazil, EBITDA goes from &#x20AC;800 million to &#x20AC;1.1 billion, thanks essentially to good hydropower, but of course commissioning of new facilities, taking off of our activities in Chile and merger of our business in Chile and some forex upside.</p>
          <p>Asia results benefiting from a rise in power demand in Singapore that is pushing prices up and development fees in the Middle East on the combined plants that we've won.</p>
          <p>2011 on a like-for-like, EBITDA of the division is flat, that is we're offsetting the exceptional effects of the year 2010, positive effect of new power capacity put in place in Brazil, Estreito; Chile, Thailand, offset by continuing margin contraction in the Benelux that the whole sector is experiencing, and by the disappearance of one-offs to the tune of about &#x20AC;180 million. Excluding exceptional, the mid-term growth prospects remained sustained by the commissioning of 13 gigawatts of power generation capacity.</p>
          <p>Before moving to the results of the infrastructure division, just a quick word on the results of International Power that is now heart of the business lines, since the 3rd of February. Yesterday, during the publication of the annual results, Phil Cox is here, announced a profit from operations 2010 of &#xA3;995 million, which in the definition is an EBITDA of 1.4 billion in line with our expectations. This chart demonstrates the crafting of the combined accounts that on a full year basis, the size of the new company resulting from the tie-up between our activities and IP.</p>
          <p>In another words, if the transaction that had occurred on the 1st of January 2010, the new company would have contributed to the result of the Group to the tune of &#x20AC;16 billion in revenue and over &#x20AC;4 billion in EBITDA. The preliminarily pro-forma 2010 accounts exclude the purchase price allocation and take account notably of the full integration of &#x2013; we control the 2011, the division Europe Energy and International will benefit from the integration of IP, which will contribute, as G&#xE9;rard said, to EBITDA. We also confirm that the operational and financial synergies of the new company should, in 2010, reach approximately &#x20AC;200 million at Group level, excluding implementation costs.</p>
          <p>The infrastructure business line continues its strong growth with a rise in revenues of 5%, and EBITDA grew 6.5% to reach &#x20AC;3.2 billon. This fine performance is due to the price increases obtained in 2010 by the commissioning of the Fos Cavaou terminal for a contribution of &#x20AC;40 million in 2010 that will account for &#x20AC;100 million in 2011, also through favorable weather conditions for &#x20AC;150 million driving EBITDA. CapEx stand at a high level, &#x20AC;1.8 billion, with 65% devoted to maintenance in 2010 as against 58% in '09, notably to strengthen further the safety of our facilities.</p>
          <p>Outside France, the division is growing, as you will see in recently in Germany, with the acquisition of 1.5 billion cubic meters of storage capacity. The six sites concerned around the future gas &#x2013; Nord Stream gas pipeline to meet increased flexibility requirements notably to balance the power base, 80% of capacity pre-contractualized through 2020, which gives us good visibility on the results and profitability of this acquisition.</p>
          <p>Contribution of this transaction to Group EBITDA will be about &#x20AC;100 million full year. The closing is planned at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Storengy affiliate that drove this development becomes the pan-European storage leader. 2011 will be a year of consolidation of the division's results. 2010 benefiting from exceptional weather conditions, mid-term growth prospects are sustainable, 3% or 4% per year, driven by return on our investments.</p>
          <p>Energy Services; 2010 results of Energy Services division confirm the very good resistance of this activity in a challenging backdrop, notably in the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>Revenues posts stable organic growth; EBITDA, &#x20AC;923 million, you can see slightly up, thanks to constant productivity and cost containment efforts in France. Service activities benefited from the colder weather and installation activities are growing with orders seen to herald an economic recovery, given the pressure on the margins remained considerable. Significant developments achieved in 2010 as demonstrated by the level of CapEx standing at &#x20AC;620 million, within particular pre-acquisition of the heat networks of YOU Telecom in UK, which leads us to a leadership position in the management of hot and cold urban networks acquisition of Energy Services of Proenergy in Germany and the completion of the energy plant on the future site of the London Games.</p>
          <p>2011 now for this business line; EBITDA growth remains linked on the economic recovery, the upturn of our Dutch business, but should benefit from development projects achieved such as heat networks. We expect to capture additional revenue of the order of &#x20AC;150 million. Amongst that, 30 new contracts similarly on the new public private partnerships, we expect additional revenues of &#x20AC;50 million a year.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the Environment division put in a strong performance in 2010, thanks to the completion of the friendly takeover of AGBAR. For 2010, EBITDA should grow by 10% and 7% mid-term at constant exchange rates, and these results were presented by Jean-Louis some 10 days ago. So, this brings me to the end of the operating income, let's return to the overall Group results.</p>
          <p>On the Group accounts, you can see the main items before the operating income and you can see an anticipated increase to amortization and depreciation, &#x20AC;650 million, such as for instance the move from AGBAR to comprehensive integration of SUEZ Environment and the number of commissioning of assets in France, the combined cycle plants, wind, power plants, Fos Cavaou in Chile, the LNG terminal at Mejillones. This increase should continue in 2011 to the tune of &#x20AC;500 million on the like-for-like linked to the commissionings of which half are accounted for by euro.</p>
          <p>The move from current operating income to the result of activities stands at &#x20AC;700 million positive. This positive movement is due to the generation of important capital gains on disposals. The sale of Fluxys and Elia and the write-back of a provision for the dismantling of gas infrastructures, &#x20AC;1.1 billion, leaning to the extension of well gas reserves that's extending the lifetime of our structures. And we've also revised on what's the book value of our long-term B3G contracts, so &#x20AC;550 billion on the basis of a conservative assumption, and then there were other capital losses on smaller assets.</p>
          <p>Financial income stands at &#x20AC;2.2 billion, it's down because of the interest cost on debt &#x20AC;180 million. This is essentially volume. And then we have a change in the mark-to-market for &#x20AC;330 million. They were positive in 2009 and now negative, here the difference is &#x20AC;330 million. The tax cost is &#x20AC;1.9 billion and the effective rate adjusted for disposals and one-offs has increased and stands at 33% and should remain stable at this level. As we announced, minority interests are up by &#x20AC;250 million, following the increase of the contribution of SUEZ Environment of &#x20AC;100 billion. So total, P&amp;L which stands at &#x20AC;4.6 billion, Group share up 3%.</p>
          <p>Net debt at the end of 2010, debt remains contained at 2.2 years of EBITDA, excluding the financing of assets under construction. The future contribution to EBITDA detailed in Annex, this ratio will be broke down to 1.5 years.</p>
          <p>This sound balance sheet is due to sustained cash flow generation to close of &#x20AC;8 billion, integrating maintenance investments, development investments to tune of &#x20AC;8.6 billion and asset disposals of over &#x20AC;3 billion. Then the impact on return to shareholders down to &#x20AC;4.4 billion, including the payment of the balance of the dividend of '09, the interim dividend of $0.83 paid in November in the end of our share buy-back program for &#x20AC;500 million in 2010.</p>
          <p>Cash flow generation is supported by a high level of cash flow from operations. The Group has generated close on &#x20AC;15 billion of cash flow from operations, that's up &#x20AC;1.7 billion. That's an increase of 13% of '09; maintenance investment, stable at &#x20AC;3.3 billion, 40% for infrastructure, 30% for service and environment and the remaining 30% for power generation. The change in WCR is under control in spite of the weather, the cold weather, at the end of the year, which increased billings as expected.</p>
          <p>Financial structure in 2010; three major financial transactions were completed successfully in June. We signed a syndicated credit facility of &#x20AC;4 billion in five years. In September, we issued a bond of &#xA3;700 million, 50 years this issue is the largest transaction of this duration ever have achieved on the sterling market by a company. It was immediately swapped to euros at a fixed rate on average of 4.28 for 50 years; and then in October, 2 billion bond issue with a partial buyback of three quite costly bond tranche.</p>
          <p>At the end of this transaction, the debt maturity was extended by one year. It now stands at nine years on average whilst preserving an average cost of debt that remains stable at 4.6% cash balance sheet optimization measures will continue. And we've anticipated the renewal of our credit facilities that are maturing at 2012 to the tune of &#x20AC;4.5 billion. The closing of this transaction is scheduled for March and things are looking good.</p>
          <p>End of 2010, the net debt to EBITDA ratio remains below 2.6 years, pro forma of international power, but without impact of coming disposals which will bring it down even further.</p>
          <p>The Group's operational and financial performance and active and dynamic cash management allowed the Group to recently have confirmed by S&amp;P and Moody's ratings of A with stable outlook after the inclusion of the International Power deal. And this is excellent news for us.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio optimization and disposals program; we wish to see the &#x20AC;10 billion assets over the next three years. This is part of the continued disposals over the past three years that also amounted to &#x20AC;10 billion as G&#xE9;rard said. This new program focuses on two areas. Research partners just support us in growth transactions and to share risks as we'd already in many countries, the Middle East, Latin America, but also in E&amp;P, because in E&amp;P we still have partners on gas or oil fields, and asset disposals that are no longer a priority or strategic sales achieved of our minority stake in Noverco in Canada, the beginning of this year; and design and manufacturing activities of Logan Teleflex in the service division illustrate the second prong.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, several projects are currently under study. As regards the first area, we're looking at the possibility of bringing in partners in our E&amp;P business. And in accordance with those commitments, the Group will continue to reduce its presence and footprint in Belgium. This allows us to preserve our financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>Over to Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard. Good morning to you all. Special good morning to Philip Cox. He is with us today for the first time, and forever now. Now let's just quickly run through three main points for the Group. I'll talk to you about the gas marketplace, how things panned out in 2010. It's an important thing to look into here. I also wanted to talk to you a little bit about our expectations in terms of electricity generation in Europe, and I'll talk to you about Efficio, which is our productivity program.</p>
          <p>So first of all, to talk to you about the gas marketplace. Clearly, at the end of 2010, we ended up with the gas market that's less of an &#x2013; less in an imbalance than was the case at the beginning of 2010. Nevertheless, it's better that the excess capacity is still with us. But there are some positive signs in 2010. We have to observe these. First positive is of course recovery of demand in Europe. For 2010, we think that was up 8% after a drop in 2009 of 6%.</p>
          <p>Now clearly last year something else helped us a lot, weather, cold weather in 2010. But recovering gas demand is to be seen in the US as well, up 5% as opposed to down 4% 2009; Asia demands growing there for gas as well. There is a great deal of potentials, strong potential. Gas now only represents 4% of Chinese consumption today.</p>
          <p>We also observed, and this is fairly new, I think it's good to say therefore. We see that there is a gain of natural gas for heating, including in mature countries. Previous periods were more difficult. For instance, in France, in new buildings, gas heating while proportion has gone from 29% in '08, which is very, very low, the lowest on record, and now that's gone to 43% gas in new buildings. So there is a spectacular uptick. This just goes to show that the French are aware that in spite of some price hikes, they are still in the headlines today. Nevertheless, gas is still the least expensive solution for heating.</p>
          <p>So, prices more specifically, we see clear firming up of prices for gas in the marketplace last year, if you look at NBP, up 25% on average for the year. On the other hand, some less favorable aspects, mainly as you know the situation of excess capacity has lead to a de-correlation and unlinking of gas prices next to oil. So we still continue to see this. If you look at the gas/oil spread, as you know, there was peak here at the beginning of last year, and it's strengthened up around &#x20AC;6 in 2010, so they go from &#x20AC;10 to &#x20AC;6.</p>
          <p>Now, really forward contracts don't give us much indications as the trends. Forwards tend to be pretty flat, so we can't know when there will be the end of spread. Furthermore to say that in the very recent future the spread was heightened somewhat due to stronger growth in oil due to some recent events in North Africa. So, we're not making any assumptions that the spread will close this year nor next year. In all likelihood, this may even happen more in the order of 2013 or 2014.</p>
          <p>Another fairly difficult point, supply is still around, especially, LNG. We will talk about the gas bubble, it's mainly LNG bubble really that we're having to content with today. There still is that LNG bubble, this is the last year for this. There is new liquefaction capacity that's been brought online worldwide, especially Qatari and this is peaked production. So, 2010, as we can see, was the beginning of a rebalancing in the gas market, however the market rebalancing will be gradual and will not yet be completed this year. So, that's the backdrop, a difficult one.</p>
          <p>What are we doing during this difficult gas market situation? Well, our teams are working exceptionally to counter these negatives in the market, addressing spread. So, we use as much flexibilities as we can in the long-term supply portfolio, particularly we're adding volumes. As you know, we've got several areas, margins for maneuver here</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we work with GDF SUEZ and we do arbitrage, we optimize, we are in a strong position to optimize here, thanks to our geographic footprint and thanks to the fact that we are active at present. We have needs both in Europe and in Latin America, the Middle East as well as Asia. So, since there is diversity, there are differing needs; we can do the necessary arbitrages and trade-offs. Furthermore, we make best use of our LNG capacities and its flexibility to best orient them in line with our Group's interest, i.e. to the premium markets.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we quadrupled the number of shipments sent to Asia. G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet gave us the figure a moment ago, going from four shipments in 2009 to 16 shipments last year. So, this is flexibility in our portfolio. Thanks to this flexibility, plus our hedging policies we're constantly tailoring to market situations, fine tuning. Thanks to all this, we can limit the current consequences of the spread.</p>
          <p>To give you a couple of figures; last year, as we said to you, due to our exposure, which was about 80 terawatt hours for 2010-2011, there should have been an impact on the EBITDA maximum of &#x20AC;800 million shared between 2009 and 2010. That's still the neighborhood; we're still talking about that amount. We've met that commitment. We'd like to make this better; wasn't possible, but we managed to stick within the confines of that figure, thanks to actions we took.</p>
          <p>So now, end of 2010, talking forward for 2011, we no longer have exposure on to the spread in 2011, which means everything is contained in EBITDA figures that I'll be giving to you when I talk to you about the trends in a few moments time. So we are in line with our announcements.</p>
          <p>So another question is about 2012; 2011 has been settled, 2012. Now currently the amount open exposed to the spread, if you look our overall portfolio, 700 terawatt hours, is on the order of 100 terawatt hours, that's the ex-project, 100 terawatt hours as opposed to the 80 last year. That exposure of 100 terawatt hours will be closed throughout 2011 using various operations of flexibility, optimizations, trade-offs, arbitrages.</p>
          <p>So operation similar to those we enacted in 2010 for 2011, we're doing exactly in 2012. This is being &#x2013; that hasn't been factored in the financials yet, but there have been impact of renegotiations that we will be conducting this year with our main suppliers. So the real impact, actual impact of the exposure of 100 terawatt hours will depend, first of all, on the value of the spread throughout the year and will depend on when we close the positions, plus including renegotiations with our suppliers.</p>
          <p>So you can see the spread &#x20AC;6, &#x20AC;100 of openness &#x2013; 100 terawatt hours, sorry, is open. So you can look at the 600 and see what's that issue. It's not a reduction in our current account results. This is moving on one year to the next.</p>
          <p>So on a short term, with that in mind what we can say regarding 2011 and changes in global gas, quite a mix here. But all-in-all, let's say that there should be an uptick &#x2013; moderate upswing compared to the results that we indicated for 2010 of &#x20AC;2,080 million expecting an increase. The increase is mainly thanks to contribution of exploration and production activities, which will see a strong increase, particular with Gj&#xF8;a coming online, which is up and running doing very well. This is oil and gas at Gj&#xF8;a. And prices will be better in exploration and production, particularly for oil.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, when it comes to supply activities, supply and market activities, this will stay positive. These are still the positive activities. However, they will still be suffering from the spread. In addition to that, there is increased &#x2013; somewhat increased competition in 2011 compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>In addition to all of these, there will be fewer customers that are indexed on oil. So we still have a portfolio that's oil indexed, we have fewer customers though that are oil indexed, because some of them such as industry are switching market indexes.</p>
          <p>But even though there are these negatives, they are still with us. Nevertheless, we expect still a positive contribution from supply activities next year &#x2013; sorry, this year at GDF SUEZ. So you can see we're well. This is the market context. This is no news. We need to review the balance of our long-term contracts that we have with our main suppliers and producers.</p>
          <p>Last year, we addressed this quickly &#x2013; quick answer, we renegotiated with all of our suppliers, that had never happened. That was a first in our company's history. We negotiated to deal with the severity of the situation we were having to contend with. We were able to temporarily adapt those, adjust the contracts. What do we obtain? We got greater flexibility for volumes, so we could really keep this in check with demand. Furthermore, we achieved a limited indexation to market price benchmarks for around 10% of supplied volumes via the long-term contract.</p>
          <p>The limited indexation is something we then immediately transferred, passed on to the final consumer, such as households, residence. So currently we are in ongoing negotiations with our suppliers. We have resumed this cycle of negotiations with suppliers. And contractually, in 2011 we are able to renegotiate with all of our long-term suppliers. So throughout the upcoming months this is major leverage for us, contractual leverage that we now have. And it's part of our long-term contracts and our timing.</p>
          <p>And what are we asking for &#x2013; without spelling it out, let me just say we're asking for is for our suppliers to give us price levels that are more in line with market prices today. Now at the same time, of course, we are trying to tailor our development policy adapted. Let me just quickly focus on our developments in Asia, where we know demand for gas is strong, and what we see here is that last year, for instance, we signed two major contracts with two major energy players in Asia, the Korean company, Kogas, and the Chinese company, CNOOC. This was the first contract &#x2013; medium term contract with the Chinese for us.</p>
          <p>So these two contracts, they are oil indexed. They foreseen oil indexed. They foreseen oil indexed a total of over 5 million tons LNG, and of course our intention is to develop this transfer of LNG from the Atlantic to the Pacific to these markets that continue to be premium markets for us.</p>
          <p>This is also why we are developing our projects in Australia, such as the Bonaparte project, of course, and E&amp;P/LNG integration in that area of the world. In that area of the world we are strengthening our production. We've got 13 gigawatts and they will be online in 2013, and much of this, 55% of it is gas-fired. So we do need to supply these facilities in Asia, production facilities.</p>
          <p>Next point, to tell you in electricity what we are doing in Europe. I think this is also something that we need to inform you and to talk to you about our production mix, and it's been tailored to the new policy situation in Europe. First of all, we're now dismantling old facilities which are not well positioned. We're decommissioning them in appropriate order. You can see over two year period we withdrew 700 megawatts particularly from Benelux areas.</p>
          <p>Now thermal, all-in-all, we are not building anything. We are not beginning construction of anything. No unsecured greenfield, so we are not doing much in Europe today. Of course, we're continuing with wrapping up completing facilities, plans that had been launched in 2008-2009. There were many projects brought into service in 2010, such as in the Netherlands two units, and in Greece CCGT facility; then France, CombiGolfe, went in force; and then Montoir, that came online.</p>
          <p>Now 2011 and in future years, we've got three remaining projects to be brought online in Europe; one of them in Portugal, coming from the IP portfolio, and then two coal-fired; one in Germany and one in The Netherlands.</p>
          <p>Aside from these though in thermal, to repeat, if it's not secure, there will be no further greenfield committed above and beyond repowering operations when necessary or biomass conversions. So in Europe, development of production facilities at this juncture will hinge on renewables, a selective strategy here favoring certain areas, when the regulatory context and visibility are appropriate as we see it. And that's not the case everywhere in Europe. And of course, we will be using two areas in which we excel; onshore wind and biomass.</p>
          <p>We're also going to be involved in offshore wind, for instance in Belgium and in France. We are getting ready to be involved in a call for tender and win that call for tender that French government just announced. It will be for consortium. It will be fully announced in near future and we very much intend to win on that one.</p>
          <p>Hydro, we have ambitions here. This is, as you know, a main focus of ours. We've made a major step forward with International Power thanks to hydro assets they have, International Power top ranking assets such as First Hydro, 2,200 megawatts, that's major, and then of course in France. For us this is a priority objective. We intend to increase our hydro capacity by bringing in some concessions renewals.</p>
          <p>I didn't mention nuclear, but let me say policy is crystal clear in this area. Of course, we intend to make sure the Belgian consumers get the quality that GDF SUEZ continues to provide them with. Availability rate is near 90%. Last year we were at 88%, basically the same as 2009.</p>
          <p>Now under the extension for the lifespan of the nuclear facilities, we've agreed with the government in extending those facilities. And of course we want to be a player in nuclear renewal when the time comes and in the countries that we are interested in.</p>
          <p>Now briefly lastly, let me talk to you about the efficiency productivity program. Today I have to tell you that this program is very much part and parcel of every business unit's policy. First of all, in 2010 we came up with results. We delivered these results that were above our targets. With just over &#x20AC;1.5 billion in gains through the period of 2009-2010, we are about &#x20AC;300 million above target. And we had already revised that target upward.</p>
          <p>Now this year we're launching a new Efficio program. We didn't wait for the end of the previous year program, which is the end &#x2013; at the end of this year. We decided we needed to review the Efficio program, so the Efficio 2 program. During the last year Efficio 1, we wanted to strengthen this, tighten it up and we wanted to put together the plans, these are operational efficiency and excellence programs that are part of the business units. Therefore, the business units and also for the functional departments we are combining productivity and operational excellence.</p>
          <p>We are really focusing, first and foremost, on cost savings under Efficio 2, CapEx gains and also working capital requirements gains. We're expecting &#x20AC;900 million performance gains per annum, that's the target, &#x20AC;900 million per year. Furthermore, there are going to be &#x2013; we're going to be the indicators to measure operational performance of our activities, so KPIs.</p>
          <p>Lastly, before handing over to G&#xE9;rard, let me talk you briefly about the challenges we have. First of all, flexibility, maneuverability, operational excellence, these are the features. These are the main priorities for this Group today.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>So just by way of conclusion, you've seen strong 2010 results that bolster our business model. Our objective is to build a global benchmark in energy and services, with clear strategies and clear financial targets, and to be a platform of strength, solidity and resilience in a very volatile and risky environment, and we have very first rate positions. We have the ability to adapt our supply portfolio to changing gas market conditions. We wish to create value from our best-in-class international platform bolstered by the tie-up with International Power and consolidate our domestic positions.</p>
          <p>All right, we're available to take your questions, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, G&#xE9;rard and I, but we also have our business managers, Henri Ducr&#xE9; for France, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Tolot for Services; Phil Cox is with us today from IP, and Guy Richelle, who is the COO of International Power, Jean-Marie Dauger for Global Gas and Jean-Louis Chaussade for Environment. Who would like to ask the first question? And forgive me, yes, Jean-Claude Depail is also with us for the Infrastructure Business Unit, discrete, but very effective.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Exane. Three questions, first one on the gas division. I'd like to have an idea of the amount that you're &#x2013; volume amount in 2013 that you're going to lock-in in terms of oil to gas margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, sorry. 2011. Forgive me. You indicated 100 in 2011 on open on 2012. How many will be closed in 2013 during 2011? Whether this is sort of an extension or shortening of the contract lifetime for your gas consumers in France and Europe?</p>
          <p>Second question on the guidance, the target of &#x20AC;20 billion of EBITDA 2013, is that on a like-for-like or is it on a post-disposal basis? And on the guidance your growth in net income, is that recurring net income or is that just a straightforward net income?</p>
          <p>And the third question, could you give us an update on the state of the renegotiations or negotiation on the lifetime of nuclear plants in Belgium and risks of tax increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. I'll answer the third question. Let's start in a reverse order. In Belgium for the time being, there is no renegotiation, because an agreement has been reached. We reached an agreement with the Belgium government, Prime Minister was Mr. Van Rompuy, concluded with the unanimous support of all parties represented this agreement, the extension of the three nuclear power plants that will be reaching 40 years in 2015.</p>
          <p>We've agreed on number of counterparties with Belgium government payment to the budget for nuclear power providers, not just us, but others investing in renewables and volume of jobs, of hires in Belgium. So we of course abide by those.</p>
          <p>Commitment for the time being, the Belgium government is in caretaker mode, no new government. So the Belgium political situation is very specific, but we have a firm agreement. We're respecting it on our part, we're just awaiting that the Belgium institution is in a position to respect their own commitments. But I mean there is no negotiation, because an agreement has been reached. So there is no renegotiation.</p>
          <p>On the second part of your question &#x2013; second question on the guidance, in terms of income as to whether it was constant scope? Yes, so &#x20AC;20.8 billion are not the consequence of major acquisition deals. I mean, there are small minor transactions, but nothing major. So we can consider that it's pretty much organic, which leads us to &#x20AC;20.8 billion. Of course, it incorporates International Power, as G&#xE9;rard indicated. And the disposal and the impact of disposals, right, that was your question.</p>
          <p>So that factored in a certain assumption on our disposal program, the &#x20AC;10 billion is of course factored into the &#x20AC;20 billion. That stands to reason.</p>
          <p>The question on the guidance and the net income is to whether it was recurring net income or total net income that was growing? It's total net income, we include everything.</p>
          <p>Well, if you refer to page 77 in the Annex, you'll see that the gas balance is very considerate, 1,200 terawatt hours with about 700 terawatt hours long-term contracts. I mean that's not the Europe, but the problem is essentially European. So the question is today, I mean, we can't answer you at this stage on what are ultimately the terawatt hours open for 2013, because it of course depends on the sourcing developments in terawatt hours, but also the change in our customers. If we have fewer oil customers, more oil customers, of course that can change the terawatt hours.</p>
          <p>What we're saying today is that in 2011 we have ahead of us about 100 terawatt hours for 2012, and for 2012 we will close them during the course of the year, hoping that the bulk of the spread will be quashed by the renegotiation that we will undertake with the suppliers. So you see, for example, we have 350 terawatt hours regulated, what we call, regulated. These are terawatt hours at oil indexed. How many that will be in two years down the road? It's rather difficult today to give you a firm answer on that. We'll see how the market unfolds over the next two years.</p>
          <p>But having said that, in '09 for 2010, we had 80 terawatt hours for 2011; for 2012, we have 100, so we can &#x2013; we see that it's pretty much a figure that we need to bear in mind, save major upheaval either on the supply side or change in our customer base. Are we seeing a shortening in our contracts? No, in any event on long-term contracts, we're committed for the time being through the end of the decade. And we don't have &#x2013; no one has the means of discontinuing those before the end of the decade.</p>
          <p>As to customers, I mean if you're speaking of B2B customers, rather B2B, because B2C has changed of B2B today, what we're seeing is a wait and see, is heightened wait and see attitude compared to other periods. People are waiting to really know &#x2013; I mean, didn't know up until recently. Perhaps the recent oil developments may shift people's thinking, but we're more in a wait and see mode before signing up to one to two-year contracts, because that's the bulk of what we do. Thank you. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Couple of questions. Once again on the gas, this year we see that there is a big gap between the NBP, and the trend it seems to increase that. Do you think that this is something that's sustainable? Or how do you view the risk that the Europeans spot market will move closer to the U.S. market?</p>
          <p>Secondly on gas, you indicate that you'll have renegotiations in 2011 with your suppliers. Generally those contracts are renegotiated every three to five years. You've used the special clause in 2010. What is the possibility of renegotiating all the contracts? And aside from the reset what are the other improvements that you can bring about, knowing that you've streamlined all the volume and increasing the gas indexation components in those contracts? That's on gas.</p>
          <p>Second question on shareholder stake increases, E&amp;P and GRTgaz, I mean there were rumors in the press indicating that CDC might take a stake in GRTgaz. In E&amp;P, you mentioning an increase in partnerships on the fields or potentially the partial IPO as rumored in the press. So, on the first part, well, you've partially answered that in the presentation, but maybe just some clarification.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we think that the U.S. will remain an energy island for a degree, and so the backup, the $4 in the U.S. won't we translated to Europe. In fact, the market prices in Europe have tended to rise. So what we should see is 10. Going forward more increased tension on LNG once everything has come on stream. And so there is no reason that Europe should come down. In fact, it's never been come down.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, three major price areas, so the U.S. area with very depressed prices, Europe twice the U.S. prices, and Asia, which remains essentially oil. So is that sustainable? Everything will depend really on <mark type="inaudible" /> and what happens in shale gas production in the U.S. going forward. I don't think the U.S. is likely to export gas very soon, even if sometimes we read about certain projects in the press.</p>
          <p>Renegotiations 2010, what I was saying was that this is kind of an emergency situation, I mean an urgent situation. I mean, we're not the only ones. We went to see our suppliers to say, we need to respond rapidly. But we said here in fact that in these early renegotiations that we're undertaking over a limited period 2010-2011, not real price reviews in a contractual framework, we've already maintained the contractual framework that allows us &#x2013; offers a number of milestones of two to three years to reopen the issue. It so happens that most of our contracts opening up in the current period. So we're going to be able to renegotiate in accordance with the contracts to review all our suppliers for a very large part of the volumes that are supplied to us in the 12 months ahead.</p>
          <p>Have we done everything on arbitrage, on trading and optimization? No, I mean there is always things to be done. It depends on market trends and every step with this we can always save a little more and teams are working actively at that. But it's true that as you indicated to narrow the spread and to include &#x2013; to narrow the cost of the spread in GDF SUEZ, the large partners come in 2012 as was the case in 2010-2011 through a &#x2013; from a price revision with our suppliers, &#x20AC;6, about &#x20AC;6. I mean, that's a high figure. So that can be booked in volume. That's how it can be achieved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two other questions, exploration-production, GRTgaz, in both cases there is a point in common. We have industrial projects for these two activities. On exploration-production, we've given some guidance on what we plan to achieve in developing E&amp;P. On upstream the idea is that this business should bolster, should support our downstream gas, and LNG business notably with the study of certain integrated projects, such as in Australia that I referred to.</p>
          <p>So to implement this industrial strategy, clearly we wish to combine our own financial resources with those partners. Let me state clearly that we're ruling out a partial IPO of the business unit. But on the other hand, it's not at all to be ruled out that we ask partners to come and join us with partnerships that are more or less extended on a particular activity. We've always done this and in all business, be it in electricity, gas or services, and that also applies to exploration-production.</p>
          <p>For GRTgaz, here again the prime idea is to build an industrial venture that is ambitious, not just for business in France, but also internationally. And here again, an option amongst many might be to bring in partners to the shareholder base minorities, and they can by law only be public, but I mean that's one option amongst many. Nothing is decided and nothing is ruled out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we have two questions here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>SocGen. Forgive me, but you said that one-third women in the company, I see there's three of you there up on stage. So just have to worry, which of you will not be there next year. That's &#x2013; and we can also have a sex change, yes, well everything is possible today. Okay, what about your company, everything okay?</p>
          <p>If we could perhaps revert to the 2011 guidance, you've just published &#x20AC;15.1 billion. If I add &#x20AC;1.5 billion, &#x20AC;1.4 billion for IP that's in consolidation, you're targeting &#x20AC;900 million per annum in synergies and operational efficiencies, which sounds huge. But if you confirm so much the better, de facto reach in excess of &#x20AC;17 billion. Why have a guidance between &#x20AC;17 billion and &#x20AC;17.5 billion in 2011? What's going to go awry at that step &#x2013; I mean, I'm missing something. Global Gas you seem pretty positive on that. So that is my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question on the dividend and the buybacks, it's a bit surprised that you upped the interim by 4 &#x2013; closed on 4%. You remain &#x2013; the final dividend is flat. I mean, what's the rationale your anticipated increase in the final dividend? All of a sudden a sharp increase in the independent, in the interim and flat final, &#x20AC;2.1 billion in buybacks, is that something to be repeated every year? That's my second question.</p>
          <p>And third in the scope, we see you just excluded the IPO of Global Gas, GRTgaz we see that you want to move on that, might there be other key factors, major factors in the scope that you'd like to change over the next couple of years? I'm not speaking here of external acquisition, but the current scope that you have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we'll try and answer your questions. The range goes from &#x20AC;17 billion to &#x20AC;17.5 billion, and if we wanted this year to give us &#x2013; to err on the side of caution to give a raise is that the world around us is a rather uncertain world. And since we want to be sure of delivering on our guidance, of course we've opted this year to give that range of &#x20AC;17 billion to &#x20AC;17.5 billion, which of course includes element of caution linked to the macro economic, macro political and macro strategic of the world today.</p>
          <p>On the dividend, there is an increase in the dividend overall, 2% increase in the dividend to show that we're continuing in spite of quite a high payout for the industry. We wish, nevertheless, to increase the dividend by 2%. So it's not a very significant increase, but it's the signal that we wish to convey that the growth in the dividend will be sustained, and part and parcel of our payout policy. That we want dynamic, uncompetitive, in fact the yield of our stock remains very competitive.</p>
          <p>On the buyback, we're very pragmatic. Let me just recall that we announced at the time of the merger, a program of &#x20AC;1 billion. We initiated it, we achieved &#x20AC;500 million, and then we had Lehman going bankrupt, so we stopped there. In fact everyone stopped the share buyback programs. And we had &#x20AC;500 million to complete.</p>
          <p>So we waited for conditions to be ripe to resume this &#x2013; to complete the share buyback program. That's done. We now have not decided to resume an equivalent share buyback program at this point in time. But let me &#x2013; recall that it was part and parcel of the Group's practices and it must remain part of the instruments available to the Group that is a cash dynamic, cash payout policy and the use of share buybacks at the appropriate time. For time being, as I say, we have no agreed share buyback program, but nothing is ruled out for the future.</p>
          <p>There are times when I would say the balance lends towards more generous payout of cash to our shareholders either in the form of a dividend or share buybacks here. We're combining the maintenance to that policy with an eye to bolstering a financial situation that is sound and that we want to see as very sound.</p>
          <p>On your last point, amongst the transactions, G&#xE9;rard said a few words. We plan to gradually reduce ourselves in the &#x2013; presence in the inter-communal distribution operations in Belgium. That's one of the key points that's perhaps likely to affect the scope, in answer to your question. So the Group was strongly invested with the Belgium communes in all the gas and power distribution networks in Belgium, and our intention is to gradually reduce our presence in the capital structure of these inter-communal.</p>
          <p>As to the rest, we continue to optimize our scope with a few disposals that G&#xE9;rard mentioned. There will be others. We'll tell you about those in due course. But there will be no upheaval, no major disruption in the Group scope. There will be some optimization at the fringes, the whole covering &#x20AC;10 billion over three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> from Credit Suisse. I have two questions. Firstly, you gave us your view of nuclear prices for long term in the France. I want to know what the real &#x2013; what would the real change be in your strategy if these prices differed, if things move towards the 42 figure that we saw in the press? Would you change strategy? What would you change in the medium term, if you couldn't obtain that entry point that is a more favorable one?</p>
          <p>Second question, payout, just to come back to point you're just making. In reality, what is the payout that's sustainable in a Group such as yours due to your purchasing and future gas uncertainty and CapEx. Longer term view, what would the range for payout be that you think will be sustainable in your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on your first point, let me just recall the following. Currently there is no NOME law, so we're having to live with the situation. We don't yet have EDF selling at historical cost price competitive fashion. So we're having to continue &#x2013; we have to deal with it, we cope with that today. What we are expecting is that through the NOME law with the regulated access price that will provide for genuine competition, then long last we would be able to see much more significant penetration to the private household market for electricity.</p>
          <p>And we would also once again see industrialists in the market, we would get customers back that were previously last due to TaRTAM, when the electricity market opened up about 10 years ago now. It opened up gradually starting with the biggest players. Gradually we took a major part of the share of what were called eligibles at the time, up to 7% or 8% of the industrials, large consumers that were eligible at that time. We were selling them basically at market price.</p>
          <p>Then when the TaRTAM was brought into law in 2006, which is a tariff, it's a very special tariff, only given through EDF. What happened? Well, all the clients we were selling at market price, they could &#x2013; through this new law they were then able to give us up and shift over to the TaRTAM tariff, which is around 42 as a matter of fact. So we lost those customers. And we lost and we would resell our electricity in the free market. The electricity that we were no longer directly supplying to these customers was then being sold to other suppliers. So we sold in the market and lost those customers. We hope through the NOME law that, first of all, we get those industrial customers back, that's the first thing, by being able to access competitive nuclear.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you another solution for the government would have been, all European governments have done this. They could have &#x2013; this government could have made the incumbent supplier sell capacity. In Belgium, this was done. We've sold capacities such as nuclear capacity to both EDF and E.ON. But the French government didn't opt for that. They wanted EDF to keep all this capacity, but in exchange they sell at a price that's in line with their cost, this electricity up to 25% of nuclear. So we are applying for this to be able to use this new arrangement mandated by Brussels. And the French parliament is going to enact this in legislation.</p>
          <p>So the second component is B2C, so the retail marketplace. We very much intend to be offering our customers particularly 11 &#x2013; 10 million, 11 million gas customers, we'd like to give them electricity offers as well that are very much competitive with the blue rate, so &#x20AC;35 is the proposal.</p>
          <p>But remember, today EDF is selling its electricity at &#x20AC;35 to the French, some of you; &#x20AC;35, which is to say, that's the blue tariff. Now, if instead of selling at &#x20AC;35 directly to consumers, if EDF were to sell at the same price to its competitors, Valeo, DirectEnergy and us, they wouldn't be losing any money, &#x20AC;35, and we know they're making money. Their cost price is below that, their cost price is about &#x20AC;31.</p>
          <p>So to answer your question, we're expecting an upside. We think there will be an upside. The current situation, there is no NOME law, it's not enforced. We are coping with that. We're expecting an upside, so there'll be no downside, an upside with market openness. Everywhere else in Europe the market is open. It's not in France. It should become so. It should become open henceforth.</p>
          <p>On to your second question, I don't know. Would you like to? Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would. I think the Group's financial model has both growth and profitability. Growth, you see this in EBITDA, up 8%, up 15% gross margin, so financing cash flow and we are continuing with substantial CapEx, profitability for shareholders. We announced a dividend, which is up, and we very much intend to continue with that policy. Currently, the dividend is a payout of 71%. We announced medium-term earnings next three years. Net income up and I said to you that we've built a very sound, strong balance sheet. So the Group can very much continue to grow, see its businesses grow and maintain a generous policy with the payout on the order of 70% to 80%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I am from Kepler. Several questions. Firstly, what are the risks in your supply &#x2013; gas supply activities and E&amp;P in the light of tensions in the Middle East, Libya I will imagine is under control, but I'm really targeting if there were extension to Algeria, what would the risks be for your supply of gas?</p>
          <p>Second question, to come back more specifically to your view of the gas marketplace. You were saying in Qatar liquefaction facilities will be coming on stream by end of April. According to what I've seen, there are some problems in terms of liquefaction capacity, because next projects will be for in terms in Australia and should be commissioned as between 2012-2013. So with your scenarios, strong growth in gas demand boosted by Asia, don't you think there is a risk then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Possibly our gas prices might spike before 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question, the Acea deal, when we'll see the contribution of this, how will it depend &#x2013; in your financials and what about your 10% stake, will you be recategorizing that at SUEZ Environment or removing it entirely from your group? Then two last questions somewhat similar &#x2013; in similar vein. Your view of competition in Latin America and Brazil, so I want to know contract mix in your international division, currently you've 60% contracted and 40% merchant. Is that a good target for the medium term, or would you rather target an increase in contracted? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're clearly a specialist. Regarding events in the Middle East and North Africa, maybe I could give you a little bit of information. &#x20AC;1.5 billion in committed capital in the region at most, at most 3.5% of our EBITDA, and that covers everything. So as you can see, it's not essential to our activity today if there were to be some dramatic events there.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, when it comes to Gas Supply, some of these are major countries for this group. Egypt and Yemen, in those two countries we have contracts, and of course obviously there is Algeria as well. It's difficult to say what would happen. What we do see at any rate, and the two countries I mentioned earlier, Egypt and Yemen, they've experienced difficult events and yet at no time did LNG export activities halt, or were in any way slowed. So that's the case today.</p>
          <p>Will we see gas prices spike, maybe with reduction in the LNG bubble in Europe? Probably at some point, because we have always said is that, yes, there is excess capacity in Europe, mainly because a lot of LNG &#x2013; and 2010 was no exception to this, because we continued in 2010 importing lots of LNG into Europe. But at the same time, it's very difficult to predict the future clearly.</p>
          <p>What we do certainly know is that, well, Libyan gas is no longer coming to Europe, that was a main break in supply for Europe and that didn't change any prices out in the market. So all-in-all, in the medium term the LNG bubble will disappear. We don't know exactly the pace for this, but in the meantime there is a major Australian project, the new El Dorado for LNG so to speak. That's something for the future. And at that point we should once again see gas and oil prices coming closer together.</p>
          <p>Would you like to answer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The two other points, you asked two other questions, Acea, let me remind you we completed an agreement with Acea targeting a sharing &#x2013; separation of sharing of assets. There is a slight balance payment, but it's fairly low. So it's a positive impact, you right to mention this, but the impact nonetheless won't be gigantic on the Group's financial statements, not a gigantic impact. The closing continues and it should take place within next few weeks or months. We are always patient.</p>
          <p>Next point. The Group's stake in Acea, remember it's two times 5%, 5% held directly by Electrabel, 5% held by SUEZ Environment. Now since SUEZ Environment is to continue its collaboration with Acea in water and since we are completely separating in the area of energy, we are not going to keep the 5% stake for ever. Everything else though remains an open question.</p>
          <p>Now competition in Latin America, it's not competition as such because in developing our business internationally, we have always opted for a significant proportion of activities covered by PPAs, power purchase agreements or power/water purchase agreements, like in the Middle East. That way we can make secure revenue streams often for very long periods, often recover the whole time it takes to depreciate the facility, 20 years for water desalination in the Middle East or Thailand or for electrical facilities, often 30 years for major dams in Brazil would be the amortization period.</p>
          <p>We like to have a significant portion covered, 60/40 was the proportion given, that's a good one, because some times we have to combine that absolute security with the possibility of some flexibility to move on a market opportunity. That's to some extent what happened last year in Brazil, because of some stress at some point. Market prices went up and we were able to &#x2013; Electrabel's Energy subsidiary was able to benefit from that situation to use some of the free portion of energy and value at a higher price than things that were under contract already.</p>
          <p>So that's the underlying Group philosophy, that is to have a base, a foundation including in emerging countries that makes for a firm footing, visibility, sustainability, but at the same time we want to set aside a little bit of flexibility, keep some freedom for maneuver, so that we can move on market opportunities as they arise.</p>
          <p>Is there a future question?</p>

          <p>My name is <mark type="inaudible" />. Two questions, just to confirm I've understood in this supply for gas your message for 2011 is clear, EBITDA down, but will remain positive, so the range is wide between zero and &#x20AC;500 million EBITDA 2012 when you start crafting scenarios. You mentioned 100 terawatt hours open assuming the &#x2013; an assumption of five and six terawatt hours of negative spread. So we'll have an EBITDA, all other things being equal, at best at zero and at worst at &#x20AC;1.5 billion negative. Is my reading right?</p>
          <p>And mid term last year you released for 2011 on ranges for the full Global Gas division E&amp;P growing contribution because of values for midstream, are you perhaps prepared to discuss your average contributions on a cycle or a normalized spread for the mid term?</p>
          <p>So that's the first part of my questions, and then a big leap to Asia now for my second question, which &#x2013; through all your presentations and those of your peers, which is a promising growth market, no doubt the company, the best established amongst your European peers in Asia. Could you connect the dots between your various assets; the assets on your affiliates, International Power SUEZ Environment projects and liquefaction? What are the areas essentially the business segment, secondly the geographies, that you view as most promising towards which you plan to shift your CapEx? Five years down the road when you speak of the EDFSUEZ in a &#x2013; GDF SUEZ in Asia, I mean how would you describe your presence and perhaps quantify it in EBITDA terms?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm going to turn to Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois for the first part of your question on gas.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there might have been a slight miss &#x2013; what you said was right on 2011, zero, &#x20AC;600 million, don't challenge that. That's the range on supply in total EBITDA 2011 up over the two &#x2013; that's 800 EP last year, but 1,350 EBITDA, so that's a conceptually as it were to compensate what would be lesser revenues in supply in 2011 versus 2010 for the next year. 100 terawatt hours, the spread is around &#x20AC;600 million that you mentioned, but you mustn't remove them from the zero base this year. Well, we're reopening as it were, we revert to &#x20AC;600 million and then we see what we can do to bring that down. So you mustn't have two increments down.</p>
          <p>We come back to a situation that's &#x20AC;600 million and then we see what we can gain. So 2012 without wishing to go too far here might &#x2013; it might, I mean, this is a very long way ahead. It could be of the same order as 2011. But not negative today. We can't conceive of a situation in which the supply activities would lose money. Make less but not lose money. Have to be a spread that opens up hugely that there is no possibility for renegotiation, factors that today are not on the agenda, so it's rather difficult to provide, to predict normalized spreads. There in lies the difficulty in supply given trading, arbitrage, optimization, varying international and varying gas prices between region, very difficult to give a precise prediction of the out years for gas price.</p>
          <p>In spite of your wishes, I think you'll have to remain in some uncertainties that doesn't please us, as long as you don't call it the black box. I mean if you call it the black box, it's more bothersome. But we see what we can do and we've given some quite specific color on the ranges, on the limits of the exercise. But once again bear in mind for 2011 that there should be a moderate growth.</p>

          <p>We're running short of time, so I'll answer your question and it will be the last for this session unfortunately.</p>
          <p>Phil Cox, if he wishes might give some color to the few words I said in introduction. I'll say in introduction. For us, the emerging market, the emerging world is not just Asia. It's Latin America, which today accounts for more than Asia in our balance, in our capital employed. It's also the Middle East that accounts for less. And Asia &#x2013; in Asia, we are &#x2013; we've been present for a long time in Asia, but always very selectively for over 20 years in water, in China through SUEZ Environment, but we don't &#x2013; we still don't wish to be there in the field of power generation, because we don't have enough visibility on the system of regulation.</p>
          <p>However, in other parts of Asia, be it in Thailand, where we're the leading private producer, be it Singapore, where with our partners, we're the leading power producer with positions that International Power brings to the Group, very strong, bolstering us in Thailand, providing us with positions in Indonesia. That's very, very strong in a country that is hugely powerful. It's the number one country behind the BRIC in terms of growth and GDP.</p>
          <p>So we really want to look closely at these countries. Also Australia is a country in which SUEZ Environment is very present. I mentioned that earlier where International Power is very present and through power generation, where we weren't present with a leading position, we wish to expand also in LNG.</p>
          <p>We've acquired with the Santos partner reserves in Northwestern Australia offshore, and we're looking at a possibility of having those exploited by large offshore liquefaction platform to service the Asia market. I indicated that we've signed two keynote contracts for supplying LNG to South Korea and to China, so there is a shift in the center of gravity towards Asia-Pacific in some of our activities. Notably, the international gas and LNG business, but it's too soon at this stage to quantify those changes. We have a historic presence that will allow us to be very selective. We don't want to be present everywhere in all our business.</p>
