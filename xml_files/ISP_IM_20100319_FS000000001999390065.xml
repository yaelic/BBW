        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our 2009 results. 2009 has been the bottom of the crisis, and despite that we have maintained our profitability quarter-after-quarter, this is only to say that we're very satisfied with these results, also because we are the only bank in Europe to have gone through the crisis without increasing the number of shares, while keeping low leverage. This is a point I wanted to make at the beginning because it's probably a unique case in the continent. We have decided, since a long time, to build a commercial bank, low-risk, relatively simple, solid and very careful to take care of all the components of sustainable profitability, but I will come back on this point.</p>
          <p>We have had a number of shocks, but the margins we had in mind, the targets we had in mind have been met. We have not, I want to make it very clear since the beginning, we have not used leverage to flatter our revenues. We have, as always, focused on fundamentals such as industrial revenues and cost. Especially on costs, all our targets have been clearly beaten.</p>
          <p>Liquidity. Liquidity's a very important piece of our strategy. We believe that liquidity is and will remain a key factor for success for a long period to come, and we have accumulated reserves in order to be able to face any kind of scenarios that might happen in the next month and years.</p>
          <p>Capital ratios, we are implementing a number of capital management operations. You know that very well. All the planned deals are underway, and as you also know, in case regulators ask for more, we have reserves to use. For all these reasons, we have decided to propose to pay a dividend to our shareholders after the one-year break we had last year.</p>
          <p>One last point before we go through the presentation because the market conditions in 2009 have been very difficult, and they came during the hardest part of our merger. And I really want to thank my people, the people of Intesa Sanpaolo, that have never been intimidated by the difficulties and also all our shareholders who have supported us also in the most challenging situation we had to go through.</p>
          <p>So let's move to the presentation. Page Four. Page Four, the summary of the results. The main message is that our performance has proved sound even at the bottom of the cycle, and 2009 is, in our opinion, the bottom of the cycle. Net income in the fourth quarter of the year has reached 543 million. The net income for the whole year has reached 2.8 billion. Even if we adjust this figure for the main non-recurring items, we have 2.6. On the basis of this result, we proposed a dividend in around one billion; that means $0.08 per share, and we will elaborate on it.</p>
          <p>Core Tier 1. Core Tier 1, from an accounting point of view, is at 7.1. The pro forma, as we will see, is higher because a number of deals have already been completed during the period, but 7.6 is the pro forma figure we already have in our pockets. Cost of credit, in line with what we expected and I will have a number of things to tell you on this point.</p>
          <p>Page Five, the dividends, $0.8 for ordinary shares and $0.091 for savings shares. Those two figures get to a yield of 2.7% for ordinary shares and 4.1 on savings shares.</p>
          <p>Page Six is a page that has been one of the first pages in all our presentations also in the last year. And we are very much convinced that in a period like this one, a bank like ours should stick to the rules of sustainable profitability. That means very strong attention to operating margins, and that means very strong attention to industrial revenues on the one side and structural cost on the other side, but at the same time, at the same level of importance, we are defending the risk profile that has to remain low, the strong liquidity position, both the short and long term, solidity in leverage. And according to all these axes, we are delivering what we promised.</p>
          <p>In the rest of the page, there is a line on CDS that where we are amongst the cheapest in Europe and about our ratings that have been confirmed.</p>
          <p>Page Seven, to confirm what I said before, sustainable profitability in the sense that no leverage effects, no inflated revenues in any respect. These are non-volatile kind of revenues, and despite the continued fall in market yields, and so they fall, a very bad fall in markdowns, all our core revenues are showing quite a good resilience. Another effect that has affected negatively our revenues is the elimination of overdraft charges, but despite that and despite the costs that we decided to accept in terms of excess liquidity, if I can use this word, revenues are in line with what we could have expected in a year like this one.</p>
          <p>Certainly we have pushed a little bit stronger on the cost side, and we could find the way to do it, we could find the way to anticipate some of the restructuring, some of the cost, some of the structural reduction of costs. 2009 is the third year in a row where we have a very clear minus sign on our accounts, minus 1.1 in 2007, minus 3.3 in 2008, minus 4% in 2009. And that is a bit in excess of what we expected for 2009. The synergies, you know, were due to be higher than we initially planned on the occasion of the business plan, and actually we reached these results.</p>
          <p>If we look at the bottom part of the page, we planned to reduce staff in the fourth quarter of 2009, and that was done as agreed, almost 2,000 people. And one point that might be material for next year's result, integration charges will go down significantly, something in around of 55 million, the figure we expect for 2009, it was more than 200 &#x2013; in 2010 while it was more than 200 in 2009.</p>
          <p>Page Nine, liquidity. Liquidity remains a priority, will remain a priority. We strongly believe short-term liquidity and long-term funding will remain a key factor for success for some years.</p>
          <p>We think that Basel 3, as far as the liquidity requirements, will probably end up with proposals that are very close to what people are discussing today and so we decided to be in line with the requirements since now. That's why we have &#x2013; you know, the four components of our liquidity policy are that the balance between direct customer deposits and loan to customers and this, more than balance, is confirmed. The interbank position, that remains very well-balanced. At the same time, we accumulated quite an amount of eligible assets with central banks; that's the left hand side in the bottom of the page.</p>
          <p>And last year, we decided to speed up the funding operations also in excess of what was needed for the year. We thought that the market were particularly interesting for a bank like ours, and so we placed in around of 44 billion vis-&#xE0;-vis funding needs of only 35 billion; that means nine billion in excess of what was needed. In the first two months, we have accumulated six billion more, so 15 billion for the 2010 needs have already been achieved.</p>
          <p>Obviously, this very rigid liquidity policy and matching policy, also on the long term as a cost, but again we believe that regulations will move in this direction and the very high uncertainty on the market will reward those banks who follow policies like ours.</p>
          <p>Page 10, capital ratios. First line is the capital ratios you find on our accounts at the end of the year. Second column, the disposals/acquisitions underway that we can consider already inside the pro forma figures, and if we look at the third column, pro forma capital ratios, we have 7.6 Core Tier 1, 8.9 Tier 1 and 12.3 total capital. The management actions we have already planned for the short term will add in around of 50 basis points to this figure.</p>
          <p>Then we will see what the new rules require. If regulators will ask for higher ratios, we have a reserve in around of 100 basis points. Actually, I hope they will not because I do believe that a bank like ours would be more than comfortable with Core Tier 1 in around of eight and Tier 1 in around of nine. These figures do not take into account the benefits that will come from the agreement we signed with Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole, and that provides for a sale of 150 or 200 branches to that bank. Since we're still discussing the price and the price would be obviously a market price, so that sale will bring a positive benefit on our ratios, but that effect is not yet embedded in the figures.</p>
          <p>Page 11. Page 11 is the leverage position. Since a long time, we are the strongest in Europe as far as the ratio between tangible net shareholders equity and tangible total assets. I think that this is another important piece of our policy, and we will keep to these rules also in the future. Risk profile. Risk profile comes from a number of things. It comes from our decision to be big, but not too big; to be diversified, but not too diversified; to have a certain number of businesses, but not too many.</p>
          <p>If we look at the portfolio of businesses on Page 12, you'll see the usual breakdown. We are a commercial bank mostly concentrated in our country, but not only in our country, but in a limited number of other countries, too. On the main market, that's the Italian market, we have a strong competitive position in all the main activities. But the figures you have on the right-hand side show that we have potential for further growth.</p>
          <p>Page 13. Risk profile obviously has to do with the cost of credit. Cost of credit in 2009 has proved to be in around of what we expected. We said in around of 100 basis points, and 99 obviously is in line with that.</p>
          <p>If you look at the figures, we will see that &#x2013; and you look at the blue part of the picture, in Q4 the trend has been consistent with what we expected. And as you know, we expected that Q2 would remain the peak of the year and the year will remain the peak of the crisis, but let's look at 2009. The figures of the fourth quarter 2009 are in line with our expectations, and those two little figures on the right-hand side, 0.9 and 0.4, are figures that, from an accounting point of view, are included in the new non-performing loans, but the 0.9 comes from an accounting change. Maybe I will elaborate more. It's on the past due especially mortgages that do not represent a real risk in our portfolio, and the 0.4 is really a purely accounting figure because it's a position where we have only 26 million worth of risk, but since we are the leading bank in that syndicated position, we have to account almost 500 million worth of risk. So that part can really be taken off from the total figure.</p>
          <p>One other point has to do with the second line of the page. We wrote very clearly that the extra coverage we have on our doubtful loans that now is in around of 124% is the main reason why repayments from doubtful loans, that is what we get from the closing of those position is structurally higher than what we had on the net book value. That means that we get more than what we have at net level on our accounts when we closed doubtful loan position.</p>
          <p>One point that is very important, I'll come back also in this point, is the reserve on non-performing loans. We have almost 2.5 billion accrued in that reserve, and it is a stable position even if the loan reduction of the portfolio, so the coverage of the performing loans has increased during the year.</p>
          <p>Another perspective to look at the risk profile of the bank is at Page 14, is our presence in Central Eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean area. It's an important part of our activity, but in terms of risk, it's certainly something that does not add to the overall risk profile of the group. Only 7.4% of our customer loans are in this part of the world, and there is no country that accounts for more than 2% of the total portfolio.</p>
          <p>This is a very precise choice on our side. We don't want to have any country in a position to create troubles whatever happens. Actually all the four countries where activity is mainly concentrated, Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, and Egypt, are performing according to our expectations.</p>
          <p>Page 15 provides other figures on our presence in the 11 countries where we have banks, retail banks.</p>
          <p>Page 16, only a few words on 2010. We expect some improvement in terms of operating income both on the net interest income side and also on the net fee and commission, but I will give you some more detail in the next pages.</p>
          <p>We are working on further decreasing operating cost despite the fact that the decrease in 2009 has been higher than what we originally targeted. Cost of credit will go down slightly but in the right direction, and the pipelines of the different non-performing loans are in line with this forecast of ours. For all these reasons, recurring profitability will move up, integration charges, as I said before, will go down markedly. As you know, we have a number of capital management actions under finalization, and for the combination of all these elements, we expect net income for the year to exceed 2009.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the details of 2009. Maybe we can just skip 18 and move to Page 19; 19 is a summary of our balance sheet. Loan to customers, average volumes plus 1% and average volumes of direct deposits 8.6% up.</p>
          <p>As far as indirect customer deposits, an interesting trend in assets under management. I will elaborate on it because the right trend is taking the right pace in this area, and the assets under administration, these are 200 billion that are concentrated mostly in our retail and private customer base will be a source of significant future growth of revenues.</p>
          <p>Page 20, the summary of the net income in 2009. Revenues resilient despite the market situation. We're a commercial bank, and so we pay the cost of the monetary policy that is taking place throughout the world. Interest rates that are very close to zero obviously affect a bank like ours in a very strong way. But we are ready to restart with the results as soon as market yields get back to normal levels.</p>
          <p>Cost very much down for the third year in a row, the 4% minus, and then operating margin up 0.4% also in the worst possible year. After that, the provisions and the adjustments, the combination of all these effects bring the income before tax at 4.3 billion. That means 28% higher than last year, and after paying taxes and all the other merger-related costs, we have 2.8 billion as net income. That is almost a 10% increase on last year.</p>
          <p>If we look at the last quarter of the year, the normal, usual and expected seasonal effects, but if you look at the three yellow clouds on the right-hand side, you see that operating income of the fourth quarter 2009 is almost 10% higher than same quarter last year. If you look at costs, they are almost 5% lower than the same quarter last year, and if you look at operating margin, it is more than 40% higher than the operating margin at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Line-by-line now, Page 22, interest income. The market yields, the Euribor has gone to zero, as we all know. This was the way to save a lot of banks throughout the world, but obviously these market yields have compressed markdowns almost to zero, and that's why we are suffering a bit in terms of total interest income.</p>
          <p>If you look on the right-hand side, from 4.35 to 0.93, actually the decrease was much, much lower than market yields might have created. And that comes from a number of reactions on our side, hedging on the one side, defense of spreads and volumes, and I will give you the figures about those management actions.</p>
          <p>Page 23 is exactly on the analysis of net interest income in the last quarter and in the whole year 2009. If we look at the last quarter 2009, you'll see that from an operating point of view, we lost 83 million because of the unavoidable spread further reduction. The hedging facilities we have in place have partially, but only partially obviously, compensated for this decrease.</p>
          <p>One figure I would like you to look at very clearly is on the right-hand side is the spread effect of the decrease of market yields. The automatic decrease in our interest income, because of the decrease in market yields in the last 12 months, has been almost &#x20AC;2.5 billion. This is at least the money we want to get back as soon as the market yields get back to normal levels.</p>
          <p>We have compensated part of this decrease through volumes, the 175 you have on the same part of the page, and we have compensated a good part of the decrease with the hedging facility we established a couple of years ago that had growth almost 1.5 billion worth of positive effect on our account.</p>
          <p>Page 24. Page 24 is the page on the net fee and commission. For several quarters until the end of last year, this figure has kept falling down. Since Q1 2009, this element of our P&amp;L has steadily increased quarter after quarter, and we expect this line of the P&amp;L to contribute significantly to the increase of revenues we expect for 2010, 2011 and 2012. This has to be mainly related to the actions we are taking in the area of asset management, and the area for growth is very, very significant.</p>
          <p>On this point, we have also Page 25 where we have a clear trend in terms of net flows of assets under management. This has been a negative figure for quarters and quarters until the beginning of this year. And in the last three quarters, the figure has been positive. This is positive also for insurance products and the combination of incomes coming from asset management products and from insurance products is on the right-hand side, top part of the page, you see that the trend is very clear in one direction.</p>
          <p>It's not only a matter of volumes, it's a matter of mix of mutual funds. We have a mix that is very much skewed toward bond and monitory funds, and that has been a very good thing for our customers. But now there is room for moving this mix toward a more equity-connected kind of funds. And that's one of the direction we will try to move our portfolio and the portfolio of our customers.</p>
          <p>Page 26, trading profits. Trading profits has been a positive contributor to our results for the whole year. The trend has been the one on the left-hand side. Q2 and Q3 have benefited also from some non-recurrent item, but we expect a very positive contribution also for next year. And if you're interested, we can discuss a little bit more on the possible targets we have in mind.</p>
          <p>Page 27, these trading profits are analyzed more in detail because it's important to look at the evidence that the very large majority of these trading profits come from activities very strongly related with the customer's activity. The so-called proprietary trading is only the second part of the page, the last two lines of this page, and if you see in 2009 prop trading has accounted for about only 1% of our total revenues.</p>
          <p>Insurance business. We have been working in this area, and the trend is a positive one. We had to postpone the consolidation of the four companies because you might remember that in the last several months, unfortunately, we had a number of discussions with Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole. And the antitrust authority that slowed, blocked actually, our file on the insurance consolidation project we have in mind. We now are in the position to restart, and we have already restarted this project that'll be implemented during 2010.</p>
          <p>Page 29, costs. Cost is an area of proudness for this bank. We have been consistently increasing efficiency in our bank, and we have invested in the last years a lot of money to make the company leaner and more efficient. There is room for more. We have in mind a number of actions and a number of projects. We are actually implementing a very pervasive project that is called Banca Simp, which that means a simple bank because we believe there are very large areas of improvement in terms of simplification in the procedure, in the organization, in the products, in the way the bank works. But having said that, 4% reduction and after two years of other reductions is well in line, a bit higher, than what we targeted for the whole year.</p>
          <p>Page 30, cost of credit. As I said at the beginning, we are in line with what we expected in terms of cost of credit. 99 basis points is what we had in our budget, and we are in line with what we expected. We believe that next year will not be very far from there, but we are on the decreasing side. And let's look at detail in order to understand why we expect 2009 to be the peak in terms of new flows and in terms of cost of that credit.</p>
          <p>Page 31 is the total gross non-performing loans and total net non-performing loans. The yellow cloud is only to say that we had to add, in the last quarter of the year, the mortgage overdues in more than 90 days; that was a change in the Latane accounting rules. But that's an area where we don't expect any real problem from a P&amp;L point of view. In the trend of substandard, you have to keep in mind what I mentioned before, that the first note on the page, the first dot on the page, the 427 million loan that has been included despite the fact that our risk is only 25 million, but that is an accounting rule we had to follow.</p>
          <p>Page 32 says, again, that our doubtful loans are very well-covered and that is the reason why we have repayments from doubtful loans that are structurally much higher than their net book value. On the right-hand side, you have the exact figures on the reserves on performing loans. It's an extra reserve; we have increased the weight of this reserve on our performing loan portfolio that is now 72 basis points.</p>
          <p>Page 33 are the details of non-performing loans and loans per business unit. I will not elaborate on it. Let's spend a few words on the new flows.</p>
          <p>Page 34, on the left-hand side, new substandard loan gross flow. If you look at the last three quarters, and you get to the fourth quarter 2009, you have 3.5. If you take away the almost 500 million I mentioned before that do not represent in any respect a risk for us, you get to three billion. And that is a good evidence of what we expected; that is a clear trend in reduction of new substandard loan flows.</p>
          <p>Obviously in the year 2010, we will have to get the effect of the increasing substandard we had in 2009, but that is totally part of our forecast and that's why we believe that the cost of that credit in 2010 will be lower, maybe not that lower, but certainly lower than 2009.</p>
          <p>Page 35 is another set of figures on the breakdown and the diversification of our loan portfolio. The largest slice of the pie is residential mortgages, and this portfolio is particularly well-managed both in terms of installment on available income that is lower than 40%, but even better than that, the average loan to value is in around of 50%. In terms of industries, the portfolio, the total portfolio is very much diversified, subdivided into the different segments, and that's more or less what we already saw together in the previous presentations.</p>
          <p>Country exposure, we thought that you might be interested in having the detail of our exposure both in terms of loans and in terms of securities and derivatives in the different countries. Most of our exposure is in the G7 countries, but you have all the details here in this page.</p>
          <p>Page 37 is the table with the summary of the divisional results. If you agree, I will not go through them now, but I'm obviously very much ready to do it if someone is interested.</p>
          <p>Let me close this first part of the presentation by saying that we see a very significant potential for growth in revenues as soon as market yields are back, and also we see quite a potential coming and being built through the exercise we're making on asset management products. Based on the large reserve of assets under administration, we can switch in that direction.</p>
          <p>The decision we have taken to pay a dividend wants to be the expression of our confidence in the future. The business plan we are working on is very solid and is partially already being implemented. Given the uncertainty, both in terms of economic scenario and regulation, we will decide together with the new board that will soon be elected when, and in what occasion, to make it public to the market.</p>
          <p>I'm now ready to answer to any question of yours. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon everyone. A few quick questions. The first one is on net interest income where you're giving a guidance of defending the current level. I was just wondering whether you can give us your assumptions in terms of lending volumes, spread, hedging in place and interest rates? The second question is on the commissions, indeed a very good performance in the fourth quarter results. Just wondering how sustainable it is, and where do you see the business in the first quarter? And finally on the operating cost, we've seen a very positive trend both from you and a couple of days ago from UniCredito, much better than what we were expecting. So I'm just wondering whether, in 2010, you can sustain the same level or we are likely to see a decrease in operating costs in the region of what I estimate to be around two, 3%? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is about net interest income. I will simply repeat more or less what I said before. We believe that in 2010, the main task is to defend and we will defend our spreads. Volumes certainly cannot move faster than the economy as a whole, and what we have fully operational is the hedging facility that will provide, more or less, even a little bit more effect on our accounts.</p>
          <p>Commissions will move in the same direction. The only point you have to take into account is that in the last quarter of 2009, we enjoyed some performance fees that obviously can be achieved only once a year and that is in around of 60 million, but the commitment of the retail network to switch from assets under administration to assets under management is very high. As far as operational cost, we will elaborate this point much more in detail on the occasion of the business plan presentation. We want to have a minus sign for sure, but we will give the detail only on that occasion.</p>

          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Last quarter, you mentioned that you were starting to see the signs of maybe a pickup in loan demand from the businesses in your initial meetings with companies. So far not a lot of macro data has pointed to that direction, but I wonder whether you have an update on that? And then the second question will be, I feel in the next few quarters we're going to see a number of assets available on the market. Clearly over the last couple of quarters, you have done some very good deals at very good prices. At the same time, over the next two quarters, most likely especially from the banks that does Tremonti Bonds, we'll have to see some disposals. So I wonder what's your strategy going to be there in case any branches or business units become available? And then my last question would be I see that your loan book in Central and Eastern Europe essentially is stable or even somewhat shrinking over last quarter. Do you expect this to be an agent of growth in any way over 2010? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>As far as loan demand is concerned, the behaviors of the different kind of companies is becoming even more evident than before. We see a number of strong, especially mid-sized corporations, that are benefiting and that are exploiting the present situation and that are accelerating investments and acquisitions. And that's why, also in the figures I showed you before, the mid and large corporate are increasing in terms of loan volumes with us. We are much more prudent with SMEs and micro companies where obviously we are very available to support the very many strong ones, but there are also a number of companies in this region that cannot afford more credit and actually the credit demand from very small companies is still very low.</p>
          <p>Second question, asset available on the market. We have already taken the opportunity to buy branches in the Tuscany region when Monte Paschi decided to sell some of them. There are a few regions where we want to be stronger and where we are targeting groups of branches. So the answer to your question is yes, if the branches or small local banks are available in regions where we are not yet the size that the market share we want to be, we look at them very seriously.</p>
          <p>Growth of lending activity, in general, in Central/Eastern Europe will be a bit higher than in Italy in 2010. So it will be in the mid-size, one single digit area as we used to say. These are the answers.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I have four quick question, if I may. The first one is a Core Tier 1 ratio, your target of total after all the operation you are planning is lower than you were mentioning in Q3 by 50 basis points. I would have, just try to understand how is it possible?</p>
          <p>The second, could you give me some more flavor on the capital gain that are already planned for 2010? I'm not speaking of Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole operations, but all the other that are already announced?</p>
          <p>The third one is the Basel 3 future requirements regarding the deduction of your insurance affiliates' equity. Is it changing something in your plan because insurance is quite big for you? And the last one is just a question regarding the coverage of your non-performing loans? When you are mentioning a coverage of 67, are you including the generic provision, too? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course you want to know what we are proposing today is in-line with what we said on the last time we discussed our results. The figures that have been described a few minutes ago embed already the dividend policy. The dividends that we have in mind, while on that occasion, you mentioned dividend was at zero. So probably you are referring to that point.</p>
          <p>Capital gain 2010; obviously, we cannot say anything about Fideuram. We made a very clear press release on the Security Services. And if I remember correctly, the capital gain is 750 million. And that's about it for the things that have already been announced.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we don't have yet the figure on the sale of this branches to Credit Agricole. Basel 3 and the effect on insurance. Obviously, we will have to see what at the end regulators will decide. It would be strange if they force all banks to divest from banking holdings, but who knows. We believe that our results and the results of the insurance company itself will allow us to keep this important shareholdings of our. In case that is against our capital ratios policy, obviously we will have to divest partially or totally from that industry.</p>
          <p>One point that we have to take into consideration is that whatever Basel 3 is, they will have to decide in how many years banks will have to comply with the requirement. And on a number of occasions, the number of years has been mentioned to be so high that decisions coming from Basel 2 will certainly not be very rapid.</p>
          <p>The coverage on the doubtful loans does not include the generic reserve. Generic reserve is only on performing loans. And doubtful loans have their specific provisions in around of 65, 70%. On top of that we have collateral; we have guarantees. And the total coverage of doubtful loans is in around of 125%. Excluding again, I want to stress it, the generic reserve.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. I would like to ask for your views in terms of medium-term returns or medium-term improvement in returns. As you said at the beginning of the presentation, the defensive risk profile of the Bank has been quite positive and you haven't had to issue shares. And that has been good. But as I think I asked you a couple of conference calls ago, the flipside of that is a low level of returns, both in terms of revenues from risk-weighted assets and return on risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>In fact I was looking at your numbers. You're currently generating a return on risk-weighted assets of 0.8%, which is clearly bottom quartile in the sector. And you are generating a revenue on risk-weighted assets of 4.4%, which is also clearly bottom quartile. Even if we adjust for the pressure on the markdown &#x2013; and I give you the benefit of the one billion of net interest income that you haven't recovered with a hedge, the return on risk-weighted assets would be one, and the revenue on risk-weighted assets would be below five, which is still a clearly below the average and still bottom quartile. So congratulations on your defensive profile. But going forward, when are we going to see returns that are comparable to the average of the industry? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you said is very right in terms of the defensive profile we have given our bank. What we are committed to is to provide return on equity that is very competitive given the low risk we want to give to our shareholders. And that will be the main point that we will discuss on the occasion of the new business plan. But the ROE we have in mind that we have already achieved in the past and that is already embedded in the consensus going around is something that from an investor point of view, given the kind of selling proposition we provide to investor is very positive. But let me just postpone this discussion to the presentation of the business plan.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. The first question is on the trading income. We saw that in this quarter was relatively poor, and this was clearly expected. Particularly the line has suffered the most is the capital market and financial asset line with only 30 million. I just was wondering if you can quantify the possible effect of the markdown on government debt on Securities on our Alpha-traded Securities, which will be clearly non-recurrent in the next few quarters?</p>
          <p>The other point I wanted to make is we saw some pressure on net interest margins. This again was to be expected. But the one thing is that if you want differentiate you from a number of Italian banks or European banks is that you maintain a positive strong interbank position. And this is clearly a cost in terms of the margins that you can &#x2013; that you can have. So I'm not clear why &#x2013; in a way you want to keep on your defensive profile. I know that we are still in a difficult situation. But is it possible that you give us an idea of the potential interest on margin improvement if you wanted to normalize your interbank position in-line with some of your competitors?</p>
          <p>And finally, I connect to the question that was &#x2013; you answered a few minutes ago. On your returns, I think that your returns, first of all, are actually higher than your domestic competitors at this moment in time. And it seems to me that you haven't lost much in terms of assets during this crisis, if none at all. In pre-crisis, you didn't have the full benefit of the integration of Intesa Sanpaolo. So it seems to me that going forward, you should have a relatively good return on equity given your defensive profile. I don't know if you can also comment on this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will start with this last comment of yours. I do agree, the kind of ROE can provide even the kind of bank we are and given the potential we have is and will be quite interesting as it has been in &#x2013; also in recent times with normal market yields. One point that you very wisely reminded is the full benefit of the integration. 2009 was the last year of the restructuring, integration, harmonization, migration, internal migration, our information systems. And for sure a good part of the management attention has been devoted to non-commercial activities.</p>
          <p>From 2010, the Banca dei Territori model is functioning and operational. And from this year, we'll certainly benefit more from all the investments we have done. I agree also on what you said in terms of returns and asset defense, let's say. As far as the pressure on non-interest income, I must tell you that theoretically, you are right. We could be less prudent, but we want to see what happens. And we will keep at least for some more months the four liquidity policies I mentioned at the beginning of the presentation. Interbank position will probably remain balanced. The balance between customer deposit and customer loans will remain more or less in any case below one. And we will keep a lot of eligible assets in case of need.</p>
          <p>Certainly, the cost of having the long-term activity matched in terms of funding is costing us a few hundred million euros per year. But given the uncertainty on the one side and given the potential effect of Basel 3 because if Basel 3 is approved the way it is today, the request of long-term funds on the market will be enormous. And we don't want to find ourself in a position to discontinue or interrupt or reduce support to our customers. So for some more months for sure, and probably for the whole year, we will pay some &#x2013; these economies or some cost. But we believe that these cost are more than balanced by the kind of strength and soundness of the overall Group.</p>
          <p>The first question about trading income, the answer is really zero. There is no debt effect. So there is no risk of having figures reduced because of reduction of that kind of activity because we are practically not involved in them.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thank you very much. Sorry. On &#x2013; just on this last answer, I was just trying to figure out or to understand what could be the sustainable trading profit on a quarterly basis. And it seems to me that the last quarter is somehow affected by some trading one-offs or markdowns, but maybe I'm wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, if your answer is this one, I will try to give you my personal opinion. Obviously it's very, very difficult to make forecast for this activity. But if you take the average quarterly contribution of 2009, so you average the two high quarters and the two lower ones. You get to a figure that is not far from what I expect to be a sustainable figure.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes through from the line of Domenico Santoro of Exane BNP. Your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon to everybody. It's Santoro from Exane BNP. Just three very quick questions. The first one is on provision. You said before that your coverage is actually above 100%. So when you close the position, you'll recover more than what's probably in the provision. I was just wondering if you could give &#x2013; if you could tell us if you had significant recoveries in Q4, and what was the gross provisioning policy in the quarter?</p>
          <p>The second is on fees because you said before that you expect significant growth also in 2010 and probably the level of Q4 excluding the &#x20AC;60 million performance fees as a solid starting point for the next quarter.</p>
          <p>The question is we know that the Italian Banking Association is actually discussing possible revision of the interbanking fees, you know RIBA, RIDA. I was wondering how much it is a contribution of this kind of fees to the total?</p>
          <p>And then a question, which is probably a bit tougher, is on the hedging policy. This is a question that many investors need to have, so this is why I'm asking you. The hedging has contributed for &#x20AC;1.4 billion this year. If I am not wrong, you said in the last conference that the hedging is going to work until the beginning of 2011.</p>
          <p>So with all other things being equal, it is reasonable to expect a &#x20AC;400 million per quarter? And I know that is difficult to predict rate because you know the macro scenario changes so rapidly. But I'm just wondering in the case the interest rates are going to be flatter for longer than one year; this already happened in the past. You know that we were waiting for interest rate hike, and then it happen. And you lose the contribution of this hedging policy.</p>
          <p>Do you have already mind any actions? And maybe you can share with us, actions that you can implement of course and might replicate the same contribution of the NII to the hedging, which is going to be probably difficult considering the level of rates? I know this is a difficult question. But if you have some thoughts and if you can share with us, would be welcome? Thank you. Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will try to answer all your questions. Okay. As far as provisions for 2010, I confirm that we expect them to be below the 99 basis points of this year. In Q4, we didn't have any special write-backs or recoveries. We always have in around of 250, &#x20AC;300 million that has been more or less the cruising speed during the year.</p>
          <p>As far as the fees growth, yes, we expect in the following quarters, not &#x2013; depending very much on the mood of the people toward stock exchange and share-related investments and increase in asset management-related fees. The impact of interbanking fees that are being discussed will be negligible as far as we expect &#x2013; as far as we understand today. So we don't expect anything material for a bank like ours.</p>
          <p>As far as the hedging, 2010 is completely covered. And so if interest rates &#x2013; market deals remain at the level they are today, the impact or the effect of the hedging facility will be more or less the one we had in 2009; maybe a little bit higher. In 2011, if interest rate remain at the level they are today, but actually we do not expect it to happen. But if they remain at the level they are today, we are &#x2013; about half of that effect can be expected on the basis of the hedging facilities we have in place.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we will react. And we have already started reacting. We will do our best in terms of revenues and spreads. But if by any chance the interest rates, the market yields remain at the level they are today &#x2013; but again it's not expected &#x2013; we cannot expect to have an effect like the hedging we have in 2010 also for 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So can you &#x2013; sorry, just a follow-up. Thank you for your answers. Can you confirm the &#x2013; can you tell us what is the actual expiry of this hedging policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Good afternoon. Good afternoon to everybody. I have a couple of question. The first one is on trading assets. They declined by roughly eight billions in December versus September. I am wondering what is the reason behind this? And if &#x2013; and eventually if this is going to continue over the next few quarters?</p>
          <p>And the second question I have is on Russia. I see in 2008 and in 2009, you charged around 6% of the loan book through the P&amp;L. Some other European banks such as KBC or LTP charged in the region of 11% summing up the two years. I am wondering whether the loan book &#x2013; the risk profile to loan book in Russia of Intesa is very different from the one of the other competitors? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as trading assets, we made very clear that we wanted to reduce further the prop trading-related trading assets, and that's what we did. And we will probably remain at the level we were at the end of the year. But it's a policy that can change in accordance with the trend in the markets.</p>
          <p>As far as Russia, we believe that our provision policy has been very prudent, given the very small and the very well known &#x2013; and given for the quality of the portfolio we have in that country. So yes, I must infer that the characteristics or the features of the portfolios are very different.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I just have one question left. If I look at the data for the sector, I see that the banking market in Italy is very differentiated between Retail and Corporate at this point. The Retail is growing in volumes, and actually the non-performing ratio is quite stable. Corporate seems to be still softening with negative loan growth and also deteriorating asset quality. Do you think Retail will remain resilient? And when do you expect Corporate to start improving? Or do you think this is something where it will be repeated for a few more quarters? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm afraid I will disappoint you because we have our mid and large Corporate portfolio growing, and the level of risk remaining very low. While Retail in general, both Individuals and Small Business, is certainly not growing, and the level of risk is as expected, higher than the rest of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>So we expect in 2010 weak companies to become weaker and the strong companies to become stronger. That's why we have been quite careful in the last few years to concentrate our efforts on those companies that add the qualities and the shoulders, as we say in Italian, to go through the crisis. But if I were you, I would not underestimate the risk content of a lot of Retail and Small Business portfolios.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just a few question on the Corporate and Investment Banking division. Looking at your net interest income, if I compare the full-year results with the nine months, it seems that Q4 has been particularly weak, around 400 million. So 25% of the average of the previous quarter. I wonder if there was any reclassification of asset of clients' moves somewhere else? Or otherwise, what has been the key driver for the weak performance?</p>
          <p>Secondly, going forward, if there will be an increase in market rates and such improvement in the cost type. Is this going to benefit the Corporate Investment division, or is going to just be a trend in the Retail division? And then still on this division, I noticed a significant drop in customer funds, around 15 billion versus previous quarter. Again, unless there is no reclassification as this liquidity has been withdrawn by Corporate clients from the Bank who redirected to other products? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I understood your questions, and I'm not sure we are talking about the same figures. But in any case, I will try to answer on the basis of what I know about the Corporate and Investment Banking division. For sure the net interest income has decreased because volumes have decreased. Also because a number of companies have moved from normal lending facilities to the issue of Corporate bonds. But that is one of the reason.</p>
          <p>The other figures you are mentioning are probably related to the fact that the Security Service business that was part and is part of the Corporate Investment Banking division has been moved to another line because it's being sold to states straight, as you know. So you might refer to the decrease and then a reclassification as you were mentioning that has taken place is &#x2013; be taken place because of the Security Service disposal.</p>

          <p>No. It's mostly concentrated in the Banca dei Territori in the Retail division where the impact will be almost automatic, while very rapidly the effect on the Corporate customers will be absorbed.</p>

          <p>Hi, and good afternoon. I also have just a few questions. Going back to discuss your loan growth. I know you've just said Retail, you are concerned, especially I believe about Small Business. The risk profile still being high there. What about Mortgages? I can see some more banks pushing mortgages quite aggressively; the spreads have gone up. Do you think that the product is now becoming more attractive, or you're also staying away from mortgagings at this stage and why?</p>
          <p>Second question is again little bit on regulation. You've obviously done a lot work on liquidity. Clearly, you have very health &#x2013; healthy capital ratio also looking forward. Are there other areas of regulation at the moment to concern you, especially given what has been projected in Basel 3? Do you see any changes to the business structure that you have that you might have to implement in addition? I'm thinking about the Insurance business, for example?</p>
          <p>Third question on provisions. Clearly, it's still hard with the macro economy to give an exact view here. But how do you see your through-the-cycle provisioning sort of changing? And how do you see provisions eventually for the &#x2013; which level do you think they may be settling more in 2011, 2012?</p>
          <p>And then one very quick question. I see on the headlines that Fideuram Vita has been sold out of Eurizon into 80% at group level; 20% into Fideuram. Can you explain why the structure of that transaction, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, loan growth. We expect all segments to start growing again, and Mortgages will be an interesting area of growth. I would suggest to almost anybody with today's rates to make a mortgage and buy a piece of real estate. So yes, the answer to your question is we will do our best to push in this area.</p>
          <p>Loan growth will happen in all the segments of our customer base, not only in the Banca dei Territori, but also in the mid and large Corporate.</p>
          <p>Regulation. I think that Basel 3 is more than enough to be worried about. And I hope the impact study regulators will perform in 2010 will show that the kinds of proposals that have been discussed in the last few months have to be very much corrected. Where I do not expect them to be very much corrected is in the liquidity area; that actually is the most relevant area to avoid a future crisis. That's why we have decided to comply to the worst-possible scenario in terms of regulation already from now.</p>
          <p>As far as provision, we expect 2010 go down not that much, but 2011 and 2012 to go significantly down. We will not reach, obviously, by 2012 the pre-crisis levels, but we are talking about a very significant drop in cost of bad credit by 2012.</p>
          <p>Fideuram is an area where we cannot because of Consob Regulation make any kind of comment. So even the operation we announced this morning through an official press release is the only thing we can say about the Fideuram Vita connections with Fideuram. So we will be very clear on all these details as soon as we can provide all the market with all the information. Sorry.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's just clear. Thank you. Just one small follow-up on &#x2013; not so much just on regulation but thinking about the business in general. What sort of thoughts have you had with regard to your Insurance business now that you are in the process of buying back Intesa Vita as well and re-merging all the units? Do you think this is a business that is likely to remain within the Group or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe very much in the strength of that project. I believe that we can create a top player in the market. We will proceed with the project. Obviously, we cannot go against the gravity law if regulations will be too heavy for us. So the day regulation forces ask to divest, we will do it. But I do not expect that day to come. And for the time being, the project will be pursued with all the necessary determination.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have three questions. The first one is regarding re-pricing. If I look at other Italian banks, which already reported results, it seems to me that at least in terms of trend, for the first time after many quarters there has been a slight &#x2013; very mild improvement in terms of marginality for the net interest income. I know that it takes more than a quarter in order to have such a trend to be confirmed. But it seems that there has been some positive sign. And I think that this has been &#x2013; can be explained by the re-pricing process. So my question is, how is evolving re-pricing for Intesa? Have you been able in the last quarter of 2009 to further push re-pricing? Or you think that what was able to achieve has already been achieved?</p>
          <p>Second question is just for &#x2013; probably, and you already been clear; it wasn't to me. So did you drive for &#x2013; or at least, let's say you gave an indication for a cruising speed for trading income in the region of 250, 300 million per quarter for 2010?</p>
          <p>Third question is about Findomestic, is for the remaining 25% stake that would be sold by 2013. I've seen that in the last quarter, you already book a positive amount relating to this second tranche of Findomestic to be sold. So my question is, is there still some potential capital benefits from Findomestic or has already been 100% taken? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as re-pricing, in some cases, you are probably referring to of other players with some better marginality, as you were saying. I believe that part of that effect comes from leverage operations, not from normal lending activities. As far as normal banking lending activities, there is always, obviously, room for improvement. And we have underway an exercise to identify all the areas of insufficient EVA per customer. But we believe that pricing, if you choose to work with the companies that are good enough to go through the crisis; that are with the right level of ratings cannot be pushed more than to a certain level.</p>
          <p>So I don't see actually a lot of room for further re-pricing on the customer base, even if there is any. And in the comparison, you must always remember that we decided not to engage in any kind of leverage activities or carry trade kind of things. And that can make a difference with others.</p>
          <p>Second question; you also gave the answer to your questions. As far as Findomestic, yes. There is room for further capital gain. We could account only for the minimum we get from the final disposal. But the value of that stake is related to a formula that might bring up to almost 300 million more in terms of capital gain.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much to all of you. I think that 2009 was a year in-line with what we expected, what we worked for. I think that the fact we could deliver what we promised has given us the confidence to propose a dividend; that has to be the rule. And will be the rule also in the future. We will decide as soon as the new board is elected when is the right moment for presenting to all of you the very solid and strong business plan we are working on. Thank you again to all of you.</p>
