      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter of 2010, our diversified portfolio of assets across Latin America delivered solid top and bottom line results, continuing to prove the strength of our defensive business profile. The strong brand equity of our portfolio of products with its wide array of packaging alternatives we offer to our consumers and our continuing innovation in <mark type="inaudible" /> were the main drivers for our solid performance during the quarter.</p>
          <p>As I referenced in our last conference call, we mentioned details regarding the devaluation in Venezuela of the local currency and the analysis we were going through. We have decided to use the exchange rate of 4.30 bolivars per US dollar, from 2.15 bolivars per US dollar that we used last year to translate the financial statements from our Venezuelan subsidiary to our reporting currency, the Mexican peso.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, our consolidated revenues reached MXN23.6 billion, up 5% from the first quarter of 2009, despite the effect of the negative exchange rate translation derived mainly from the devaluation of the bolivar in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>On a currency neutral basis and excluding the acquisition of Brisa in Colombia, our total revenues grew approximately 19%, driven by increased prices and volumes. In the first quarter, our consolidated sales volume rose 6.3%. Excluding Brisa, our consolidated sales volume increased more than 4%. This increase was driven mainly by the strong performance of brand Coca-Cola, growing 6% and the still beverage category growing more than 18% across our franchise territories.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated gross profit increased close to 3% in the first quarter of 2010. Cost of goods sold increased mainly due to higher cost of sweeteners across our operations, which was partially compensated by the appreciation of our main operations, local currency as applied to our US dollar denominated raw material costs. Consequently, our gross margin declined 100 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated operating income improved more than 6% to MXN3.5 billion in the first quarter, supported by double-digit operating income growth recorded in our Latincentro and Mercosur divisions. Operating leverage achieved through higher revenues compensated for gross margin pressures. As a result, our operating margin improved by 20 basis points to 14.9%. On a currency neutral basis and excluding the acquisition of Brisa in Colombia, our consolidated income grew approximately 20%.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated EBITDA increased close to 5% to MXN4.5 billion in the first quarter. Our net controlling interest income reached MXN2.1 billion. This mainly resulted from a more favorable, comprehensive financial results recorded during the quarter combined with higher operating income.</p>
          <p>Now, let me expand on our operations. In the first quarter of 2010, bad weather conditions in Mexico and our consumers' lower disposable income mainly due to higher taxes and increased cost of services led to a slow start of the year for our Mexican operations. However, the solid recovery of our volumes in March compensated for the quarter's slow beginning.</p>
          <p>Overall, our Mexico divisions delivered favorable volume for the quarter, 3% volume growth of brand Coca-Cola, mainly multi-serve and returnable presentations, combined with the growth of the still beverage category generated by the innovation in the Jugos del Valle platform were offset by declining volumes in our water portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our average price per unit case increased 2.6% during the quarter. This increase was driven mainly by higher volumes of brand Coca-Cola and selected price increases that we have implemented in our portfolio over the past six months. As a result of these factors, our Mexican operation's total revenue increased 2%, reaching MXN8.3 billion.</p>
          <p>On the profitability front, higher sweetener costs were partially offset by the appreciation of the Mexican peso as applied to our US dollar denominated raw material costs. Our gross profit declined almost 2% to MXN4 billion compared with the first quarter of 2009. Our gross margin in Mexico declined 190 basis points, reaching 48.2%.</p>
          <p>Our operating income declined 17% to MXN1.1 billion. Operating expenses almost in line with inflation were driven mainly by this &#x2013; support of our growing the still beverage platform as well as the resources deployed in the value of Mexico to enhance our execution at the point of sale, bolster our returnable base and improve our cooler coverage.</p>
          <p>Our operating margin decreased 300 basis points to 13.4% mainly as a result of gross margin pressure. Our EBITDA declined 11% to MXN1.6 billion compared to the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter of 2010, international sugar prices started to decline significantly. However, we expect to face short-term cost pressures from this raw material in our Mexican operations. Over the second half of the year, a more stable sugar cost environment, our ability to extract sugar and more favorable exchange rate of the Mexican pesos applied to our US dollar denominated raw material costs should help us to mitigate this cost pressure.</p>
          <p>In summary, after a difficult start to the year, our Mexican operations showed significant improvement in March. All of the tools that we used last year to weather the difficult economic environment remain in place, the increase of <mark type="inaudible" /> and the innovations that arise from our acquisition will continue to provide our consumers with an attractive multi-category beverage offering and help us to outperform our industry.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to our Latincentro division. Our Latincentro division posted more than 15% volume growth in the first quarter. This increase was driven by the integration of Brisa bottled water business in Colombia, double-digit volume growth in brand Coca-Cola in Colombia and Central America, and the strong performance of the still beverage portfolio in Colombia and Central America. Excluding Brisa, the division volume grew more than 6%.</p>
          <p>In Colombia, we reported strong volume growth of more than 32% in the first quarter. This increase was driven by the integration of Brisa and double-digit volume growth in our sparkling and still beverage categories. Excluding Brisa, our Colombian operations volume grew close to 7%.</p>
          <p>In Venezuela, our volume increased 2% driven by increased volumes of the sparkling beverage and our water portfolio. And in our Central American operations, we recorded sales volume growth of 12% compared with the first quarter of 2009. This increase was driven by double-digit growth across all of our beverages categories.</p>
          <p>Our Latincentro division's total revenues declined 8% to MXN7.4 billion. This decline resulted from a negative currency translation effect, mainly due to the devaluation of the bolivar in Venezuela. On a currency neutral basis and excluding the acquisition of Brisa, our Latincentro division's total revenue grew 36%, driven by higher volumes and higher average price per unit case across all of our operations.</p>
          <p>On the profitability front, our Latincentro division's gross profit declined 8% to MXN3.4 billion, again, as a result of the negative currency translation because of the devaluation in bolivar in Venezuela. Consistent with the industry, we faced higher sweetener cost across the division. This cost was partially offset by the effect of the appreciation of the Colombian peso as applied to our US dollar denominated raw material cost. Our gross margin reached 45.8%, an expansion of 20 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Our operating income grew almost 18% to MXN1.2 billion. In local currency, higher operating expenses were driven mainly by continued marketing investments to support our growing still beverage category in Colombia and Central America, the integration of Brisa water bought in Colombia and higher labor costs in Venezuelan.</p>
          <p>Operating margin expanded 370 basis points to 16.7% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Our EBITDA grew 14% to MXN1.6 billion compared with the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of this year, our Latincentro division delivered strong results despite the devaluation of the bolivar in Venezuela. In local currency, all of our operations reported solid top line growth.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our performance continued to demonstrate the brand equity and the continued strength of our sparkling beverage portfolio, which achieved double-digit growth in Colombia and Central America despite the increased pricing initiatives designed to compensate for local inflation and higher sweetener costs.</p>
          <p>Over the past year, we have reinforced our returnable base of the sparkling beverages, at the same time developed a broader portfolio approach through innovations we have made in the still beverage categories, offering our consumers more alternatives at different price points. Additionally, through the acquisition of Brisa, we have reinforced our position in the water segment.</p>
          <p>Now, let's talk about our Mercosur division. In the first quarter of 2010, our Mercosur division total revenues grew 25% to MXN7.9 billion. Excluding beer, which accounted for MXN763 million, our total revenues reached MXN7.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Organic growth, driven by higher average price per unit case and increased volumes, represented approximately 70% of our incremental revenues. The effect of a positive currency translation resulting from the appreciation &#x2013; from the depreciation of Mexican peso against the Brazilian real provided the balance.</p>
          <p>Volume growth in our Mercosur division was up 10.5% in the first quarter. Our Brazilian operation reported more than 14% volume growth driven mainly by brand Coca-Cola in multi-serve presentations and the continued strong performance of Jugos del Valle line of beverages.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, our volumes grew 2% mainly due to the strong performance of our still beverage category, which compensated for a low-single digit decline in the sparkling beverages. This performance represents a significant improvement as compared to last quarter.</p>
          <p>On the profitability front, our Mercosur division's gross profit increased 24% to MXN3.3 billion, increased cost of sweeteners across the division were partially compensated by the important appreciation of the Brazilian real as applied to our US dollar denominated raw material cost.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin decreased 40 basis points to 42.1% for the first quarter. Our operating income grew 27% to MXN1.2 billion. Operating leverage achieved through higher revenues resulted in a 30 basis point operating margin expansion to 14.9% in the first quarter. On a currency neutral basis, our Mercosur division operating income grew 17% and EBITDA grew more than 19% to MXN1.4 million.</p>
          <p>During this first quarter, our Mercosur division delivered positive results in Brazil. Our portfolio of products grew importantly in every category, supported by the wide array of alternatives that we offer to our consumers. It is important to highlight that brand Coca-Cola also grew significantly, driven mainly by our two liter returnable presentations and reinforced by our introduction of new packages such as the 250 milliliter can and <mark type="inaudible" /> presentations.</p>
          <p>These alternatives represent a compelling market offering for our consumer. Going forward, we anticipate an important opportunity to leverage our returnable base in Brazil when we continue to capitalize on our innovation capabilities. Additionally, as we noted in our last conference call, the still beverage category is gaining traction supported by the integration of Jugos del Valle line of products in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Now, let me talk briefly about our financial performance for the quarter. This quarter, our operations outside of Mexico produced strong results, driven mainly by our Brazilian and Colombian franchise territories. These engines of growth help us to compensate for our Mexico's division's low start to the year. This underscores the value of our company's diversified sources of cash flow as well as its strong operating and financial position.</p>
          <p>As of March 31 of this year, we had a cash balance of MXN14.7 billion, an increase of MXN4.7 billion compared with year-end 2009. This increase was driven mainly by additional funds we obtained through the issuance of our new debt and cash generated during the quarter. Our total debt increased MXN3.2 billion compared with year-end 2009. This increase was driven mainly by the issuance of the Yankee Bond in the amount of $500 million and the repayment of our Certificado Burs&#xE1;til Mexican Peso bond in the amount of MXN2 billion both during February of 2010.</p>
          <p>As a result of the abovementioned practice, our net debt decreased by MXN1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. As of March 31, our net debt to EBITDA from the operation was 0.2 times and our EBITDA to net interest coverage ratio was close to 15 times, highlighting our financial flexibility and balance sheet strength.</p>
          <p>Using part of the proceeds of our Yankee Bond issuance, on April 16, 2010, we fully paid the maturity of our Certificado Burs&#xE1;til in the amount of MXN1 billion, reducing our debt position. This would be reflected in our balance sheet in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>As you might already know, on April 14, Coca-Cola FEMSA held its Annual Ordinary Shareholders Meeting, in which our shareholders approved a cash dividend in the amount of approximately MXN2.6 billion to be paid as of April 26. This dividend is almost double the amount that we paid to our shareholders last year.</p>
          <p>Additionally, on the same day, following the Annual Ordinary Shareholders Meeting, our shareholders also held an Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting in which they approved amendments to Coca-Cola FEMSA's bylaws to reflect changes to the shareholders' agreement between subsidiaries of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries of FEMSA.</p>
          <p>The main purpose of the amendment is to establish that only a simple majority vote of the Board of Directors is required for the appointment and compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and all of the officers reporting to the Chief Executive Officer. And also the adoption of decisions related to the ordinary operations of Coca-Cola FEMSA. Decisions related to extraordinary matters such as business acquisitions or combinations, among others, shall continue to require the positive vote of the majority of the Board of Directors along with the vote of two of the members appointed by The Coca-Cola Company.</p>
          <p>2010 represents another opportunity for our company to demonstrate the operating and financial capabilities and to outperform our industry, despite the challenges that we might face. We have learned to capitalize on past experiences to achieve our goals. For everyone in our company, the value of learning is the foundation on which we would continue growing and focus to deliver solid results for our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your continued trust and support and now I would like to open the call for any questions that you might have.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from the line of Lauren Torres from HSBC. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. My question is about the market environment in Mexico. You talked about some poor weather starting off the year and then some improvements, but you also spoke about tougher -- consumer getting hit with higher taxes and higher cost of services. I was curious to hear about how those are impacting the consumer, if there's more of a &#x2013; more pressure as a result of that this year than what we've seen over the last several quarters and something more of a concern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Lauren. Mexico, as we explained and you summarized in this question, it's going through difficult times. January and February were pretty much affected by seasonally cold weather. We have checked with other consumer indices and it was pretty much the case where January and February were very slow. For us, March was a positive month compared to last year, both in terms of volume and in terms of profitability. However, we believe that the Mexican consumer is still experiencing a lot of pressure.</p>
          <p>My concern in Mexico is with respect to the pricing &#x2013; availability of the price potential that we have. We have planned since the end of last year to increase prices at a slow pace and little by little to compensate for this increase in taxes. Remember that the ad valorem tax in Mexico was increased from 15 to 16%. So such a small price increase is not necessarily possible in all presentations, I mean we have a product that is being sold at MXN10. You are not going to sell back to MXN10 pesos and $0.10. You have run both the figures to &#x2013; either to 50 or MXN11, for example. So we have planned to increase prices in a progressive manner during the year. We have done some of these price increases, especially in the last package presentations, the 250 milliliter and the 3 liter. But at the same time, our competitors have reduced prices. And just to give you an example, Pepsi-Cola announced a reduction of their three liter packets that we have from MXN16 to MXN14. Just as a reference, we just increased the price of the three liter from 21 to MXN22. So at the end of the day, we have more than a 50% premium over the same prices than Pepsi-Cola.</p>
          <p>So when you look at our numbers in Mexico, I'd say it's basically the effect of maintaining some of our operational expenses pretty much in line with inflation, but not been able to increase revenues at the same rate, both because of the effective volume that we have during January and February and because of the fact that this pricing power as we were, in a way, absorbing part of the price increases during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So I think that in general &#x2013; in summary, the environment continues to be tough. I think that we are very well positioned. As we have stressed in the past, with all the different packages that we have to address consumer needs at different price points. I think the fact that we have a very strong returnable base also help us in this. Again to accept the pricing environment that I was mentioning, our 2.5 returnable PET brand Coca-Cola is priced at MXN14 pesos. So it's similar to the Pepsi price and the cola price, but in a returnable package. But again, we continue to move our prices on, one way, packages and another is playing with a very large price tag.</p>
          <p>So I think that the consumer in Mexico is hurt by all these service and price increases. I think it's a tough environment to continue to increase prices, but we should be looking for these increases so that we compensate for some of the costs. And I think that the positive news out of all of this is that finally we are starting to see some movements on sugar prices at least on the international market that at some point in time in Mexico, we'll start to see some of these pressures to go off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just as a quick follow-up, you don't believe that you need to pull back on any pricing that there should be other ways of managing that with packages and whatnot? It's not that you may have to pull back on pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's correct. We don't believe that it's necessary to pull back on prices. And as I mentioned, we are actually increasing some of the prices on the large &#x2013; on the family presentation. I think that with the cost pressures that we have because of sugar, at some point in time the competitors will continue to increase prices and to follow-up. It's important also to highlight that we do believe that because of all the marketing activity that we have around the World Cup that we will benefit also from that. The consumer also is just forced to a larger budget on marketing and that will also help in our point of sale.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ford from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good day, everybody. H&#xE9;ctor, I was hoping you could comment a little bit more extensively on Venezuela in terms of the operating environment that you see there, your ability to access the preferred FX rate for some of your input costs. And then if you could just remind us how much this year and last year did Venezuela represented of the sales and the operating profitability, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bob. The Venezuela environment continues to be tough, as you might imagine. There is a lot of pressure on salaries and wages because obviously when you have, as we explained, as we anticipated during the fourth quarter conference call, when you have devaluation for currencies, usually you start having a lot of places some raw material costs, but also from wages and salaries.</p>
          <p>In terms of the &#x2013; access to the controlled exchange rate, we have been receiving some foreign exchange at the 2.60 exchange rate. But it's a very small amount and it was basically amount that were approved prior to the announcement of the devaluation of the bolivar. It's almost &#x2013; if I remember correctly, it was around $10 million for raw materials that we have. We have continued to work with this agency &#x2013; with our rating agency to continue to have access at this exchange rate. And some of these applications have been approved, but we have not received the money yet. So there is pressure on that. Part of the preoccupations or the worry that we have in Venezuela also has to do with the availability to some of the raw materials because it's only we have the currency to pay for that, but also the suppliers were able to import to some of these materials into the country. Sugar is important. We don't foresee any problem in the short-term but we are worried more over the second part because obviously, as you may know, Venezuela produces a lot of sugar, but not for the consumption of the country. And this issue with the electricity shortages is also a thing that we need to be on top of that very careful. We need to &#x2013; because of regulation we need to consume 20% less electricity than what we are consuming last year, we are installing some diesel generators in some of the plants. That has a little bit of advantage that diesel is quite inexpensive in Venezuela, so I don't foresee necessarily additional expenses related to that, but we have to do some investments in our production plants for that. So again, the environment is tough, and I'd like to see a little bit more flow of funds to really get a better picture of how the future is going to shape for us up in terms of access to dollar going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, then, H&#xE9;ctor, just sales and EBIT in both periods. And then I would expect that it's got to be even tougher for some of your competitors. I'm hearing that you basically are selling everything you can get on the shelf right now. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Revenues, Venezuela represents around 12% of this quarter's revenue on a consolidated basis. I didn't understand the second part of the question, Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was hoping to get revenues and EBIT in both periods, H&#xE9;ctor. And then I was under the impression that the environment is even more severe for your competitors. And I'm hearing that you basically are selling everything you can get to the shelf.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, the average is similar. It's around 11 or 12% of the consolidated EBIT. And you're right that in Venezuela the issue we have is we sell everything we produce. We are looking at alternatives in how to improve productivity in some of the plants. We have some plants that have very low productivity because of the agreement that we have with unions. We are investing in new production lines. We are investing on that, so that by the third quarter of this year, we have we will have some extra capacity because we see our volumes &#x2013; we are selling everything we produce in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>In the case of our competitors, we know that they have been prone to some difficult times in terms of the relationship with unions and closing of some of the facilities, some of the stuff that happened to us in the past when some of our plants were stopped on a few days. I think that's basically what I had to say in that respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wanted to ask a follow-up and then a separate question. If I understood the answer, you just said that Venezuela was 11 to 12% of your EBIT this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess that's what we thought it was in '09. So can you help us understand how your Venezuela contribution could be steady if you've gotten sort of 100% devaluation of the currency? What was Venezuela as a percentage of the EBIT in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say what is happening in Venezuela. In Venezuela, we have volume growth that is not only important, but especially we have been able to increase prices importantly. And even with 100% evaluation of the bolivar, our EBIT was very close to being flat. It was slightly below what we had last year on the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the implication is that the margins grew materially, big, big margin increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, Lore, because we were able to increase prices and move our mix to a mix of growth, but that's basically what is happening in Venezuela.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess, can you help us sort of stretch that and give us some perspective on 2010. It's not intuitive that you'd have a big devaluation and you would grow margins. So is this sort of a temporary factor because you've got a lot of pricing ahead of, I don't know, renegotiating with unions or do you expect to see, I don't know, this kind of trend persist?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that &#x2013; well, it's a little bit counterintuitive probably because of the cost of raw materials that we import. But in local currency, the implication is that the bolivars. You have volumes. You are selling everything you can, but still you have capacity constraints or volume doesn't even grow significantly. You have a lot of pricing because of obviously the effect of this devaluation and increases in sugar and increases in PET and things like that.</p>
          <p>And the expenses are pretty much flat. Salaries and all of that is flat and we are receiving some pressure, but we have not finalized the negotiations. So maybe first quarter is a little bit awkward because we haven't received a lot of the pressure on wages. But when we you look at the numbers for the first quarter in Venezuela, in local currency, it's very close to &#x2013; almost double the size in local currency to what it was last year. But once you translate that into pesos, EBIT is very close to being flat to slightly negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not something that we can &#x2013; I don't anticipate that this something that we can sustain once you start receiving a lot of the cost pressures that's related to that, especially dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But in terms of access to raw materials at the 2.6 rate, you mentioned that I think it was $10 million worth. Are you optimistic that you can renew raw materials at that rate or will you face more pressure in incoming quarters there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that &#x2013; I'm not very optimistic because the $10 million that we received were invoices that were prior to the devaluation of the bolivar. We have received approval to receive at 2.6 rate, but we have not received the dollars. So it a little bit &#x2013; it s a cumbersome process, but we have not received it. So until we get a little bit more light on that, I'm a little bit pessimistic that &#x2013; I'm not sure exactly at which exchange rate we're going to receive the currency for raw materials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the question I wanted to ask was just to understand a little bit about the perspective for how the change in the sugar cost dynamics is going to affect your results in coming quarters, and I know it's going to depend by market, but if you could comment, I don't know, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, how quickly you expect to see the lower world sugar prices be reflected in your cost structure? That would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you saw, Lore, international prices went up, very importantly, at the end of last year and maybe at the beginning of this first quarter. And the good news is that these prices are back to more reasonable levels. The bad news is that in some of the markets where we operate, it takes some time to adjust to those prices. If we go to Mexico, prices are very high still. And we are close to prices around $900 per ton, which is pretty much affected by the US price. The US price is also very high for sugar. It's higher than Mexico. It's close to $1000 per ton.</p>
          <p>So in Mexico, even though international prices are probably around the 500, $600 per ton presently, I don't see Mexico prices coming down as fast because, again, we knew the US prices to come down for Mexico to come down because of the small trade that is happening between the US and Mexico.</p>
          <p>In other markets like Brazil, the prices adjust basically immediately because they do follow very closely with international prices, given the fact that Brazil is a big exporter of sugar on a worldwide basis. So in Brazil, we're already with prices closer to the international prices. And remember that we have some cases there, around the 16, $0.165 per ton that are still working for us. So they are basically back to the levels where we have the prices, the hedged price.</p>
          <p>And for that we have &#x2013; basically we have covered half of our consumption for the next few months. So in Brazil I've seen a reduction of prices that will be reflected in the second quarter numbers and going forward. And then you have someone between these two extremes, which are the Colombian market and the Central American market where you have different regions that it would be adjusted little by little, somewhere between the Mexico and Brazil, that are the two extremes.</p>
          <p>I'm leaving outside Venezuela because of the situation in Venezuela. It's very complex. It's the highest price per ton of sugar that we have in our system. It's close to $1,100 per ton. But that has to do with capacity issues and all these currency crisis in foreign exchange that we see in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Alan Alanis from JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question has to do with the trends that we're seeing in different categories in Mexico? I know it's only a quarter, but I wonder if you could help me reconcile. We're seeing a big drop in bottled water, and acceleration and growth of the Coca Cola brands next to the multi-serve and the returnable bottles. Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm also seeing a deceleration, we're still having some growth, but some deceleration to beverage, particularly Jugo del Valle. So if you could give us some more color regarding why are we seeing these trends, particularly the drop in bottled water, that would be, I think, very very useful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the theories that I do not basically share personally is that water was affected at a higher proportion because of the value add. I don't necessarily buy into a lot of the comments that we are seeing, that not only are we seeing some of our competitors and what we say here at the Coca Cola company, and so it's not only Coca Cola. The main effect that you see in the big water, in the jug water, and also in the presentations were affected, especially January and February.  For me it's more a reflection of the competition trends. We are seeing very aggressive from brands in the marketplace with promotional activity, and promotions to the retailer, meaning they get for free a certain amount of bottles for every purchase of X amount of bottles. So I think that we have been losing a bit of share in water.</p>
          <p>On the other containers, to everyone's surprise is the fact that brand Coca Cola continues to grow, and is growing at a very interesting pace still, it's growing 3% as we said during the speech. And continues to outpace the growth of the sparkling category. We can forecast it, introduction of new packages, the fact that we will continue to foster returnability and investing behind that. And that will continue on cola.</p>
          <p>And in the juice category, in general that continues to grow, probably not at the same pace that we saw last year, because remember last year the high count is complete, in other words we weren't growing last year, but this year we are growing 6 or 7% over a very short comparison of growth.  And we think juices and nectars, what we see is that we continue to gain share, importantly.  And one of the trends that we see there is that as we continue to innovate and to launch new products like cranberry juices and that were not present before and by a fruit which has low juice content, but it's also within this category growing very importantly. You see some cannibalization of the traditional line of business, with what is called the red line. Because remember the packaging material for the traditional fruit juice and nectar were red. So the juices, 100% juices and nectars &#x2013; our growth rate is very slow and what is providing the growth in this category is all the innovation that we are bringing into the market place.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very useful. Thank you. If I may just ask very quickly, regarding your cash, it's a totally different question. You have almost Ps.15 billion there. It would be like 1.2 billion US. How much of your debt you can actually repay, H&#xE9;ctor, of the long-term debt and how should we think about the accumulation of cash that you will have going forward? If you could provide some comments please on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you are correct. We have this MXN15 billion. As I mentioned during the introductory comments, we paid in April 16, MXN1 billion. And next Monday, we are paying a big chunk of that as dividend on April 26. The idea that we have, Alan, is that we'll continue to pay some of the bank loans that we have. We have been very selective on the timing and the institutions that we're using, and some institutions don't want the credits to be repaid because it is an important business for them also.</p>
          <p>But the mandate that we have from the finance committee when we issued this Yankee Bond was basically to extend the life of our maturities and use basically the full $500 million to repay other credit lines that we have. So we are in that process and the idea is obviously not to have such a large cash balance and start reducing our debt.</p>
          <p>The big question is, when it's going to happen as we continue to generate cash going forward. We discussed briefly that last quarter over that. And obviously, our idea is that we see opportunities to continue growing by acquisitions, maybe not in the short-term, but obviously we need to have our cash balances in order for that. But we also have the flexibility to reduce our debt and then borrow money if we are confronted with an acquisition.</p>
          <p>And then obviously if more acquisitions are in the radar screen in the short-term to review our dividend policy again and maybe increase that dividend again for next year. But as of this moment, I prefer not to speculate right now if we are going to increase dividends or not. But what I can say is we have it quite clear that we are basically getting to a zero debt situation which is not efficient for the company. So it is important that we have a structure where we have debt in our balance sheet and obviously use that either for acquisitions or larger dividends if no acquisitions are approaching.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Antonio Gonzalez from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. My question is also on Mexico; in particular, on the profitability front. Clearly, part of the impact of profitability this quarter is related to sweetener costs. But just excluding that for a moment, could you help us understand how could SG&amp;A evolve in line with inflation for the remainder of the year?</p>
          <p>I wanted to understand &#x2013; first, what's your current coverage of coolers at the point of sale and if you're planning to expand that aggressively. Secondly, if there's any incremental expense you foresee in terms of a higher share of returnable bottles; and, lastly, to what extent can the potential increase in marketing related to the World Cup can impact this SG&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Antonio. I think that when you look at operating expenses on SG&amp;A, what you have here is that &#x2013; for example, this year, this already happened in most of the &#x2013; and speaking about Mexico, most of the salary compensation was increased by 4.5%, which is you know basically what you see around the industry in Mexico, which is close to inflation of last year, which you remember was close to 5%. So, it was 4.9% or something like that. So, you see in different areas, it increases between 4.5, sometimes 5% increases in the salaries.</p>
          <p>So, in general terms, you see the salaries flat with inflation. The problem we are facing this quarter is that, in addition &#x2013; there are several situations, but in addition to all these salaries increases, we have increases in the cost of gasoline and diesel for our trucks and electricity for our plants and our offices. And all these services that are provided by the government in Mexico saw big increases at the beginning of the year, that's one issue.</p>
          <p>The other issue is that we were not able to pass along, or to increases prices at the same rate that we are suffering these increasing costs and salaries. And a portion of that was that during the first quarter, we are absorbing basically one extra point of ad valorem tax, because we couldn't adjust as I mentioned the prices on a timely manner.</p>
          <p>But we have a plan to recuperate little by little these prices during the rest of the year. So when you have volume basically being close to flat and prices increasing in nominal terms around 2%, with mix and everything changing in our favor, but just 2% and you have most of your salaries and cost increases 5% and that's what happens. You have <mark type="inaudible" /> on the profitability.</p>
          <p>With respect to coolers, we have a lot of the initiatives, but it doesn't really have to go with progress. Progress, we have very good progress, we're already close to 80% progress in that respect. The initiatives have to do more with how do we improve the execution of the performance of that cooler in the point of sale.</p>
          <p>It has to do with larger coolers maybe, but we it not change the progress, it will change the investment because we have to change to a different cooler, and we rotate from this plan to start investing in a larger cooler and the coolers that a B-client has you translate that &#x2013; you send it to a smaller retailer. Remember that as we move in to a more, a larger number of SKUs, the space in the cooler gets complicated.</p>
          <p>So, there are a lot of initiatives on how to deal with multi-categories, and how to improve the performance of the cooler in the market place. At the same token, we can say that the cooler that we have right now consume less than 80% of the electricity, 80% less electricity than what they use to consume five six years ago. So we are also very consciously moving into a lot of sustainability issues. So that's the issue with coolers.</p>
          <p>Returnable bottles, we continue to invest behind that, the mix. I don't remember exactly where the mix is, but it's increasing versus what we have last year, basically by 1% just once, but we do have some investment behind returnable bottles.</p>
          <p>And with respect to the World Cup, we do have some investments behind that. It's something that we see every two years because of the Olympic Games and because of the World Cup, the World Cup being a little bit more serious in terms of the amount of resources that is invested behind that. Obviously, the negotiation process with the Coca Cola Company is always tough in that respect, and we actually invest in marketing as we see resource performing during the year, and we might adjust a new rate over the end of the year if the results are not there.</p>
          <p>But, the World Cup always brings some extra investment behind this. What we hope to see is that because of this investment in marketing with the World Cup as you would see a pickup in bigger presentations as peoples start growing more towards on-premise consumption, and that might help a little bit our margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And, finally, with respect to Jugos del Valle, this year are we seeing something significant in your P&amp;L already that's contributing already to EBIT for Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Right now, this year we have a, as you may remember that at the beginning of the year we were saying that most of this availability was going to remain with Jugos del Valle to continue investing in behind the production facilities. And Jugos del Valle, for this year, basically we are operating the joint venture among all the bottlers in the Coca-Cola company, basically with a very small profit over there, so that most of the margin starts &#x2013; reflect in the bottler.</p>
          <p>Still the profitability of juices and some of these drinks that we have been designing are at the low end of the margins that we would like to see. We'd like to improve those margins. Remember that juices have a very different cost structure because of the juice content and of the volatility that is embedded in our juice and some of these fruits.</p>
          <p>And we don't have the same margins that you have on a CSD or water, but we are improving that profitability little by little, and at some point in time, actually it would be a good contributor to profitability of our company.</p>
          <p>So in terms of pesos, we are adding pesos through the operating profit line. In terms of margins, as you include the revenue on a lower margin product, it's reducing a little bit our total margin for domestic operations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to everyone. Well, my question's a follow-up to what Alan was asking, about the hoarding of cash and what you're going to do with it. I understand that you're still looking at acquisitions. I guess, specifically, if you come to the next three or four months and all the acquisitions you're currently evaluating were to stop or to become cold again, would Coke FEMSA consider an October or November dividend like some of the other bottlers do or other companies in Mexico do, or would we have to wait until next year? And then just a second question on &#x2013; If you can just review our CapEx forecast with us, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Jose. First of all, on the acquisition and the dividend issue, I think that three or four months is a short period of time for us to refine acquisitions. We have mentioned the fact that we know that the <mark type="inaudible" /> operation was for sale, and then they stopped the process.</p>
          <p>I don't think that we would refine an acquisition in the next three or four months, and because of that I don't think that we don't have it in the radar screen to increase dividends at the end of this year. My perception is that it would be more next year during these dates; again during a normal shareholders meeting to take a decision on that.</p>
          <p>With respect to the CapEx, last year, we invested &#x2013; cash flow for CapEx was around $450 million. 2010, I think that we will increase that to $530 million as we are investing in some of these production lines. We have increased some of the capacity already on some of our operations. But part of the program to operate production capacity in all of our facilities, including what I mentioned installing a new production line in Venezuela. And we have plans for Brazil and Colombia and Mexico also. So, it takes the CapEx budget to I'll say around $530 million for 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then for 2011, we can just assume it goes back to the sort of near depreciation level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, like 2009 and 2010, we have this step up in the CapEx because of the four new production lines that were installed at the end of last year, some of them started production as late as March, and we have a lot of projects still under development.</p>
          <p>But, we basically install capacity for &#x2013; in these two years, we will install capacity for an additional 300 million unit cases in our system. We took advantage I think of the opportunity that during last year, some of the producers, manufacturers of these lines were in very hard conditions. So we negotiated very good prices in very good terms, and we placed a big order with the suppliers of equipment to help us improve our production capacities in this 2009/2010 period. So my expectation is that 2011 will go back to 400 million, 450 &#x2013; $400 million would be a good number for 2011.</p>

          <p>And next question comes from the line of Gustavo Oliveira from UBS, please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, a question is again back to Mexico. You comment a little bit on the cooler coverage and the executions at the point of sales. And my understanding then is that those are only some of the issues that you're dealing with in your new revenue-driven model that you're trying to implement in Mexico.</p>
          <p>The question then is, to what extent you think that the new model you're implementing is already supporting your volumes and profitability? And if it is, do you think that it's been a big contributor already to your volumes? And if it's not, what do you think that this means going forward? Does it mean that you essentially have to maintain a very high or even increase your operating expenses during the year to support your new implementations?</p>
          <p>And that's the first part of the questions. And the second question would be, in terms of the overall market conditions, if that is really one of the drivers of your weak volumes in Mexico, what are the signs that you are expecting to see to essentially try to position your portfolio a little bit more to the returnables to one-way presentations away from the returnables. And what are the signs that you could see that could make you a little bit more aggressive in the marketplace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, Gustavo. The new model that we have has already been implemented in some areas. We are deploying that little by little in geographic areas. It takes training of the work force and everything. And the idea is that we are trying to maximize the revenue potential from each of the clients. It hasn't yet been deployed to the majority of the area. So, I'd say that we haven't seen the effect of that yet in the volumes during this quarter.</p>
          <p>It's something that we will expect more towards &#x2013; I'm speaking about Mexico now towards the end of the year. That model has to do also with the expenses that are related to that model. There are some additional salaries, because you've got the positions in terms of supervisors and workers that have that kind of position that is a slightly richer salary than what we have. So, it brings some additional costs.</p>
          <p>What our expectation is that the volume that we will get and the cost to serve when you start to deliver products in a more efficient manner would more than compensate for those additional expenses.</p>
          <p>There will be some expenses related to all the software that we need to develop for that. And, this is also coinciding also with a big renovation of the SAP platform that will also bring some additional expenses, as we are more tied to this new version of SAP in all of our operations. But again, we are expecting that this additional volume and the lower cost to serve to these specific lines will help us more than mitigate these additional expenses.</p>
          <p>In terms of the aggressiveness in our mix and pricing in Mexico, I think that for us, the returnable platform that we have, have helped us a lot with the pricing formula that we have in the one-way packages. For us it will be impossible just to have three-liter presentations at MXN22, when Pepsi is at MXN14 with three -liter. If we don't have in certain geographic areas, the 2.5-liter returnable presentation at the same price at Pepsi, then we would have a lot of pressure in how to manage our one-way packages.</p>
          <p>The signal that you're probably referring to is when we see the consumer moving more towards one-way packages to see the increase in consumption in the 600 milliliter for example. That would be a signal that the consumer is again starting to spend a little more on these. And obviously, seeing our competitors to move the prices also &#x2013; it's very difficult when you have a price gap or a premium that is more than 50% versus a brand like Pepsi, on equal presentations, it's very difficult to continue moving prices.</p>
          <p>But again, I think that we have demonstrated in the past that we're always trying alternatives to either improve the mix of products or start selling another &#x2013; a new package that will bring us a little bit richer margin, or at some point in time, sustain these price gaps and live with that and continue growing our volumes because of the strength of our brand.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I see. If you sustain your price gaps, knowing that &#x2013; you mentioned that your competitors lowered it substantially, are you concerned with losing a little bit market share? Although you might be growing your volumes in absolute terms, you might be losing market share? Are you concerned, or you can live very comfortably with that as long as your profitability is okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our drive is obviously the profitability that we have, and we would sacrifice market share because of the profitability. But we also need to bear in mind that market share is important for the long-term sustainability of the product. So we like to find that balance. In the numbers that we have reviewed recently, we continue to maintain or slightly improve our market share in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So, even though we have this price gap with our competitors, we are not concerned with the market share right now, because it's sustained or improving &#x2013; even improving a little bit in some areas.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. I wondered if you could just give us an update on two initiatives, please. You talked about coolers before. But if we can talk about, specifically, the multi-category coolers, what the status is in terms of your rolling them out in any of your territories and what kind of initial indications you're getting in terms of benefits versus the cost of putting them into new locations.</p>
          <p>And then the second one would just simply be, can you give us an update and some color on the evolution of the Jugos del Valle portfolio in Brazil? And where does it stand now versus &#x2013; in your estimation, the complexity or the sophistication of the Mexican portfolio? Is it halfway there? Is it 10% of the way there, just so we can get an idea of what opportunities there might be in the months ahead in Brazil specifically? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Celso, good morning. These multi-category coolers, it's pretty much related to this new model that we are calling aggregator or working with values for our consumers, and this model of how we approach the market and try to capture the revenue from our consumers. We have started essentially, as I mentioned minutes ago; we have started to rollout that model in some territories.</p>
          <p>We basically did that in each of the individual <mark type="inaudible" /> area, and in one of the warehouses in the Valley of Mexico in <mark type="inaudible" /> areas. So in those two areas, we are advancing in this approach to the market that also takes together with that this new cooler that &#x2013; it's too early still to understand the impact of that and if we are more than compensating or not the additional expenses that are brought by the new model and the cooler that we should place in some of these plants.</p>
          <p>So, we need a little more time to really understand that. But it's being rolled out as we speak. And in terms of the coolers and value categories, the two main areas for development of initiatives of innovation, it's Mexico and Brazil. And we will continue to see a lot of ideas, obviously not all of them will be successful, and maybe not all of them will even get to the starting point and will be canceled before deployment of this product.</p>
          <p>But, I do see that innovation is a big force and the one of the big initiatives that Coca-Cola FEMSA is focusing on during this year. It would be very difficult for me to give you a percentage if we were halfway there or 10% there, but we see a lot of activity with innovation.</p>
          <p>And, as an example, this ValleFrut, or this orangeade that we launched a year and half ago, two years ago, it has been a tremendous success in terms of volumes.</p>
          <p>The number of unit cases that we're selling is huge. It's more than 30 million unit cases, close to 40 million unit cases, from a product that we didn't have in our radar screens before and was not present in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>So I hope that some of these new initiatives and innovation would bring about a lot of cases in the future and profitable cases. And obviously we are looking at every category; coffee drinks and milk-based drinks, and soya-based drinks and things like that. And again not all of them will be necessarily developed totally, but it creates a lot of enthusiasm once you see the amount of innovation that has been developed in this company.</p>
          <p>And that's true for Mexico and Brazil. When we are doing in some of the other countries and with a lot of success is in Colombia and Central America we are also deploying some of the products that have been successful in Brazil and Mexico and with a lot of success. We have a product that is a bit more concentrated than this orangeade and with different flavors.</p>
          <p>For the people that have visited Mexico before, it's very similar to Boing, which is a non-carbonated soft drink that has a lot of pulp, and that has been very very successfully in Columbia and Costa Rica. So, I think, Celso, that the area of innovation, and if you see on our annual report is one of the pillars of our business going forward and we continue to work a lot behind that.</p>
