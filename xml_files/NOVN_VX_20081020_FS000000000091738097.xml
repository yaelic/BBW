          <p>Thank you very much, John, and I would like to add that of course George Gunn is also with us. He is also filling in for Thomas Ebeling, who could not attend today because he had a emergency privately.</p>
          <p>With that, let me start with slide number one, which gives the overview on our results so far. What strikes is that Pharmaceuticals has really accelerated in growth and also profitability, while all businesses have contributed to our growth overall. Then, we will discuss the new structure we have on the group level and the nomination of several leaders.</p>
          <p>If we look at our strategic actions, of course first the business portfolio, the Alcon transaction is complete, the 25% are acquired; Speedel and Protez are being integrated. And on the R&amp;D side, we also made significant progress with a number of submissions which are being planned. Several large Phase III trials are underway and also some interesting compounds, as you know in Vaccines.</p>
          <p>Project Forward has gone even better than we anticipated. We are not only on plan but ahead of plan and the impact on the organizational behavior results are positive. There's a lot of simplification which went on and speed has accelerated; and so with all of that, we are on track for a year with record net sales and earnings.</p>
          <p>Looking at the figures, I don't want to spend much time. You have seen the nine months continuing operations. That's the next slide, with a growth in top line of 4% in local currencies, 12 in dollars; operating income up 24%, net income up 19%, and EPS up 22%. The number of employees has been slightly reduced, which is also a consequence of Project Forward as well as a change in the marketplace in the US especially, and Joe will talk more about this.</p>
          <p>In Pharmaceuticals, as I mentioned, we are ahead of what we had communicated initially, which was I think a realistic plan. Nevertheless, we have exceeded it. I think it has to do with the energy and the determination the team is moving. On the other side, I want to highlight that Andreas and I are disappointed with the results of the Sandoz business.  I'll come back to that later on. Novartis Consumer Health on track and Vaccines and Diagnostics, strong top line growth.</p>
          <p>The third quarter from a point of view of turnover has accelerated mostly by an acceleration in Pharmaceuticals. Operating income, very dynamic growth, and net income up also; and I'm sure Raymund will comment more about these numbers and how they have to be seen.</p>
          <p>On the geographies, good growth and what is remarkable is that from the point of view of negative growth in the US, we are now turning back to positive growth, and that is due to the digestion of all the disappointments we had with the various products last year, which had of course an impact on the first half.</p>
          <p>Slide number nine shows you the priorities we have in the group and we continue to pursue. First of all, to really strengthen our existing franchises in our business portfolio, which of course aims at addressing customer needs. The second is to continue to invest into R&amp;D so that we can have a continuous flow of really differentiated product. Third, to invest in the real growth opportunities as it relates to geographies; these are emerging growth markets in most cases. And last but not least, work on the organizational efficiency and we have still opportunities as we look forward to improve the way we operate.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to ask Joe to catch us up on Pharma.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dan. Starting on slide 11, performance in Pharma continues to be strong. In the third quarter, our sales were up 9% versus year ago in local currency. As Dan said, this is ahead of where we expected to be by the third quarter. It was really driven by two things, the in-market brands performing better than expected, but also the launches are ahead of what we thought they would be at this time.</p>
          <p>Importantly, the US showed good growth, up 9% versus year ago, and that's really the first time that the US has grown since early 2007. Operating income was up 13% and that includes the Aurograb impairments, where our productivity initiatives are really benefiting the bottom line.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the key metrics for the third quarter. I would just point out that the return on sales number of 26% includes the impairments; so excluding that impairment, it was about 29.3%, in line with the year-to-date number.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the nine-month results. You could see sales up 4% in local currency with operating income up 17%, and we are doing this with about 3% fewer people than we had a year ago.</p>
          <p>Slide 14, I wanted to put in a slide that shows that we have less exposure to the US than most pharma companies. And I think this is one of the reasons why we were able to overcome some of the issues that we faced earlier this year. It's also important as you think about the future and the fact that the US may become a tougher place to do business. We're going to rely heavily on Europe and Asia-Pacific for solid growth.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows pretty broad based growth in the third quarter. You can see the US up 9%; Europe also up 9%; Latin America, a little slowdown in the third quarter but we do expect the full year to be in line with year-to-date results.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 shows the same thing by franchise. You can see Oncology up 15% in the third quarter; Cardiovascular up 20%, and this reflects the fact that Lotrel is now out from under the base; and good performance by the launches of Exforge and Tekturna also starting to kick in. Immunology and Infectious Disease actually year to date is our fastest growing franchise, up 19%, and that's driven by Aclasta.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the quarterly progress that we've made in the US as we've gotten out from under the negative events. This is the true underlying growth that we are seeing in the US, and it's driven largely by good performance against the launches Aclasta, Exforge, Exelon Patch. And in fact Tekturna, we even started to see a tick up in Tekturna performance. In September, we had total prescriptions of 115,000 versus previous months, where we had seen 75 to 80,000 a month. So some of the changes that we made on Tekturna are starting to work.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows that today, we have announced a major change to our commercial model in the US This map on slide 18 shows how the US has moved from an open model where physicians have good autonomy to prescribe to a more restrictive model where HMOs and payors have created more restrictions. I said earlier in the year that we started three pilots in highly restrictive markets and we took a key account management approach and we learned a lot, and now we are ready to roll that model out more broadly.</p>
          <p>So on slide 19, we are moving from a national model of mirrored sales forces that are organized really by brand, and we are moving to a geographic based structure that is flexible and it will allow a key account management approach in those restricted markets but also will allow a continued share of voice model in the open markets. So it's going to I believe really improve our effectiveness. It also makes us more efficient as we are announcing today the elimination of about 550 positions, and that will save $80 million a year ongoing. We'll take a charge of about $20 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the success that we are having in Europe, and this is really a good story. As you look at the new products having a good part of the reason for the success in Europe, our in-market products are growing above the market, so Diovan is up 13%, Gleevec up 13%. These are significantly faster rates than the market is growing.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows some of our emerging market results, and I want to point out that in China and Russia, we are growing over 30%, and we see this as a big opportunity. I know that all pharma companies say they think emerging markets is a huge opportunity, but the thing that makes us different is if you look at these five countries on the slide, they add up to over $2 billion of total business. So, if we can take this group and grow it in the high 20s &#x2013; 30%, it will add significant top line to the global pharma numbers.</p>
          <p>We have good news on development during the quarter. As you know, Afinitor is under priority review for renal cell cancer and we expect a decision by December; as well Gleevec in adjuvant GIST [Gastro-Intestinal Stromal Tumors] also under priority review with a decision before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>On [slide] 23, I wanted to point out that I am spending lot of time with my executive team on the post-Diovan patent expiry period, and in fact really beginning in '10 and '11 when Cozaar goes generic and start to have an impact on Diovan. We're going to spend a lot of time driving our base businesses harder and also ensuring that the execution of our launches both for late stage as well as the launches that we had in 2007 continue to drive growth.</p>
          <p>But we're also deciding to invest now in some other initiatives that will help us post 2012, and they are shown on slide 24. We are accelerating our work in Oncology. We have a very strong pipeline and so we will invest more heavily in Oncology to allow concurrent development of some new indications for Afinitor and other late stage molecules which will help in that time period. The second thing we're doing is we are accelerating our investment in emerging markets; so that means more sales force, more market access resources.</p>
          <p>And then the third thing we're doing is we're accelerating our general medicine pipeline. When we reorganized into small cross-functional teams, we charged those teams with looking for ways to reduce their timelines and bring the drugs to market faster. And so you will see in the recent months ahead projects that have been accelerated.</p>
          <p>So in summary, good performance and that has allowed us to raise our full year forecast from low single digits sales growth to mid-single digit sales growth with operating income growing ahead of sales. And importantly, we are investing in projects today that will enable continued growth for Pharma into the future.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joe. I'll take your promise. With that, I would like to discuss the other businesses briefly. Vaccines and Diagnostics had dynamic growth, 15% growth in local currencies and 20 in dollars. The flu market has become somewhat more challenging in two ways. There is a lot of supply, and the prices are under pressure. But nevertheless, we are on track to have a good result in that area.</p>
          <p>What is very important for the future is obviously that we succeed with our Menveo submission. It is a very important medication in Europe with some groups, some pictures there, which show you this disease is often deadly and progresses very, very rapidly if not diagnosed quickly. So these vaccines will add substantial medical benefit and I have no doubt that they will also be commercially successful.</p>
          <p>Sandoz grew in the first 11 months by 1% in local currencies, 11% in dollars. It's really a mixed picture between some countries who have had a great performance and some with a weak performance. And even in the weak performance, I would separate two groups. One of the weak performers is the US. Here, clearly we are underperforming. That is mainly due to lower prices and delay of approvals. Then we have the German market, where we performed well. We gained market share. But nevertheless, it's a poor performance overall because the market is contracting.</p>
          <p>And then we have the good news, which are most of the emerging global markets, where there is very dynamic growth, and Sandoz does extremely well. What is satisfying is to see that from a profitability point of view, Andreas and his team have reached the objective they had put forward a few years ago. So it's over 15% ROS [Return On net Sales] and if you exclude the goodwill, then it's even over 20%. So by all means, the productivity and the improvement here have been achieved and of course, the battle continues.</p>
          <p>If we look at Consumer Health, finally, finally CIBA Vision is delivering good numbers. The operations are going in the right direction and we see that plus 6% local currencies and 13 in dollars. OTC on the other hand had a weak performance in the US market. It's not really entirely clear yet what all of the reasons are, but we have also management change there, which certainly didn't help.</p>
          <p>In Animal Health, a split picture really; the farm animal business is suffering due to the economy, the high commodity prices for the feed, the animal feed. And so people treat &#x2013; or farmers treat their animals in a restrictive way. And on the other side, the companion animal business, which is performing very well, contributes to this good result. So hopefully, the global farming crisis will soon be resolved.</p>
          <p>The next slide describes where we stand with Project Forward, so we have quite a way to go to achieve our goal of 1.6 billion in savings in 2010. But, we already have realized now over 700 million and we're able to partially reinvest this money and partially into savings and you can see here different initiatives taken by the various businesses.</p>
          <p>So far, I think most have been expected. What may have been less expected are the organizational changes we have announced today, and they comprise really of two things. One is a slight change in the structure by creating a job as Chief Operating Officer. And then the second is changes in the leadership of three divisions, and that is substantial.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I'll start with a simple change, which is the nomination of Thomas Werlen, our Group Legal Counsel, who is becoming a member of the Executive Committee of Novartis. And secondly, I would also like to acknowledge that Thomas Ebeling, who is now pursuing or going to pursue a career outside our company, has made major contributions to building the Pharmaceutical division and to our results. I am very grateful to him and we are leaving each other in very amicable terms.</p>
          <p>The second change on a divisional or a related change on the divisional label in Consumer Health is a little bit untraditional in the sense that George Gunn agreed to keep the Animal Health leadership and at the same time be the divisional chief, so there we are combining two jobs. George Gunn is a very experienced leader who has worked in many countries and in several companies, so I think he knows exactly what he has agreed to.</p>
          <p>Then we have two young chaps who are taking over: one, Sandoz; and the other, Vaccines and Diagnostics. Obviously with the promotion of Joerg Reinhardt to become Chief Operating Officer, we had to also address his succession. Andrin Oswald, who is by background an MD with also international experience and McKinsey training, who has worked as the general manger in Korea, as my personal assistant, and then in development, is going to take over this job.</p>
          <p>Then, Andreas Rummelt and myself had a discussion about his job. He did an outstanding job in integrating Hexal and Eon Labs. We had a very unfortunate event in the fact that our global head QA had unexpectedly passed away, and so I am grateful to address that he agreed to take over this responsibility on a group level. We combined it with the manufacturing job because Andreas has a lot of experience in manufacturing and when we had big difficulties in Pharmaceuticals a few years ago, he really fixed it.</p>
          <p>And with that, there is a new opportunity for another very promising leader, Jeff George, who will take over the generics business.  So overall, I think the changes indicate that we want continuity; that we want to give opportunities also to younger people, and it also indicates that Joerg and I will share some of the workload I currently have. The demands on a Chairman and CEO have increased over the recent years, and the good fortune is that Joerg and I have work together in the past, in fact for many, many, many years, sometimes in a reporting relationship, sometimes not. But we know each other extremely well, we trust each other, and that makes it I think a workable relation and we will in an aligned way lead the company.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would also like to close with another important decision the Board has taken, which is to ask David Epstein to create a molecular diagnostics business. It will obviously start with some development work and it will start obviously with oncology. In fact, it has already started with oncology, so it will be a natural expansion and buildup. And he will also become, like the other new nominees, a permanent guest of the Executive Committee and contribute to the overall strategy of the group. I think it will be a very strong team at the top; at least if I exclude myself, I can say that.</p>
          <p>With that, Raymund, may I ask you to take over?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel. I would like to add a few comments on the financials. I am now on slide 33. First I have to mention here that obviously all the numbers that we show are numbers on a continuing basis. That means they exclude the effect of the businesses that we divested last year, the nutrition businesses, and the gain that we see on those divestitures.  The second remark on these numbers is that one has to take into account that in the third quarter of 2007, we booked an increase to our environmental charges or provisions of $590 million; so one has to keep this in mind assessing the performance and the increases in the various performance numbers.</p>
          <p>Our operating income, as Daniel mentioned, is increasing 24%. But excluding the environmental charge, the operating income would have increased 13%. And excluding this charge, there is a margin improvement from 23% to 23.2%; the same with the net income increase of 19%, translating to a 10% increase excluding this environmental charge.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you see the same overview of the third quarter. The increase of 61% in operating income translates into 14% excluding the environmental charge. We show an increase in the operating income margin from 21.2 to 21.7%. The net income increase of 32% on a comparable basis would then be 2% and I will comment later on the major factors affecting this.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, I analyze further the drivers behind the increased operating income margin. We have three sets of factors there. One is we have higher revenues, mainly from the Betaseron agreement with Bayer Schering. Then we have productivity improvements as a result of the Forward initiative that flows through in cost of goods sold, marketing and sales, and G&amp;A; and then our targeted investment into research and development, where you see an increase of these investments at a higher rate than sales.</p>
          <p>In addition, there is a third element. We have one-time elements that had to be taken into Pharma cost of goods sold. In 2007, we had the Famvir impairment of 320 million. And in R&amp;D in 2008, we had the Aurograb impairment of 223 million. So these exceptional items explain an additional part of these variations.</p>
          <p>Finally in operating income and expense, we had another set of exceptional items but those probably can best be gleaned on the next slide, where we give you the adjustments that we usually make to the income numbers, be it for intangible asset charges or for significant exceptional items.</p>
          <p>For the group overall, we obviously have to take into accounting in 2007 the 590 million environmental provision increase. Excluding this, these adjustments are virtually at the similar level. I think they are 57 million lower than in the comparable period last year. The exceptional items affecting other income and expense are: restructuring of 89 million; lower product divestments, 141 versus 166 million; and the release of pre-launch inventory provisions mostly related to Tekturna, which again was lower into 2008 compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we have the other non-operating items. Income from associated companies, up 12%, nothing special here apart from the first un-consolidation of Alcon, which I will cover later. Financial income net, virtually unchanged from the year ago, 6.2% as a percent of average net liquidity. This item did not increase because of the financing for the Alcon 25% stake that we acquired at the beginning of the third quarter. And this stake caused a financing and a reduction of interest income of approximately $80 million, so that explains why this number is not increasing.</p>
          <p>Taxes is the other exceptional development. In the nine months 2008 the 14% is higher than the number in the year ago period, but the year ago period was an exceptionally low number of 11% because of one-time factors.</p>
          <p>Then on the next slide, a few comments on the accounting for the 25% Alcon equity stake, the allocation of the 10.4 billion purchase price is done on a preliminary basis and will be finalized in the fourth quarter, but we currently have allocated 6.2 billion to identifiable net assets with an average amortization period of 11 years, and 4.2 billion to goodwill. Our share of the estimated Alcon net income for the third quarter is 121 million, but that was more than offset by Novartis charges for amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items related to this transaction of 126 million. So the net income contribution for the third quarter was negative 5 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, I should stay that under IAS 39, we have concluded that we didn't have to value the outstanding options, the call option and the put option for the remaining 52% Alcon stake held by Nestl&#xE9;.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we show that free cash flow increased strongly but was mostly used then for the benefit of higher dividends. So the free cash flow of nine months 2007 of 1.7 million increased for operating activities; and reduced investments in property, plant, and equipment; and the reduced investments in intangible and financial assets; but then was partly offset by lower sale of assets and as I mentioned, an increase of 747 million for higher dividend payments.</p>
          <p>On the last slide, I would now like to make a few comments on the direct impact of the financial crisis on Novartis treasury operations. We have had no equity or bond investment exposure to any of the insolvent financial institutions. We have no counterparty exposure to any insolvent financial institution through financial contracts, be it swaps or options or other financial instruments. We continue to have a very sound ability to issue US commercial paper with no substantial limitations and at very fine rates. And finally, our defined benefit plans as of the end of the third quarter are fully covered.</p>
          <p>With this, I hand over again to Daniel.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I have a few questions. At current exchange rates, if you extend those into 2009, can you give us some idea of what the impact would be to sales as well as to operating income? The second question is on the emerging markets that you mentioned. Can you tell us what the Novartis's top five products are at present in emerging markets and how that might shift over time? What could be the top five products may be five to ten years from now? Then last question on generic Lovenox, any increased visibility whether that will be a fully substitutable true generic product in the US such that you'll have rapid erosion of branded Lovenox?</p>

          <p>2009, that's a bit of hypothetical question because it depends to a very large degree where the rates will move to. If they would stay at current levels, at the average rates that we had for 2008, obviously the impact would be minimal, but one has to assume that they will move about. On slide 70 of the analyst presentation, you'll see the impact that any currency changes would have. For example, if the US dollar/euro rate, if the euro would move up 10%, then you would have a 3.2% positive impact on group sales and a 4% positive impact on operating income; and obviously if it moves down, then vice-versa. And similarly we give these impacts for the other currencies. But I think the euro together with the Swiss franc are the two most important ones.</p>

          <p>Tim, regarding the EGM [Emerging Growth Markets] markets and the Pharma brands, generally, the top five brands are quite similar to our top five brands with a couple of exceptions. So you will see Diovan, Gleevec, Neoral for transplant. But you also see Voltaren in the emerging markets, and we've done a very good job with some of our more mature drugs, continuing to grow them in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of what we expect to see, to be honest, we expect to see continued growth. So there are generics on the market against some of these drugs already. And we continue to grow them because of the self-pay nature of some of the markets. We've done a good job from a branding standpoint and would not expect to a see a material change probably for the next few years.</p>

          <p>Okay, on Lovenox, we filed an ANDA in the US. We have received a set of questions on immunogenicity last December. This was the only set of questions we received on enoxaparin where we needed to file an amendment to the open ANDA. The ANDA was submitted by September 26 and we had of course discussions with the FDA before, how we wanted to address the questions here. The FDA fully agreed with our approach. So we hope that the data are sufficient now and will lead to approval. And if the ANDA is approved, then the product is fully substitutable.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Graham Parry, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is just on the management changes that we have announced. We are seeing a sweeping level of management change in the Pharma business and you have now restructured the rest of the management, Dan.  I was wondering, particularly with the elevation of Joerg's role, to what extent you are moving to eventually split the Chairman and CEO role and what your thoughts are there.</p>
          <p>Second, question for Joe on cost savings in the Pharma business beyond 2010, you talked about the $80 million a year saving, but you're going to need a lot more than that to offset, obviously the Diovan and the loss. So I was wondering if you could talk through how you see cost savings going for 2010 and beyond, and whether you think this would be part of a company-wide Project Forward 2, for example. And then thirdly just a product question, we see both Diovan in Europe and Lucentis ex-US down sequentially quarter on quarter. I'm just wondering, are you seeing more price pressure for Diovan in Europe and on Lucentis patients starting to cycle to less frequent dosing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First on the creation of the Chief Operating Officer's job, it has nothing to do with the split of the Chairman and CEO, obviously. We evaluate this question in context regularly and if ever the Board feels that this is appropriate, it will split the jobs. So it's a question which will be re-examined regularly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, second question was, Graham, about cost savings. And you are right, we will need a lot more than $80 million in cost savings as we move forward in the US. It's not just a US effort though in terms of overall cost savings. It truly is a Pharma global Initiative. So we are driving significant changes in the way that we source. We are looking at taking Lean principles outside of manufacturing and Leaning processes that have tended to become bloated and bureaucratic and we are finding ways to save money.</p>
          <p>And then finally, I do think that when you look at the US and the commercial model change that we have made in the US would &#x2013; it allows us to modify our approach as the US changes. So as the US becomes more restrictive on a market-by-market basis, this regional model that is done on a market-by-market level allows us to make modifications.</p>
          <p>I don't think you will see a Forward 2 unless conditions change dramatically because we are able to modify as the markets move basically through attrition, given the current attrition rates in sales. So the point is a valid one that we will need more savings than the 80 million. Don't look at this is as a one-time SWOT. This enables us to really change the model in the US to adapt as the market changes.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question on Lucentis volume growth ex-US continues to be strong. We don't see any flattening. We actually had some positive developments with market access in quite a few big markets, Canada, UK, Australia, and Germany, where we see broadening access to the product. And the number of injections a year is actually going up if I compare to last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on Diovan as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The volume growth on Diovan continues to be strong, US and ex-US. We are gaining in the US; and in Europe we continue to gain market share in the Europe markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And so for example, in Europe on Diovan, we are seeing high single digit growth, and all of that is volume. So, none of it is price.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Gbola Amusa, UBS. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good afternoon. First, could you update us on the proximity of your pharma margins in emerging markets to those in developed markets, not just in terms of what you see today, but what you might see some years from now?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, given the very high component of out-of-pocket expenditures for Pharma in those markets, there has to be some high sensitivity of sales growth to per capita income growth. Just given your high exposure on slide 14, at what level of emerging markets GDP growth in '09 would you start to get nervous in terms of our own internal forecasts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with the proximity of margin, we don't talk about margin on a region-by-region basis. But I have said in the past that emerging markets is slightly below the Pharma global average. The more mature markets are slightly above, which gets us to the average market.</p>
          <p>We are going to invest more heavily in the short term in emerging markets. So you might see a one or two point suppression in the emerging markets. But as I have committed to the aspiration of showing margin improvement every year, we will fund the investment that we're making in emerging markets through greater cost savings in the more mature markets. So where I would expect it to go long term is I would expect emerging markets to start to approach the Pharma global average, but it doesn't need to given the portfolio plays that we're making in terms of profit growth and sales growth. We're looking at emerging markets primarily as a sales growth driver. And as long as we can show good, solid operating income improvement year after year, we will be happy.</p>
          <p>In terms of the out-of-pocket expenditures, you're right in that there is quite a bit of out-of-pocket expenditures, but we're also selling a lot of what we sell in emerging markets through hospitals, where it is fully reimbursed. So I would &#x2013; we have seen ups and downs in per capita income in emerging markets. And our business in emerging markets, this Pharma business the way that it is currently configured, is fairly insulated from big swings. So it would have to really change dramatically for me to change my outlook for '09 or beyond.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, to what degree do you believe that there are also new healthcare systems, insurance systems, reimbursement systems which are being put in place into these countries?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you look at what's happening in China and the plan to broaden insurance or at least healthcare coverage for a broader percent of the population, as of today, only about 25% of the urban population in China is covered by some kind of healthcare program. You're going to see more and more of that as China unveils their plan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Mr. Paul Mann, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, a few questions from me. First of all, in your other operating income line, or other income and expense line of 286, can you just highlight what was in that line versus the one gain from last year, the one-time gain last year? It's quite a large number this year, any particular items in there?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in your vaccine sales, you mentioned both pandemic sales as well as normal Group sales. Can you just talk about what is the difference between pandemic and normal? And then on Zometa, obviously, that's growing nicely following the Austrian study at ASCO. Could you just talk about when should we expect the AZURE data? Is that going to come at San Antonio or is there any clarity on timing there?</p>
          <p>And then finally, just thinking about your version of beta interferon, how should we think about the marketing of that product? And also, FTY720, will you require an additional sales force? Can you talk about the timing and potentially the cost or the upfront cost of that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Other income and expense, Paul, I think we have two elements that need explaining. One is Pharma and, the other one is corporate in Pharma. The nine month figures you mentioned, we had a swing of approximately 286 million there. So in there, we have restructuring expenses of 83 million. We have the reduced liquidation of launch, inventory launch provisions for Tekturna of approximately 66 million. Then we have reduced gains from divestitures, and we have &#x2013; that's 25 million approximately. And then we have increased personnel cost accruals. So that explains those changes.</p>
          <p>For corporate other income and expense, there you have a swing of approximately 120 million. The main items are increased investments into the corporate infrastructure. We have centralized the management of the IT services and infrastructure and that has a costing there of approximately 55 million. And then we have increased insurance payments and premium of 34 million as the main items that would explain the nine-month numbers. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Flu vaccines, what I can tell you is that we had in the number for the third quarter around 19 million of seasonals or working doses sold. And in terms of pandemic or pre-pandemic sales, it was a deal with the US Government valued at $126 million in the third quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, would you please address the Zometa question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding Zometa, just a background. As you've seen, Zometa has returned to growth as positioned, now focused back on treating patients monthly where the real benefit is. In addition, we benefited somewhat from ABCSG [Austrian Breast &amp; Colorectal Cancer Study Group] data already presented this year.</p>
          <p>The AZURE trial, which is a large randomized trial looking at both pre and postmenopausal patients for the prevention of return of breast cancer, that trial has been looked at. An interim look has been taken by the Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee, and they've decided that trial would continue until its completion, which will mean full results in early 2010. However, at the San Antonio Breast Cancer meeting, you will see some data from a subset of about 200 patients who were treated in the neoadjuvant setting, and I think that will be the near term data to focus on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I am guessing you can't file on that data. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are evaluating whether or not it makes sense to file the ABCSG data or not, and we will get back to you on that once we have clarity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the beta interferon, which we call Extavia, this is obviously the entry of Novartis in the attractive US market. Beta interferon is the standard of care that will establish Novartis presence in this field ahead of the launch of FTY. We are deploying small dedicated teams of MS experts in all the key markets. The marketing has started and will be accelerated in the first half of next year. And these people are deploying a service package for physicians and for patients, which is required to compete in this category.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Thanks for taking my questions, two quick questions. One, just following up on Betaseron, could you give some guidance on other revenues in the Pharma division as I think that Betaseron royalties from Bayer Schering cease sometime in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Second question on Vaccines, could you give us an idea of the returns policy for the flu vaccine this year, whether you've sold to wholesalers or government institutions who will completely accept the 33 million or whether you think any of those are under threat of return? And if you could give us an idea on how many more doses of vaccine you are planning to produce this year beyond the 33, that would be very useful. Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So on Betaseron, just on to that first question. We do stop receiving royalties on Betaseron mid-October. So won't receive any substantial royalties for the fourth quarter of this year. And as you know, we'll be launching our own version of Betaseron in the beginning of next year. So we will stop receiving our other income before after revenues from Extavia kick in.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our expectation for a full year would be around 200. So you can pro rata on that basis that we might lose one quarter of that 200.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Regarding flu vaccines, this year's season, not unexpected to me, has developed a little bit more into a challenge than what we would have liked. We see especially in the US market but also in some European markets some levels of oversupply of material. In addition, there is a relatively weak season, or it has been so far. So all together, what you see towards the end of the season is that the conditions in terms of supply for wholesalers start to be stabilized a little bit, and some of our competitors have already started to give lots of return to a large extent. We cannot exclude that we are going to do the same going forward for the remainder of the season.</p>
          <p>All together, I believe that we will &#x2013; it's unlikely that we will able to sell all of the 65 to 70 million doses that we will be able to produce this year. But we are still in the middle of the season, so we'll have to see how the rest of the season unfolds. We have not given up obviously the ambition to sell whatever we have produced. But as I say, so far it's relatively weak. We'll have to see how the rest of the year will look like.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much indeed. Daniel, first for you that there is a comment in the press release that talks about extending your current position as Chairman and CEO of Novartis. Is there something new in that at all? And second on Sandoz, you've been very clear with regards to outlook for this year from a top line perspective. But can you may be roll on a little bit further and talk a bit about how you expect the markets, particularly Germany and the US, to develop and therefore how we should think about the evolving profitability in that business going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Yes, first to my contract and the terms for a new contract, my contract is over next February when we have the AGM. So that was the end of the term. And it was a question if we prolong and at what conditions. So we have discussed that in fact over rather an extended period of time, the Board and I, and we came to conclude and the key terms really are that it will be a contract in the first phase till the AGM in 2010. And should I be reelected, it will be an automatic prolongation for one year, which will be basically repeated unless one of the two parties does cancel the contract with a notice period, which is usual. There is no severance pay and no golden parachute foreseen for that new contract, so that has also been agreed. And finally, the compensation is going to remain unchanged. So these are really the main points. And in that context, yes, that is news.</p>
          <p>From a point of view of Sandoz, I think Andreas will comment. But my view is following the business that in the US, I don't see a fundamental shift. It's more that one really needs to have new products. And if anything has changed, it's the level of aggressiveness of generic manufacturers who take and have taken an increasing risk to attack patents and taking a bit where it takes some time until the truth comes out and until the judges and the juries have taken their decision. So it's a short-term win for a generic manufacturer to go and launch at risk, but we'll see if it plays out in all cases. I think in some cases, it does and in some cases, it won't. If it doesn't, it's an expensive proposal.</p>
          <p>In Germany, the market is continuing to change. I am not very optimistic from a point of view of the outlook. I think we have a very strong position. I don't see that as being endangered, but the statutory health now are trying to get better prices through negotiations, and Andreas has been deeply involved in this discussion. So he can comment more and maybe give some further aspect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Daniel, well if you look at everything on US, the issue that's here is really the launch delays we have and approvals pending of the ANDAs, which have been submitted a long time ago. Six of the ANDAs are &#x2013; some of them really important, one including enoxaparin are also under &#x2013; have Citizens Petitions, and here it's unpredictable on how fast the FDA will act on this. Otherwise, the pipeline for the US is intact. We have more than 100 ANDAs pending, half of them with Paragraph IV challenge. It's just that the agency is not moving and approving. So this is the issue for this year.</p>
          <p>Germany, it is certainly a contracting market right now, with the new rebates we have to give to the statutory health insurance companies. Nevertheless, we were able to increase our market share by nearly three percentage points over the last year. So we are by far market leader in Germany and this was certainly I'll say help us by winning new contracts with the current health insurance companies and also winning hopefully a significant number of molecules from the new AOK tender, which is due November 3. We will hear until the end of the year what the outcome is. So there will be price and margin pressure, but through increasing market share, we hope that at least a good part of this we can balance out.</p>

Second, on the US Sandoz plant manufacturing warning letter from the FDA, how has that impacted the Sandoz challenge, and that's all? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Okay, as you know, we have launched the generic Plavix clopidogrel in Germany. The launch has gone pretty well. We have achieved rapidly sales, also moving faster than the only competitor here, which is Ratiopharm. So legally, everything is clarified right now. So we can &#x2013; our product is fully substitutable to the Sanofi product and we are hoping to continue this very successful launch in Germany.</p>
          <p>On Wilson, we are in constant constructive dialogue with the agency. We have sent in our written reply on the warning letter to give full commitment to bring the site on full compliance with respect to the deficiency we mainly had in documentation and validation. A direct result of the review, which we did with internal and external experts, was the recall &#x2013; a partial recall of three part-products, partial metoprolol, full recall in azithromycin and gabapentin. Gabapentin was not directly related. I think the commercial impact of these three recalls was pretty small, so we don't expect a significant impact on our US results here. Again, we are still in discussions with the agency which is on a continuous basis. And we're fully committed to fix the issues as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p>Okay. Do you have &#x2013; maybe one last question related to that, do you have indications of any approvals are being delayed because of the quality?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, when a plant is under a warning letter, that new approvals would not come through. So we don't have planned significant launches from the Wilson plant. We are confident that until that time we will have fixed the issues, so that this will not delay any new approvals from the plant and impact our business negatively.</p>
