      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, let's get started ladies and gentlemen. Good afternoon, it's Q1 2010 financial results, LUKOIL Vice President, Leonid Fedun.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen, for finding an opportunity to spend this afternoon with us. Well, to start with regular forward-looking statements, pretty standard ones. Next slide please.</p>
          <p>Well, in general, this quarter has been quite successful. And it is good news that many analysts who actually forecasted worse results have been wrong. So it is always a pleasure to be better than expected. And although the oil price only grew by 70%, our net income turned out to be much higher than that.</p>
          <p>What it tells you is that apart from some objective market conditions, we took some serious &#x2013; really serious steps to show this financial performance. That's how the macroeconomic and the tax situation has changed recently. So oil 70% up, export duties 135% up, and the minerals production tax 120% up.</p>
          <p>While indices were growing for pipeline transportation, they were more than 30% up, which had an impact on our indicators. And of course, we have concerns about these tariffs still going up, because some of the players are trying to share those transportation costs all across the entire system, which is wrong. And the real ruble appreciation by 22%, which always distorts our reporting. And so as you can see, we are seeing the distortion in our figures.</p>
          <p>Well, our main financial performance indicators, full production was down a little bit, because we &#x2013; although we &#x2013; our production declined &#x2013; slowed down in West Siberia, but West Siberia has been and will be going down for everyone. It's a natural process.</p>
          <p>So this &#x2013; but we are seeing some stabilization here, because next year we are launching our Korchagin field. Speaking of oil production, distribution is basically the following. Well, as long as we have those strategic fields, provisionally now legislation, so we're going to see production going down, because the bank loan cannot keep you up all the time. There are also some limitations here introduced by Gazprom last year, but the marketable hydrocarbon production was 2% up overall.</p>
          <p>Well, our refining grew and so we reduced our refined products and exports a little bit by improving our Russian retail sales.</p>
          <p>Well, main financial results, sales down a little bit as compared to Q4, but it is up as compared to last year. Well, this slight reduction quarter-on-quarter is due to the fact that the prices were down a little bit on the one hand, and on the other hand, we reduced our third-party sales.</p>
          <p>Taxes, well, income tax went up. And although the taxes were growing, including excise taxes and import duties so far LUKOIL today is paying more taxes than anybody else, because we are not using any tax deductions and tax benefits yet.</p>
          <p>Well, net income, 18.9% up quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year, it's more than 126%. The same proportion you can see in basic EPS, next slide, our main operating expenses.</p>
          <p>Well, our hydrocarbon lifting costs grew a little bit year-on-year, but they were a little bit down quarter-on-quarter. Our refining expenses went up, but our own refineries, those refining expenses were down at third-party refineries Q-on-Q.</p>
          <p>Well, crude oil transportation went up because of tariffs increase, as well as power generation and petrochemical expenses, because the petrochemical industry consumes a lot of power. At the same time we have seen some operating expenses in the crude oil and refined products inventory originates within the group because, we've done some, made some changes in our policies and then facilities, especially in those abroad.</p>
          <p>Well, let me emphasize that LUKOIL keeps its operating expenses under control, but the growth we have seen, about 20%, is due to the ruble appreciation. Of course, the lifting costs are going up because we have a lot of water costs, and a lot of operating wells, so you can only use one strategy to find that.</p>
          <p>So we are now carefully looking at state-of-the-art technology worldwide. Shale gas, for example, so when you can use this unique possibility of drilling three kilometers deep with one kilometer horizontal section with lots of frac jobs. And this well could be much less expensive than those used by Russian and European competitors. So such technologies are giving a lot of opportunities to all oil companies, including LUKOIL to reduce our operating expenses and that is something we should do.</p>
          <p>Well, our expenses are going to grow. It is inevitable. So the only solution here is to develop our own power generation capabilities. And the other operating expenses within the framework of controlled growth and those are below inflation.</p>
          <p>Our transportation expenses, like I said, we are concerned with transportation tariffs going up dramatically, especially for railroad transport and for pipeline transportation. The problem is that state-owned monopolies are trying to balance their losses in some areas with the oil companies using some traditional routes, which is not fair, and which has an impact on our commercial efficiency. In the future transportation expenses are going to be one of the most important components that will determine the competitiveness of the Russian oil and gas sector. If those keep going up, our competitiveness will come under pressure and one will have to do something about it.</p>
          <p>So what is important is not new transportation routes, but the kind of transportation infrastructure that will be competitive as compared to other delivery routes in our traditional markets such as Europe. But as you can see in this quarter, cuts in the quarter reduced our SG&amp;A, but it is a regular situation if you compare Q1 and Q4. Next slide.</p>
          <p>Net income reconciliation. While revenue increased by almost $5 billion was compensated by an abrupt almost $3.5 billion of tax increase. But this system we have in Russia for the tax basically kills the main cash flow. Today the proportion of taxes in our revenue nears 50%, which does not allow us to say that we can increase our investment into E&amp;P projects in the Russian Federation because the current tax regime is not instrumental in this respect, to put it mildly.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow structure. LUKOIL has managed to grow free cash flow, and today it's a pretty substantial figure. So it has gone up by 1 billion. Now it's $1.4 billion. With this cash flow, we can start reducing our debt, and through including some cash flow cushion to implement major investment projects that I will touch upon later.</p>
          <p>Our capital expenditure break down. So I would like to draw your attention to the fact that in LUKOIL's strategy, we are seeing a transition from this 70 to 30 ratio, so exploration and production to refining and marketing, so we are moving towards the 80/20 ratio. Because we already made our main capital expenditures and investments into our refineries upgrades, so now we can reduce the proportion of marketing and refining in our CapEx, so we can ship this money into E&amp;P projects.</p>
          <p>And the results of Q1 so basically show this trend. And hopefully you will be seeing this trend in the future. That is the message we want to send to the market.</p>
          <p>So we have already done what our competitors have yet to do. So we have increased the conversion rate depth of refining. And with this new unit, we are putting on stream next quarter is a refinery in Nizhny Novgorod with this bottom of the barrel upgrading. So we will be able to free up some cash to invest in more interesting projects from the financial point of view.</p>
          <p>Next slide. So we got first oil in the Yuri Korchagin field. As you know it was, just to remind you, <mark type="inaudible" /> (12.00) Prime Minister, for which we thank him, so that is what we are seeing. It is basically getting baptized the oil industry way. So you smear yourself with the oil. That is the way you get baptized in the oil industry. Which shows respect for the hard work our oil people do. So these Caspian fields still remain one of our priorities because we have very substantial reserves there.</p>
          <p>While the rate with which we put them on stream is influenced by two factors. Number one is the so-called strategic field provision that we still have in place. Well, formally they say these risks are being reduced, but we still have those risks. That's number one.  And number two is we do not have a legislative framework to boost investment into such projects. Today LUKOIL is the only oil company investing money in offshore production. And we are the only company that has such experience and expertise amongst Russian oil companies.</p>
          <p>But you can only introduce, you can only launch those skills quickly if you have tax breaks. And this African meeting that took place and it was decided to introduce zero duty for those Caspian fields. If this is done we will immediately revise our marketing strategy to accelerate the launch of all the other fields, such as Filanovsky, Rakushechnoye, <mark type="inaudible" /> field and others &#x2013; the Temryuksko field that we found together with our partner, Rosneft.</p>
          <p>So from 2025, 3035 we will ship them to earlier dates to stock the oil production on the Russian integration built. Without those breaks and benefits, it is very unlikely we will be able to put them on stream quickly, because there is no infrastructure in this field, and with this very poor infrastructure, it basically kills your revenue and makes it inattractive for any oil company to produce oil from those fields.</p>
          <p>At the same time if you look at the world, you can see some alternative options. Well, we did some exploration drilling in Cote d'Ivoire in Ghana and &#x2013; so we found some reserves which are by far superior to those in the North Sea and for those in the whole West Siberia, just to give you an idea of the scale. And today in our Ghana block we can count up to 10 structures. And by size each of those structures is larger than the Filanovsky structure. And the tax regime in that region is much more attractive from the investment point of view. Despite the high geological risks those fields will just pay your money back very quickly.</p>
          <p>So in first look offshore Ghana, we found pretty substantial reserves. And in the Ivory Coast we also found some signs of oil. And so we estimated this potential is very high. And we are planning to drill from 8 to 10 wells in this region over the next two years to make &#x2013; to enable us to make final conclusion on how productive those fields could be so we can quickly start developing them there in West Africa. Next slide please.</p>
          <p>So starting this year LUKOIL is beginning to develop West Qurna-2 in Iraq. Next year, we're going to start high-volume drilling, because it doesn't take a lot of drilling, so you'll need to drill about 312 there to put in place necessary infrastructure. And we're going to grow our oil production over the next few years because of this concentration of oil from West Qurna, that should give us a stable cash flow and a stable oil production level reaching 80 million tons of crude oil a year. That's something we'll put on our balance sheet, of course.</p>
          <p>Well, in Q1 we retained our strong position in the industry, as you can see, in terms of cash flow, in terms of capital expenditures, LUKOIL is very competitive. If you look at gross and the net income per barrel, so very competitive this part, this very stringent tax regime we have here in the Russian federation, but still even within the framework of this system, we managed to be successful, although slightly.</p>
          <p>Also a very strong competitive position in finding and developing costs. So we were pretty much in line here and in terms of lifting cost as well.</p>
          <p>Next slide. Of course, we confirmed that we are one of the most of open and transparent companies, so we got those Investor Relations awards in Russia for our report. We were the winner of this annual award. And it was about annual reports and the website, and we congratulate ourselves on that achievement.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your time, ladies and gentlemen. Now I would be glad to take your questions.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Anton Sychev, Goldman Sachs. I have two questions for you about LUKOIL's future. So number one, so we could read in the press release about the 550 billion ruble loan for LUKOIL from Sberbank of Russia.</p>
          <p>Well in that process international investors had questions about LUKOIL's acquisition of assets in Europe, and so this approval of such a big loan makes one suspicious that you're looking at new acquisitions. Although you said that you have enough production and refining capacity. So could you just comment on this large Sberbank loan? What are the goals of this loan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have just one goal. We want to have an investment cushion, investment headroom to give us a safety net in the conditions of high volatility in the market. So I can confirm once again that we're not planning any downstream acquisitions. And because of this new strategy, like I said, this ratio between oil production and refining will no longer be 70 to 30, it will be 80 to 20 from the CapEx point of view, which means we are going to reduce our investments in the downstream.</p>
          <p>So it's just a formal thing to give us a safety net so should the oil price go down dramatically, so we have a chance of using this cushion like a shock absorber. But we are not looking at any global position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a second question about the Timan-Pechora region, because the government is planning to offer, once again they are planning to offer <mark type="inaudible" /> fields, which could be interesting to LUKOIL. I have two questions on that. Number one, in what way and what format could LUKOIL be involved in this meeting, given the strategic nature of those fields and are you seeing any limitations here?</p>
          <p>And my second question is, we already had the bidding for the Gdansk field in that region, which is run by the Helle Gdansk people. So it was taken by red necks, without any competition. So isn't it a sign of capitulation from LUKOIL, but why are you still interested in bidding for those acreage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so LUKOIL is in the Russian legislative framework. I cannot comment on it. So if the situation is structured in such a way that they give fields to a limited number of participants it's the right of the government. So we are doing some other stamps. We are making emphasis on assets outside of the Russian Federation, which might be more interesting from the <mark type="inaudible" /> point of view.</p>
          <p>If the situation in the Russian Federation changes, which was the talk set by the Prime Minister, because I think we are seeing a revolution in the oil production industry and crude oil is now a very interesting commodity. And this is not about access to appeals, but it is about investments. Then you could reduce crude oil all over the place. Those offshore fields by the recent accident.</p>
          <p>But still those offshore fields are now ready for development. So in those conditions, those access limitations should be obsolete. The government should really change the situation, because this position scares off the investors and channels the investment planning into more interesting regions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, could you be involved in a joint venture with the Gazprom Neft?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the current regime, LUKOIL has no chance of participating in such bidding processes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, for this last question what about the export duty rates discussion for the Caspian fields, because Mr. Putin was certain of this launch. So what's the status of those discussions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, discussions are taking place at a very high level, which makes us feel optimistic. Let me put it this way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question about the Federal Anti-monopoly Service. Those things they're claiming, the things they are well-grounded in, so how would you comment on that? And what do you personally think about the retail gas prices, petrol prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the claims the Federal Anti-monopoly Service has got against all oil companies are not grounded and politicized. But a political decision was made and all oil companies will have to pay now, and they should be more careful about investing into this market in the future. So the government is government controlled, it is a hidden message the government is going to control the prices in this market. So what we are concerned with is that they're talking about shifting this transport tax and including this transport tax in the oil price.</p>
          <p>So if this transport tax is brought into the oil tax, into the excises, which are easy to collect from the oil companies, so this should result in the growing prices for refined products. And given that the calculation formula is still nonexistent, so we do not know what is fair and what is an unfair price. So of course, we are concerned about the situation. Today's prices are fair from our point of view and can just be explained by one thing that the main part of this price is the taxes paid to the government and the tax component is going to grow in the near future <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So how happy are you with those refining assets in Europe that you have acquired recently? So what is the refining margin you have there and some other KPIs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I wouldn't say that I am thrilled with those assets. But, of course, all those assets we wanted to acquire we did acquire, and at a fair price and at the right time, although the refining margin went down abruptly last year. But we are going to see some <mark type="inaudible" /> in those assets. According to our calculation from 10 to 14 refineries are going to close down in Europe, which should reduce the supply side by 15 to 20%. And that should bring the margin back to the normal level. And those refineries will be closed down, but in a simple configuration that have no crackers or hydrocrackers. According to our consultants, Wood MacKenzie and some other companies, our refineries that we acquired at year end</p>
          <p>in feedstock are top 10 in the world that will close down last. So from this point of view we made the right investments and they should generate more value for the company in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Irina Bulkina at URALSIB. So did you do any hedging in Q1? And did you see any losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we did not see any major loss, because the oil price volatility was not very high. Actually this high volatility, it's up all the ups and downs, so we do not have any substantial loss or profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Mr. Fedun, in your report we can see $235 million of advanced payment for some retail asset you were going to buy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's the calculations of those parts of those assets we already bought. It's new assets. It's the assets we are still buying and we are still paying for, it's not new deals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Interfax, Yelena. Is LUKOIL planning to issue Eurobonds in the near future? And how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are always planning on issuing Eurobonds to replace our short-term and mid-term debt positions to convert it into long-term debt, 10 or 15 years. Well, whether or not we are going to do it this year I'm not sure, because we have enough cash, and it depends basically on the distribution in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So, so far we have very low interest rates we have on loans, they make this market very attractive. But we are not sure, because the volatility is very high. But it is very simple, you know, to go from this 3 to 5 year debt to 10 or 15 years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you also said that LUKOIL was not planning new downstream acquisitions. Does that mean that you're not looking to buy this Conoco refinery in Germany?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are not. Moreover, that would be, how shall I put it? It would be quite incorrect to consider this kind of acquisition, because today it's the buyer's market, not the seller's market, because we have 14 refineries available for sale in Europe alone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexander Galagan, Finam Securities. Six months ago you said that you wanted to turn this company from oil production to a dividend payment company. So, that means more dividends. So have your plans changed now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Haven't you read our other reports? According to those reports we increased our dividends every year. And at the board meeting in April, we decided despite the net income going down, 2010 we are going to pay more dividends. Still it's the only Russian company doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question, maybe just, so BP, why can't they plug in this well? So what is the main problem? Is the pressure so high that it's impossible to shut down that well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a very complicated question. Of course, we are looking carefully at this problem, because we are the only Russian company with offshore production assets. So, we operated in deposits in the Caspian Sea and we have operations in the Gulf of Guinea.</p>
          <p>Well, the question is really very complicated because we've never seen such an accident in 40 years of offshore production. It is very much like what happened in Chernobyl. It's a number of factors, human factors, technical factors and natural factors, and give you a unique combination of factors, so which gives you unique and sad accident.</p>
          <p>So BP who have excellent engineering expertise, so they're looking for options. And all other oil companies keep an eye on that, to study this accident and to learn lessons. Certainly how to act quickly if something like that happens, God forbid.</p>
          <p>But although in Korchagina field, for example, in our production facility, we have triple protection for shutting down the wells in such situations. But under the U.S. legislation, you only need to have one such system. So, Russian legislation from this point of view is more stringent in terms of environmental protection than the U.S. one.</p>
          <p>So for example we have this zero discharge technology when we even have to collect the drilling mud and to carry it on shore. But in the U.S., basically it is treated like waste, and it could be discharged into the sea after dilution.</p>
          <p>So this you measure seven times and you cut just once. So this principle works. And our technological systems allow us, touch wood, to prevent such accidents.</p>
          <p>But offshore drilling technology is unique as of today, and can't be compared to anything. So if you just have a look at the past 20 years, you'll see that technology has been developing into two areas. ITC, information and communication technology, that has made a lot of progress. And number two is oil production.</p>
          <p>So imagine when you're drilling at the depth of two or three kilometers, and you're doing it with robots, so remember, recently we had problems with this submarine. And here it's a lot more operations you have to perform because people cannot work at such depths.</p>
          <p>And the drilling vessel is controlled by special positioning system above this well two or three kilometers is the sea depth. And it cannot get away from this drilling port more than 10 or 12 centimeters despite stormy winds. So you can imagine all kind of technology this entails. So hopefully BP will be able to learn lessons to prevent such accidents in the future, and will be able to cope with this ongoing problem over the next few weeks. So maybe they will just do a sidetrack or something. And all the oil companies will feel good after that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ron Smith, Chevroc. I have a question for you. So it is your reports, and you said that in March in London that oil production in West Siberia is limited because of power generation problems. So do you still have those problems? And, if yes, when could it be resolved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, circuits connected to gas utilization, and it is set to be increased to 90%. And LUKOIL is a leader, and gas usage is closely linked to our own power generation capacity. Since such capacities are being put in place, so this should be over the next 20 years.</p>

          <p>Speaking of gas, this is my second question. So after this line and gas demand in Russia and worldwide and with this increase on the supply side which then Russia does worldwide, so have your gas production and sales plans changed in any way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is a very good question. I could give you a lecture on that. But we revised our gas production programs very carefully. We think that the world has changed from the gas production point of view. And this gas deficit we could see in 2008 has now turned into surplus, and the gas price is going to be much lower than we had expected. It will be about $200, maybe a little bit more per thousand cubic meters. And the Russian domestic price is going to go up to this level too.</p>
          <p>So gas exports should become marginal business. And spot contracts in the Russian Federation should give you more revenues. So that is our strategy. That is why we are planning to produce under that gas that we will find around consumers in this market.</p>
          <p>So from this point of view this power generation strategy, this migration towards high value added chemical operations, so just they go very simple to give the maximum return of our investment into our gas flow from the Russian Federation. And you've got Central Asia where we have huge volumes. Well, there is a unique gas market there, and that market is going to develop.</p>
          <p>Today we're not seeing any problems. So the gas price we're going to &#x2013; we expect to see should go up to 150 to $200 per thousand cubic meters over the next five years. That should give us a pretty good return on our gas investments. But overall we will be more focused on oil production, of course.</p>

          <p>Once again, Mr. Kolova, Reen RST. In Iraq on September 1 there'll be a tender for a three new gas fields. Are you interested in those fields? And are you going into the consortium <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are monitoring our project in the world, but we have not yet reached the final decision on that yet. Well, we have some questions from our Internet users, so we shouldn't forget about them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What will be your cost in Ivory Coast. What are your plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is not a dry well, it is an exploration well, which confirmed the availability of oil and gas. And like any field like that, so what you do at those wells you shut them down and cement them immediately, like in Ivory Coast and Ghana. But we will continue drilling in that region. We have no doubts about that, and so we will all have production.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So basically you made a technological mistake here. What is your internal rate of return from your new projects &#x2013; E&amp;P project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are not looking at an internal rate of return of less than 15%, only it is more than 25%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you plan to grow your production by 1%. Given your excellent May figures it's very unlikely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually we're talking about the growth of 1% to 2% in hydrocarbons. And we can confirm this figure, and it was confirmed by our reports today. For crude oil, like I said, this West Siberia question it is about technology and tax breaks. We cannot resolve those questions quickly. Thank you so much. Let's take our last question.</p>

          <p>Argus Agency. About two years ago and you bought this Turkish retail chain, Akpet. So are you happy with this acquisition? So what are the key performance indicators from that asset? And as far as I know the Company was building gas liquefaction terminal. So are you developing those plans that the previous owner had started or have they been suspended?</p>
          <p>My second question is just completely different. So are you still having talks with AK Transneft on using the deeper pipelines to supply crude oil to the Odessa refinery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will not comment on the second question. For Akpet, yes, we made this acquisition. It is a regular retail chain. It does not have a huge profile. It does not have &#x2013; it does not have a strong impact on our overall net income. Despite the crisis they give us positive margin. So the acquisition had the goal of selling our refined products from our refineries in Bulgaria and Sicily. So it is a pretty good acquisition, pretty good economics. Well it is in Turkey, in Antalya.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we are finishing the construction of a new terminal near Antalya. So when you're going to Antalya you're going to see new LUKOIL retail stations. But the margin from those assets is not very high, but we have profitability. But you need to have it in your value chain for any oil company.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
