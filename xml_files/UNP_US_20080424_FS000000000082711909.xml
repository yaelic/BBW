      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Rob Knight, our CFO; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Dennis Duffy, Executive Vice President of Operations.</p>
          <p>I'm happy to report a strong start to the quarter here. We're reporting record first quarter earnings. Union Pacific earned $1.70 per share in the quarter, a 21% increase over 2007. The key factor in this gain was the 10% increase in operating income, the first quarter best 788 million. Despite a variety of challenges in the quarter from continued economic weakness, ongoing turmoil in the financial markets, the endless climb in fuel prices and weather challenges, we remain focused on improving profitability.</p>
          <p>If you look at what drove our performance in the first quarter, it was really the strong fundamentals of our company. Despite a soft economic environment, UP's franchise diversity provided a solid demand base. Record shipments of coal and strong grain movement, allowed us to offset double-digit volume declines in products such as lumber, finished vehicles and cement.</p>
          <p>Our continued focus on price produced record first quarter operating revenue of 4.3 billion, that's up 11% to a year ago. Offsetting a portion of our strong revenue growth was another quarter of record diesel fuel prices. Although we can't do much to influence commodity markets, we are working to minimize the impacts for our fuel surcharge programs, as well as improve our fuel efficiency.</p>
          <p>The benefits of ongoing operating initiatives were evident, as we improved employee productivity, asset utilization and overall network fluidity.</p>
          <p>In addition, the railroad's operating resiliency enabled us improve customer service despite a tough operating environment. We are delivering a more valuable service product to our customers and in turn they are rewarding us with profitable business.</p>
          <p>Overall, it was a good quarter for us as we converted record revenue and reliable efficient service into strong bottom-line growth. These results are a testament to the hard-working men and women of Union Pacific. As many of you know, a stretch of our mainline in Oregon was out of service for the majority of the first quarter. Thanks for the commitment and dedication of our operating team, who literally moved a mountain, we resumed limited operations on that line a few weeks ago. We also appreciate our customers' patience during this time.</p>
          <p>So, with that let me turn it over to Jack now for a breakdown of our first quarter revenue. Jack?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jim. Good morning. Well, by way of overview, all sets of our businesses posted best ever records for average revenue per car in the first quarter, driving an 11% growth in freight revenue to 4.1 billion, even as the economic softness held our volumes flat.</p>
          <p>Our Ag products team, chemicals and energy set their best ever revenue marks while the other three groups had record first quarters and at the same time customer satisfaction again showed year-over-year improvement.</p>
          <p>Turn the chart to page six. Chart makes it pretty easy to see which markets were impacted by the economic softness. Our automotive business declined 6% with growth in parts partially offsetting the effect of the sluggish vehicle sales. Of course in addition to the economic softness the American Axle strike which began in late February has also lowered volume, and it reduces our revenue by about $15 million every month that that strike continues.</p>
          <p>Slumping construction markets continued to impact industrial products, but the good news in our industrial products business was a 17% increase in steel shipment. Low inventory is creating a strong domestic market and high prices for foreign steel are limiting imports. Intermodal volumes also continue to be impacted by the economy.</p>
          <p>Ag products revenue grew 10% with strength in grain shipment especially in the export market. Demand for coal remained strong and a 34% increase in export potash allowed the chemicals team to post a slight gain.</p>
          <p>I am going to take you through a look at three of businesses a little more closely; that will Ag products, energy and intermodal. We'll start with Ag products. That business posted the largest revenue gain as the 10% growth in volume combined with a 13% improvement in average revenue per car to drive revenue up 24%. Wheat shipments increased over 50% with favorable commodity prices, above average production and a weak U.S. dollar, all combining to nearly double exports.</p>
          <p>A weak dollar also helped drive feed grain exports up 32% and much of the growth coming in milo destined for the European market. Both wheat and feed benefited from improved shuttle train productivity. We expect that the export markets are going to stay strong and be a key driver of Ag products growth throughout 2008. Ethanol and DDG has continued their growth as well with volumes up about 19% and about the only area of softness that we did see in our Ag products business was import beer where high inventory levels were still being worked off in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our energy revenue was up 17% with volume up 6% and an 11% increase in average revenue per car. Continued strong demand along with more normal coal production and improved network efficiency drove the Southern Powder River Basin volume up 7%, setting new records for trains, tons, and carloads.</p>
          <p>Colorado-Utah volumes were up 4% for the quarter and were also aided by better production and improved service performance. Now in January, we talked about the fact that although demand in the Colorado-Utah market looked flat, emerging export opportunities could drive a more favorable outlook, so with the shortfall of coal to meet demand in the global market and the weak dollar, we now expect that that business will be about a 4% increase.</p>
          <p>The FCRB outlook remains unchanged at about 5% with a strong demand from existing customers. With an 8% improvement in average revenue per unit, intermodal revenue grew 5%, even though volume ran 3% below year ago levels. Overall West Coast port volumes were down due to the continued softness of the U.S. economy and we saw that impact in our international segment where volume declined 5%.</p>
          <p>Volume in our domestic business was flat year-over-year as growth in the legacy contract business offset other business losses. We expect intermodal to gain some strength here in the second half and to be flat versus last year, when 2008 ramps up. Continued service improvement supports yield gains and helps us capitalize on business opportunities but most importantly it leads to higher levels of customer satisfaction. Our customer satisfaction index climbed to 81 in the first quarter which was up two points from last year.</p>
          <p>Our outlook calls for the second quarter &#x2013; its going to look a like it did in the first. Ag products and energy should continue strong, offsetting continued weaknesses in the automotive and industrial product segments. Looks like chemical volumes will stay pretty solid and intermodal should run closer to year ago levels. Put it altogether and we expect overall volume in the second quarter to be down 1% to flat versus a year ago.</p>
          <p>Our full year outlook remains unchanged in the range of down 1 to plus 1 by year end. The primary driver of revenue growth is going to be our continued focus on yield and we expect our core price increase to stay in the 5 to 6% range throughout the year.</p>
          <p>With that I am going to turn it over to Dennis for the operating review.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jack and good morning. The operating team continued its efforts in the first quarter to drive better service to our customers and bring efficiency gains to the bottom-line. The starting point for operations is safety where we continue drive improvements in the employee, public and derailment prevention areas. The main emphasis here is our total safety culture and zero tolerance mentality.</p>
          <p>From a train operations and service delivery standpoint, we had another quarter of strong improvement. We are running a more resilient network today as a result of our capital programs, unified plan efforts and continuous process innovation. We are also using our resources more efficiently, reducing train starts, increasing train length and speeding asset turns.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we held 1% more gross ton-miles, with 4% fewer first crew starts and 7% less yard and local starts. In the Powder River Basin, train length grew to nearly 131 cars per train in the first quarter, which will move more than 100 additional loaded coal trains of coal in '08 versus '07 without any additional crews or locomotives. We achieved these results despite a challenging winter environment. As Jim mentioned, we were without the use of our mainline between Klamath Falls and Eugene, Oregon for the majority of the quarter.</p>
          <p>While our engineering team was dedicated to the task of reopening this line, the rest of the operating group focused on maintaining service to our customers in the most efficient expeditious manner. The results of those efforts can be seen in our overall network's performance metric. As you can see by the bars in the upper left corner, we had a significant increase in the level of network disruption, up 22%. Despite that, we made a nice pick up in system velocity, gaining a half mile per hour during the quarter. We also managed a slight improvement in our terminal dwell and reduced our inventory levels by 1%.</p>
          <p>As Jack just showed you, we continue to improve the service product we are delivering to our customers, through measures that are very visible from a customer perspective, our industry Spot/Pull and freight car utilization. Spot/Pull metric measures our first and last interface with the customer: did we pull the car from the customers' facility, and did we deliver the car to the customer within the designated time period.</p>
          <p>Freight car utilization which measures the days between originated carloads was a first quarter best, 9.9 days. Union Pacific and our customers benefit from this in the form of lower cost with both reduced daily equipment <mark type="inaudible" /> as well as long-term capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>We are also managing our unit cost with greater employee productivity and fuel efficiency. Our efforts to reduce train starts and increase train length are reflected in a 4% increase in gross ton-miles haul per employee. We talk with you quarterly about fuel efficiency and our efforts to move more freight with less diesel fuel. Given the huge step up in fuel prices, those efforts have never been more important.</p>
          <p>In the quarter we achieved a first quarter best level at 1.28 gallons per thousand gross ton-miles. Again, this is something that benefits both UP and our customers. Rails are roughly three times more fuel efficient than trucks, so we have a natural cost advantage. Through a combination of our conservation efforts and technology improvements, we have the ability to further enhance fuel efficiency and related bottom-line results.</p>
          <p>As demonstrated in our network efficiency and customer service performance, we are achieving greater asset productivity which in turn gives us flexibility in our resource planning. Although we want to ensure the railroad is resourced to handle whatever the economy, our customers or mother nature brings our way, we plan for this in the most productive and cost efficient manner.</p>
          <p>From a crew standpoint, we currently plan to hire about 2,000 new conductors. Although this hiring level would be back fill for the preponderance of this, we expect attrition to take somewhere more than 2,000 and we have the ability to scale that hiring up or down depending on demand. Because we still have a couple of hundred employees furloughed today, we have some volume variability with our current employee base.</p>
          <p>On the locomotive side, we also have a good plan in place to update the fleet, bringing on 175 fuel efficient environmentally friendly new road locomotives, and at the same time we are also turning back more than 200 older leased units and parking up to 400 in our surge fleet.</p>
          <p>If we look further at where we plan to spend our capitals and capital dollars in 2008, the plan is somewhat similar to what we did last year. Our maintenance-of-way budget is 1.6 billion. Those dollars allow us to improve safety, increase service reliability, provide for growth and enhance productivity.</p>
          <p>On the locomotive side and freight car side, I've already discussed our 175 locomotive adds for the year. This is 125 fewer locomotives than we bought in '07. So the total locomotive spend is less versus last year.</p>
          <p>For freight cars, we are going to add 300 covered hoppers to support our agricultural business, which is clearly in strong demand. Capital spending both in terms of new track and terminals is expected to total about 840 million, that's capacity spending. Approximately 85% of this spending is devoted to adding capacity in the Sunset Corridor and the Red X areas of the Central Corridor.</p>
          <p>So, as we move forward into the second quarter of '08, our operating priorities are unchanged. Operate a safer railroad, provide an enhanced service product to our customers and continue to drive productivity and throughput to create value for all of our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn it over to Rob.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Dennis and good morning. Before I get into the details on the first quarter, I'd like to call your attention to a couple of changes in our income statement. As a result of system enhancements and to improve the clarity of our financial statements, we have reclassified the components of operating revenues into freight revenue and other. We have also revamped our expense categories to give everyone a better view into our business. We are reporting fuel as a standalone category and have combined purchased services and materials into one line. In addition, certain other expenses were reclassified among the operating expense categories. Of course, none of these changes impact previously reported earnings.</p>
          <p>On the Investor Relations page of our website, we have provided reclassified quarterly numbers for 2007, 2006, and 2005 as well as a brief description of the account changes. This information should be helpful for you in updating your models.</p>
          <p>Turning the income statement summary. First quarter operating revenue grew 11% to $4.3 billion. Quarterly operating expenses increased $352 million to just under 3.5 billion. The primary driver of the higher expense was a 45% increase in fuel expense. We also experienced higher costs associated with the Oregon mudslide, which added around $20 million of operating expense to the quarter. The mudslide will also have a capital impact. Although there is still work being done, we currently are estimating between 60 and $70 million of capital to repair that line. We do have some insurance that should help offset a portion of this, so we will be pursuing that over the next several months.</p>
          <p>The net result of our operations was 10% growth in operating income to a first quarter best $788 million. The primary driver of operating revenue growth was a $404 million increase in freight revenue to $4.1 billion. Our continued focus on price as well as increased fuel surcharge revenue associated with rising diesel fuel prices drove the year-over-year gain.</p>
          <p>Splitting up the 11% increase in freight revenue, we would say about half was core price and half was from our fuel cost recovery. Today, roughly 25% of our total book of business is still under legacy contract. And in the near term, as we experience strong volume growth under those old legacy deals, it holds back our overall yields. As you know legacy contracts do not reflect current market prices and lack adequate fuel surcharge mechanisms.</p>
          <p>Our quarterly business mix was better than originally anticipated. Greater than expected movements of long-haul export grain, as well as increased Colorado-Utah coal moves added to our first quarter growth. First quarter other revenue increased 9% or $17 million to $211 million. The primary driver of this increase was higher revenue from subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>First quarter compensation and benefits expense declined 3% in the quarter to $1.1 billion. Greater employee productivity allowed us to lower workforce levels by 3%, primarily through attrition. Fewer train starts and lower training costs contributed to greater efficiency across our company. Looking ahead at the year, we will continue to align our hiring plans and workforce levels with anticipated volume and productivity.</p>
          <p>Turning now to fuel expense, this category increased $295 million to $957 million. Despite moving 1% more gross ton-miles, we consumed 2 million fewer gallons of diesel fuel as we continue our focused efforts on conservation. Unfortunately, this improved consumption was more than offset by a 47% increase in prices during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Average first quarter diesel fuel prices increased nearly $1 year-over-year from $1.93 per gallon in 2007 to $2.84 a gallon this year. Of course, as you all know prices have increased dramatically in the last month and remain at historically high levels. In fact, we are currently paying around $3.40 per gallon and could average close to that price in the second quarter. This would be more than a 50% increase from last year's quarterly price of $2.20 per gallon. And as we've said, we are focused on obtaining 100% fuel surcharge recovery, but until we reprice all of our legacy contracts, we are not fully protected from rising fuel prices. As a result, fuel cost will be a challenge to earnings throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Purchased services and materials expense were up 6% in the quarter to $469 million. We would attribute roughly one-third of the increased cost to the Oregon mudslide as third party contractors were employed to help us to reopen that line. In addition, we experienced increased joint facility expenses as well as higher crew transportation and lodging expenses.</p>
          <p>Equipments and other rent expense totaled $342 million in the first quarter, up only 1%. Although we continued to improve our equipment utilization during the quarter, those gains were offset by higher locomotive lease expense related to our 2007 acquisitions and car hire reclaims.</p>
          <p>Other expense increased 23% or $46 million in the first quarter to $242 million. The majority of the increase relates to last year's actuarial study which resulted in a $30 million casualty expense reduction. And although we continue to benefit from our improved safety performance in the form of lower quarterly accrual rate, the year-over-year comparison is unfavorable. We also experienced cost inflation related to increased utility costs and higher state and local taxes.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide 28, we illustrate the drivers of our first quarter operating ratio. Our first quarter 2008 operating ratio was 81.5%. The effect of increased fuel expenses, net of fuel surcharges added 3 points in the quarter. We also had the impact of last year's casualty accrual and the Oregon mudslide. Against these combined headwinds, we've made great progress. Strong operating revenue growth and overall efficiency gains took over 4 points off of the operating ratio nearly offsetting the cost challenges. Importantly if you set aside these costs, we basically held our quarterly unit cost flat versus last year</p>
          <p>Turning now to the full income statement. First quarter other income totaled $25 million, up 10 million year-over-year as a result of increased gains from real estate sales and higher lease income. For the full year, we now expect other income to be in the range of 75 to $100 million. Interest expense increased 13 million or 12% to $126 million driven by higher debt levels. Income taxes grew 4% to $244 million, as a result of higher pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate of 35.5% was 2.3 points lower than last year's rate as a result of a state tax law change. For the balance of 2008, we expect our effective tax rate to be around 37%.</p>
          <p>Net income grew 15% to $443 million, a first quarter best. Our diluted shares outstanding declined 4% year-over-year, contributing to the 21% increase in first quarter earnings per share of $1.70. We continue to produce solid earnings growth in a challenging business environment.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we continue to purchase shares buying back 3.3 million shares of UP common stock for a total cost of around $400 million.  Since inception we have repurchased roughly 15.9 million of our 20 million share program returning nearly $1.9 billion in cash to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 31, and our balance sheet. We remain comfortable with our current balance sheet strategy. Over the last 12 months; our total debt increased nearly $1.7 billion and added over 3 points to our debt to capital ratio. We continue to generate capacity on our balance sheet through improved profitability and we are using that capacity in a balanced approach to invest in our business, pay dividends and return cash through our share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>As we look out at the second quarter and the remainder of the year, the two biggest variables are car load volumes and fuel prices. As Jack discussed earlier, we expect second quarter volumes to be in the range of down 1% to flat versus last year. Combining that volume outlook with diesel fuel prices around $3.40 per gallon, we expect second quarter earnings to be between a $1.80 and a $1.95 per share or 9 to 18% growth.</p>
          <p>The impact of fuel alone in the second quarter would increase locomotive fuel cost by $180 million or more from the first quarter levels. Although we will recover a portion of that through our surcharge programs, the two month lag will push some of that recovery to the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Setting aside the impact of higher diesel fuel prices, pricing gains and productivity will continue in the second quarter and increase overall profitability for our company. For the full year 2008, we had originally expected annual fuel prices to increase 15 to 20%. Today it seems likely that annual diesel costs will be substantially higher than that. Despite that headwind however we are not changing our full year earnings guidance of $7.75 to $8.25 per share.</p>
          <p>Clearly higher fuel prices will impact our earnings, but fuel generally has a greater impact on a quarterly basis than it does over the course of the full year. As I just mentioned, this is because of our two months lag in our surcharge programs.</p>
          <p>High fuel prices will also affect our ability to show operating ratio improvement in 2008. As we consume over 1 billion gallons of diesel fuel annually, rising diesel prices make fuel expense a bigger and bigger part of total operating expense, over 27% for us in the first quarter. And just the math of rising fuel surcharge revenue and fuel expense results in a higher operating ratio even if we had 100% recovery, which we do not.</p>
          <p>So, although 2008 is shaping up to be a challenging year, we are confident that our ongoing initiatives to improve profitability and drive efficiency will result in solid earnings growth.</p>
          <p>So with that, turn it back over to Jim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Rob. When we laid out our 2008 plan for you back in January, our message was pretty simple. Although we expected external factors such as the economy, high diesel fuel prices to challenge us, we are committed to deliver a record year for our shareholders. Our opportunities are clearly within our control and we have initiatives underway that will help us achieve our objectives. Union Pacific will continue to improve safety, drive greater productivity across the organization and increase customer value.</p>
          <p>With that, we've got there some time here to take few of your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, good morning. Just to start off, great job in covering the spicy &#x2013; the network downside in the upper west. But just looking at the coal side, you talked about how the continued growth you are expecting from the shipments. Can you talk a bit about how if we are seeing any of the PRB volumes to make up what is now moving export from the East Coast, are you seeing more and more of that PRB shipments go East?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, I'll let Jack take this in minute but I know it's overall &#x2013; the export impact really, it has an indirect influence in PRB. We're not seeing a surge in terms of requests for &#x2013; that it would displace Eastern coal. We've got enough demand here just domestically that, out of PRB now we are talking about that we see can be pretty strong here going forward here. Colorado-Utah has been a little bit of a surprise to us as you know. I think Jack mentioned, we were expecting flat volume, we were about 4% up, some of that could have some impact, particularly a little bit going west but, Jack, is there anything I missed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know Ken, actually what we are seeing is the more likely impact is in Colorado-Utah. We are moving probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 million tons now export heading primarily to the river and then beyond. But we are getting more phone calls as Europe gets <mark type="inaudible" /> and the coal imports come off of East Coast mines moving to Europe, there's a lot more interest being generated. But right now the interest is more for the higher BTU Colorado-Utah coal than it is PRB.</p>

          <p>Is there capacity to handle that increase demand?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think we are in fairly good shape and actually the mines have held up. We, time to time, have had problems with some of the Colorado-Utah mines in terms of their geology and things like that but I'll tell you, right at the moment, mines are doing well, we are doing well. The market is pretty hot, so we are feeling pretty good about it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>PRB has the capacity; Colorado-Utah will be stretched. Any way you look at &#x2013; I mean the potential to see any kind of a major surge coming out of it. There is a little bit of upside, but not significant.</p>

          <p>The network interruption days, that was an interesting one on the slide. I don't think I have seen that before on your slides. How do you measure that?</p>

          <p>Ken we look at any time that we incur 50 or more greater train hours in any one particular day from an incident, then we characterize that as a service interruption day.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, now the exposure on the insurance from the problems in Upper West. Are you still exposed about $25 million of that total amount that you had given?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Ken, again I think you have to be careful on the timing of the insurance recovery. We are not assuming anything in our financials right now. That will be a long drawn out process, out there going forward. Most of it will hit capital. The pressure we will see from this thing for the year will be the 60 to $70 million capital hit we are going to take. Rob, if you want to...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's right. It will be &#x2013; generally the deductible is that 25 but Jim is right it will be, it will be a long drawn out process here which as I mentioned a majority of that costs that we incurred is on the capital side.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great one last question if I may. On the amount of locomotives, sounds like you are turning back in a lot of older locomotives, the 222 you mentioned and you are only adding 175, should we see &#x2013; kind of a &#x2013; can we see a sizable decrease in your rents going forward because of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you will see a lower &#x2013; by the end of the year here we'll have fewer locomotives operating in our property. You should see some reduction going forward. On the other hand if the amount of volume picks up in terms of the need to maybe go back in the short term lease market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wanted to drill down a little bit on fuel and try to understand the impact in the quarter and then going forward. In fourth quarter period you had the timing impact with maybe a greater effect. In first quarter as you look at surcharge and increase in expense, do you think that it was kind of neutral or headwind or tailwind, how would you look at that and then I guess second quarter does it looks like it's a much greater headwind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean it was clearly a headwind for us in the first quarter Tom. I mean rough numbers we &#x2013; our expense was up roughly $300 million on the cost side. We recovered roughly 200 million more if you look at it, in terms of the yield. So clearly it was a headwind for us. Second quarter, we'll see what fuel prices do but as I mentioned we are looking at currently high spot levels or prices that we are paying around 3.40. That's going to create a headwind for us which were always with that 2 month lag, we are always behind when it's in a rising price environment. Now that goes both ways; when the prices soften, we'll see the benefits. But in a rising price environment, it creates a headwind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom with our legacy contracts as we talked about, there is just no question we challenged to recover fuel and it's just going to take time and focus to as these things come up get the right fuel recovery mechanism in there. But as long as prices continue to go up, we are going to have a problem with each quarter. As Rob said, we get and who knows, I mean it is anybody's guess, where at some point, things do move a little bit in cycles and you get the reverse effect. But our goal is to get 100% fuel recovery and make it a neutral in our business going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Okay. In terms of the 11% yield was there any mix or was it purely 5.5 from price and 5.5 from year-over-year increase in fuel surcharges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is some mix in there when you look at it, if you recall Rob was talking little bit about our legacy contracts that we saw some pretty decent growth on those legacy contracts which quite honestly, there is not much in there in terms of price or where it reflects in the market. So it did hold down. It actually negatively impacted our overall yields.</p>
          <p>But I will tell you, 5 to 6% is what we said have earlier for the year on our core price. We are sticking to that. There are some markets today that are hotter then that. You look at some of these commodity markets like coal, ag that are out here. The market is pretty hot. On the other side domestic intermodal pretty weak, international intermodal pretty weak. But where in some of the markets the pricing opportunity is little bit stronger than others but we are sticking to our 5 to 6%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And do you care to quantify in the legacy contracts if you look at your volume growth for business under those contracts versus what total volumes were? What was the volume growth in the legacy contracts? Do you have a sense of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know what, I really don't, I haven't broken it out that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We aren't looking at it that way but we do know that the legacy growth was on the higher than average side but we haven't given that number precisely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right okay and then on the opportunity that comes from high fuel prices, you have -- I guess your franchise isn't tremendously leveraged to things domestic intermodal but it would seem that truckers are extremely challenged with the high fuel prices and I am wondering where do you see potential opportunity for some business to come to the railroad versus truck just as the fuel prices are really, really hurting the truckers a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Tom there is no question the pressure is there. We are seeing more interest. I think you have to be careful on the one side there is lot of pressure but I will tell you there is also lot of these truckers have just basically try to get some positive cash flow so that can put some pressure on pricing the short term which we see. But long term I will tell you again we look at intermodal and coal as our highest growth potentials. I just don't see the cost pressure changing on the truck side and that in my mind is really bodes well for us in terms of intermodal network. Jack you want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I think that's right and I think as we move into peak season you will see things perk up again, obviously we could put a lot more business on the railroad if we wanted to change our pricing strategy which we don't, so... that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great, good quarter and thanks for the time.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" /> Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we get an update, Dennis on the Oregon outage? What exactly is going on in terms of I get the sense you're mostly through it but there is still a little bit of digging out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah that's a fair characterization, <mark type="inaudible" /> What we did was, we restored the service on a night time basis, we take about a 10 hour window at night to run trains through there. What we are in the process of doing now is cleaning up the unsuitable material that poses a risk to be able to come down on us in future operations. So we think -- we are gaining on that and we should get that behind us here, hopefully within the next 30 days and be back to a full regular operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So assuming another 30 days, so it's two-thirds of your quarter or something like that, what's the impact or the drag that we should think about from Oregon this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it cost us about a nickel, in the first quarter. I would -- my gut says maybe half that you think about for second quarter. There is several components of it, lost revenue, we have some business, intermodal moved down the highway. You had out-of-route miles that came through, in terms of running it where we could, around through the Salt Lake-Ogden and back up. And then again lost asset utilization. So there is both an operating cost and revenue component on there, and yeah again my gut says maybe half of what we saw the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the auto side if I look at the strike which seems to gotten worse not better recently, what's the impact as you think about that if it were to last the whole quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's cost us $14 million in first quarter. It's costing us $14 million a month, and it's anybody's guess where that will come back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So 14 million if we did that times three that's kind of a worst case scenario?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now that's revenue, what's the earnings impact to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the short term <mark type="inaudible" /> a lot of that falls to bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Why are you laughing at me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I am not going to give you the margins on the auto business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Labor head count down 3.3 and you made some comments about hiring but also attrition, how should we think about that moving forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, it looks like we'll hire about in total, 4000 employees for the year. We're going to lose about 4200, 4500 employees, so net-net, you'll see that differential there. Again, part of this is really a function of how we look for volume going forward. I expect our productivity numbers &#x2013; they need to continue to improve, and again it's a wild card. What we have to be careful of here, is you can take a lot of cost out pretty quick in an organization but when that business comes back. We are very focused on maintaining our surge capability. We've got &#x2013; what do we have, 300, 400 locomotives sitting in storage right now. I have got about 15,000 freight cars in storage. We have on our train and engine crew side, the furloughs today are about 300. Now that's down from the peak where we were about 8 to 900. But we want to make certain we have the right balance between surge recovery and efficiency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack had mentioned intermodal strength, a couple of times expected it, for at least it to improve in the second half and also said that it's not going to be based on going to get it on price. What's the confidence? Is it just easier comps? Is it fuel being at these prices? Why are you so confident in intermodal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, when we just look at the supply-demand situation that's out there <mark type="inaudible" /> I think it's going to be okay. I think you will actually see volume levels pick up during kind of the peak season kind of thing, although it probably won't be as robust as we have seen in the past, but I think it will be there for us. I also think that you will see some &#x2013; there are some pressures in the trucking industry and I do think you will see some of those guys starting to fold up and you'll see some of that kind of take pressure off and put more opportunity for us in the domestic world for the rail side. So, just everything that we look at kind of tells us it's going to perk up here a little bit. It's not going to be an outstanding season, but the domestic side of the business, it is going to help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah there is another factor we didn't really talk about which is our really very good service. As we put new service products into the market, we show the consistency. Customers don't automatically switch. We are proving that we can provide a good consistent service in the market and that's where we are also seeing more calls. Not only the costs from the trucking side are pressured, but good service products we're putting in the market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are also expanding some service out of Northern California and other places and taking advantage of the new train service with <mark type="inaudible" /> and things like that. So, we've got some growth opportunities there that are pretty attractive from an overall -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was my follow-up. Is the Meridian Speedway starting to open up a little bit for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually it is. We lost a little business there that we talked about I think in the last quarter, with a contract shift, but we are rebuilding it fine and customers like the service, its great performance, very reliable and I think that's going to be one of our growth features for the rest of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Last question and then I'll pass it off. Just could you give an update on the Sunset Corridor and the timing for when you think the double track will be done from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are sticking to our original timeframe on that, <mark type="inaudible" /> We are doing what we said we would do this year and that is about 36 miles of additional construction. We're going to do somewhere about 140 miles of additional grading and we are on target to get all of that accomplished and we are working with Arizona to get our permitting issues behind us there as well as the local communities in Arizona. So, we are staying with the original timeframe. We'd like to be somewhere in that first part of 2011, have it behind us.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" /> Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just quickly to follow-up on intermodal there. There has been some press reports about container shortages. Has that limited your ability to grow intermodal at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not substantially at all. No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then when we think about the repricing story, you said you got 6% of the revenue that's repricing this year. How does the timing of that work? Did you have 6% reprice in the first quarter or does it kind of layer in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of it is back end loaded, end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what are we really seeing in the first quarter. Is it really what you were able to reprice in 2006 then, and then you'll get the kicker in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, yes sorry. '07, right. And then can I ask on fuel, do you see any sort of demand elasticity as these fuel surcharges keep rising? Recognizing that truck should lose more than you do, but also obviously it's hard to change with a two week move in oil of $17 per barrel, you're not going to change your whole supply chain. So do you see shippers reacting at all from a volume standpoint or they just sort of accept it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in some cases we are &#x2013; again at the end of the day for a customer, it's the total cost, core price plus fuel surcharge and they are going to make their decisions in terms of where there might be an alternative mode that gives them more economics. In some cases, you can find some pretty low costs in the markets. But what we are trying to work with our customers on is long-term. In some cases, there is some business that quite honestly, probably shouldn't be moving on the railroad. Again, you look at the efficiency, you look at the density, you look at length of haul, that's out here, so we are losing, and have lost some business. That's out here, but nothing in terms of that I am overly concerned with. Again rationalizing the network and what business moves on here is a long-term process.</p>

          <p>Our leverage ratios, you saw today that the capital ratio was up. We think as we improve our profitability, we have capacity on the balance sheet. We haven't given a target in terms of what we are aiming for other than being a solid BBB-flat rated kind of metrics, is how we look at it and the -- as we mentioned earlier on the mudslide for the second quarter, I think Jim said about half of the impact would be a reasonable assumption, second quarter, which call that about $0.02.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. One, have you seen, given how lean truck price has been in the last couple of quarters, have you seen the competitive environment spill over into any other commodity type other than intermodal in terms of more aggressive truck pricing for other types of commodities?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have. We have seen it in our industrial products. Actually, John, the way you would look at it, is any business that is susceptible to truck which covers a wide spread group of things. Our industrial products business would be one in particular, some of the non-specialty chemicals, a little bit of impact there. But it really kind of boils down to Jim's comment, of the total price, when you add fuel surcharge and the freight rate together and what you find is the business that we tend to lose is the business where we were stretching to keep it on the railroad to begin with. And that's what starts to fall off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Jim to your comment about there being some freight currently on the rails that maybe shouldn't be some &#x2013; is that causing you any issues in terms of operational performance. I mean, could your operational performance be a stair step function better, if some of that freight that maybe should be on the highway or elsewhere wasn't in your system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, John, I don't see a major stair step function there. We just have to keep at it in terms of processes, capacity that's out here. I would tell you, well we had a &#x2013; and we always remind we have winter every year. So we don't want to make it the big issue but I'll tell you, our network with the issues we have, we really showed a great capability recover and I don't, I just don't see that on the &#x2013; taking a huge chunk of business off, there would be this step function.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know John, Dennis and I when we came into the 2003-2004 and the problems that we hadthere, our teams kind of sat down as we did the unified plan and really looked at prices where there were operational issues associated with business and I think we pretty well cleaned the franchise up on those kinds of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay very good. The barge companies are really struggling right now, I guess. Again, winter did show up in the first quarter. I think it was some of the worst winter conditions I had seen on the rivers in a couple of years and then one of the companies was talking about, second quarter is going to be negatively impacted by high river conditions on the Mississippi. Is your bulk franchise doing a little bit better than you would have expected because of some market share? When oil <mark type="inaudible" /> 75 bucks a barrel, or wherever it was, I can't even keep up with it anymore. But the comments were made at the time that the forward curve on hedging and that type of thing wasn't that attractive and obviously nobody had the <mark type="inaudible" /> to think that oil was going to 120 a barrel or whatever we may get to. But I'm just curious, given the rapid spike and how fast it keeps going up and the fact that it just never seems to want to give any back. Have you guys started rethinking your strategy in terms of how you approach your fuel cost and yeah, you're doing a great job, a better job at the recovery and the surcharge programs. But is there another mechanism out there that you need to start exploring again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, John at the end of the day our best strategy is on the fuel surcharge, really. We have talked about it. We don't ignore it but I'll tell you I'd hate to get in a situation that I have locked in a future price and it falls and then I've got the worse of both worlds. Refunding, you are cutting your revenue side and you locked the high price in. It can work both ways, so, I just don't see that going forward here and as you said, I'm not sure anybody saw $118 crude, at least the experts I followed, very few of them had that on the agenda. So, again, our focus is on the fuel recovery, the fuel surcharge going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a price level that does become attractive from the standpoint of doing something on a hedge basis? I mean if oil was back into the mid 70s would you look to hedge at that point or is it hedges are kind of off limits and you are going to do this all through the surcharge mechanisms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only time we might look at it is where you get down to where we have the base coverage. You look at where these things could kick in, which is probably in more of the 50, $60 range but even that I would say I'd be hard pressed to say let's lock it up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question probably best aimed towards Jack regarding the downturn in international volume and how much of that you of that do you think is a function of the slow down of consumer consumption and how much of that is a function of the fact some of the retailers and the steamship companies running through the canals to the East Coast directly, which presumably will not bounce back to the west coast if the consumer starts to purchase again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I think primarily right now you are seeing the economic softness and high inventory levels and things like that. You are not seeing the retailers really buying a lot or stocking a lot. We are still seeing some impact from the shift from the west coast from the previous ILWU negotiation problems that were there, and you saw the big retailers shift distribution centers and things like that. So we are seeing some of that but that's working itself through the supply pipeline and I think what you are seeing right now is more of a function of the economy than you are of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That, I guess increases the likelihood that will bounce back here eventually. For Rob perhaps, I was a little surprised with your locomotive order in particular that you didn't talk at all about drawing maybe some of the '09 orders into '08 to take advantage of the bonus depreciation. Any thought along those lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John we'll take a look at it but at this point in time we don't have plans to pull out any capital spending as a result of the bonus depreciation. But we will continue to look at and it's really just a timing issue, as you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we will look at that but we don't have any plans to do that at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it possible to perhaps take advantage of that savings with some of the work that perhaps you plan to do in the second half of the year that isn't under contract yet? Is that something that is possible? I've heard that some of the other railroads are contemplating that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will definitely take advantage of the bonus depreciation. But the question would be whether not it causes us to pull something ahead is what we haven't determined to do yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, we've got a pretty healthy capital spend. I'm not &#x2013; 3.1 billion I am not &#x2013; I mean we are not going to ignore the economics of bonus depreciation. As Rob said, it's timing, but that's a pretty healthy spread, particularly given where the demand is right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. I understand the question. And maybe just one question on the regulatory front, we've heard that sometime during the second quarter the railroad industry perhaps with the AAR taking a lead it's going to make a proposal to the STB to factor in replacement costs into the calculation of ROIC which presumably would take the ROIC down quite a bit below the new weighted average cost of capital that is generated with the capital asset pricing model. Is that a fair assessment of where we are and it sounds to me like the STB is going to seriously consider this. Do you think there is a strong likelihood that this could be adopted and what sort of opposition might you get from some of the shipper groups?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John, as you know when I testified, I guess this was about a year ago now, I made a point of replacement costs and used several examples in terms of what it costs to replace bridges today and what I am pleased with is that the STB is considering it. Rob and his team have been working very hard with the other railroads in terms of methodologies. We'll see what happens. Again my comments when I am on the Hill is that what we have to keep in mind here is whatever methodology is picked will determine how much capital goes into business, because it is going to be function of the returns. And without considering replacement costs in the equation, you get to this point where you may say returns are capped, you are going to see capital pretty flat going forward. So, again I think there will be a nice debate. Rob, do you want to -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree with that. I mean, we believe in it strongly and we are going to put forth our view on it. We believe the STB as Jim said has certainly opened the door and receptive to reviewing and evaluating it and we will go from there.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Just in reference to your Ag business, I wonder if you guys could comment on the relative advantages of shipping out of the PNW [Pacific Northwest] versus the Gulf and whether more attractive shipping rates out of the PNW play to the strength of the Union Pacific versus shipping out of the Gulf?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to handle that Jack?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Randy the determinant is really the freight factors as we look at it today. We did see a significant increase in the PNW and that works out fairly well for us, but what we are really looking at right now is the balance between the Gulf and the PNW, and the markets will shift depending on ocean freight rates and things like that and we can play in either of those markets and play pretty darn effectively.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you don't have a preference, one way or the other?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess if I &#x2013; it really depends on rate levels, but I think intrinsically you would say that our franchise would probably favor the Gulf a little bit, but we're ideally suited to handle it either way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay one other question, just on the revenue side. Industrial products &#x2013; yourindustrial products division was up about 9%, which is relatively on the low end and I wonder what was going on there. Was it a mix issue in terms of the ARC increase or is that just competition from the trucks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you, you are looking at the average revenue per car?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Randy when you look at the marketplace right now in the industrial products world, the price increases that we are getting and that's a big book of business for us is heavily dominated by lumber and some of those and they are just not moving much product. So we are seeing a mix shift there, number one. Number two, in some of those markets, you probably see more like 2 to 3% price increases instead of, the opportunities that we have in export wheat and steel and some of the other things. So, I think it's more a reflection of the market and what's happening there than it is anything else. The economic recovery will benefit us enormously.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question I guess for Dennis, 4% productivity growth in the first quarter. That's &#x2013; I'm always impressed when that occurs in a winter. Was that just an easy year-over-year comp or is that kind of a sustainable rate in terms of labor productivity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we did have a nice year-over-year comp but we stressed that we want to have at least a minimum of 3 to 5% productivity Randy. So that's our internal, external target and we try and drive our whole organization that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last Rob, the guidance that you have given, is that now including a sort of 3.40 fuel price?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if the 3.40 is a bit &#x2013; is obviously a drag relative to what you were originally looking for, where is the offset <mark type="inaudible" /> thinking? Can you give me some sense as to sort of where you are getting positive variance relative to --</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I wish I knew the answer to that. We're suspecting that it's going to get a little stronger here than normal in the second quarter, that you're going to see a break and then it will resume after the Olympics.

          <p>We actually have looked at expanding some of the Blue Streak lines and opening up again, some of this Northern California business heading to Texas and other places, so we are evaluating opportunities where we can expand the product offering.</p>

          <p>Good morning Gary.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple quick ones and then maybe one for Jack or Jim. Dennis or Rob, when you talk about these network interruption days rising, is there a way you can generalize as to what the expense impact of that is or is kind of all over the place? What is it mean that you had 12 more network interruption days this quarter than you did last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it depends on what the interruption is so kind of short answer would be, it's all over the place in terms of what the dollar impact would be. I said though this mudslide cost us $20 million in the quarter, but you can't necessarily extrapolate every incident being exactly the same. So it does kind of depend upon what the incident is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you &#x2013; you noted the 180 million which I took to mean the variance in fuel price from the first to second quarter laid on top of the second quarter consumption is going to cost you 180 million right assuming 2Q is $3.40. What's a good assumption for the incremental surcharge recovery that you will get from that given the lag? About 120 or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to try and answer that? Again they are running up, its going to put pressure on us again, again as this keeps moving up. Rob I don't --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean 180 million, it's obviously not zero that would be an enormous number. So there has to be some significant portion --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't given a number on that but again it's a similar dynamic. Depends on exactly what the price is, what you're chasing it and where it is, but generally speaking we've got that two month lag so a two-third is kind of number as a guess, rough estimate in a rising price environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that and then Jack and/or Jim, you guys have talked and answer to a couple of prior questions about elasticity between modes as a result of some of the surcharges, just curious if you have heard any color about or any instances of just elasticity overall reaction to the total cost change and people saying well, we've decided to ship less as a result of the transportation cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah it really varies by commodity group and it's obvious when you look at the coal, ag and the ores that are out here, it's pretty hot and in terms of their pricing what we see in demand. On the other side where they have the capability to maybe consider moving business on the highway, there is some places again that we have found that price elasticity point but you have to, to me its important to understand the market, the competition in terms of what's driving us and whether it's short-term long-term deal. We could chase a lot of business by cutting prices right now, there is just no question in my mind when we look at where we are seeing some of this business flow. But I will tell you, and honestly, I just don't think that's the right thing to do for us long term. Jack? Do you...</p>

          <p>You know Gary I have not seen any indication that a customer stops producing product because of freight rates. It's really the market, it's really the demand for their product, it's their own productivity and ability to manufacture and produce a product more efficiently or effectively than the competition and it's not freight rates that differentiate whether or not the product gets made or not.</p>

          <p>I would. Well thank you everyone for attending our call this morning I would like to remind all of you that we do have our analyst meeting on May 15th in Chicago which we'll give you an update on our next five year outlook. I am pretty excited about the opportunities I see but we'll talk to you about both opportunities and challenges and hopefully we'll see all of you there. So again thank you for attending this morning.</p>
