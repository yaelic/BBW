      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Joining me on the call today with Sherry are Trip Tripathy, Jeff Naylor and Ernie Herrman. I'll start by saying that we are very pleased with our second quarter performance. Our 24% increase in adjusted EPS, excluding the charges detailed in today's press release, was achieved on top of record results last year on an adjusted basis. The second quarter demonstrates once again our ability to deliver quarter on top of quarter a strong performance and continues our trend of strong results despite a highly promotional retail environment.</p>
          <p>We executed well and marketed well and when the favorable weather in June boosted demand for summer apparel are great values appeal to customers in challenging times. We are pleased that traffic continued to be up during the quarter which bodes well for today as well as for the future.</p>
          <p>I want to emphasize again that TJX is not only a company for tough times, but for strong economics environments as well. In down economies, we tend to capture new customers, which is evident in our increased traffic and is an opportunity for us to build our customer base for the future.</p>
          <p>When times improve, our history has shown that our new customers stay with us because they love our value. At the same time, our pricing umbrella also rises when consumer demand is stronger, providing us an easier environment in which to operate.</p>
          <p>I'd like to address the commonly asked question regarding availability of merchandise and the impact on us when the department stores run with tighter inventories. Let me be clear, TJX has over 500 buyers, buying in more than 60 countries, working with the universe of over 10,000 vendors and growing every day. For example, one of our divisions opened several hundred new vendors in a period of three months. The impact the department store's tightening inventory level gives us just as much opportunity. It helps maintain a wider pricing gap between us and the department store and can increase average ticket.</p>
          <p>In addition, we had built very strong vendor relationships both domestically and internationally, allowing us to grow to a $20 billion company. I have complete faith that our model will allow us to continue to grow to $30 billion, $40 billion and beyond.</p>
          <p>We have seen in the past cycles that when we develop new vendor relationships in tough times, they have positive experiences with us and want to continue to do business with TJX in the future. As with new customers when we add new vendor, we are building relationships for the long-term. I'll say it again, availability has never been an issue for us.</p>
          <p>Today's marketplace presents fantastic opportunity upon which we are capitalizing for the short and the long term. Further, while we are delivering consistent top and bottom line growth, we have a tremendous growth story to tell. Our strong operations allow us to reinvest for the future even in a challenging consumer environment which will serve us well when times improve. As I mentioned on our first quarter conference call, our growth opportunities are plentiful and we're seeing exciting things.</p>
          <p>Now to recap the consolidated numbers. Net sales for the second quarter increased to $4.6 billion, 7% above last year. Consolidated comp store sales increased 4% over last year's 5% increase which was above our plan. Foreign currency exchange benefited comp sales by approximately 0.5% which was about what we had expected.</p>
          <p>Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.45 this quarter including the $0.02 impairment charge related to Bob's Stores detailed in today's press release. Last year's results include a $0.25 per share after-tax charge related to the computer intrusion. Excluding these charges, our adjusted earnings per share is $0.47, a 24% increase over the very strong adjusted $0.38 per share last year. Overall pre-tax profit margin was 6.9%. Excluding the charges I just mentioned, adjusted pre-tax profit margin increased by a strong 50 basis points above last year's 90 basis points improvement and above our plan.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margin was up 40 basis points from last year to 24.4% driven by strong merchandise margins despite the impact of higher fuel costs. SG&amp;A expense was 17.5% which included a negative impact of 30 basis points from the impairment charge, excluding this charge, SG&amp;A was 20 basis points favorable to last year and also favorable to plan.</p>
          <p>In terms of inventory at the end of the second quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis were down 2%. We begin the third quarter with very liquid inventory which positions us extremely well to take advantage of the enormous opportunities that the marketplace continues to present.</p>
          <p>To recap the first half, which was above our expectations, EPS for the first six months was $0.88 which is 19% above last year's adjusted EPS excluding the intrusions charge for last year. The net impact on EPS of the $0.02 per share tax benefit in this year's first quarter and the $0.02 impairment charge in the second quarter was neutral. Comp sales increased 4% for the first half, over a 4% increase last year.</p>
          <p>We saw a strong pre-tax profit gains in the first half over similar increases last year, excluding the intrusions charge which again speaks to our ability to deliver sustained profit growth.</p>
          <p>Now to our divisional results. Let's begin with our domestic concepts. At the Marmaxx Group, our largest division, comp sales were up 3%, over a 3% increase last year and above our plan. Segment profit was $298 million, up 18% over the prior year and segment profit margin was 10.1%, up 110 basis points over last year both well above our expectations.</p>
          <p>Marmaxx delivered an outstanding quarter on top of exceptional results last year. We've been asked a lot about whether Marmaxx will return to peak margin level. So I'd like to point out that Marmaxx's segment profit margin in the second quarter was the strongest second quarter performance in nine years. Through excellent execution, merchandise margins increased 70 basis points despite the increase in fuel costs. The Marmaxx organization also was extremely effective in managing expenses.</p>
          <p>Some brief highlights on categories. Accessories and shoes were once again terrific. Accessories comp up 10% and footwear was up 8%. Kids, men's and dresses were all above the chain. We're happy with the Q and we'll have a total 340 of these departments by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>With the continued success of footwear, we see further opportunities in this category. As you may have heard, we will be testing a new standalone shoe concept this fall which is called the Shoe MegaShop by Marshalls. We are excited about the potential for this concept but we are only in the test stage as we are with many of our new ideas and initiative. As to home fashions at Marmaxx, we are feeling better about the improvements we are seeing in the business. As we discussed on prior calls, we have strategically lowered our inventory levels to identify the areas that are working.</p>
          <p>We are seeing significantly higher inventory turns and profitability is up. Comps are coming back in several categories and overall comps to home fashions were essentially flat to last year, again, with leaner inventories.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have rolled about 80 new home prototypes at Marmaxx this year and although early, we'd like the results we are seeing. We remained focus on improving our performance in home and believe we have opportunities in the back half.</p>
          <p>Now to HomeGoods, comp sales at HomeGoods decreased 1% in the second quarter versus a 5% increase last year. Segment profit was $2.2 million which was lower than last year and our expectation. We believe that HomeGoods' disappointing second quarter results were mostly a factor of our own execution issues.</p>
          <p>Having said that, traffic is healthy and up over last year. As we have discussed on our monthly reportings, we had some regional execution issues and also allowed too large a percentage of high ticket items into the mix, particularly given the weak home environment in certain regions.</p>
          <p>As I hope investors by now know, when we identify problems we work diligently to fix them. We took our medicine with extremely aggressive markdowns in the second quarter in order to enter the third quarter in a better position.</p>
          <p>From a cost perspective as we discussed on our first quarter call, HomeGoods gets hits harder by the negative impact of fuel increases than our other divisions due to the higher costs of shipping home product. We have initiative in place to mitigate this cost pressure and you've got to see some benefits, but we are continuing to work on this.</p>
          <p>As to new things going on at Home with this fall, we will be testing our largest store layout with the first store opening plan in Westford, Connecticut in September. The new layout which is about 37,000 square feet allow us to spend certainly highly productive categories in our existing square footage cannot accommodate.</p>
          <p>We are also seeing good results in a few new categories. We will be expanding this new initiative while cutting back on some categories that are not performing as well. Moving on to A.J. Wright which continue to make very solid progress in the second quarter. Comp sales increased by a strong 6% which was above our plan.</p>
          <p>On the bottom line, A.J. cut its segment loss in half which was significantly better than last year and in line with our plans. We are very pleased with A.J. Wright's second quarter performance and are feeling more and more positive about this business. We believe that we have a better hand on these customers than ever before and that we have the right marketing campaign.</p>
          <p>We continue to light the progress we are seeing in A.J. Wright stores contributions and are getting close to levels that will give us the confidence to accelerate the rollout of new stores. We continue to be conservative, however, as this business is in a very good place, we are now planning on opening an additional marketer until next year. Long term, we continue to view A.J. Wright as a vehicle with tremendous growth potential and believe the U.S. could ultimately support 500 to 1,000 stores.</p>
          <p>Finally, on our domestic division stores, although comp sales were disappointing comp stores manages well in the second quarter. In addition, they continue to buy better and improve their mark on as we have set out prior calls, we are evaluating this business.</p>
          <p>And as for our international division, let's start with the Canadian businesses which had a fantastic second quarter. For the second quarter, comp sales in Canada increased 12% in U.S. dollars, in local currency which we believe better reflects our operating performance comps increased by a remarkable 6% over challenging 7% compare last year.</p>
          <p>Segment profit increased 27% to $60 million and segment profit margin increased 100 basis points to 11.2% which was significantly exceeded last year and our expectations. Winners' exceptional quarter is all about execution. The Winners organization is doing an outstanding job of remaining flexible buying right and selling great products and great values to our stores.</p>
          <p>HomeSense in Canada continue to do terrifically well. On the top and bottom line HomeSense contributed huge increases over enormous huge increases last year. We have mentioned our plans to touch new-off price concept in that country and I'm excited to tell you more about its launch.</p>
          <p>Again, as with any new idea or concept we develop, we will test and be very methodical in our approach.</p>
          <p>Our new business is called StyleSense and will offer predominantly family footwear and accessories. These categories continue to perform extremely well for us, Winners, and across our chains and we see that it's having potential to expand our presence in Canada. We have two store opening plan this fall with one next spring and the box will be about 14,000 square feet in size.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to our European businesses. Beginning with T.K. Maxx in the UK and Ireland, second quarter comps increased 4% in U.S. dollars and increased 5% in local currency which again we believe better reflects our operating performance. Segment profit at T.K. Maxx in the UK and Ireland, excluding our investment in new European businesses, increased to $21 million in the second quarter, which was above our plan.</p>
          <p>Segment profit margin, excluding our new European businesses, increased 60 basis points to 3.9% well above our plan. Including the investment in T.K. Maxx Germany and HomeSense in the UK, our total segment profit in Europe in the second quarter decreased to $14 million from $16 million last year and segment profit margin was 2.5%, again, above our plan.</p>
          <p>In the UK and Ireland, T.K. Maxx delivered another outstanding quarter in the face of a highly promotional retail environment. By sharply executing the fundamentals, this division is driving strong result and we believe is gaining market share in this tough environment. Our T.K. Maxx stores in Germany are performing beyond our expectations on the top and bottom line. We continue to see inventory turns equivalent to the UK, which is really impressive. With strong merchandise margin, the bottom line results of our German operations were favorable to our plans for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>While still early days, we feel very well positioned in Germany. Our vendor base is very strong and a large majority of products in our German stores is sourced directly in Germany. In terms of store growth, we plan to end 2008 with 10 stores and are looking at the possibility of accelerating our store growth plan slightly next year.</p>
          <p>HomeSense, which we brought across the pond from Canada to the UK this spring is off to a good start. Our plan is to end the year with six HomeSense stores in the UK.</p>
          <p>Now, I want to spend a moment on our vision to grow TJX as a global off-price value retailer. I talked in detail in our last call about our plentiful opportunities to grow our company both domestically and internationally. We have a tremendous advantage and that our core businesses are performing extremely well in funding our growth vehicle such as A. J. Wright and T.K. Maxx Germany along with some of our newer test concepts.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, we believe we can grow to more than 4,300 stores with our current portfolio in the countries where we currently operate. This does not include some of the tests we talked about today. It's the enormous growth potential in the future and our solid strategies in place to support our goal.</p>
          <p>Key to our strategy is building a global organization that will position our company for future success. To that end, we have made a number of important senior management changes that I would like to share with you.</p>
          <p>Ernie Herrman has been promoted to Senior Executive Vice President and Group President with the responsibility for Marmaxx Winners, Corporate Human Resources and Brand Development. Ernie continues to report directly to me in his new role. Michael MacMillan, previously Chairman of Winners, has been promoted to Chairman of the Marmaxx Group reporting to Ernie. Bob Cataldo, previously COO of HomeGoods has been promoted to President of Winners, also reporting to Ernie Herrman.</p>
          <p>In addition, in Europe, we have taken significant steps to strengthen the organization. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we have formed a new shared service structure that we call TJX Europe. They're highly committed to our recruitment efforts and are hiring some of the best talents available.</p>
          <p>Recently, we added a CFO of TJX Europe and a Managing Director of T.K. Maxx Germany. Building our global organization is a top priority for us. With these moves, we are continuing to groom executives, who have corporate and global experience, so that they can be tapped to run any business any time, domestically or internationally. Further, we recently enhanced our world-class executive buying training program which is one of the few training programs of its kind remaining in the retail industry.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to discuss our financial strengths in terms of our share repurchase program. In the second quarter, we repurchased $225 million of TJX stock, retiring 7 million shares. During the second quarter this year, we spent a total of $450 million in share repurchases and bought back 14 million shares. We continue to expect to repurchase at least $900 million of TJX stock in fiscal 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving to guidance for the third quarter and the full year. In the third quarter, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.62. This compares to $0.54 in diluted earnings per share or an increase of 9% to 15% over the prior year. This outlook is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of approximately 2% to 3%. While we believe these are prudent goals for the third quarter, I can tell you that as in the second quarter, we are motivated to surpass them. Trip will provide more detail on this guidance in a moment.</p>
          <p>For the fiscal 2009, we are raising our previous guidance. We now expect fully diluted EPS of $2.26 to $2.31 including the benefit of the 53rd week. This range compares to reported EPS of $1.66 in the prior year, which included a $0.25 per share charge related to the previously announced computer intrusions. Excluding the 53rd week impact and the prior year's intrusions charge, our guidance is in the range of $2.17 to $2.22, a 14% to 16% increase over the adjusted $1.91 earned last year. These estimates are based on an estimated comp store sales increase of approximately 3% for the full year. Our full year guidance assumes fourth quarter EPS of $0.79 to $0.81 including the benefit of the 53rd week and $0.70 to $0.72 without that benefit.</p>
          <p>Summing up, I'll recap the major points. First, our expected EPS this year represents a third consecutive year of significant earnings growth excluding the intrusions charge last year. Our 14% to 16% estimated range for EPS growth this year is on top of its 17% increase last year which was on top of the 26% increase to prior year. Again, excluding the intrusions charge, certainly our goal will be to beat the back half numbers.</p>
          <p>Second, while we are driving these strong results, we are building to the future. By not taking our eye off our cash engines, Marmaxx and Winners, which by the way we see growth in, we are fueling our other major growth vehicles. We're in a great position with our core businesses doing extremely well and our growth vehicles are beginning to work. In addition, we have continued retesting initiative and we will never stop.</p>
          <p>Third, we have tremendous opportunities to grow our concepts globally. In this call alone, we've talked about the possibility of a new market at A.J. Wright, testing a standalone footwear concept at Marshalls, the launch of StyleSense in Canada and our early success in Germany and with HomeSense in the UK. We have solid strategies at place to achieve our goals for growth and are creating a global organization that combines success of TJX experience with fresh perspective.</p>
          <p>Fourth, expense management remains a key focus area which help fund our investments in new businesses, as well as other marketing initiatives. Fifth, our extremely solid financials give us great confidence in our ability to invest in the future growth while returning value to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And finally, our no-walls approach to communications continue to pay dividend as we share ideas, initiatives, talent and best practices across all of our divisions. As we begin the second half of 2008, our chief goal remains driving profitable sales. I can't say it enough. It's about execution, execution, execution every day. We are upbeat about the back half. We see exciting products in the pipeline and believe our marketing will resonate with assisting and new customers.</p>
          <p>I look forward to updating you in our progress in the third quarter and now I'm going to turn it over to Trip.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Carol has really hit the major points of the strong quarter. On a sales basis, I want to emphasize the transactions were up across all of our off-price divisions which indicates that we are gaining market share.</p>
          <p>On the bottom line expenses were very well managed overall. With that said, I'll work in this regard has never done and one of our major objectives continue to be cost management. Before I cover the third quarter guidance, just to avoid any confusion, I want to recap our first half results and how that impacts our full year guidance.</p>
          <p>The net impact of the $0.02 tax benefits in the first quarter and the $0.02 impairment charge in the second quarter is neutral to EPS. Therefore, the net impact of these items to our full year diluted EPS range is neutral. So for modeling purposes, people can include both or exclude both because either way the net impact to EPS is neutral.</p>
          <p>Now to guidance. For the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.59 to $0.62 which represents a 9% to 15% increase over $0.54 per share in the prior year. We're assuming a third quarter top line of approximately $5.1 billion with a comp sales increase of 2% to 3% on a consolidated basis with a neutral impact from foreign exchange rates and a 2% to 3% comp sales increase at the Marmaxx Group.</p>
          <p>As to monthly comps on a consolidated basis, we expect comp sales increases in the range of 1% to 2% in August, 2% to 3% in September and 1% to 2% in October. For Marmaxx, we are planning on comp sales to be flat to up 1% in August and up 2% to 3% in both September and October. We are planning third quarter gross margin in the range of 25.2% to 25.4% flat to up 20 basis points from last year and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales to be flat to 10 basis points favorable to last year at 16.7% to 16.6%.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax profit margins are planned in the 8.4% to 8.6% range essentially flat to prior year. As a reminder, we begin to anniversary investments in our new European businesses in the third quarter. For modeling purposes, we're planning a tax rate of approximately 38.6% and weighted average outstanding shares of 441 million.</p>
          <p>To keep the call on schedule, we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Thank you and we will take questions now.</p>

          <p>Very good. Now, Carol, I know you said you see exciting product in the pipeline. I think you made that point pretty clear. I think the bear case says really the quality of the product, not the quantity, but the quality is apt to deteriorate, in other words, say good bye to a lot of the low-hanging fruit in contemporary, luxury and bridge and so on and so forth. So I'm wondering if you look at your mix for holiday and then for spring and maybe spring is away too far out there but because you're buying a lot more off-price, but what do you &#x2013; do you see the &#x2013; talk a little bit about the mix in terms of quality of the better product that is really exciting the customer right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, Todd, we are relentless in our quest for always raising the bar. So, I can't talk to fourth quarter because obviously, we are very, very liquid, but I can tell you that what we do have in the pipeline is very new. And again, as I said before, our buyers are out all over the world and I do not see the quality of our merchandise deteriorating in any way. As a matter of fact, I see the group as a whole testing a lot of new things and upgrading and trying new country. So, I certainly don't see a deterioration. If anything, I see progress. And that's what we talk about every day.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Carol, and congrats as well. That was pretty amazing. I guess our question really is just focusing on the merchandise margin at the Marmaxx division. Just trying to understand I mean how much of that was just your lean inventory and lower markdowns versus the markups on the better buying? And just also about the second half, should we expect that you'll continue to have these nine-year high operating margins at Marmaxx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to comment just in general and then I'm going to hand it over to Ernie. Marmaxx just continues again to execute very well. They were very, very liquid, very seasonally appropriate. They are really managing all aspects of it. So, we are going to continue obviously to work hard in improving the margins and I will hand it over to Ernie, what you see.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, just what Carol said, we talked about it on our last conference call. We maintain that liquidity position really for most of the back half and I think we're getting them on both sides, markdowns and on buying goods better. So it's really a combination. We maintained our liquidity so going into the third quarter, I mean, it's just the way we feel is wise to operate in this environment really and in any environment. So I think we'll get it on both sides of the equation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One other comment Brian is we continue &#x2013; I think I've talked about it in the past quite a bit, that some of our investment is in the supply chain. And again, that will allow us over time to continuously do a better job of allocating to the particular store and demographics better and better as we go forward, which again obviously helps in terms of optimizing markdowns.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think you mentioned, Trip, in your prepared remarks the transactions were up across all of your off-price businesses. I just wanted to follow up on that and see if you were seeing an increase in ticket as well or if ticket is roughly flattish?</p>
          <p>And my main question for Carol. Carol, it sounds like you're seeing encouraging things coming out of A.J. Wright and I was just wondering if you could share with us what are the metrics you're looking at for that division as you consider whether or not you go forward with more store openings and expansions there and roughly timing if you think you would look to accelerate those openings? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I'll answer the A.J. Wright and then I'm going hand it over to Trip. As far as A.J. Wright, we're just seeing constant improvement in the four-wall contribution on &#x2013; this year running through the second half, I think we're up over 200 basis points which is really a vast improvement. It doesn't mean, Kimberly, that we're going to just suddenly add on 50 stores. We're going to look at a couple of new markets for next year. We're going to look to probably accelerate slightly. But as we always are, we're careful and conservative and we want to see continuous results, but we're very, very pleased with what we're seeing. We just think we have a terrific team there that's really understanding the business and what needs to be done at this point. So I think again, we're a year &#x2013; past a year ago with a lot more education, a lot more knowledge.</p>
          <p>Trip, do you want to talk to this transaction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Kimberly, so first of all, to confirm, every off-price business had positive transactions, which for us is a proxy for traffic. And then, the second thing is our average ticket was relatively flat for the quarter.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Dana Cohen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. I was wondering if you could break out by &#x2013; for company as well as Marmaxx, the merchandising margin versus fuel piece. And then, my major question really is on HomeGoods if you could just break out the composition of the earnings decline by pieces?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Dana. We don't usually &#x2013; we can do &#x2013; we can certainly go offline. We don't usually break down by specific company and I will talk to HomeGoods a little bit in terms of the fuel because it did hit them hard and then I'll turn it over to Trip.</p>
          <p>I think with HomeGoods, I think, when I talked about execution, part of the execution was in the mix. But I think part of the execution was not understanding the ramification of big furniture and the impact on fuel. So it took its toll on the HomeGoods bottom line this quarter. They have gotten their arms around it and are getting their arms around it and I think it is an opportunity for the back half but it did hit them extremely hard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Dana, I'll just give you some top line merchandise margin improvement numbers. For TJX in total, it was 80 basis points and that was after absorbing the impact of increased fuel costs on merchandise margin which is about 20 basis points. And then at Marmaxx, the merchandise margin improvement was about 70 basis points after fuel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms &#x2013; was 70 basis points after fuel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And at HomeGoods in general, I'm not going to break the number out here but in general, the fuel impacts there are at a much higher level simply because of the bulkiness of the freight that they handle and the larger number of trips that have to be made to deliver similar merchandise. So it hits harder there. And then, of course, the merchandise margin, that was hit by markdowns, et cetera, as we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Is there any way to just order of magnitude of the $7 million decline, what percent was due to fuel? What percent was due to the markdowns? I mean, the business had a pretty big decline in profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A large percent was fuel, Dana.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of that was fuel?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Carol, on Europe, do you think there's hard evidence that the businesses perform in downturns like they do over here domestically on a relative sense? And then a question for Trip as a follow-up, is it possible next year given all the investments that we still see this level of stock buyback or do we think or should we assume rather that that is &#x2013; the buyback goes to lower levels than the $600 million range? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Trip, do you want to talk a little bit about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me answer the buyback question. First of all, I would say the three-year plan that we put out there holds us at the $900 million a year stock buyback level and frankly, we have no plans to change that. So I would just tell you the plan is $900 million for next year, at a minimum, and we remain committed to that. As you know, we generate a lot of cash and we have a very aggressive &#x2013; positively aggressive capital spending program and we would still have &#x2013; and a good dividend program as well, I might add. And after all of that, we still have more than enough cash to support a very health stock buyback program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, in terms of Europe, first of all, T.K. has shown obviously improvement in segment profit year-over-year and they've just perhaps continued that trend. I think that you may &#x2013; I'm sure you're aware that the UK, the retail environment has gotten pretty tough. I think it was as much as 6% decrease if I recall last month in the retail sales segment. So I think &#x2013; again I'm thinking good times and bad times. That model is an absolutely terrific model.</p>
          <p>I think the other thing that's happening is that they're just becoming more and more known in Europe. And as we grow the businesses as we go into Germany, the T.K. Maxx as a business is becoming &#x2013; again, from a marketing perspective, very, very high awareness, so I think that's a piece of it and I think that will continue.</p>
          <p>But I think it probably reacts pretty similar to the United States in terms of the economics.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a quick follow-up question, you talked about the business internally. Could you talk about your view on the competitive outlook? Obviously it's a tough economy, a tough economic outlook for fall. You guys are bullish, you're doing very well, but clearly your competitors aren't.</p>
          <p>Historically in this scenario, your competitors tend to falter before you do and put pricing pressure on you guys. Do you see anything different this year, particularly with the consolidation of department stores that improved your outlook in this competitive way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Again, Richard, we're always about the difference between where our competitors are, that span. And so whether they have leaner inventories and their price point is at a certain place, we're always working towards giving that great value versus them. I'm going to come back to saying, if we execute well, then we do well.</p>
          <p>So I can sit there and make comments about the outside world but I really have to say that it's about what we do in our business and execute every day and give the consumer a great value and that's what we're sticking to.</p>

          <p>Good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just in terms of the comp plan, it looks as if you're lapping an easier Q3 in terms of comparison, yet you're planning a more modest 2% to 3%, and it sounds as if the quarter is a little bit more back-end loaded. So is that a function of perhaps the checks that we saw this quarter had some positive impact in saving a little bit in the near-term? What is driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We basically planned &#x2013; well, we've been planning the quarters pretty much around the 3% mark. So obviously, we like to plan our comps conservatively and we beat them and that leverages to the bottom line and that's our goal every quarter. But in terms of August, we are going into August with less clearance than we had last year. We also believe that we have put a lot of our marketing dollars into September because we think the back-to-school time period will probably shift a little bit later. So that's why we have set this up strategically in the way that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. That's helpful. It makes sense. And then, just follow up on HomeGoods, I think you discussed the promotions. I wasn't clear who would be heading this division now. It sounds like there was a promotion out of the division, so if you could share that &#x2013; is that a spot there that has to be filled?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We have built that internally. Actually we had somebody that was boxed up quite a while ago. We've been working with that person for a long period of time.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just in terms of &#x2013; you shed some light in terms of initiatives that you're focusing on to see some positive impact there. Any sense in terms of timing? You've obviously been pretty impatient in terms of poor execution. Just any sense in terms of when we could see some lift out of HomeGoods?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would say closer to the back end of Q3 and I think Q4 is looking pretty good, but I'm not &#x2013; it's not going to happen tomorrow. We have to ship some of the categories, some of the larger furniture into accent furniture. So we have little bit of work to do. But I think we'll start to see progress towards the end of Q3.</p>

          <p>And Dana, just to go back and partially answer your question on HomeGoods, the other 210 basis point decline in margin in the second quarter at HomeGoods. So just to let you know, about 130 of that was due to markdowns in freight and fuel impact, okay. So that just goes back to the point about cleaning up the inventory in the second quarter.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning. It's actually Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. I just want to follow-up on a previous question about A.J. And I was and I was hoping you guys can talk more specifically about some of the initiatives in specific categories that you're going to place, particularly in home and how you've seen the performance improve. And also if you could tell us a little bit more on what you're doing on the marketing side that would help. Thank you so much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In terms of A.J., we have some &#x2013; the core drivers that we look at are really accessory shoes, juniors, young men's, kids and basics. We had Home which was an area that we thought we really need it to fix which we believe we have. So those are the core drivers of A.J. Wright. We're very, very focused on execution and value, and in addition to that we talked about the expansion but I think this is a very good environment for real estate opportunities for A.J.</p>
          <p>In terms of the marketing, last year, we were not focus I think on the right elements that drove the business. I think this year we are. And I won't specifically tell you our marketing plans because of competitive reasons. But I think we understand how to get to this customer now and I think we have the right media to do that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and congratulations, everyone. Carol, I've been hearing the word global a lot in your prepared remarks. I just want to understand what do you see is the sales and margin opportunity as you expand globally? What are your infrastructure costs or timing? How important do you think it becomes? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, we certainly felt in the UK, Germany &#x2013; I think the UK, our model is about 8% of our goal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>8%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We think Germany can probably range close to that between 7% and 8%. Real estate, it tends to be a little less costly in German than it is in the UK. But, Dana, as with everything, we are &#x2013; we build our infrastructure. We're conservative. We will look at Germany. We'll have 10 stores by the end of this year. Next year, we may, if we trigger it a little bit harder, we're probably talking about maybe another three to five stores. So, we'll continue to build it, be careful and support it, but we like the global infrastructure that we're building over there, which we'll be able to really leverage. If Germany ends up, we're thinking 200 to 300 stores, there may be more opportunity in the future. So that's how we're building it. We won't be diving into five or six more countries immediately. We think we've got quite a bit going on there now that we can build upon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a question on marketing. In your press release, you mentioned you're trying to acquire more customers. Can you talk about how you're doing that? Have you adjusted your marketing overall for the Marmaxx division and just how you're addressing that issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll not get specific in terms of our strategy there. I can tell you that we've tested some &#x2013; many new ideas and we are &#x2013; you'll look forward to seeing what is on TV in the near future because we think it really takes the heart and soul of not only our customer but new customers and this is after we've done quite a bit of testing. So you will see it in the back half, and we're really excited about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then how about an update on the status of your non-merchandise procurement initiative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously you saw that we were able to mitigate fuel. We're just beginning, I spoke last time. We have somebody on board that has procurement directly reporting to them, so we're really just beginning that project. So we see pretty big opportunities there. You saw some benefits in in-store labor from the Marmaxx numbers and we are working on damages. I mean, there are many, many initiatives that we have been improving on and best practices in the DCs that's certainly helped some of our divisions in the DCs and it continues. So it's going to be a never-ending project, but it certainly going to help us fuel new businesses, new ideas, supply chain. So we're reinvesting some of those dollars and some of it will go to the bottom line, but this is an ongoing process.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Another congratulations. My questions have mostly been asked. Just a quick one on Canada. Can you give us a sense &#x2013; the environment there has been very strong. Can you give us a sense what your team is saying there on the ground and are there market share shifts out of department stores and you guys are obviously up against a tough comparison going forward as you have been up against them this year but some color on Canada would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think with the Canadian guys, we have to kind of keep their excitement in line because, again, I think we built HomeSense which now customers, there's such a high awareness. We think that Canada is just &#x2013; has tremendous opportunities and that there's a lot of retailers up there that are just having a very tough time. But I will come back to you and I hate to just keep saying it again and again, but Canada really has executed very well and I think they're building upon the knowledge that they have. They tested a lot of new categories. So we believe there's still some opportunity and it will continue in Canada but it's truly about execution.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks. And any color you can give us on the mix of your new U.S. footwear concept? How you see the mix in footwear in those stores?</p>
