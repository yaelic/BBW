        <plist>
          <p>If we could take our seats I think we will try and get this thing kicked off as soon as possible. That's Yannik at the back, take your seat.</p>
          <p>Okay. I think we will kick this off. We've got roughly an hour before we have to get the management team off to the next meeting. So, it's &#x2013; for those of you who don't know we, I'm Sachin Jain from Bank of America. It's all pleasure to have the Novo Nordisk management team on the road for the full year results road show. I think the intention is a brief over to Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>And, without further ado, over to Lars Rebien.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much and also thanks for the invitation. Yes, we're going to try to make it brief, if at all possible, as my colleagues and I are excited about the results in their individual areas, so let's see how brief we can make it.</p>
          <p>I can make this one very brief. This is the usual slide. Things may turn out differently and henceforth I hope that I have absolution for any mistakes we're going to make in the future.</p>
          <p>Highlights. I'm not going to go through the highlights because that's what the presentation is going to be all about. So, that's also quick.</p>
          <p>Here, sustainability highlights. I'll just go through a little bit of this. It's a big bag of other issues that we highlighted in connection with the annual results.</p>
          <p>Our social performance, we've built an ambition of wanting to have an aspiration of 40 million people treated with our products by 2020, that's what we have stated here, 40 million by 2020. Right now we have 23 million patients using our product, and we have 5 million people treating with insulin from our company at a cost of $0.20 per day. The whole strategy being we have something for the low-priced segment, we have something for the medium-priced segment, we have some for the high-end segment, so full portfolio approach from the company.</p>
          <p>In terms of social performance, the workforce has increased with 5%, turnover stabilized &#x2013; actually declined a little. We can discuss whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. I guess our HR people think it's a good thing.</p>
          <p>Social performance, when we look at the engagement in the company and adherence with our values, very high score. A slight negative point here is that for the first time ever, we have received a Warning Letter from the FDA on GMP and this of course, something that we take serious. It is something that we intend to fix and hence it is something that we eventually will be stronger from.</p>
          <p>Environmental performance has been impacted by the phasing-in of our factory in Tianjin in China, which is using coal power as opposed to wind power which we're using in other plants. CO2 emissions increased with 30% but we on track to meet the 10% absolute reduction, which we set going from 2004 to 2014. Energy and water consumption is following sales basically.</p>
          <p>So we've taken the opportunity &#x2013; the company has grown significantly over the last 10, 12 years in terms of size, in terms of complexity and we basically been the same management team managing the company, rather a narrow one if you want. We've taken the opportunity to appoint two new members of the corporate management team. Jakob Riis, whom some of you have met, is responsible for global marketing, signaling, of course, the importance of global marketing market access, in the future pricing and positioning of our drugs, and also Lars Fruergaard, who would be responsible for IT and quality, both these two gentlemen have been with the company for several years. I think Lars Fruergaard started in 1991, so is an old hand in Novo Nordisk <mark type="indiscernible" /> (4:06) and Jacob started in 1996, both of them have international experience in United States and Japan before having their previous responsibilities.</p>
          <p>And, with that, over to K&#xE5;re.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lars. I'll briefly go through the sales. And if we start here by looking at the geographical distribution then you can now see that clearly North America is the biggest region for us now, grew nicely 29%. You will see that China is growing nicely also with 28%, overtake Japan in size this year and International Operations where we have more than 4 billion people living, it's growing strongly and in a few years time it will overtake Europe. So the growth is really coming from those three regions, North America, International Operations and China, whereas we have a relatively low growth in Europe and Japan, both for demographic and market regions.</p>
          <p>In terms of products; it's diabetes care that carries the growth, 21% growth in diabetes care. And you can see it's really very simple. It's the modern insulins, the three insulin analogues we have, that carry 55% on the growth and Victoza 39%. So 95% of all growth coming from diabetes care.</p>
          <p>Our biopharma franchise is highly profitable and is growing but at a low rate. We have saturated NovoSeven basically in many markets. And in the case of Norditropin, we still some growth, but there's quite some tough price competition in certain parts of the world.</p>
          <p>If we look at diabetes, then 21% reported growth, 15% in local currency. It is of course, the modern insulins that are carrying it, but we also see growth in human insulin that is due to the fact that in certain emerging markets, governments are still buying human insulin to get some cheap insulin for their nationalized healthcare systems. Victoza has grown 58%, and then we have a few other bits and pieces. If you look at the split then, of course, Victoza is starting to be seen as part of our sales with a meaningful size and, of course, we expect this to be more pronounced in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Some of you might remember 10 years ago, when the insulin segment was doomed and nearly to be dead by some, and it was only one-third of the diabetes market, and we stepped out of chemical compounds, OADs, and focused on proteins and that has turned to be out either clever or lucky.</p>
          <p>Anyway, what's happened since then is that now the proteins are more than half of the diabetes market and we have a strong position in both insulins and GLP-1. I won't sort of bore you with the whole story about this slide over here; just say that the story of OADs for those of you who have followed the business for a while, is typically from boom to bust. We had Rezulin booming and busting. We had Glucophage booming and busting. We had Avandia booming and busting. We had Actos booming and busting. We have <mark type="ph" /> Januvia (7:04) booming right now, and you can see that from this curve here. And you can see our broad portfolio of proteins is sort of not booming but it's just growing steadily, and we are right now at 26% of the world market in value share, and if you get the monthly numbers which we do of course and some of you might also do, then it's higher than 26%, so that's good.</p>
          <p>In terms of the world market, we have seen a strong device penetration over the years, strong penetration of modern insulin. This is seen in volume, so here you are sort of around the 70% if you take it in value, it's of course significantly higher. But it's also important to realize that modern insulin will stay around in markets like India and other emerging markets, modern insulin &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; human insulin will stay around, and we'll continue to manufacture and sell that for quite a while.</p>
          <p>Market shares of modern insulin, not much dynamics there. You could say we are sort of around 46%, Sanofi is somewhat less, and Lilly is slowly continuing to lose out now being less than 20%.</p>
          <p>On Victoza, it's really straight line growth you could say. The small beep here in Q4 of 2011 that was just a rebate adjustment, where we had to sort of reduce the accrued rebates due to some realization of the levels of the healthcare reform rebates in the U.S. And that has stabilized now, so you have a more stable situation this year, so you really have a straight line growth here in sales quarter-on-quarter. It's coming from primarily the U.S. and Europe, but we also saw International Operations kicking in, they doubled sales of Victoza, and we saw China getting on the map <mark type="ph" /> fully on reimbursed (8:43) by the good price point, so we are very happy and satisfied about the sales growth of Victoza.</p>
          <p>With that, over to you, Mads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, K&#xE5;re. I'll try to be brief as well.</p>
          <p>If you look at this slide, it really just highlights how &#x2013; my telephone should be shut off, okay &#x2013; if you look at this slide here, it really just highlights how we have a large number of diabetes products that are ready to take off we hope in the next few years. Now interestingly, if you look at FIAsp, Tresiba, and Ryzodeg, they all represent our best shot at retaining or regaining leadership in each of the three insulin segments, fast-acting, basal and premix.</p>
          <p>If you then look at IDegLira, it represents an invention at Novo Nordisk of a whole new class of insulin or insulin and GLP-1 agents called the fixed ratio combos. Semaglutide obviously is our, we believe, best-in-class potential once-weekly GLP-1 analogue destined to enter Phase 3 in this quarter. And liraglutide for obesity is what we are all waiting for data on in the next two quarters of this year. On top of that we have the activities of hemophilia.</p>
          <p>So if you look at Tresiba and Ryzodeg, quite clearly a lot is happening. We start with Europe, we're all extremely happy, or at least at Novo, that we got the approvals, we can now witness the labels on the website from the EU Commission, later on from EMA, and they are very strong and powerful labels, as I think we've communicated to you previously. We'll have the first launches in Denmark and U.K. in this first part of the year. Japan also witnessed approval of the last of the two products, Ryzodeg, quite recently, and we're hoping to complete the price discussions on Tresiba, followed by launch during the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>In the United States after the AdCom that happened on November 8, we have continued the what we call constructive dialogue with the agency, and there are questions and answers going to and forth and we hope to come towards the end of that discussion such that we can launch around the latest midyear this year, but that is obviously not in our hands. We will always continue to roll-out and also submit NDAs all over the world, as you can see under the other group on this slide.</p>
          <p>Now, IDegLira holds the promise to become completely new class of agents with unsurpassed efficacy, in as much as we've combined the truly long-acting liraglutide and degludec molecules in one combo that proved itself extremely well in the DUAL I trial, where people were with &#x2013; on an OAD background, when, in this particular trial, they came in with a typical more than 10 year, you can say, treatment cycle for diabetes. They were on insulin, yet, after the treatment for half a year with IDegLira, we saw that the majority of &#x2013; 60% went from 8.7%-ish down to below the ADA target of 7.0%.</p>
          <p>If you compare this up against the GetGoal-L study from Sanofi or the Harmony 6 study from GlaxoSmithKline where they have allowed loose combination therapy to take place, so where there's been a full titration with Lantus and then either lixisenatide, in the case of Sanofi, or albiglutide in the case of Glaxo, they achieved 28% and 30% treat to target reductions and 60% in the case of IDegLira. So, I think, we also on the glucose side, but just as well as on the weight benefit side are seeing something that puts this in its own little league, on top of the convenience factor of course.</p>
          <p>Confirmed hypoglycaemia was very low and actually lower than you would expect when you compare to the insulin standalone arm, and this is kind of the hypo-protective effect that a long-acting GLP-1 seems to have on insulin.</p>
          <p>So, I mentioned FIAsp, which is our last segment to be superseded, in the case of NovoLog, NovoRapid, with this even faster acting version. Phase 3 program is destined to start in the second half of this year, entailed a trial program of about 3,000 patients, both on multiple daily injections, but also a type 1 pump infusion study to show that this also can become hopefully the preferred future pump insulin based on an even shorter lag period from the bolus wizard is activated until the insulin appears in the circulation.</p>
          <p>If we look here at what else has happened in R&amp;D. Well, Victoza has shown in a four week, very comprehensive study actually, to show that it's counter-regulatory hormone responses in type 1 diabetes are uncompromised after the use of Victoza, and with that plus some insulin dose sparing and weight beneficial effects that we observed during this brief trial, we are now entering Phase 3 during this year in type 1 diabetes, which we think can be an interesting and value-adding for the patient's lifecycle management and indication expansion for that molecule.</p>
          <p>Then, uniquely, we've come up with a new-generation of engineered, both backbone and side chain engineered insulin analogues, the first one being LAI287. It's a once-weekly with a circulation half-life anticipatedly of about one week in the circulation for use by injection initially, theoretically even for oral administration as time goes by. Biopharmaceutically, NovoThirteen has know been launched in Denmark and Canada and resubmitted to the FDA in the United States just around Christmas time.</p>
          <p>Turoctocog alfa, as you are aware, is our first betting, or our first molecule in the realm of hemophilia A. It's been submitted in the major markets last year and we would hope to see regulatory approval in the first market emerge here during this year. And then we had to discontinue an information project called NKG2D as I think we've announced previously.</p>
          <p>With that, over to you, Jesper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mads. In terms of financials, we've benefited in 2012 significantly from tailwind. We had 6% tailwind on the sales line, so the top line saw 12% underlying growth in terms of gross profit. We also benefited 70 basis points from the tailwind on currencies. So, we had an underlying 100 basis point improvement in our gross margin. Sales and distribution cost declined in percentage of sales by almost a &#x2013; by a full percentage point and that was really reflecting the deferral of the launch of Tresiba to 2013.</p>
          <p>In terms of research and development cost, our ambition was to grow R&amp;D in line with sales, in underlying terms, sales grew by 11.6% and the R&amp;D line group by 11.0%. So that was broadly achieved however due to the different currency composition of sales and &#x2013; or research and development costs compared to sales, we had a decline in the ratio.</p>
          <p>Admin cost was hardly benefiting from some non-recurring items in 2011 and 2012. The underlying growth was in the ballpark of 4%, so an all-time low of 4.2% in admin cost to sales.</p>
          <p>License fee increasing significantly and significantly actually benefiting from the higher recurring level of royalty income but also a higher level of income from our non-core activities, the engineering company and the IT company.</p>
          <p>Net financials, of course, seeing a loss reflecting to the benefit that we have achieved on operating profit, but whereas we had a benefit on the top line of more than &#x2013; or the operating profit of more than DKK2.5 billion, the cost on net financials was to the tune of DKK1.5 billion from hedging, so a net positive contribution from currencies in the tune of DKK1.1 billion. The tax rate that was as expected around 23%, net profit grew 25% and because of the repurchase program, the EPS increased by 30%.</p>
          <p>In terms of currency, you also here clearly see the significant positive impact we had in currencies from U.S. dollar and also from Japanese yen, but also do note that the current levels that these currencies are operating on are significantly lower than the levels we had in 2012 and hence we will be facing headwind and we have been illustrating the 5% currency impact from the movements here and we are covered for approximately a 12-month period for the major currencies.</p>
          <p>In terms of the outlook, the outlook is now a sales growth in the range of 8% to 11%, and that range is of course dependent on how the rollout will be of Tresiba, but also for example how our Prandin product in the U.S. will be faring in terms of potential generic competition. The currency impact will be negative, approximately 4.5 percentage point on sales and around 7 percentage point negative on operating profit. The operating profit growth is in local currencies, estimated to be around 10%. Net financials will then this year swing around and be a positive impact to the tune of DKK1.4 billion, unchanged tax rate, unchanged capital expenditure, slightly increased deprecation levels and an increase in our free cash flow to DKK22 billion assumed for 2013.</p>
          <p>If we look at how we're spending; the cash that we are generating, while we are assuming that we will payout some DKK18 per share that's equivalent to DKK9.7 billion and an unchanged payout ratio of 45% like last year and we have proposed a repurchase program of up to DKK14 billion. So, in totality, we will recycle a little bit more than &#x2013; or a little bit less than DKK24 billion and we are expecting cash flow of DKK22 billion, so actually returning all the cash we generate to our shareholders in 2013.</p>
          <p>We've also taken the opportunity in connection with the full year results to update the long-term targets. We have maintained the ambition of growing our operating profit by 15% year-on-year, In individual year, it may be lower, like we are forecasting for 2013 as we have the significant Tresiba growth opportunity ahead of us and it may also deviate if currencies are against us or with us.</p>
          <p>Operating margin is now lifted to 40% and the growth to &#x2013; the 40% level is going to come from an expanded gross margin, And also, over time, hopefully from an expanded &#x2013; increased efficiency in our sales and distribution cost. Cash to earnings level is maintained &#x2013; remember we measure this on a three-year average basis at the 90% mark.</p>
          <p>And then as closing remarks, we basically continue to see a 10%-plus growth in the annual diabetes care market, and we have a very promising pipeline. And with that short notice, I'll hand over to Lars to lead the Q&amp;A.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin Jain, Bank of America. Three short questions actually. One, on the call you guided to Victoza growth being lower than the DKK200 million in quarterly increments but also recognized limited competition for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:19). So wondering if you could just clarify that commentary from the conference call.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Levemir, I think it's your fastest growing insulin now, so can you discuss the extent that benefits from the additional marketing effort that potentially should have been on Tresiba last year? Or has there been any particular perception change of that product in the market?</p>
          <p>And then finally on Victoza, type 1 diabetes, I'm not aware of any other GLP-1, looking at the type 1 space, so just could you provide some color as to why Victoza is unique in that regard? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. In terms of Victoza sales growth, K&#xE5;re, we've indicated DKK115 million to DKK200 million as a quarterly growth, absolute number going forward. As <mark type="ph" /> both (21:00) were historically DKK200 million, why's that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's because it's difficult to predict the future, and the current going rate is around DKK200 million and there's different competitive changes in the marketplace. As you all know, Amylin was acquired by BMS and AstraZeneca and we have not seen them being able to really make any changes or indents into the TRx development of Victoza in the U.S. marketplace. However, they have been trying very hard, we can see that from IMS data on their sales activity, and I think they will continue to try very hard to somehow justify the $7 billion acquisition price for Amylin. Whether they will succeed or not remains to be seen.</p>
          <p>Of course we prefer that they don't succeed and that situation continues the way it is right now where it's stabilized and Victoza continues to have a good track in the U.S. But at the same time, we see Sanofi coming out with Lyxumia in Europe. We see this as an inferior product profile compared to Victoza, but on the other hand we also have to say that we don't know exactly what's going to happen. So that's why we're guiding the way we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, K&#xE5;re, perhaps also you. The U.S. position of Levemir has that really changed perception or is it simply a question of marketing power behind the product which is resulting in a <mark type="ph" /> quick take-up (22:21)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is the result of years and years and years, of course of staying with the same message and then increased marketing power. Because we have increased the sales force in preparation for the Tresiba launch and that means we now have sort of four retail sales forces, roughly a field force of 3,000 people in the U.S. And that means, of course, we have the power to both promote Victoza, NovoLog, and Levemir at the same time. And that's probably part of the reason why we are seeing a continuation of relatively nice development for Levemir in the U.S. marketplace, which of course is important because it indicates that once we switch part of the sales force on to Tresiba we should have enough coverage. And one of the reasons why that's the case is that competition used to really pump up their diabetes sales forces in the past. It seems like we're the only ones increasing significantly right now, and that's of course positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mads, perhaps a comment from you on Victoza for type 1, it's sort of initially a little bit counterintuitive since liraglutide is releasing insulin and there's no insulin producing capacity left in Taiwan. So, can you give us a little color on this and the competitive situation there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah well, first of all, Sachin, not only have we seen two external investigators that have been using Victoza in small studies in anywhere from 10 patients to 20 kind of patients, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:48) in the U.S. and <mark type="ph" /> The Host Group (23:47) in Copenhagen, that have shown some promising data that of course kind of intrigued us a little bit, but on top of that we did some various animal models where we actually showed benefit from type 1 diabetes that could either be due to beta cells replicating again &#x2013; and that is not likely to happen in human beings. If you have established type 1 diabetes, I think you unfortunately can forget about replicating your beta-cells.</p>
          <p>So what is then? Well, it's probably more in humans the notion that people with type 1 diabetes they don't have any insulin, but they have too much glucagon, okay. So, since we know that GLP-1 has at least three effects &#x2013; it stimulates insulin, it inhibits glucagon and it suppresses appetite &#x2013; two out of those three effects are still present in type 1 diabetes. So what we've shown in our study is that we get the nice glucagon suppression and that is something you need 24/7. You need it around the clock, because it's constantly elevated. That is why you will actually need a long-acting GLP-1 agonist to have the constant suppression. The same goes with appetite, if you only suppress appetite at certain during the day, you will tend to eat more later in the day kind of to compensate. So those are logical reasons for long-acting GLP-1.</p>
          <p>And then there's a safety one. The safety one relates to the fact that if you interfere in the meal time prandial insulin regulation in type 1 diabetes, which you will do if you use exenatide or Lixisenatide, they have half lives of three to four hours, meaning that they will actually interfere when taken at a meal. With the insulin, the prandial insulin, you will end up in a potentially unfortunate situation. So, what you need is a stable baseline in GLP-1 agonist that kind of do the things we just discussed. And probably that's why you are seeing <mark type="ph" /> an osmostatin (25:26).</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks. Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Couple of comments &#x2013; couple of questions, please. First on, just your comments on the Boehringer Ingelheim pulling out of the joint venture with Lilly. What do you think this means for biosimilar competition? How aggressive they might be? And also the requirement for potentially CV studies, pre-approval for new insulins beyond Tresiba, their PEG-Humalog, what it might mean for that?</p>
          <p>And then, second question, just on IDegLira, assuming approval of Tresiba midyear, is there a chance that the FDA might view this as a new product? And therefore how would they think about this regarding CV studies? The long term safety studies for Lira and Tresiba wouldn't be available at filing, so just your thoughts there?</p>
          <p>And just a follow-up to Sachin's question on Victoza competitive threats, just wondering about the SGLT-2s as an oral therapy that can lower weight quite substantially. Obviously there are side effects, but how do you see the competitive threat there? Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mads, I guess it's largely you again. Well, just an initial comment on Boehringer Ingelheim. This means that Lilly's now got the insulin back and are likely to be pushing that significantly. So, Mads, what is your view on new insulins and CV as it relates to the PEG, insulin from Lilly and Tresiba for that matter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I think, Richard, is that, we have the first insulin since the adoption of the various guidelines, both the new and more assertive AdCom process that came into place, but also the CV guidelines for diabetes products, originally contemplated as being non-insulin products. I think I am seeing &#x2013; gauging in some ways, the whole situation around CV and insulins as something they are revisiting, i.e., I have to foresee, as one of the main players in the insulin space, that we should probably expect CV to be an element of every and any insulin product we come around with. So that would actually be my expectation.</p>
          <p>Whereas when I look for IDegLira specifically, my view is that we're doing the leader trial in agreement with the Agency. We are not going above 1.8 milligram of liraglutide in the IDegLira formulation such that I would definitely view &#x2013; and it's the same population we're treating &#x2013; so, I would definitely view the leader commitment as sufficient for IDegLira per se. And if and when Tresiba gets approved in the U.S. with the PMR commitment, the post-marketing requirement, to do the CV outcome trial as we are of course discussing with them to do, that would also hold for the Tresiba or the degludec component.</p>
          <p>Now, it is of course, the first time two different proteins are coupled in one formulation to the best of my knowledge, actually, as a combo protein-based product, but it shouldn't change the fact that it is the individual safety data basis plus the aggregate from the dual trials, and I think we should be in a decent shape there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then K&#xE5;re perhaps you talk a little bit about how you see the competition to, for instance Victoza from SGLT-2, or maybe comment on the SGLT-2 class in general? How it might influence our insulin business and what not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think I have a little populistic explanation about boom and bust of OEDs. And I think SGLT-2s will probably get some success when they are launched due to the fact that they are easy to switch to and it's not a major hassle; there are some marginal inconvenience and safety concerns. But the way I see it, it's not a play in the OED space, nor a set of combination therapy when people take, one, two, three OEDs. I don't think it will be anything that will affect the penetration rate of GLP-1s and of Victoza, because that segment is different in the sense that you get a much higher efficacy. It's &#x2013; effect of two or something on the glucose-control efficacy and you get significant weight loss when you use Victoza.</p>
          <p>So, in my mind, it's not really something that will affect it. Also given that the segment that's using Victoza out of type 2s is tiny. It's right now like 1.3% of scripts that's Victoza. So, it is a tiny segment of people who want high efficacy and see the benefits of it, are willing to cross the injection barrier and are willing to pay the price or can get reimbursement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we can say that if they are successful in terms of adopting patients in great numbers then it might have an effect on the growth of the insulin market, that we've seen on several occasions in the past with the insulin sensitizers and perhaps also with DPP-IV inhibitors that they somehow postpone the transition towards insulin therapy for a certain period of time. The same thing could happen with the SGLT-2s.</p>
          <p>Yes, next question please there in the back?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Brian Bourdot from Barclays. Thank you very much for coming back to London once more. Questions on FIAsp, please. If we were to go back to slide 16 and if you were to superimpose endogenous human first phase insulin release on the healthy people, how would that look in comparison, please? And I see you're moving it from Phase 1 straight into Phase 3, just wondering what hypotheses you're hoping to show, what clinical benefits over your existing products you're hoping to show and whether you're going to be studying that head-to-head against aspart? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mads, this must be wonderful for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it should be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:21). The <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:25), Brian, I have to start with one admission, and that is that if you superimpose endogenous first phase insulin secretion, it is faster. Okay, so the endogenous first phase insulin secretion would be faster than this, we simply cannot make it that &#x2013; with this technology we can't make it that fast. On the other hand, what I like is also the right hand side of the curve; on the one hand, we have significant absorption within the first five minutes, which is good news. On the other hand, we actually have more or less a duration of action, which is not significantly shorter than NovoRapid. And I think that's important in particularly type 2 diabetes, because people are postprandially hypoglycemic for several hours and I've seen some technologies that simply were too short. This one should not do that.</p>
          <p>So I think this is probably as good as we can get it with really a good old insulin aspart, which is only in reality being spiced up and accelerated with the addition of some very innocent endogenous natural ingredients of the human body. The way we'll do it in Phase 3 is essentially look at postprandial glucose control. We've already done a study where we actually took a standard meal and administered NovoRapid or FIAsp and were able to see a significantly reduced spike of postprandial glucose to the tune of 1 millimolar improvement. So, this is the kind of thing we would love to see repeated in Phase 3.</p>
          <p>Other elements of flexibility such that we will of course look at: can we administer the product like 20 minutes into the meal, where the patient knows much more about the load of carbohydrates and other things that he or she actually already has taken on board such that you can fine-tune your dose? And finally, we would also continue subcutaneous infusion studies, such as pumps, to really show that the lag period from the bolus &#x2013; the pressing the bolus wizard until you actually see the glucose lowering effect is significantly reduced. This is probably going to be easier to show in pumps where there's a very distinct lag phase that you see in a different way than when you use multiple daily injection.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Pete Verdult here from Morgan Stanley. Just three questions. Lars, firstly, on the warning letter, we see many companies in the industry get warning letters and they've proved to be nothing, but there's also been a number of warning letters recently affecting companies which has led to a significant delay, taking longer to resolve, costs more. So, I wanted to get some sort of assurance that you think your warning letter is the former rather than latter, and whether there is any link between the lack of clarity on when FDA is going to make a decision on Tresiba and this.</p>
          <p>Secondly, maybe for Jesper or K&#xE5;re on Levemir pricing and marketing. Can we just understand, as we launch in Europe, or as you guys launch in Europe with Tresiba in Japan, is all marketing on Levemir being essentially stopped or are you doing anything with the price?</p>
          <p>And then just lastly, very quickly just to return to the Lilly biosimilar question, we've obviously seen mixed Phase 2 data in Boehringer's decision to hand back the rights back to Lilly. But what about their insulin glargine? Is it your expectation that that will be a substitutable product eventually in the U.S. or is Lilly content just to me-too and something that they'll have to promote and they won't be able to price too cheaply? So be interested in that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I'll deal with the warning letter and then K&#xE5;re perhaps you want to comment on Tresiba, Levemir, and what our intentions are in terms of the competitive situation and perhaps also the &#x2013; what you expect to see from Lilly going forward since they've given back the insulin to Lilly in the collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim.</p>
          <p>Warning letter, yeah, I wish I could give you 100% assurance. What I can say to you is that we have &#x2013; maybe I should explain the process here. You have an inspection, you get some observations, you are required to answer how you want to remedy the things that can be improved. We have already done that. And then six months later we get a notice from the FDA resulting in a warning letter. Then we review those same observations one more time to see if we can handle the initial response in a better and more complete way. We've done that within 15 days, we've done all the changes which is required. There's nothing which requires building new equipment or anything of that sort. And so we see the issues as being something we can deal with.</p>
          <p>There is still the uncertainty of how the FDA looks at this. There is also an unusual situation in that it was us that announced that we had a warning letter. The typical process is that FDA posts the warning letter so that the company can discuss the nature of the warning letter. We are somehow precluded from discussing the nature of it because we might be putting words and perspectives forward which would be taken offence at the FDA, and therefore there is only downside risk for us to disclose the nature of the warning letter until such time that they publicize it. And so then we can perhaps discuss it in somewhat more details.</p>
          <p>So only thing I can say is we've dealt with it, we think it's doable, we think it's of the first category that you mentioned, and we have committed ourselves to be launching Tresiba in the U.S. in the second quarter. So that's as best as we can take it and hopefully we're right. Yes, K&#xE5;re?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And when we launch Tresiba in a specific market, then it's sort of all in, you could say, and that means that all sales and promotions moves away from Levemir and moves on to Tresiba. It doesn't mean &#x2013; we don't discontinue Levemir; obviously, a lot of patients use this and are very happy about it. But all the sales and promotion activity moves 100% on to Tresiba, regardless of the pricing strategy in the individual market.</p>
          <p>And with regard to Lilly, then of course the PEG long-acting remains to be seen what results come out of that, and then we can assess how much of a threat that is once we see the results.</p>
          <p>The glargine me-too product, I think that is only the way of a me-too so to speak. So the way I see it personally is like an Apidra lookalike; like Apidra came late to the party of fast-acting analogues, Lilly will come late to the party with this in the space of basal analogues. And we will by that time have an ultra long-acting analogue that will be launched, and will be hopefully having a very high capture rate at that point in time.</p>
          <p>So, I don't really see it as a major threat. I don't see how they can really disrupt the pricing game in the U.S. because that's already so granular and fine tuned to the different customer segments by us and Lilly and Sanofi, that it's not a major threat.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A few quick ones, please. I wonder if you can tell us what you're going to be doing in Japan to restore your market share which has being falling.</p>
          <p>Can you update us on your attitude to getting into diabetes testing? One of your major competitors thinks that the two will ultimately be linked; so is that something that you're looking at doing?</p>
          <p>And can you give us some idea about the commercial approach you're going to be using with Factor VIII? Because it's a bog-standard Factor VIII with no sort of differentiating points; so is it worth putting a lot of effort behind? Toe in the water? If you could just help us on that, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. K&#xE5;re, if you deal with the Japanese turnaround &#x2013; should we call it that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And how you intend to position and market Factor VIII biosimilar, if we should call it that. And then I'll talk about how we see testing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The way to turn around the situation in Japan in the diabetes space &#x2013; because, as you know, we're doing fine in biopharmaceuticals &#x2013; is to launch Tresiba and Ryzodeg basically, and then get a capture rate above 50%, hopefully above 60% on both products in the basal segment and in the premixed segment. And in doing so, turn around the total capture rate in the market and start gaining market share instead of losing as we've been for the last several years. So that's the short version of it. It's all hinging on first launching Tresiba and then launching Ryzodeg successfully in the Japanese market.</p>
          <p>With regard to Factor VIII, we will launch this as what it is, which is a high quality product, very reliable, very safe, very, very clean clinical trials, state-of-the-art in all aspects, of course, a me-too to the sort of best in the marketplace. It will not be a discounting game on our part, so it will be the me-too kind of way of doing it. So, there will be a sales force overlapping with the NovoSeven sales force. It will be priced probably at parity to current list pricing. And we will not be sort of playing a biosimilar or generic game on it. It has a full clinical program behind it, so it will be sort of launched as a high end, nice device, nice quality, nice reliability.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we have one unique advantage other that on all parameters, we are matching, you could say, the best. So we have not a single aspect of the development program, the clinical profile, the device, anything, which is not at par with the best. That's how you should look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of diabetes testing, this is obviously something that we review on an ongoing basis at least once a year when we make our strategic plan. We are still of the view that of course it would be nice if these things were linked; but the technology, the commercial side of things are completely different than ethical pharmaceuticals. And therefore, in history, where we have had collaborations in this area, it has been a lot of dust, but not a lot of bread. So, we don't think it's linked for the foreseeable future and we have no intentions of going into it.</p>
          <p>Yes, in the front?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Vincent Meunier from Exane BNP Paribas. Well, two questions, please. First one on the obesity program, SCALE, can you refresh us regarding the timing for the publication of the data and then the filing?</p>
          <p>And also, on the liraglutide obesity, what's the percentage of overlap in your targeted population of patients with type 2 diabetes, because indeed we could imagine that existing patients could increase their dose in order to tackle the obesity problem, and I would like to know what proportion it <mark type="ph" /> covers (42:32)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mads, SCALE, when are the data coming, when is the file being sent in? And what's the overlap with type 2 diabetes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, there are three sets of data. The first one is indeed the one with the overlap, that's the diabesity study, where people both are obese and diabetic. That is coming in this quarter. Then, the big &#x2013; and that's like 800 patients. The big one, in 3,600 patients, that is the pivotal trial where the ultimate benefit-risk will be defined. That's coming in the second quarter, that's obese people of whom about 50% have pre-diabetes in that trial. And then the third one is a comorbidity study specifically looking at obstructive sleep apnea, which is one of the major comorbidities, along with pre-diabetes and a few others, to obesity. And all of that, if things go well and the benefit-risk profile in our assessment is favorable, we will kind of around year-end submit the new drug application for obesity.</p>
          <p>Now, it's a very good question with the overlap, because if you define obesity as something in the United States that 110 million people suffer from or live with, and diabetes as something that maybe 25 million or so have, you can actually say that out of those 25 million, more than 80% are obese. So, those 20 million, they are included in the number 110 million. That is true. So, there is an overlap, you're absolutely right; not surprisingly, because obesity drives insulin resistance, that then again drives the overt occurrence of type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously the reason why we're doing the first study to bridge the 1.8 mg and the 3 mg dose is also to be allow &#x2013; allow ourselves to understand and discuss with the regulators how we handle the situation, as you're hinting at, of the 1.8 mg versus the 3 mg dose. And that is something I can't be very crisp on, because it will have to depend on also discussions with the regulators once we have the data.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Keyur Parekh with Goldman Sachs. Two questions, please. Lars, this is the first time in a while we have seen the payout ratio kind of flatten out. As we look at your cash flow generation over the next kind of four, five years, how should we think about the split between dividend payout and stock buyback?</p>
          <p>And secondly, kind of just as you're about to launch Tresiba both kind of in Japan and in Europe, what is the sort of feedback you're getting from kind of reverse marketing by Sanofi and what are the areas they are trying to raise up on those ends? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah, we try to &#x2013; and we see &#x2013; and, Jesper, you should feel free to chip in here afterwards &#x2013; we see dividends as something which you are likely to raise, but not reduce; and therefore, we're going on gradually. We've hit a point now where we believe the dividend is competitive with our peers. And then what we say is that the remaining surplus liquidity will be paid back by buyback programs. We do also, on a regular basis, have interaction with our main shareholders and ask them whether the balance is right, whether they like one or the other, and they are a little bit different of opinions and we try to at least satisfy everybody by finding a way which suits us and something which is sustainable.</p>
          <p>So, Jesper, do you have any further comments to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, just that the 45% we are at currently basically matches the pharmaceutical peer group. We don't use the entire peer group, which also involves some biopharmaceuticals as they don't pay dividends, so the 45% we have now is roughly matching what we have. But we'll have to see what they come up with, proposals for 2012 dividend and 2013 and then we'll revisit it again. And if it goes towards 50%, then we'll move in that direction. We just basically want to match them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with regards to reverse marketing from our dear competitors, I think we are seeing all the tricks in the book that you can imagine. We've heard from some sources that Tresiba was too short and some other sources that now it was too long. We have seen excerpts from FDA briefing books being used as counter, detailing of our product. So, what I can say is, I mean, this is obviously a very, very serious matter for Sanofi having their major product being under severe pressure and attack of an approved product &#x2013; approval of a product that is seemingly superior. So, I think one should expect everything; which we are. Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Nick Turner from Mirabaud. I was just wondering whether you think that the cardiovascular issues that were raised in the FDA review of Tresiba might constrain the uptake of Tresiba in those regions where it's approved until a liability can be ruled out in a post-marketing surveillance study?</p>
          <p>And then a second question maybe on Victoza, which would be, there's obviously &#x2013; the Harmony study showed that Victoza was somewhat more efficacious in dropping HbA1c levels versus albiglutide. I was just wondering is there &#x2013; is that different &#x2013; or how clinically significant do you see that difference is, particularly when you consider maybe the ability of these drugs to prevent or delay diabetic complication and particularly cardiovascular &#x2013; improve cardiovascular risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, whether or not the CV discussion at the AdCom would limit the uptake of Tresiba. Mads, why don't you deal with that? And maybe &#x2013; perhaps also take the second one, if you mind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is something that I feel quite strongly about, because do bear in mind that those studies shows that there was absolutely no difference between Tresiba and glargine on the cardiovascular profile. The event rate was 1.44 and 1.48, which is the same. The upper level of the confidence limit did not exceed 1.8 and the statistical analysis of the point estimate revealed that they were the same. The only thing that happened was that when certain extension studies were done, they were actually only done through a couple of the studies, and not the rest. Then, suddenly reporting became different and biased. So, these data, they prove absolutely nothing in regard to Tresiba being any different than any other insulin. There's no preclinical signal; there's no signal at the level of the cell or the receptor binding or anything.</p>
          <p>The European and Japanese authorities have reviewed all of these data, including what was discussed at the AdCom and come to the same conclusion as I'm doing now. So, no, we don't see anything in that regard, the fact that we're doing a CV outcome trial is completely natural. I actually had contemplated on suggesting one about a year ago, because with the degludec family unfolding three different major products, it's kind of important that you also show that this is indeed just an insulin with the expected CV profile. So, we don't see any changes in that regard. I don't know, K&#xE5;re, whether you have additional comments?</p>

          <p>Yeah just to support you and say we don't expect it to in any way affect the uptick on the product. It's more a case of getting reimbursement in Europe, which will take time, just like it did for Victoza. And in the U.S. it's more once we get the approval we think we're pretty much ready to go.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I was just really wondering &#x2013; I mean, I'll take your argument. But I just was really wondering whether &#x2013; I think it was a 12-0 vote by the FDA &#x2013; a committee regarding that.</p>

          <p>As opposed to...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Whether that actually would sit in physicians' minds more than the detail that you've talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well &#x2013; what &#x2013; the experience we have when we talk to physicians &#x2013; and I obviously have spoken to quite a few, both cardiologists but also diabetes specialists &#x2013; that is that they are not worried. But the other thing is that the physician doesn't sit and look at page so-and-so, line so-and-so, in the label. Once the physician has prescribed the product a few times, it's almost as being in the clinical trial. Once you've gotten feedback &#x2013; because these are open label, so actually you know who's getting glargine and who's getting degludec &#x2013; once you've gotten the first few visits of patients coming back, who are extremely happy and the physician realizes this, this is really what drives the prescribing behavior; the clinical experience of the physician. Unless you have something with a huge black box warning that is clearly of detriment to the patient that has to be weighed against some benefits, which is not the case here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You also had a question about albiglutide and Victoza?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was just wondering, what &#x2013; in terms of the difference in HbA1c levels, which I think was something like 0.7 of a percentage point in terms of the difference between Victoza and albiglutide, what the clinical significance of that might be, if one relates it to the diabetic complication and cardiovascular risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mads, it is probably better you answer that for now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But if you take albiglutide, so what happened is the albiglutide was given on top of glargine, so that it was a loose combo between albiglutide given once a week and then glargine given every day. The data from this study, which is the Harmony 6 study, you're absolutely right, they do show a difference in A1c between our study, <mark type="indiscernible" /> <mark type="ph" /> II (51:43) and their study, which is at least 0.7% in our benefit. And on weight, we had a 5lb decrement of weight and they basically had more or less give or take no change in body weight; max 1lb.</p>
          <p>So overall if you combine the weight effect with the fact that we actually have a more than 0.5% percent improvement in A1c compared to their product, and the fact that blood pressure reductions, as I recall it, are larger in the dual studies than what I've seen for albiglutide, then, on top of the fact that it's also a more convenient product, because here it all comes in one injection quite frankly, making life simpler, because you don't have two treatment modalities &#x2013; but that was not your question, your question was about CV. I would calculate that the CV risk would be measurably lower when you have these benefits. But that's just a postulate based on these three lines of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:38).</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And as you can gather, Mads is not biased at all. So, could we take the last question please? And then we're going to be around for, I think at least another 15 minutes still, for individual conversations, if we may. Any last questions? Oh, don't seem to be the case. Then we'll &#x2013; no. Yeah? Saved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two last questions. First, on hemophilia. Mads, could you just comment on time lines now for the Factor VIII and IX long-acting versions? Given you made some comments which were very quick on the call last week. And then just on insulins in Europe, I know it's not the major market for the long-acting products, but &#x2013; we now biosimilar similar guidelines or at least a draft that's been published in the last month or so. What do you think of that &#x2013; do you have any sort of horizon &#x2013; anything on the horizon that you see other than the Lilly product potentially entering into the European market and what does that do for pricing?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mads, hemophilia timelines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so, Tim, what I explained is that because we have to prepare everything including, you can say pre-launch supply activities, getting everything in good shape, what I said, that was from we complete the clinical program until we submit the Biologics License Application or the equivalent, the NDAs. It will actually be approximately one year. So, clearly, we are behind Biogen Idec, which is the front-runner in this field, both as regards Factor IX and Factor VIII. So, we will of course, have to hope that our Factor IX data show that the longer half life plays a role, but that's simply too early to speculate, because we don't have data until around summertime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, K&#xE5;re, biosimilar insulin in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a little thought about it. Insulin has been a biosimilar since it was born and there's been biosimilar competition for 90 years now and that's how we built the business. So, we're not so worried about it. There is a lot of biosimilar competition in Europe today on human insulin. There might be a &#x2013; what you would call a biosimilar glargine from Lilly coming into play, and there might be others. Most of the ones we've been trying the last, I would say, 5 to 10 years, have for maybe kind of odd reasons been either delayed or giving up in getting regulatory approval and getting to the marketplace. So, we don't really see any significant moves, which is kind of funny in the sense that the whole human insulin segment is wide open to biosimilar competition in Europe and that is not going to be long before also some of the analogues will be open for that.</p>
          <p>So, my take on it is that insulin for a lot of reasons I won't get into now, because it will be a long explanation, but for a lot of competitive reasons, scale, know-how, distribution, manufacturing, so on, it's not really the ideal biosimilar product to go forward, because it's simply too complex and the price is too low per milligram. So, it's not that attractive and we probably won't see a lot of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that is in a way confirmed by two deals that have separated: the Biocon-Pfizer deal, which when upon closer look and studying the detail, was terminated; and very recently, Actavis and Bioton. I think the biosimilar manufacturers are very good at selling their case of the insulin market being a very attractive one and hence they should share that upside with somebody else, but once people start to take a look at it, they realize the profitability is not there. So, not a very attractive case for generic companies in general.</p>
