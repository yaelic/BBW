          <p>Good day everyone, and welcome to the Apache Corporation First Quarter Earnings 2008 Conference Call.  Today's call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the program over to Mr. Bob Dye, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Mr. Dye, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for joining us today.  This morning Apache Corporation released first quarter 2008 results, which totaled net income of $1.02 billion or $3.03 per diluted share.  Consistent with prior quarters, we also provided adjusted non-GAAP net income for the first quarter that is 2.99 per diluted share with the adjustment primarily related to foreign currency fluctuations on deferred tax balances.</p>
          <p>Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized.  A full disclaimer is located on our website.  In addition, any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred will be identified as such with the reconciliation located on our website at www.apachecorp.com.</p>
          <p>Steve Farris, our CEO; and Roger Plank, our CFO, will now make prepared remarks prior to taking questions.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob.  Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for Apache's first quarter earnings conference call.  The first quarter was highlighted by our solid financial results, some excellent exploration success and continued progress and our delivering our expanding &#x2013; and expanding our major pipeline of visible growth projects.</p>
          <p>Our financial results were excellent as we eclipsed $3 per share for the second consecutive quarter and our $1 billion of earnings was driven by $1.84 billion of cash from operations for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Roger is going to cover the financial results in more detail and I thought I'd go into some of the operating highlights.  We told you at the beginning of the year that 2008 would encompass the largest exploration program in our history in terms of resource exposure, and I could not be more pleased with our results so far.  We made five important discoveries during the first quarter, including Brulimar-1, Julimar Southeast-1, the Halyard-1 all in Australia, the Hydra-1X in Egypt and 3 wells in our Muskwa Shale play in British Columbia, Canada.  In addition, today we announced the positive results of our Julimar Northwest appraisal well offsetting our Julimar discovery in Australia.</p>
          <p>I'll go over the developments on a regional basis in a few minutes, but let me summarize upfront how our achievements for the first quarter have updated Apache's future growth profile.  We began the year with a pipeline of six major projects scheduled to begin production between the latter part of this year and 2012, which should contribute about 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of new production to Apache.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we had updated this profile in really three main ways.  First, we added a seventh development project to our inventory, a new 100 million a day gas plant in Egypt, which is expected to be online by mid 2010 and should add 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of net production to Apache, which increases our visible growth profile from our major projects to 135,000 barrels a day by 2012.</p>
          <p>Second, as I mentioned, during the first quarter, we completed our three important test wells in the Muskwa shale in the Ootla area of BC, which allows us to estimate a resource potential in the play of 9 to 16 Tcf of gas net to Apache.  And this area will likely give us very significant long-term natural gas production starting in 2011 and 2012.  We now foresee Ootla potentially becoming the 8th major development project in our portfolio, which could increase and extend Apache's growth visibility in a very material manner above the 135,000 barrel of oil a day from our other 7 projects.</p>
          <p>And third, our exploration success during the first quarter has added significant resources that will extend some of our major projects.  As highlighted, we have raised our assessment in the total recoverable reserves in the Julimar area in Australia from 1 to 2 Tcf to 2 to 4 Tcf and the Hydra discovery, we have the potential to add up to 1 Tcf of recoverable gas in Egypt.  That's not a bad way to kick off the year.  Frankly, most of the exciting part of it is, is that we have only scratched the surface with respect to our exploration program for 2008.</p>
          <p>As I'm sure all of you have noted, our daily production for the quarter was up 4% year-on-year, which was driven substantially all from oil volumes and that's good news from a financial realization perspective.</p>
          <p>On a sequential quarter-to-quarter basis, daily production was down 3% due to down time from weather in Canada and our Central region in the US.  We had pipeline access restrictions in Argentina and the Gulf of Mexico and we also made a decision last year to direct some of our Canadian investment budget from Alberta into longer term projects in BC, which by the way has tremendous potential long-term value and growth for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>In our year-end earnings call, we gave a projection of 6% production growth for 2008 after we've taken into account property sales.  So far this year, we closed approximately $300 million of sales, which will affect our production by a little over 1% in 2008.  We still believe 6% growth is attainable.  However, with the impact of current gas restrictions in Argentina and the potential additional strikes and disruptions in North Sea and lower production in Canada, a range of 4 to 6% would probably be more conservative.</p>
          <p>I'd like to now give you an overview of our regional highlights and in the interest of time I am going to focus on our key growth engine regions of Australia, Canada and Egypt and then I'll comment briefly on our other solid positions in the North Sea, Argentina and the US.</p>
          <p>We continue to have exciting news that flows out of Australia.  As I mentioned, during the first quarter we completed two successful wells in the Julimar area.  Brulimar well had 113 feet of net pay, which was followed by our Julimar Southeast-1 well that found 195 feet of pay.  We did not test either of these wells, because the well logs look very similar to previous wells that we had tested in the field.  We have three additional wells that are scheduled to drill in the area through the end of the year, which certainly will give us greater clarity to the ultimate reserve estimates.</p>
          <p>I hope most of you've read today, we announced the result of our Julimar Northwest-1 well that we logged this week.  The well had 43 feet of beautiful sand, but importantly or more importantly, from a seismic log and pressure data, it indicates that the sand is in communication with our Julimar-1 discovery, which is about 2 miles away from the Northwest well and the Julimar East well, which is another 2 miles east of that well.  So, we have a long area with substantial reserves in it.</p>
          <p>The results of the two wells in the quarter and the just-announced Julimar Northwest well certainly adds to our confidence of the growth recoverable reserve assessment in the 2 to 4 Tcf range.  When we get the appraisal program completed at the end of the year or later in the year, we will follow a dual development track of exploring LNG alternatives or also taking that gas into domestic Australian market.</p>
          <p>We tested the Halyard-1 during the first quarter. It tested at 68 million a day from 91 feet of pay.  The field is located about 20 miles from our infrastructure, so we plan to fast track this development and hopefully start-up in 2010 timeframe.  We are obviously very pleased with our Australian exploration program.  We have a very deep inventory of high potential wells remaining to be drilled this year both in the Carnarvon Basin and also the Gibson Basin.</p>
          <p>From a development project standpoint, we are on schedule with all of them.  The Van Gogh development remains on track for first production of 20,000 barrels a day net mid-2009.  The Pyrenees development, which is operated by BHP, will likely be on-stream by the end of 2009 or at the latest the first quarter of 2010 and will add an additional 20,000 barrels a day net.  Our Reindeer gas development is on track for a mid 2010 start-up at 60 million cubic feet of gas a day net to us.  We are also close to signing the initial gas contract on that development and expect to have something to announce in the near future.  It should demonstrate the gas price upside in our Australian portfolio.  Australia will continue to be a very large and important growth driver for the company for many years, driven really by our materiality in the depth of the offshore exploration and project portfolio.</p>
          <p>In Canada, the big story is our Muskwa Shale play in British Columbia.  In April, we announced the results of three horizontal wells we drilled during the first quarter of 2008 that had test rates of 5.3, 6.1, and 8.8 million a day.  We completed all three wells with six stage frac stimulations. The wells are currently flowing into our Missile gas plant.  I've received some questions as to why the 8.8 million a day well flowed at the higher rates than the other two wells.  The reason is that all of the fracs in the first two wells had on average about 350,000 pounds of sand pumped for frac.  In the third well, we pumped over 700,000 pounds of sand in three of the six fracs and obviously the larger frac size made a difference in the rate.</p>
          <p>We estimate our net reserve potential to Apache in this play of 9 to 16 Tcf and for reference, our worldwide proven gas reserves at the end of 2007 were 7.8 Tcf.  We have increased our capital program in Alberta by approximately $200 million, primarily in our deep gas drilling in the Kabob area.  This change is in direct response to the recent announcement by the Alberta government to address the unintended consequences of their previous royalty increase.</p>
          <p>I'll turn now to Egypt.  During the first quarter 2008 we drilled six exploration wells in Egypt.  We have three discoveries.  The first we announced called the Hydra-1X well and the Shushan Concession.  It tested 41 million a day and 1300 barrels of condensate from 178-foot section in the Jurassic Lower Safa section.  We also tested 35 million a day and 1500 barrels a day from a 45-foot section in the AEB.  We are currently appraising this discovery with the Cygnus-3X well that should be down in the next month, month and a half and that well is about a 2 mile step out to the Southeast of our Hydra-1X well.  The Hydra area has the potential to contain from 200 Bcf to a Tcf gas reserves certainly if the appraisal program is positive.</p>
          <p>Secondly the Shell-operated JDT well in the NEAG Concession tested 3.2 million a day and the third well, the West Kanayes C1X well in our West Kanayes Concession has been logged, but has yet to be tested.  While these results are positive, we note that that's six exploration wells out of the 40 well exploration program planned for 2008.</p>
          <p>On the development side, we continue to be on track with the Salam Gas Plant expansion project, which will allow us to increase gross gas production in the area by 200 million a day starting in the fourth quarter of this year.  This project should add net production volumes to Apache of about 90 million a day and 4500 barrels of condensate.  The new development on this front is that we have agreed to move ahead with the construction of an additional plant that will bring to the market an incremental 100 million a day of gross production in 2010.</p>
          <p>We anticipate having the same construction organization that is currently completing the Salam plant expansion move over to this new project later this year, which has very positive execution timing and cost management advantages.  Additional facility will net Apache at least 45 million a day and 2200 barrels of liquid and is projected to be completed by the middle of 2010.</p>
          <p>We are also developing several waterflood projects in Egypt throughout the next couple of years and those programs are continuing to progress.  In the aggregate, during the quarter we drilled 44 waterflood wells in eight separate projects.  Quarter-on-quarter, oil production increased 11% to 42,600 barrels a day gross and total water injection increased 8% to 52,500 barrels a day.  If you take the combination of our continued exploration success and our lower risk drilling activities, there is little doubt that Egypt's growth will continue for many years.</p>
          <p>I'd like to now provide a little highlights from our other areas, the North Sea, Argentina and the US.  In the North Sea, our refurbishments to extend the life and optimize the production, consistency is starting to bear fruit.  In March we achieved the highest average production in the last 18 months of 63,700 barrels a day.  Importantly we had zero outages and a strong contribution from two recent wells that we added 8200 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>During the year-end conference last February, we mentioned a two-week maintenance turnaround schedule for the second quarter of 2008, which began on April 17th of this year.  The downtime will impact production by 4000 barrels a day for the quarter, but we are optimistic that production consistency will continue to improve when we are completed.</p>
          <p>Last week, I am sure most of you are aware we had a temporary curve ball thrown at us involving a labor strike at a refinery in Northern Scotland that receives production and supplies power to BP's Forties Pipeline System.  All of Forties field production is transported through BP's Forties Pipeline System and that refinery strike caused the pipeline system and all our remaining production from the Forties field to go down on April 27th.  That current strike is over and we should be totally back online by the end of this weekend.  There are apparently some discussions about another strike occurring in the immediate future.  However, the expectation of that today at least is remote.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, we continued to have success notably in Tierra del Fuego.  We have a very prospective area with respect to material oil discoveries.  During the first quarter we drilled five onshore wells that cumulative tested over 4000 barrels a day.  We also made a discovery at Los Flesches. It is an exploratory well.  We discovered an oil pay in the San Sebastian down thrown of the San Sebastian gas field and it is currently being completed.  I think probably most of you are aware, Argentina announced recently that they are shipping 12 carloads of LNG that is going to be imported this winter at a price ranging from 12 to $14 per mcf in an effort to offset the predicted shortfall in the national market.  Obviously, this is a very high cost option and underlies the continuing upside from our gas realizations in the country, which at some point has to be driven by basic economics.</p>
          <p>In the US, the central region we had 24 rigs running, drilled 126 wells with only 1 dry hole.  I'll give two areas of highlights in the central region; one is on our acquired Anadarko property. We drilled 18 wells during the quarter with better than expected results.  Today, we have completed 10 of the 18 wells that we've drilled for a combined rate of about 880 barrels of oil per day.  At today's prices 880 barrels a day equates to over $35 million of annual revenue.  The second area is our Stiles Ranch area in the Texas Panhandle where we also continue to have a successful program.  We are now producing 60 million a day gross.  Our acreage position has increased from 5,000 acres to 25,000 acres in the past year.  During the quarter, we had five rigs working in the area, we drilled 10 wells.  So far, we've completed 6 of those 10 with an average rate of 2.6 million a day and we expect to further ramp-up that activity during the remainder of 2008.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf region, we averaged 13 operated rigs during the quarter, including 4 onshore.  We have continued activity in our Grand Isle 40 Complex.  And importantly, we've restored production to pre-2005 hurricane levels at 12,200 barrels a day and 47 million cubic feet of gas a day.  One of the main reasons we purchased BP's Gulf of Mexico properties in 2008 &#x2013; or 2006 was to increase our interest and become the operator at Grand Isle 40.  The acquisition has turned out to be a big win for us and there sill remains a great deal of opportunity in the field.</p>
          <p>In summary, the first quarter has kicked off in a very positive way for Apache.  In addition to achieving solid financial results, our success in exploration and project development during the quarter has expanded our portfolio of projects that provide Apache with many years of growth potential.  We enter the first quarter with a portfolio of six major projects with 125,000 barrels of oil per day of new production between now and 2012.  During the quarter, we launched our seventh project, our third gas train in Egypt that should add about 10,000 barrels a day equivalent net. We tested very successfully our Ootla Shale play in British Columbia and we added significantly to our resources in our existing projects through the drill bit in Australia and Egypt.</p>
          <p>Our drill bit and project progress during the quarter was once again balanced across our portfolio not only in North America but also in the major international hydrocarbon provinces of Australia and Egypt.  With most of our exploration activity for the year still ahead of us, we look forward to continued progress in 2008.  Roger?</p>

          <p>Okay.  Thanks, Steve.  Good afternoon everyone.  Steve talked about our exploration results and our future growth profile.  So, I thought I'll start by looking back on how far we've come financially and how large the numbers have grown from just a year ago.  First quarter a year ago our revenues were $2 billion.  This year they've crossed $3 billion.</p>
          <p>Oil revenue alone climbed $1 billion to $2.1 billion and comprised over two-thirds of our total revenue from just half our production which really speaks to the benefit of our uniquely balanced production mix.  Margins reached record levels.  Of our $3 billion of revenue over 30% made it to the bottom-line.  Obviously, a $33 per barrel increase in our oil realizations over a year ago significantly benefited the first quarter, but that's really only part of the story.  Oil production climbed 30,000 barrels a day to 261,000 barrels, driving our 4% growth in equivalent daily production first quarter-to-first quarter.</p>
          <p>The combination of unprecedented oil prices and higher oil production were the primary drivers behind our earnings doubling from a year ago.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on deferred tax balances, Apache earned a record $1.1 billion or $2.99 a share which is twice the $1.48 adjusted amount we earned a year ago.  When you earn a half a billion dollars more on essentially the same number of shares outstanding, returns become very robust.  First quarter annualized return on capital employed was 22%, return on equity was 26%.  Cash flow was also robust, up by just over half to $1.84 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>I just thought that this information might be useful perspective on our progress before I swamp you with detailed comparisons of first quarter versus the fourth quarter which I will now go through.  Oil and gas revenues rose 6% or $182 million from the prior quarter while total operating costs increased just 3%.  This drove our pre-tax earnings 8% higher.  Our after-tax earnings of $1.02 billion rivaled the prior quarters' $1.07 billion.  And on an apples-to-apples basis, adjusting for the impact of the deferred tax balances that I mentioned from foreign currency fluctuations and for a Canadian tax rate reduction that occurred in the fourth quarter last year, the first quarter's $1.01 billion of earnings were a record and 3% higher than the $982 million of adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter.  Per share adjusted earnings of $2.99 were also a record up $0.07 per share sequentially.</p>
          <p>Cash from operations of $1.84 billion or $5.48 a share was up 4% from the prior quarter.  Higher prices mitigated the impact of lower production, but drove up current taxes up.  Despite rising cost, pre-tax cash margins reached record levels, up 10% sequentially to $45.78 a BOE.  Higher prices more than offset rising costs.  Including DD&amp;A, our total pre-tax margins increased 13% from the prior quarter to $33.03 of BOE.</p>
          <p>Lifting costs per BOE rose to $8.96, While that's up $0.36 per unit, I would note the absolute cost &#x2013; total costs flattened for the time in recent memory.  So, as our production grows through the remainder of the year, LOE per unit produced should drop back a little bit fourth quarter rate of about $8.60.  You should also note that LOE previously included ad valorem taxes and we now include that in the line item entitled taxes other than income in order to give a clear picture of our actual lifting cost.</p>
          <p>Full cost DD&amp;A increased 3% sequentially to $11.50 per BOE in-line with our expectations given recent drilling costs.  G&amp;A costs increased to $1.62 per BOE from $1.42 driven entirely by increased incentive compensation expense following our record year last year and by higher first quarter payroll burdens such as FICA taxes which tend to be front-end loaded.  Absent these items rising production should drive our future rates to around $1.25 to $1.45 per BOE.</p>
          <p>Taxes other than income increased $0.91 to $4.78 per BOE which is to be expected given substantially higher commodity prices.  US severance taxes for example rose 14% and North Sea PRT basically equivalent of severance tax increased 25% on the combination of both higher oil volumes and prices.  As mentioned, this line item now includes ad valorem taxes.  So, we've also adjusted prior quarters accordingly.  Finance expense decreased $0.15 to $0.87 per BOE on lower average debt balances.</p>
          <p>Turning to income taxes, our first quarter effective tax rate increased to 39% from 31% in the fourth quarter of '07 primarily due to the one-time rate reduction in Canadian taxes during the fourth quarter.  Strong commodity prices in the first quarter have also significantly increase current taxable income causing our deferred tax to decrease to 25% of our total tax expense from 39% in the fourth quarter.  Should commodity prices remain strong, absent foreign exchange fluctuations our effective tax rate and deferred tax percentage are likely to be comparable to first quarter levels over balance of the year.</p>
          <p>In the face of tightening global credit markets, Apache's financial condition grew stronger. At 20% debt-to-cap, Apache's exceptional balance sheet remained a tremendous competitive advantage in carrying out our business strategy to pursue future growth.  So, to sum things up, Apache's financial results are off to a strong start and production is slated to grow. Add in the fact that current NYMEX prices are substantially higher than first quarter levels of $98 a barrel and $8 per Mcf, and we could see some very favorable quarter-to-quarter comparisons over the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>With that we would be happy to address any questions you have.</p>

          <p>Steve, you're spinning off a lot of free cash flow here, what &#x2013; driving down sort of our modeled debt-to-cap. What level are you most comfortable with and how do you see deploying that free cash flow in the near future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we &#x2013; you know that the first quarter we had about $300 million worth of sales included in that cash line that I think you see on our abbreviated balance sheet.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Property sales, so it's not quite as large as &#x2013; the other thing I would say is &#x2013; which I say constantly and periodically is, is that we allocate capital quarterly and we are very active very right now.  I would tell you with respect to production we expect the first quarter to be the lowest quarter of the year. And we have a very active program going in a number of places. We got Salam gas plants coming on first quarter &#x2013; first part of &#x2013; fourth quarter.  But, I think we are going to have to go through the year and see what our capital program is and also if these prices hold. We've lost about $9 a barrel in the last three or four days on the oil price, pretty volatile out there right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just kind of related to then your growth strategy, with these higher commodity prices we have heard some of the majors express regrets over certain divestments. I think Forties field was mentioned specifically by one.  So, what is the outlook for large scale unsolicited acquisitions, I mean are you seeing the opportunity there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We never plan for acquisitions because they are events, not really a strategy. I mean having said that we are a very acquisitive company, and we have been for since inception and we constantly look for things from a well in West Texas that's on the internet that somebody is selling to larger acquisitions. I will tell you this in all honesty we are beginning to see that market loosing up a little bit and we don't have anything we are doing right now nor do we have anything even on our horizon.  But if you just &#x2013; if you are in the market you begin to see certainly not from the big three right now, but certainly there are starting to be properties that are out there for sale. The real question is can you find something that's in an area that you like.</p>

          <p>I think part of that is this credit crunch, to those with strong balance sheets is perhaps a bit of a benefit.  Those who don't have strong balance sheets are seeing the cost of their borrowing go up significantly or aren't able to borrow further funds.  So, as credit gets tight, the remaining resort for some is to sell properties. So starting to see a little more of that kind of thing.</p>

          <p>One other question I had is, given your success in the shales of Canada, are you looking at other unconventional resource acquisition opportunities in the lower 48 or perhaps outside North America altogether?</p>

          <p>We are in an opportunity business, I mean we certainly we don't have any stealth plays out there that we are ready to announce, but this business is a business of opportunity and we continue to look forward.  We have a group &#x2013; a new ventures group that whether it's in Canada or Argentina or anywhere else in the world we continue to look for opportunities. Interestingly, we are looking at shale in Argentina right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys.  Just wondering if you can touch on your activity in the Gibson Basin so far and what the expectations are for kind of the future drilling activity out there?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet; in fact, Raymond and I and one of our directors just got back from Australia and spent a week in our office there.  We have drilled three dry holes with a jackup, none of which were of the size of the wells that we are going to drill later this year. And it's called Block 59, which is by far the highest potential in that area. They are not &#x2013; they are very dissimilar with respect to prospect geological traps and I will be real honest with you they are exploration wells, but I am tremendously high on the first three we are going to drill.  We really have the potential to find a large amount of oil.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We expect to get a rig in July, latter part of July, a floater that we have contracted and it depends on whether or not the current contract person that has the rig drills an option well or not. It will either be July or probably if it's not in July then it will be in September because they'll drill one more well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, sorry.  Could you talk a little bit more on the Western Australia side, timing of various gas price contracts and additionally how you see &#x2013; any exploration that you are doing that could come on &#x2013; nearby any existing infrastructure that could come on over the next couple of years.  Could you give us an update there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet, Brian.  The &#x2013; in terms of where we are, frankly, I would think we are very, very near to announcing a contract that we've been talking about now since the turn of this year.  And I would expect that to happen in May and I &#x2013; I may be wrong, but I think we are down to a point where it's nits and nats.</p>
          <p>In terms of projects that we have in front of us, we just announced the Halyard well that is &#x2013; actually it's a discovery that could come through our Varanus Island very easily. It's about 20 miles north of a oil field that we had that was depleted, that we'll bring the pipeline back through what's called East Spar, but it's &#x2013; the name is not as an important as -- we could get that on in 18 months.</p>
          <p>We are also drilling &#x2013; latter in the year we are drilling a well called Rosella that we drilled &#x2013; a well that we drilled earlier this &#x2013; last year &#x2013; later last year, that actually had quite a bit of gas in it and we expect to be able to get that drilled later this year, that is very close to the John Brooks field and also East Spar.  So both of those discoveries or potential discoveries could come back to our Island.  We are upgrading our Island to add about a 100 million a day of capacity to come out of there from compressors.  So we will have some potential there.  We are also drilling a well called Marley, which is directly north of Varanus Island, that we would bring back through some of our infrastructure -tied back to one of our platforms off of Varanus Island and bring back through, so we got two or three shots to be able to do that, Brian.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.  Couple of questions, could you talk a little bit more about Argentina? You mentioned briefly some of the pipeline issues, can give us a little more detail there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I certainly would.  The situation is that Tierra del Fuego obviously an island on the very tip of a pipeline that's 550 miles long that goes up to Buenos Aires.  And what has happened recently like over the last three or four months is that, Chevron and Petrobras are on the mainland and they are in actually over-injecting gas into the pipeline which basically makes the line pressure so high that you can't get gas into it.</p>
          <p>When I was down there here about a month ago, we talked to the Governor of Tierra del Fuego or the province of Tierra del Fuego about the fact that the province was losing royalties and also losing price in terms of being able to get their gas in that pipe.  We have seen a little relief here in the last 3 or 4 weeks. In fact, we got some indication that Tierra del Fuego was going to be able to back Chevron and Petrobras out, but that's a little bit of a wait-and-see game.  We could come back up and stay where we are or we could see Chevron and Petrobras that have big fields on the mainland, continue to over-inject and that honestly, I wish we could solve that problem, but that's basically the problem.  This is not a well issue; it's purely a restriction issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And it sounds like there is no definitive timeline on the back end to get this resolved? It's kind of a wait-and-see like you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The real answer to this, and I don't know if you follow what's going on down there, they are increasing the capacity of that line. That's supposed to be done by the middle of 2009 by 250 million a day and then they have a longer-term project to bring the capacity of that line up to 500 million a day.  We can find a lot of gas in Tierra del Fuego and there is a tremendous need for gas, especially in the Buenos Aires area.  That is the longer-term solution.</p>
          <p>The shorter-term solution was, we could put some additional compression, the other thing we have considered is doing another LPG plant down there where we'll re-inject the gas and take the liquids off the additional gas.  So we -- I will tell you, we are exploring the alternatives for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>We are not -- the only thing I would say is, we are not &#x2013; Total is also -- I mean, this is an island issue.  Total is significantly constrained also.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  And then, moving to Australia, can you talk about the Northwest well that you announced, Northwest-1.  You mentioned, obviously -- you mentioned in the press release communication with, I think it was Julimar East or Julimar-1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both, Julimar-1 and Julimar East.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And can you talk about the rel &#x2013; I mean, I think those wells you mentioned were 4 or 5 miles away. How big you think this can be, and can you talk about the relevance of the communication there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of the overall block, we are going to drill a well called Grane starting here pretty quickly that's in the Grob in between our Brulimar discovery and also the Julimar well.  And it has very &#x2013; I mean, it has a lot of merit to it.  In terms of the overall accumulation, we definitely believe that it has very good potential to be 2 to 4 Tcf of gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  And, you'd previously mentioned 1 to 2 so I am just trying to figure out was....?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We drilled more wells.  I mean &#x2013; and I will tell you the other thing is, is that we are using obviously amplitude seismic inversion.  We have drilled six out of seven discoveries. The one well that was not a discovery did not have the attributes that &#x2013; we were drilling really for a deeper sand.  So we are basically six out of six for amplitudes that off of our seismic inversions, so we feel very comfortable with our geologic picture here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And any update on pricing and I'll jump off &#x2013; in the region in Australia from what you've said prior quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will tell you, there &#x2013; the pricing is definitely on the rise.  I don't know if you've seen any of our presentations.  Certainly in the past, we've gotten from 1 to $2 and I think we are a little bit higher than that right now.  We are looking at north of $6 dollars for gas now, from spot sales, from shorter-term contracts in the five-year range, we are looking for a significant price increase there.  And hopefully, we will be able to announce this contract in the near future and it will give you some indication of the pricing.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, I mean, if we put a compressor on it, we could do about 50 million a day out of that plant.  We will have to put more infrastructure in to get higher there. I don't know if any of you read that we have a new partner in our Ootla area. Exxon bought 115,000 &#x2013;  they announced that they had bought 115,000 acres in the Horn River play.

          <p>Hi.  I had a quick question just around the sort of gas markets in general; you've obviously gone after natural gas in regions where prices are depressed. When you look around the world at areas like Libya or Algeria, even Russia, do any of those appeal to you as next places to go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't imagine anybody will let us in Russia anymore.  We continue to look, I &#x2013; when and honestly, we looked at Libya early on during the first bid round and that was a very difficult bid round.  And I don't know that it's gotten a tremendous amount better in terms of what your takes are.  The new ventures group that I alluded to earlier, I mean doesn't just look at &#x2013; for shale plays in the United States or North America, we look for things &#x2013; It's a game of opportunity and we are looking for opportunities that other people haven't seen or it's at early stages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, you may have &#x2013; you may well be aware, but we got intrigued with the upside of Tierra del Fuego and even when we were looking at the first acquisition there, the guys noticed, basically right down the middle is the border so, obviously, what we saw on Argentine side, probably didn't stop just because the man-made border is there. So that's what led to our bidding on and getting a million acres of &#x2013; million net acres on the other side where pricing seems to be better and the regulations, price regulations aren't in place.  So, while that's a ways off and about all we do this year, we will focus on and shoot seismic, if that does have the kind of potential that exists on Argentine side, that's right up our alley, because we are already there, we can run it out of the same office, and it's got interesting potential.</p>

          <p>Roger, I'm glad you brought that.  We have now officially signed those concession agreements, and we should be moving a seismic crew in there in June and hopefully with any luck we'll have a well drilled by the end of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just following up on that in South America, there's been some talk out of Brazil that domestic gas consumption is growing up 20% per annum.  Are you seeing any indications from the Brazilians that they are willing to open up the sort of shallower or shelf areas or onshore for third party participants to come in, especially looking for gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they talk about being open for business.  But the fact of the matter is it's very difficult to get concessions in those areas away from Petrobras.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question will come from Gil Yang with Citi Investment Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Steve can you talk about, in Argentina going back there for a moment, did the reduced volumes contribute to the higher prices in the region, because you were able to sell less of the lower priced in residential gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it may be a couple of cents, but not really &#x2013; what we've really seen over the last 12 months, is, we continue to see prices increase in terms of industrial volumes and also in terms of people knocking on the door and wanting gas.  There is a move right now actually by the unions and the NIC to get together with the producers and demand higher gas prices, because the fact of matter is they see the same problem. They see shrinking investment, which means something happening to their jobs.  In fact we just met with them last week.</p>
          <p>So I've &#x2013; in all of these areas, and I will tell you, the one thing hopefully people understand about us we are not a quarter-to-quarter &#x2013; we looked at quarter-to-quarter because we have to.  But in terms of &#x2013; we are more of a long-term player.  I feel very good about our gas production and oil production going throughout the year.  And I feel very good about gas prices in Argentina.  I think you'll see it.  And will we have some hiccup, sure we will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, fair enough.  I was just under the impression that the price increase &#x2013; a good chunk of the price increase in the last couple quarters was more due to a mix effect than actual prices rising.  Or you were just getting more high priced gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I think what you are seeing is not just the mix, definitely the NIC end is a higher price.  Because, number one, you have more markets there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can get the gas there easier.  So you have the potential of finding different markets.  But in terms of the overall gas price in Argentina, it is definitely creeping up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if it jumped up here in the next 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's all exactly right.  The one thing Gil that maybe you've got in the back of your mind is they are just coming out of their summer months.  And it's &#x2013; everything is upside down in Argentina.  So you go into the winter, that's when the greatest call is on low fixed price gas for residential use.  So there is an effect &#x2013; a winter to summer effect that you are probably seeing in our higher realizations.  But we haven't seen these realizations, I don't think this decade.  So what Steve's talking about is what is the primary driver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So then as we go into the winter &#x2013; their winter, do you think that the price &#x2013; your average price may drop temporarily?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is going to be a factor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet, it well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I don't think it's going back to yesterday's levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then, backing off for a more macro perspective, I know that you don't typically do a lot of hedging, but given that oil was at $120 few days ago, has backed off quite a bit, have you given any thought to locking in some prices here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We should have done that a couple of days ago.  I think Roger alluded to the fact that we are 20% &#x2013; we have 20% debt.  And I think we have, we certainly have plenty of cash flow to fuel the opportunities that we have in front of us.  So, there is &#x2013; that's somewhat our hedge, frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  All right, fair enough.  Thank you.</p>
