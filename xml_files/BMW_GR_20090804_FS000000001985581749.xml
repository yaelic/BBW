        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Maximilian Sch&#xF6;berl, Director of Corporate and Governmental Affairs. I would like to welcome you all to our Telephone Conference of BMW AG for the Business Year 2009.</p>
          <p>With me today are Dr. Norbert Reithofer, the Chairman of the Board of Management and Dr. Friedrich Eichiner, Member of the Board of Management, responsible for Finance.</p>
          <p>First, Dr. Norbert Reithofer will give you a brief review and update on our Strategy Number ONE efforts and on our overall business performance. Then Friedrich Eichiner will give a brief overview of our financial performance for the second quarter and for the first half year of 2009. Afterwards, we will have time for question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>Dr. Reithofer, the mike is yours.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the BMW Group is standing its ground in a persistently difficult market as an independent car company that has a sound financial footing. Based on our Strategy Number ONE, we started early to realign the entire company. And we have launched various strategic measures to offset the effects of the global economic crisis. So far, these efforts have served us well in these difficult times.</p>
          <p>Today, I would like to touch briefly on the following two issues. First, where do we stand? Second, how are we getting ahead with our strategy? So where do we stand at the end of the first half of 2009? We achieved earnings before interest and taxes of &#x20AC;114 million. Earnings before taxes and Group profit are slightly negative because of the negative first quarter. In the first six months of this year, we delivered a total of over 615,000 cars, down 19.5% year-on-year. This means we will not be able to match last year's higher retail volume.</p>
          <p>The climate on the automotive markets remains tense. It is mainly the volume car companies who benefit from current government-backed programs, like the scrappage bonus in Germany and France. So we will be much less affected when the program is discontinued next year.</p>
          <p>In June, our sales increased again in some markets compared to the previous year. Germany plus 15%, China plus 44%, India and Brazil plus 20% and plus 100% respectively. In Brazil, we introduced a MINI in April.</p>
          <p>With regard to global sales, retail decline slowed down in the second quarter. However, in the large triad markets, the U.S., Japan and Western Europe, the downturn in consumption continues. Even though some indicators suggest that the economic situation might improve in the second half of the year, we remain cautious. There's still a lot of uncertainty in the markets. There is no unified agreement among experts.</p>
          <p>This is why we are not announcing a result forecast for the full year 2009 today. We will continue to use measures to steer the company through these hard times.</p>
          <p>Our new models will definitely help us in this area. The new BMW Z4 has been on the market since May and is selling very well. The new all-wheel drive BMW 7 Series will be launched this fall while the V12 version is currently being presented to the media. As the positive sales figures for the new BMW 7 Series show, there is market demand for large, high-efficiency cars. The same is true for our SAVs. We are going to introduce the M models of the BMW X5 and the X6 in September.</p>
          <p>In the fall, we will launch the BMW X1 and the BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo. To meet demand, production will be stepped up, with plants Munich and Leipzig working extra shifts. In Dingolfing, we will temporarily suspend short-time work for the months of September and October. Already in July, we reduced the number of workers on short time to about 12,000.</p>
          <p>The BMW Group is the world's leading premium car manufacturer. As we see it, this leads to a particular responsibility. We believe that premium will have to set clear standards with regards to sustainability. Which brings me directly to my second point, how are we getting ahead with our strategy?</p>
          <p>The general understanding of premium is increasingly defined by sustainability in all its aspects. Customers want to know, is a product made in a resource-friendly way? What kind of company stands behind this product? Does this company act responsibly and sustainably? Being able to answer these questions satisfactorily is crucial for a company's long-term economic success, in my opinion.</p>
          <p>In the automotive industry, we are presently the company with the best sustainability performance.</p>
          <p>In May 2009, BMW Group was once more listed on the FTSE4Good, which is one of the leading sustainability indexes in the world. This means that independent experts have again confirmed our high sustainability standards. And this is the path we will continue to follow with our products and how we produce them.</p>
          <p>In line with our Strategy Number ONE, we continue to focus our expertise and financial resources on sustainability and new drive technologies. Let me give you a few examples. First, due to Efficient Dynamics, we have reduced fuel consumption of our BMW and MINI fleet in Germany to an average of 5.9 liters per 100 kilometer. Unlike with the scrappage incentive, BMW definitely benefits from the new partly CO2-based motor tax and this is a long-term effect.</p>
          <p>Due to this tax adjustment, effective as of July 1, driving a BMW has on average become more economical. By the way, our BMW 118d is the passenger car in Germany that offers the greatest savings on tax, compared to the previous, only cubic capacity-based taxation.</p>
          <p>Second, at the Frankfurt Motor Show, we are going to introduce innovative concepts that combine sporting flair and efficiency in an even more compatibly way. At the same time, the Frankfurt Motor Show marks the kick-off for a comprehensive sustainability campaign that demonstrates what we plan to achieve in the future.</p>
          <p>Third, the sustainable alignment of our company is also the driving force behind our decision to end our Formula One activities with the end of the 2009 season.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we have developed the MINI E. Today's largest fleet of electric cars is currently being tested by customers in everyday driving.</p>
          <p>Fifth, our project i is working on a Megacity Vehicle as well as on new mobility concepts. The Board has now decided this auto will be launched on the market as a sub-brand of BMW. As BMW is the innovation driver within the BMW Group, the decision for a sub-brand under BMW is the most logical step. Details on this topic will be made known later this year.</p>
          <p>All of these examples clearly demonstrate our drive to be the leader when it comes to premium. But it is first and foremost new drive technologies &#x2013; I repeat it &#x2013; but it is first and foremost new drive technologies that will pave the way for a sustainable future.</p>
          <p>We, as well as other companies, have invested early on in the development of new economic technologies. Now it is all about establishing suitable regulations on an international level that will help the new type of mobility to grow. A reliable framework is important for every carmaker to continue to invest effectively and efficiently.</p>
          <p>A promising option also for us is electric mobility. As announced yesterday, we have chosen SB LiMotive as the supplier of battery cells for our future Megacity Vehicles. This is a further step within Strategy Number ONE. This cooperation gives us access to state-of-the-art lithium-ion storage technology. Both partners of this joint venture Bosch and Samsung have the competence and ability to handle the entire battery lifecycle up to the stage of reuse or recycling.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, acting sustainably also means thinking ahead. True, there might be a few scattered indicators of an economic recovery. However, the economic environment will remain volatile, unstable and characterized by the global economic and financial crisis. A lasting recovery period is not yet in sight. This is why we will continue to act with foresight. Step by step, we will continue to implement our vision of becoming the leading provider of premium products and premium services for individual mobility.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Reithofer. And now our CFO, Friedrich Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. As Dr. Reithofer, I will be brief so that you have more time to ask questions.</p>
          <p>Intensive cost control and prudent financial management are the two main pillars of our half-year result. The downward trend in sales volume slowed considerably in June. We expect to see a slightly positive development in the second half of the year. However, the basis effect will play a primary role here.</p>
          <p>Positive signals from the stock markets and from some economic indicators show the first signs of a slight improvement. However, we cannot predict whether a stable recovery is indeed imminent. Instead, we are bracing ourselves for a persistently difficult and volatile environment in the second half of the year. Therefore, we remain cautious and will continue to take measures to enhance efficiency and lower costs.</p>
          <p>As before, we will fight for every euro and every customer. In this regard, our sights are set on both fixed and variable costs. As explained, when we announced our strategy Number ONE, these efforts will take increased effect when we start production for new models. As you know, we will launch a host of new models from the end of 2009 onwards. We will keep you updated over the remaining course of the year.</p>
          <p>What steps did we take in the second quarter? We continued to adjust vehicle production to demand with foresight. In total, manufacturing output in the second quarter was 26% down year-on-year to 306,000 units. Sales volume exceeded production by 32,000 units.</p>
          <p>We continued to implement measures to reduce fixed costs even further, across all areas within the company. This gives us the room for maneuver that we need.</p>
          <p>We will improve our capital efficiency even more in 2009. As announced, we will reduce capital expenditure by 10% compared with last year. We are also optimizing our development costs. The realized potential enables us to invest in forward-looking technologies, despite the large number of new model startups. In so doing, we are strengthening our leading position in Efficient Dynamics.</p>
          <p>Scaling back inventories and actively managing receivables and liabilities enabled us to decrease working capital in the Automobiles segment in the first half of the year. Net current assets were down more than &#x20AC;1.5 billion. As we fill the pipeline in the second-half of the year with new models and production start-ups, we expect a rise in working capital.</p>
          <p>Cash flows from operating activities in the Automobiles segment amounted to &#x20AC;987 million in the second quarter. In the first-half of the year, this figure amounted to &#x20AC;2.1 billion, a decline due to the overall sales trend of 11.5% versus the first-half of 2008. With this result, we asserted ourselves quite well in a difficult environment, particularly considering the 19.5% decline in sales.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we again generated a positive free cash flow in the Automobiles segment in the amount of &#x20AC;296 million. Free cash flow generation in the first-half year was thus significantly positive and amounted to &#x20AC;516 million. These key performance indicators show that we have clear control over our financial management despite the market challenges. Despite the previously mentioned effects on working capital, we will continue to work towards achieving a positive free cash flow for the year as a whole.</p>
          <p>Our liquidity base improved again from the first to the second quarter. At the end of June, the Group's liquidity position was &#x20AC;11.9 billion. We took advantage of the easing of debt capital markets in the first six months and raised funds under attractive conditions.</p>
          <p>Once again, global access to capital markets and the ability to select refinancing tools flexibly paid off for the BMW Group in the second quarter. Despite the difficult environment, we succeeded in optimizing refinancing costs and benefited from the reduction in risk spreads. This puts us in a position to slightly reduce our liquidity in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>In the second half of 2009, we will assess the market's developments and the situation on the capital markets to determine whether we will externalize another tranche of our pension obligations. This externalization, which is part of our Strategy Number ONE, does not only benefit our employees. It also results in financial advantages for the company as a whole. This step will depend on the economic situation and the stability of the capital markets.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to the individual segments. Despite decline in sales volume, the EBIT of the Automobile segment amounted to minus &#x20AC;282 million in the first half. In the second quarter, it totaled only minus &#x20AC;31 million.</p>
          <p>The Financial Services segment proved its mettle in a difficult market environment. In total, Financial Services recorded a profit before tax of &#x20AC;81 million in the second quarter. This was 27% up on the same period last year.</p>
          <p>What does the segment's risk situation look like? The residual value of our used cars in the U.S. and U.K. recovered in the first half of 2009. This was due to increased demand for used cars and sales-promotion measures aimed at returns. Based on the Manheim Index, the U.S. used car &#x2013; luxury car segment hit the highest level since 2001. We achieved higher residual values than forecast in both markets.</p>
          <p>In contrast, residual values in Germany and several other European countries are displaying a more negative trend. In Germany, the scrapping bonus, additional dealer rebates and other factors are causing used car prices to drop. They have not bottomed out yet. Other European markets are depicting a similarly negative picture, caused by comparable state support measures for parts of the automotive industry and the effects of the recession. We expect the used-car markets to continue displaying difficult and diverging developments.</p>
          <p>Credit risks are facing a similar situation. The credit loss ratio recorded a marginal drop from the first to the second quarter. However, we do not view this as a sign of recovery. In light of mounting unemployment rates, short-time work, and the falling consumer index, we do not see any signs of easing in terms of credit defaults in the second half of the year, neither for individual customers, nor for dealerships. We have planned for and taken the appropriate risk provisions in our results.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, given current economic forecasts, we can expect the economy to bottom out in the second half of 2009. But there is no stable upward trend on the horizon, and setbacks cannot be ruled out.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, the Board of Management is anticipating a challenging second half year. We expect competition to remain very fierce. This may have an adverse effect on profits in the months ahead.</p>
          <p>We will proceed with our resolute financial management and continue to act both flexibly and with foresight. As before, we will pursue the profitability goals established in our Strategy Number ONE and this with full force. We expect to be able to seize opportunities to improve earnings on this basis.</p>
          <p>In addition, we expect the upcoming new models to give us tailwind. These will make our portfolio even more attractive and improve our chances in the market. As you can see, the financial figures of the BMW Group clearly show of the relative strength of the company has grown despite an intense competitive environment.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Okay. And our first question is by Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Adam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have a couple of questions, if I may. First, the question on leasing penetration. You've obviously made major efforts to reduce the leasing and to substitute it with a greater Financial Services, let's say, credit and lending operations. But now that your residual values are at least in some of your key markets are improving, are you at a point now where you think the leasing can &#x2013; has fallen enough and you could at least selectively begin to increase the leasing penetration again?</p>
          <p>Second question is on German scrappage program. How many cars, your best estimate &#x2013; and I would imagine that you would have this data from your dealership channel &#x2013; how many cars has BMW sold in Germany this year that have been purchased on the back of a scrappage program &#x2013; of the scrappage program?</p>
          <p>And then as a follow up, do you have any reconnaissance so far for the U.S. scrappage program? What are your dealers saying in the United States about which cars they expect to sell? Do they expect a material impact, obviously maybe not quite as big as some of the Japanese players, but what type of tailwind are you expecting from this program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yes. Thank you very much, Adam. We'll start with Friedrich Eichiner and then Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam, first of all, I'd like to say that we have different picture around the world. So we get some relief in U.S. market and in U.K., but still pressure in Germany and some other European markets. And I think our strategy to step a little bit back in the leasing has paid off so far. In the meantime, our leasing penetration is as high as the financing.</p>
          <p>So overall penetration in the first half was 47%. Financings are of 23.8 and leasing 23.2. And in the U.S., the leasing is still significantly high. It's a bit below 50%. But we think 47, 48 is a healthy number for the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>We are absolutely convinced that leasing is a good strategy in the long term, because we benefit from higher option take-up, we know the customer, the loyalty rate is much higher. So those are all positive points. And coming out of a tough environment on used car market, I think it will give us a certain relief in the used car markets and it can bring the volume of used cars a bit down. That was the idea of our strategy especially in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Scrapping scheme, U.S. and Germany, Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, Adam, I would like to tell you the BMW Group, of course, is profiting less from this scheme than almost any other German manufacturer. Now the figure is only 19,000 BMW and MINI automobiles have so far been sold via the bonus scheme.</p>
          <p>And Adam, I have to mention, amongst, of course, the 19,000 BMW or MINI automobiles, are a lot of BMW 1 Series and MINI One. That means from a contribution point of view, I mean you cannot compare these cars with 5 series, 7 series, a C4 or X5 or X6, I think we agree. So that is our current position in Germany.</p>
          <p>So in the United States, it's too early to say what it means for us at the current moment. It's too early in my opinion. We have to wait another month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Ellinghorst of Credit Suisse. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. It's Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. I have two questions. The first one is, I wonder when you intend to update the market on where we stand with respect to Strategy Number ONE. We know that you've canceled your 6% margin target for next year, but would you be able to prepare us with an update later this year on how and when we get to the 2012 targets of around eight to 10% profitability, ones you've got more visibility obviously?</p>
          <p>And secondly, are you expecting to make more money from marketing used cars coming off lease than one year ago? On a global basis may be you can talk a bit on these affects also on a regional basis. And is this probably moving forward a trend that we should monitor? Would you be comfortable generating more cash from costs coming of lease? And also could you update us on where and how you split these gains from selling used cars, please, between Financial Services and Autos business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much; and Friedrich Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First of all, update on Strategy Number One. We always said that the target is still a target that will remain and we try to achieve it in 2012. Those return on sales target eight &#x2013; between eight and 10% is still a valid target. Now, the question is, how will the ramp-up curve look like? And it's a little bit early to come up with intermediate targets for '10 or '11. I think we first have to know what the outcome of this year will be and then we can look at next year and 2011. But I think as you can see when you look at our financial figures, the cost management things like that, we do everything to really bring the company on a different level of efficiency when the market comes back, and we see again volume growth, we really should be able to achieve those targets that is our position.</p>
          <p>Now the question is, how quickly will the market come back? That's it. Now, used car &#x2013; you're absolutely right. We have a different picture all around the world. So we have used car values in the U.S. as we have planned for this year. This is a positive effect. A bit offset by a negative effect in other markets, like in Germany with a scrapping allowance we got from Burton on the used car values and with the high sales allowances in the market. You are possibly aware that our tax rocket took the prices down for the whole industry and whole sector and this has a negative effect that is compensating positive effects in other parts of the world, like the U.S. and the U.K. So we have to see how this develops in Europe for the time being.</p>
          <p>And now your question, how we differentiate between Financial Services business and the Auto business? We have a so-called loss-sharing agreement, where the losses and the wins are &#x2013; and the profits are shared. This is a clear rule that we apply in all major markets and this will be applied when it comes to profits as well. So both segments then will benefit from better used car prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And may I just follow up, because I'm seeking just a clear answer on both questions. I mean, are we getting an update this year, yes or no, on Strategy Number ONE? And secondly, are you currently making more money selling used cars than a year ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, we are not making the losses we made last year on the used cars. That's what is clear. And I think it's reflected in the Financial Services result. We are positive &#x2013; much more positive, 27% better than last year. And last year, we got the first hits coming out of falling used car values. So this is clearly a positive signal. And we are preparing now more details and large discussion <mark type="inaudible" /> Frankfurt, and clearly you will get detailed and in-depth update on Strategy Number ONE product portfolio financials. So, a more broader picture as far as I can see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to add, because you ask what about a report, where are we from a Strategy Number ONE point of view? I mean, Arndt, have in mind that we lost during the first six months of the year 2009 roughly 20% volume, and our EBIT is plus &#x20AC;114 million in the first six months. In my opinion, that is the first crystal clear result of Strategy Number ONE, because as you know, we started to realign our company from October 2007 on and with &#x2013; on the volume side, minus 20% to achieve a positive EBIT is a first crystal clear sign that Strategy Number ONE works.</p>

          <p>The next question is from John Lawson of Citi. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks very much. I was first of all wondering about this brand decision that you made or announced to us today to keep Megacity within the BMW brand envelope. I mean, on the face of it, it seems to signal quite a lot about your future visions, the values of the BMW brand. I wondered if you could confirm is this a new assessment of this brand in train, and is there a new bulge of engineering and R&amp;D spend potentially on the way if you do have to further reorient BMW brand along those lines, especially given the catch-up that we're seeing with some competitors now. And you mentioned M, I think as a sub brand this morning. Is that also compatible with this evolving image? That was the first question. And I wonder just rather more simply whether you could help us a bit on understanding inventory and working capital. Can you say whether your desired or your minimum inventory level was the bulk of your portfolio right now, is there more to squeeze out of that? I think, we all understand that you've got two new products coming up and that you'll have to have some dealer stock of those? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, John, we'll start with Norbert Reithofer for project i and our sub brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, for me a very simple explanation what does it mean to be a sub brand of BMW. I mean, at the moment, we have a sub brand, it's BMW M for high performance cars. So &#x2013; and something like BMW M is possible as a sub brand on the other end. For example, BMW brand for sustainable vehicles, for example.</p>
          <p>That is how we have it in our mind at the moment. So that means very good example high-performance vehicle, BMW M, very good and very efficient from a fuel consumption point of view, electric mobility and so on a sub brand like BMW M, but on the other end. So that is how we have it in our minds.</p>
          <p>And you should know, project i is all about new technical projects. Project i is not just a Megacity Vehicle, because if you think or if you have in mind the year 2015 and 2020, I mean, in the year 2020, in Europe, only 95 gram per kilometer CO2. So that means we all have to change all car companies. So &#x2013; and what it means in principle, you have to protect your brands, BMW MINI and Rolls-Royce. And we start now with BMW that was the reason to create a sub brand under BMW.</p>
          <p>And you ask from a R&amp;D point of view, we will stay within the band of five to 5.5%. That is my answer.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question about working capital development. On working capital development, I mean, it comes down to stock of produced cars. It's very much related with our sales forecast, our expectation for the future. We &#x2013; on a monthly basis, we review the situation. We ask the markets what their expectation is for the next two to three months and then we decide about production.</p>
          <p>So if the expectation is that the markets are going up again and we will see more volume in the markets then we clearly have to produce more cars. And this will be then the respective decision.</p>
          <p>So it really depends on the forecast of the forthcoming months. We think on the level we are now that this is clearly a kind of a bottom level we have on the working capital side, and with the new products to come, we clearly have to build up the pipeline in order to be able to sell them in worldwide markets.</p>
          <p>But nevertheless, if the sales forecast is right, we should be able to sell the cars and then we will generate cash. So our target remains in place that we have a positive free cash flow for the whole year, and we can demonstrate this at the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Okay. Our next question comes from Thierry Huon of BNP Paribas. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. My name is Thierry Huon, speaking from BNP Paribas. So, first of all, about your target for 2012. As we understand it's kind of tough to elaborate too much on that. But could you give us the mainframe of your assumptions for getting to this return, I guess, that you have some assumptions in terms of volumes, in terms of pricing, to justify this target. So if you could share that with us, would be great?</p>
          <p>Then could we have the split of inventories between BMW and the independent dealers? Is the situation the same on both side, or is there some discrepancies? And about your value improvement in the U.S., do you believe this comes in the first place from a better demand or from a shortage of used cars, since a lot of players try to reduce leasing and to extend leasing contract. So I guess this had an impact on the car coming out of lease. And last question if I may, in the cash flow statement, we saw some provision reversal. Could you tell us from what this comes? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Friedrich Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, first of all, targets 2012, what is our plan and how can we achieve them? I think, as you can see in our numbers, we are really hard working on the efficiency side that we are able to bring fixed cost down. In the same point in time, we really are working within our new product programs. So variable costs in &#x2013; of those products will be on a different level.</p>
          <p>So with all the new models to come, we are expecting much better margins, and this should help us in a situation that the volumes are growing again. That the market is coming back, that even with maybe a lower number of total volume, we should be able in 2012 to achieve those targets, because the cost base is adjusted and if we can hold the cost base down, we should be able to really achieve those targets, eight up to 10% return on sales.</p>
          <p>And I think between 2010 and 2012, 50% of our overall volume will be renewed with new cars. And we see the whole portfolio to be much more attractive in this period. It will be the youngest portfolio we have over the years, and this will give us a certain tailwind as well, in order to achieve those targets. So that's more or less the story behind it. And then &#x2013; on your question about the inventory split between dealers and our company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we did &#x2013; what we really did is, we tried to improve working capital situation on the dealer side as well. So we took some &#x2013; we gave dealers some relief on the stock side. So they could bring stocks down against last year in order to really bring &#x2013; give them a better financial position in this &#x2013; those difficult days. So that was the target and it's not like this that we brought our working capital down and dealers had to increase working capital, this is really not the case.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and the next question was on the improvement &#x2013; the recovery of residual values and where it comes from. We have a strong demand for used cars now, especially in the U.S. market. We sold high volumes. It seems to be that our strategy works out. We implemented a sales channel with our dealers. We certified pre-owned cars, very well equipped, with good quality and with the &#x2013; with specific packages which are very attractive, our dealers could really sell more used cars and this helped stabilizing the values. And I think this is a sustainable strategy that we will pursue in forthcoming years as well.</p>
          <p>Now on the used car &#x2013; on the new car business side, clearly there is still a lot of pressure in the market. As you saw in Germany, premium manufacturers will not benefit from scrapping allowances as much as the volume manufacturers. So we still are very careful with our expectations on the new car market side for markets like the U.S.</p>

          <p>The revision? Yes. Okay. Well, the decrease is partially due to drawings on provisions for personnel and social expenses, including severance payments, as we explained already in Q1 '09.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I would ask three questions, if I may. Number one, earlier in the year, when we met in Munich, I think, you &#x2013; some of your team was quite optimistic about gaining market share from some of your smaller competitors, such as Volvo, Saab, in the wake of this financial crisis. By now we see that many governments are stepping in and that pretty much no car company has let go. Have you changed your view on going forward, on your ability to change &#x2013; to raise market share?</p>
          <p>And secondly, looking at your net interest result in the automotive activities. We're seeing net cash rising since many quarters, at the same time, your net interest result remains negative for the automotive activities, and actually even increased its negativity for the first half, what's the reason for that? And thirdly, looking at currencies, we haven't discussed this for a while, could you just give us an update on your hedging policy, dollar being at 144 can't be good by any means. What's the outlook for the next two years on that side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We start with Friedrich Eichiner with net interest results and currencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The net interest result was hampered by the general reduction in interest and the high cash proposition of total interest bearing assets. Op expense income, for example, the reversal of the discounting of provisions for pensions flow into the net interest results besides the interest on the net financial assets, and that was the main reason for that number. And now you asked currencies.</p>
          <p>We have nearly fully hedged our main currencies, so U.S. dollar and the yen, and the British pound for 2009, whereas we expect to experience significant relief from yen in 2009. The unfavorable development of sterling and various emerging markets' currencies will have an adverse effect on our earnings. In the final analysis, the amount of headwind in 2009 will partially depend on the retail trend displayed by the respective markets, but at the end of the day, we expect less stress than in 2008.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I use the so-called plus segment share, then we were able to improve in the first six months by 0.6% our segment share. On the BMW side, in MINI 0.1%, that means the first six months we were able to increase our segment share. And of course, it is our target to increase our segment share forever, and nothing has changed.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Okay. Your next question comes from Christian of Oppenheim. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian Breitsprecher from Oppenheim. I have three questions. First on your working capital, when we look at the different components of working capital then actually you had a positive impact from trades payables, increasing by 700 million in the first half of the year and I'm wondering how that can happen when actually production volumes are coming off so much? Related to the cash flow question also question to your net financial position, you are disclosing the net financial position for the automotive business, would you be willing to give us also a number for the net financial position of the other entities? And the last question, are you taking any extended summer breaks to bring down production volumes, or is the summer break just as regular normal schedule?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll start with your last question, extended summer breaks, Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Extended summer break, I can only say, it &#x2013; I would like to answer your question in total. First of all, good signals are, we were able to reduce people on short-time work down to 12,000. So to be able to support the retail side from a production point of view, we have to add even additional shifts in Leipzig and in Munich. So &#x2013; and what we will do as well is, we will suspend short-time work at our Dingolfing plant for the months of September and October. What are the reasons behind?</p>
          <p>On the one hand, we are now ramping up new models, X1 in Leipzig, 5 Series GT in Dingolfing. On the other hand, we have ambitious retail goals for the second half of the year. Hence the production ramp-up just announced and the extra shift in Munich and Leipzig. That is the explanation. If I see the summer, the summer of course will be for us the normal August. Having not compared to before the financial crisis where we had two weeks, of course you cannot yet compare it with a normal year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Friedrich Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, first of all, talking about the other segments. The &#x2013; so we are not disclosing net interest-bearing assets in those segments. Now to your question about the trade payables; trade payables as of 12 2008 were really unusually low. That was due to the plant shutdowns for the vacation early December. You remember we had a very tough production cut in order to balance supply and demand. And by doing it, we had a longer shutdown in December, and that was the major reason that the payables were going down so much.</p>
          <p>Now they rose significantly versus this number, due to the production start-up then in the first quarter of '09, and another marginal increase in second quarter over first quarter is also due to higher production volumes in quarter two. And if you compare it to 2008, you will see that this is really a one-off effect that was caused because of the heavy cuts the end of the year 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good afternoon. Horst Schneider from HSBC. Two questions, if I may. First one is on the negative net pricings that you still see it for the second half of 2009. It would be great, if you could provide some more details on that. So for example, first of all, if you expect net pricing to deteriorate further in H2 compared to H1, maybe you can give also some indication, which segments are affected the most, and maybe also you could give some color on the fact which OEM is here leading the price decline in the premium market at the moment?</p>
          <p>And then the second question that I have is regarding the cooperation with, or the potential additional cooperation with, PSA you mentioned in the media conference. Maybe you can provide some more details in which areas do you expect to extend the cooperation? When do you expect some additional savings on that, or in general, when can we expect some final details on these negotiations? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said, we started to talk with each other and it is far too early to talk about when we will achieve what result. Because I have to say there is at the moment nothing new to announce. I mean, we are at the moment successfully cooperating with PSA on engine production. We have talks at the moment to do more than engines, but it's far too early to talk about what result in what year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your question about the net pricing, the negative effect. I mean, you are aware that we had a situation at the beginning of this year that competitors had a high stock because they didn't stop production right in time, and they had to get rid of stock. That was done now in the first half of the year. So, a lot of pressure was in the market in order to sell those cars clean on stock coming from the higher production in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>And this was &#x2013; caused a lot of stress to the market. Now we &#x2013; the customers are now used to a higher level of incentives, and our view is and expectation is that this will not be possible to bring it down from one month to the other. So we have to bring that stepwise down, and not only we can do it, if you follow-up our numbers in the U.S. market, we did the first step now in July. We've reduced our incentive spending by 25% against last year.</p>
          <p>But if you follow-up what is the advertisement, you can see there is still a lot of incentive spending in the market. And as I said, we now have a situation with the customer a little bit used to high incentives, and we have to bring the levels down in the industry. And our expectation is that this will take a while, and will not be over with the start of the next quarter. That's the reason why we are not so optimistic with the net pricing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe an add-on question here. So do you expect then sequentially the pricing to improve in H2 versus H1?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

The second question I have is based on independent data, it seems like you have about 38 days of inventory in the U.S. Is that a level that you think is appropriate? Is that the level that you think you need to increase assuming some stabilization or recovery in the market? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Well, first of all, so in fact of short time work, we are not closing those &#x2013; disclosing those numbers. Now your question about the inventory. So we are adjusting our inventories based on the sales forecast. And that's the way how we decide on our production. Actually, the sales forecast in U.S. is balanced with our production and with the expectation for the forthcoming months. And we have also to consider that we have model year changes to manage and that new cars are on the way &#x2013; new products are on their way to come into this market.</p>

          <p>Okay. Our final question comes from Philippe Barrier of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Philippe Barrier, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Two question. The first is regarding the default risk, you mentioned that you see a decline in the risk at the end of second quarter. Nevertheless, do you think that you have maybe to put additional provisions, does it mean that you have to put extra provisions to cover the risk of default in the coming quarters or it has been already put in the results of Financial Services in the first two quarters as the level of profitability is extremely low compared with the previous years?</p>
          <p>And second question is regarding the cost of short-term working in the first half compared with the second half, you mean that you have to put extra shifts in the second half of the year? It does seems that actually we increase the cost of production as compared with the first half, where short-term working was extremely strong during these two quarters.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think, we start with Friedrich Eichiner with the first time of the question or first part of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now you questioned about the default rate. So the credit loss ratio was slightly lower than at the end of Q1. We still expect to see an increase in delinquent and unpaid accounts for the full-year. Now we anticipated the strength and we took account of it by allocating higher routine provisions in our budgets. So we are not expecting further unexpected burdens coming from this because it was expected.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, you asked the question, what does it mean for the second half of the year, if we increase production again. I mean, you have always two sides of a coin. I mean, if we increase production, we have also a better utilization of our capacity. And that of course improves profitability as well. That means, it will be a very balanced situation.</p>
