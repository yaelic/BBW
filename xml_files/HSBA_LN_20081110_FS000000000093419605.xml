          <p>Welcome to HSBC Holdings Plc Interim Management statement and HSBC Finance Corporation and HSBC U.S.A. Incorporated Third Quarter 2008 results. Today's presentation is being chaired by Michael Geoghegan, Group Chief Executive, HSBC Holdings Plc; and Douglas Flint, Group Finance Director, HSBC Holdings Plc.</p>
          <p>This presentation and subsequent discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial conditions, results of operations and business of the Group. These forward-looking statements represent the Group's expectations or beliefs concerning future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainty that could cause actual results, performance or events vary materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Additional detailed information concerning important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is available in our annual and interim report.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Michael Geoghegan. Go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thank you and good afternoon to those of you joining the call in London, good morning to those of you joining us from the States, and good evening to those of you joining us from Asia. You will have seen the interim management statement we issued earlier this morning, and Douglas and I will be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>But first, I'd like to run through some of the key points. Against the backdrop of turbulent markets and a slowing global economy, we have produced pre-tax profits in third quarter 2008 that were ahead of third quarter 2007. Pre-tax profit for the nine months in 30 September was lower than the equivalent period in 2007, but by less in percentage terms than the position at the half year.</p>
          <p>Our businesses in Asia have driven our performance, supported by solid results in Europe and Latin America. These have been helped to offset the increased weakness in the U.S. business. Our diversity has been a strength and a protection.</p>
          <p>Global Banking and Markets was profitable in the quarter, driven by strong emerging markets performance, reflecting the success of our emerging markets led and financing focus strategy. We continued to generate capital during the third quarter 2008 from our operating activities. This helped us improve our Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.9% at the 30th of September, towards the top of our current target range.</p>
          <p>Our financial strength has also allowed us to invest further in emerging markets with strong growth prospects, as set out in our strategy. Specifically, we have made further investments in China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan and Vietnam. We believe these results highlight the importance of HSBC's core strength, sound liquidity, capital strength, cost discipline, relationship banking and our global distribution capabilities.</p>
          <p>Now, Douglas and Stuart Gulliver and I will be very happy to take your questions. First question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Mike and Douglas. A couple of quick questions. Just to confirm, when you say your third quarter '08 was higher than third quarter '07, is &#x2013; that is including the benefit from the fair value and owned debt and the one-off from the French businesses? So, if you could confirm that. And the second question relates to your participation in the U.K. treasury plan. Is there any imposition of payout ratio or dividend restrictions on HSBC? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to confirm you, what you said is right. The bear numbers, Q3 against Q3 includes the special items that we've highlighted in the trading segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second part, we're not part of any agreement with the government in regard to the guarantees that they've give to other banks. So we're restricted any movements in regard to capital payout.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>We'll now take our next question from Ian Smiley from RBS. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gents. Three questions please, all on the balance sheet. The first one is behind the assets being broadly stable in Q3, could you give us some sense as to what the moving parts are between loans and non-loans? The second question is on deposit flows. And I don't know if you've got some sense as to how big that number has been in absolute terms in Q3 please. And the third question is on risk weighted assets and how they have performed during the quarter in order to allow us to build up the picture behind the Tier I comment which you made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The balance sheet &#x2013; in terms of loans and advances and dollar terms, it's fair. For loan and advances, it's marginally lower. For customer accounts, it's broadly stable. But remember, we get currency impact. So in currency terms, both have probably grown, one a little bit, one a bit more than that. Our risk weighted assets so broadly stable, marginally lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Next question, please?</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Our next question comes from Lee Goodwin from Fox-Pitt Kelton. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, hi, good afternoon gentlemen. A couple of questions, please. One on the 8 Canada Square. I wondered if you could just provide us with an update perhaps on progress in terms of being able to book that gain or indeed whether we should now be expecting that to come through for this year. And my second question relates to, there is a reference to &#x2013; within Europe, a single European property company or an impairment on that. I wonder if you could give us some sort of sense of magnitude for that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well for both of those, I'm somewhat restricted. I can't talk about customer advances, et cetera. But we envisage the &#x2013; there will be development in regard to the Canary Wharf building in the fourth quarter, and I can't comment in regard to the third quarter. And I will leave it at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you anyway. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Tom Rayner from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good. Good morning, it's Tom Rayner from Citigroup here. Just got a few questions. The first one, just a clarification on the comments about the underlying pre-tax growth in Asia, Lat Am and Europe, the nine months on nine months. Just sort of to clarify when you say underlying, does that include the fair value gain within that guidance or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's in there? Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it is &#x2013; so just to be clear. We don't remember allocate fair value gain to any of the customer groups. So when we're talking about PFS or Commercial of Global Banking and Markets, it doesn't include fair value gain, because the fair value gain and indeed the gain in the sale of the French banks is separated. Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah, sure, sure. Could I also &#x2013; just on your target sort of capital ratios, could you comment on how you're viewing sort of Tier I versus core now? Also how &#x2013; the impact of countries where the local regulations might force you to hold more than your target? Could you comment on how you see those factors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean clearly across the world, we are seeing regulators seek to protect the capital positions of domestic banking operations. We've always run and always will run in accordance with local regulation and we keep a modest cushion beyond that in local markets. And we keep the group surplus at the top. And nothing's changed on that.</p>
          <p>Yes, there is some pressure around the world for slightly higher ratios. And we are dealing with that. But thus far, it's not been particularly significant. And I think that the structure of the group where we demonstratively held the surplus capital, the stock is well understood by all our regulators. So perhaps we're in a somewhat different position than purely domestic banks that don't have a tiered system above them. But I think it's fair to say that we also had surplus capital at the subsidiary level well above the minimum capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and yes we could.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well before any of the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've always run with a cushion above local regulatory minimum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. And just finally, could you just comment on the IFS reserve hit, how much of that you think may become an impairment going forward and also, could quantify the scale of deposit inflows you have enjoyed in Q3 and any impact that may have had on profit at this stage? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stuart Gulliver will take the first question and then Douglas will take the second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at page seven of the announcement, we're talking about 4.8 billion additional to AFS reserves. But we also point out the bottom of the first paragraph from page 8, the actual impairment so far has only been 37 million. But actually, the way the accounting treatment works on 4 &#x2013; 542 million of face value, we're required to write down 246. So therefore the 246 taken on that to P&amp;L in the quarter. We also had a write-down on some equity positions that we had in Fannie and Freddie of about 210 million in the quarter. So you have total of about 476.</p>
          <p>So therefore the impairment is dramatically lower than the actual write-downs, because the actual write-downs continue to reflect illiquidity and uncertainty rather than impairment and if you remember in the first half, the totality was 55 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, I mean &#x2013; we've had good inflows in deposits and in dollar terms, broadly similar. We had particularly good flows in the Premier segment for all the reasons you can imagine, particularly during August, September and then till October. And then in some of our Professional businesses and Global Banking and Markets and then our Commercial Banking, we've seen customers get more liquid and place cash with us.</p>
          <p>So splitting out all the reasons for deposit inflows is fairly difficult. But across all our segments, we've seen more liquidity and more liquidity placed with us. It's difficult, I think at this stage to put a dollar number on it. But we'll try and break it out more meaningfully at the end of the year. But across all segments, we've seen good inflow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry then &#x2013; just has there been any material earnings impact of those inflows, or is that all just going into very sort of risk free liquid instruments which may therefore not have boosted NII for instance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've answered your own question, I mean &#x2013; the deployment has been fairly low yielding in terms of being cautious about where we put the money. Because the challenge is to deploy that liquidity when it comes in unexpectedly for very short notice anywhere where we could make much of a &#x2013; but we've taken deposit rates down, so &#x2013; we do make money, but we don't make significant spreads on the deposit inflows. But we do make money. But it's deployed safely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Simon Samuels from Equities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Simon Samuels from Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We know who you are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I thought I'd come in disguise there. So, two or three things, actually. First of all, just &#x2013; I was wondering on the issue of the pace of deterioration in credit quality that you're seeing in household, sorry, HSBC Finance. So you've obviously made the common statement that essentially, HSBC Finance was broadly in line with your expectations, but the current trends point to a further deterioration in the near to medium term. So, I was wondering if you can just talk around that issue and in particular, I guess really what's happened since the end of September when these comments apply.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well firstly, I think &#x2013; let's break it down into three parts of HSBC Finance. Our mortgage brokerage business &#x2013; this is the <mark type="audio gap" />- that is very much stabilized. It's &#x2013; we said it was around 29 billion. You will recall it was 49 billion at the end of 2006. And the impairment of that has somewhat been stable across the period.</p>
          <p>In regards to consumer lending through our branch networks, we have seen some deterioration in the 2006 and 2007 vintages <mark type="audio gap" /> as you know yourself, it's a reflection on the underlying economy and particularly on the unemployment rates. We have seen a tick-up in both of those, and I suspect you will find them tick up more as the unemployment figures increase in the coming months. And that's why we've laid out that notice to you. But if you do bear in mind that 50% of the book is prime and 50% are  percent of subprime. So I will not be going to give you a forward projection where we see it, but we do expect it to go in line with unemployment rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And would you &#x2013; I mean before I leave that one, do you think the past is a guide to the future in terms of the pace of deterioration that household &#x2013; sorry, HSBC Finance has previously experienced in previous periods of unemployment in the US going out, do you think that's a good proxy or is your expectation that that is actually is going to be more pronounced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frankly, I can't tell, because a lot has to do with the stimulus package that you're seeing being debated at the current time, is it going to one, two or three, I can't say. Clearly, the new administration is keen to avoid unemployment rates going higher. But if there is nothing, then there will be a tick up, but I can't give you a projection of where that will be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. The second question is just on the slightly &#x2013; sort of it feels a bit old fashioned to ask about cost/income ratios. But &#x2013; given all the else that's going on. But it looks &#x2013; I mean you basically post about $20 billion a quarter of revenues, and in the third quarter, you've taken a substantial fair value gain through the revenue line, obviously way in excess of the mark-to-market loss. There's no sense that there's an offset there. Is there a kind of &#x2013; I mean should we be thinking about the cost/income ratio excluding that fair value gain? Because I mean otherwise, it looks like if you like the underlying cost/income ratio will have deteriorated sharply in the sort of third quarter and therefore maybe the second half. I mean how do you &#x2013; when you talk about in the statement costs being marginally higher year-on-year and similar to the first half, is that against the backdrop of an ex fair value gain of revenue base that's flat or up or down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's totally independent of the revenues. I mean it's basically saying if you take the cost for the first half of the year and divide them by two, add a little bit, you won't be very far away. I mean that's where it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I suppose &#x2013; what I'm really getting at is, shouldn't we expect the cost/income ratio to improve a lot, just because the fair value gains is clearly one off, it's got no associated cost to it, it's a very significant part of your revenues, it's boosted your revenues with no offsetting increase in the cost base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a pro forma basis, that must be a statement to the truth, the 3.4 billion in the third quarter fair value gains, there's no cost against it, so whatever the cost/income ratio would otherwise have been simply for taking one number over the other. It's better than it would have been. I mean we don't regard that as part of a managed performance. It doesn't, as we say, go into any of the customer groups, it's not in global banking markets, it's not allocated to TFS or for CMB. It rises predominantly in the United States and the UK, and yes, it does affect the published numbers, but you could &#x2013; we would adjust it if we were you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then very lastly, I just want to go back to Tom's question on capital. So basically, you've said you have always run with this big cushion against either what the regulator demands or also whatever the banks have runways. That cushion is obviously getting a lot smaller as the regulatory demands go up around the world and as other banks re-cap as well. So my simple question is, are you comfortable with that cushion getting a lot smaller, or would you like to reestablish that cushion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've said in our statement that we are happy with our capital position at the current time. Do bear in mind that people who are quoting ratios higher than us, I suspect, are not creating capital. We are creating capital from our ongoing business every month. So I would have thought that others who may currently have higher ones will drop down below us. But 8.9% at the top bar range, I think it's a comfortable position to be at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're comfortable with that cushion &#x2013; forget about the competitors, but versus the regulator, because obviously the regulator requirements are going up everywhere, so your cushion mathematically has got smaller versus whatever the regulator first thought of. You are comfortable with that cushion narrowing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are comfortable with the position that we have. We are not saying it's narrowing or anything else to that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Yeah, hi, chaps, it's actually Andre Piget from UBS. Can you hear me okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have three questions that I &#x2013; quickly if I can. Firstly on capital. I hear what you said in terms of buffer, et cetera. I'm just trying to workout a bit of math backwards here. It looks as if the total Tier I ratio is up about 10 basis points or so from where we were at the halfway stage. Clearly, the overvalued gains underlying debt don't have <mark type="inaudible" /> wash in terms of capital so we can ignore that. The gain on the French disposal &#x2013; no taxes, that dropped straight to the bottom line. So that looks like it's pretty much accounted for the increase in the Tier I ratio. So it looks as if the business is pretty much absorbing the capital it's generating, whereas that's not what you seem to allude to, Mike. So am I missing something there in terms of our FX on risk assets or something which would suggest it's consuming capital squared? I can't quite seem to see how at this stage, it's generating capital on its own, and I've got two other quick questions, if I can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we're saying is, if you take out all the funnies, which we said and you then &#x2013; business excluding the French gain made money, and we had the French gain in top of that. So we generated capital in the quarter. How we deploy that capital is how we deploy the capital, but we generated capital in the quarter, so we added stock and capital. Yeah, the foreign exchange move is clear that both risk-weighted assets and the actual capital position, you're right that the fair value gains in their own debt are ignored for capital purposes. So they don't have an impact. So all we're saying is we're generating capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. But the other two questions quickly were firstly, on the goodwill on the U.S. business, where you flagged a statement that you might be reviewing that come year-end. I think from memory in the past, the Group <mark type="inaudible" /> not from the U.S., but you were very happy with it at the group level, because of the cash flows supplied by the U.S. business in aggregate. So it sounds like that's a change there, and I was just wondering if you comment on that? And then the final one was for Stuart, I was just wondering if you can give us a bit more granularity on the 0.6 billion of credit write-offs and what's driven that, what that relates to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The goodwill point, you're absolutely right, we're simply flagging that this is going to be an issue, we're going to think carefully about it at the end of the year. And it's a simple discounting model with three factors, the quantum of flat cash flows, the timing of cash flows and the appropriate discount rates and to the extent that the U.S. economy has weakened and to the extent that it weakens further, that will have impacts on possibly all three of those elements.</p>
          <p>So you're right, what we are doing is saying, this is going to be an area we're going to spend some careful consideration out at the end of the year. We're giving you a heads-up that the factors are probably on the weak side. So we're alerting you. But again, on the capital point, if we were to have a further write-down of goodwill, it does not impact our capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the 600 million, it's the same type of asset that we've been writing down since June, July of 2007. So it's more on monolined ABS structured credit. And it's existing positions, so it's not new positions and new risk, it's the same set of assets that have been illiquid and therefore have substantial write-downs, which I think we believe are in excess of their likely cash pay at the end of maturity. But there's not fresh positions and it's the usual suspects.</p>

          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Manis Cristello from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I had a question please on the branch based U.S. mortgages, the consumer lending real estate secured portfolio. I noticed that there was obviously a big increase in delinquencies, and also, you took a big impairment provision in the second half, but looking &#x2013; in the third quarter rather. But looking at coverage levels where the impairment allowances over NPLs, it looks like they've fallen a touch and in fact they are below the levels that you have in the mortgage services book. So I wondered, if we see delinquencies continue to increase in these books, should we expect a double whammy of both an increase in coverage levels and an increase in the NPLs going forward? Or are you comfortable with this kind of coverage level you have at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The coverage level is entirely related to the security packages that we have. So the mix of the states on the types of exposures that are causing impairment will affect that, So if it's different because the mix of business is different. So yes, we're happy with where the coverage ratios are &#x2013; if the mix of business changes and the coverage ratios will change. But essentially, in every case, what we're doing is setting up impairment reserves for the impairment that are indicated by the roll rate methodology and the just mentioned the factors we have in regard to deterioration. So it's entirely driven by where the exposures are rising. It's not a question of getting some particular coverage ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second thing is most of the consumer lending through the branch was first mortgaged. And the ones you saw through the brokers was &#x2013; had seconds in them, various other bits. So you would expect that portfolio to have a higher provisioning figure against it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But going forward, we should assume that increases in delinquencies in the branch base will be similar to increases in the impairment taken through the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think for the last, gosh, nine quarters we have been taking provisions that have been in excess of charge-offs because we've been building reserves. That will continue until a point in time where the future looks better than the past. So the fact that we're building reserves say that the forward outlook is higher than the statistical roll rate based on history. And that will continue until the outlook improves, at which point, it will stabilize and you can see that happening there in mortgage services, because of the maturity of the portfolio and then obviously as things improve, you will be providing less than you're charging off.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good day. I just wanted to get a better sense for the ongoing commitment to the HSBC Finance business, and talk a little bit if you could about the capital injection during the quarter and what is your target, tangible equity to tangible managed assets ratio in that business, presently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll start and then Douglas will come in with some of the numbers. I mean firstly, our commitment to our US operations is continuous. We have, as we've demonstrated, put more capital in, we'll put in whatever capital is required to be put in, and we'll keep it well above the minimum ratios for the business, and we've had no problems funding ourselves. And in fact, we retired over 20 billion worth of funding this year in regard to funding that we have taken for this business, and that came from cash flow from receivables and paid back. And to the second point, Douglas, do you want to talk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean the rating agencies dictate or set the tangible common equity to tangible managed assets that we operate here, which tends to be in the mid sevens. And we work to that. And our commitment is to continue to work to the tangible common equities, tangible managed asset ratio that the market, or the rating agencies on behalf of the market, regard as appropriate, and we meet those requirements and we'll continue to meet those.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, sorry, didn't hear you at first. Good afternoon. I have just two quick questions. The transfer of &#x2013; or the planned transfer of Card and Retail services balances and the Motor Vehicle balances over to the HSBC Bank. Could you just confirm that that is effectively, I suppose, using the liquidity in HSBC Bank using the &#x2013; effectively sort of soaking up the stronger retail deposit base? Is that effectively the advantage or are there other advantages, and could...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is the effective advancement, it's nothing new to us. We've taken the private label business through the bank for some period of time and there's just a logical sense as we attract deposits, we have excess deposits and rather than lend them into the market we are moving assets across into our own banking business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that just presumably just carries on then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it's just a regulatory approval of each time we make the transfer, but provided those approvals come through, yes, I mean it's a natural thing. I wouldn't expect the balance sheet of the US bank ever to be more than, say, 30% of subprime assets, but you're not at anything like that level yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question, Stuart, is just on asset quality in Europe. I just wonder if you could just maybe just enlarge particularly on the UK &#x2013; I know you're saying the mortgage exposure is well secured and you've given the reasons why &#x2013; but perhaps just your observations really on asset quality, more as we go into next year, I guess, what you're seeing in terms of early indicators?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well firstly, you will recall in 2006, late 2006 we called the top of the UK market is &#x2013; how we'd &#x2013; we did throughout 2007 fall back particularly into mortgage lending and actually lost market share on purpose, and we went back into the market in 2008 with much lower LTVs. And the quality of loans that we attracted from others who were in difficulty were significant. Low LTVs in the market was expected. Those mortgages are performing well and the overall mortgage book is performing well.</p>
          <p>We have indicated when we did give that warning to the market that we wouldn't be that energetic in taking commercial real estate loans and we continue not to do that. But the market generally is beginning to slow and pricing is beginning to continue, because there are a large number of banks that are unable to fund themselves and they do need to refinance their lending and their customers equally, and that's where we are.</p>
          <p>For the outlook, it's very hard to tell there were any reflections of the underlying economy, and I think the economy is going to deteriorate to some extent, and we will watch it carefully on your behalf.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. A couple of questions, if I may. First off, is there any group level impact on equity from the sale of the Canadian businesses to a separate entity? I note that you did mention that there was some goodwill impact at the local level, I just wondered if that had a group impact?</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second question was, do you envisage the PFS division being profitable before associated contribution in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to answer that question, I mean we can't &#x2013; I mean we're not going to put out a profit forecast in respect of one of the divisions. So you'll have to estimate or &#x2013; no, I mean we can't answer that question.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Michael Helsby from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I've got a few questions. Firstly, just on your overall comments at the start, when you're trying to size the performance in profit terms. I think at the half year, you talked about profits before special factors had been about 13.9 billion. And reading between the lines and taking into account your guidance, it feels like in the quarter, you're only generating profit before special factors of between 2.5 and $3.5 billion. I was wondering if you could comment on whether that's in the right ballpark, because it feels like there has been quite a material shift down in profitability in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question is in regard to Asia. And that effectively, I mean clearly you've referred in your commentary that Asia is starting to slow. You particularly comment on Hong Kong from a fee income point of view. I was wondering if you could ground that to some sort of base level, maybe back to 2005 levels or something like that. But also, I'm very conscious of the fact that the slow down in Asia from trade seems to be more of a Q4 event, rather than necessarily a Q3 certainly backend Q3 loaded. So without asking you to give me a forecast, I was wondering if you could give some color on current trends in Asia, notably in GBM, and in Commercial. And also on currency, there's clearly been a big shift in dollar exchange rates around the world. I was wondering if you could quantify the impact on your book value as at the Q3 stage. And if spot rates remained at this level, just mathematically what impact that would have on your earnings for next year? And if you feel generous, I've got another one on the US.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't you give it to us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I mean &#x2013; I think unsurprisingly, bad debts in HSBC Finance are still going up, and clearly you've referred to unemployment going up, and that's going to cause a further tick up, It's quite interesting in the U.S. bank that bad debt is now at 1.7 billion for the first nine months, which is up more than double on where it was last year. So I think that the finance company gets a hell of a lot of focus, but clearly it's a lot boarder than that. So I was wondering if you could comment on the outlook for the bank bad debt as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm going to ask Douglas to take these on trend in profits outside Asia. Douglas, you take currency and I'll do the USA. So, you're on first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think the sort of analysis you have done is exactly what we'd expect an analyst to do, but on the favor we are not going comment on it because we are making, we are basically putting out numbers or putting ranges around numbers that we haven't disclosed so, you must do your own calculations. In relation to currency and FX, I think, we've got a &#x2013; you can see the mix of our earnings from our half year statements and effective with that shows you're really on a pro forma basis throughout the &#x2013; the impact of future earnings expressed in dollars we would beat &#x2013; the European segment effectively comprises the majority of the non-dollar earnings and you can assess what that is done in relation to the same thing of the dollar.</p>
          <p>Similarly, there is a table and the interim results and indeed a more detailed one of the year and the cash that shows you, the deployment of our capital around the world which shows for our net asset side, so again you can look to what the impact from shareholders funds might be from currency strength and dollar against euros earnings. What is important to note that our practice is not to hedge our dollar &#x2013; our capital and dollar terms but to broadly keep our net assets by currency in sync with our risk rated assets by currency sort of the capital on the risk rated assets move up broadly together or go down together so the capital ratios are broadly immunized from currency movement and that's what we think is most important but you are absolutely right in dollar terms with the stronger dollar of the expression of our European earnings will be lower on the other hand, the expression of our Asian, Latin American and Canadian and American earnings with sterling terms which impacts a lot of our shareholders will be higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Turning to Asia you mentioned global banking market and commercial bank but in fact the downturn in interest income &#x2013; fee income basically came from PFS because obviously stock markets have weakened inconsiderably throughout the period &#x2013; and throughout the year and the period and hence that has had an impact on the type of volumes going through our PFS, and obviously, insurance business had some challenging times in regard to if investment income as well, but overall for global banking and markets, we continue to do well in Asia clearly, and many other banks aren't in the same strong position to us to either underwrite debts or to do trades generally and our business has held up very well, be it the FX rates so whatever you want. What I noticed is negative on Asia for the fourth quarter some of you maybe, I think it's certainly going to slow but the reality is the whole region is well structured with this because in a lot of preparation, the government of Asia have watched for the last year and the likelihood of slowing in Asia they have got strong current accounts and measures they have got good results and as China announced yesterday, intends to use those stimulated economy and hence Hong Kong as a gateway to China is also stimulated by. So, I think you are going to see growth 8, 9% in China maybe 7 in the Rest of Asia, pretty powerful stuff still. Turning to the U.S.A. and the bank in the U.S.A. clearly a number of the write-downs in global banking and markets went through our U.S. &#x2013; U.S.A. bank and obviously, that's where you're seeing &#x2013; those are the ones you were seeing in the announcement we made today. There is also a prime real estate book and which has also got a hillock portion to it that show deterioration in the third quarter as it did in the second quarter and potentially well in the fourth. But again, the bank in the U.S.A. is now focused on being joined up with the rest of the group, particularly looking at international side. So you are seeing a lot of restructuring going there, the head count that was reduced in global banking and markets, they are on the quarter, a significant number of those people are based in New York. So that is &#x2013; it's all working through in the cost ramifications of taking those restructuring actions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Do you mind if I just come back very briefly on that. Firstly, Douglas, I appreciate that you would like us to estimate, but I think there though there is such a wide cone of outcomes from the comments that you have made about profits &#x2013; underlying profits being sort of down, but less than down 25%. So could you help by maybe narrowing that range from 0 to 25 to a narrower range? Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm sorry, I mean you got it absolutely right. We said the third course of stage were less than we were at half year, which is I guess &#x2013; the total is just with the fact that the third quarter is ahead of the third quarter in the prior year. What we tried to do to be helpful is split down their important business performance by customer segment. So, Asia is good across all businesses, Europe is robust in the retail businesses, given quite a lot of information about whether global banking and markets write-downs have come, we have given a lot, we told you that global banking markets in Asia was strong. The French gains are in the segment results, the write-downs sort of the gains on the fair value of our own they are in the segment results though I think that's as much as we can give, we can't give you a sizing shot within the range you &#x2013; but I'm afraid you're going to have to estimate it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. I have got a couple of questions on some of those have already been asked, I'm afraid. Firstly, could I ask about the delinquency trends in HSBC finance and in the branch network and could you just give us some guidance as to what you think the drivers are of further deterioration and that will be and also in the reserve bill that you've made how much reflection have you taken of expectations of future delinquency that's the first area I wanted to explore.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it &#x2013; in terms of safety, I mean what we have done is taken the most current trends that we see and we will relate economic factors in relation to the impairment that we can see, what we can't do and you know we can't do in relation to accounting is &#x2013; is take an estimate of where we think unemployment might be in six, 12 months time and factor that today but what we can do is look at the most current trends and the most current causes of impairment, which continues to be much more now under employment and unemployment as apposed to the purging of what was bad underwriting and the broker business over the last couple of years and really the deterioration we are seeing now is owing very much to unemployment and under employment with a concentration in the phase that the highest has a &#x2013; or market depreciation because that's where the economies have declined more and that that's what's driving it on its continued illiquidity in terms of being able to refinance and it's lower wage packet so loss of jobs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second area I wanted to explore was again this area of guidance. Probably it's like in as far this way, you've commented that Asia, Latin and Europe for the nine months or ahead does that apply to Europe, if you back out beyond that game and in Asia, could you comment on the trends in Hong Kong and another Asia separately please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Hong Kong &#x2013; Asia continues to do well really driven by the global banking and markets business Hong Kong also continues to do well, but the comparison to 3Q '07 but it was not the volumes say in the equity markets that drove a lot of retail broker flows and there are &#x2013; it was not the borrowings in stock market levels that supported and enhanced our insurance business, but those were weaker factors and also going into the third quarter of 2008, our deposit spreads began to get smaller because of decline in U.S. dollar interest rates. So there are some headwinds however, if you compare our Asian business against 2007, I think will turn out to be a very special year, if you look at '05, '06 &#x2013; 2000, where we are in 2008 remains a very, very solid very, very profitable business. What we are not seeing in Hong Kong is any meaningful pick up and but that at this stage, we said that albeit clearly, there are risk to the downside and we are coming of a very, very low level. Europe is difficult to comment, I mean yes, it's got a big junk of the fair value debt and it's got a big junk of the global banking and market write-down. So we commented early on the retail businesses saying that they're fairly robust and the rest I think are implied by &#x2013; by what we say about the global banking and markets being brought as &#x2013; putting these write-downs between Europe and the U.S.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. I have got a really bad line, some half an hour and so apologies for that. And a question if I can on a lot of what I had has been answered. I'm just left with a slightly nerdy one. You retired about 18 billion of debt from household and I just wanted to see if I can follow that, talk a little bit. The 10 billion of sales for the GM portfolio in the U.K. portfolio bank to different parts of group as &#x2013; so that's cash in and then we have a decrease in receivables of about 8.1 billion and that was from repayments, I suppose there are two questions. Is any of the capital that's coming to household in the third quarter the 1.3 billion is that being used to retire debt? And secondly, we have a reduction in assets of 8.1 billion and we have obviously bad debts are close to four, was there any acceleration of asset repayment that led to a reassessment of fair value there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gosh, there are a number of questions. I mean, to be honest, I mean pages six and seven of the HSBC finance 10-Q is the cash flow statements and 18.8 billion net of long-term debt retired repay is effectively the figures are on the cash flow statements and so it's an application of funds that's where the money came from. It came largely from a reduction in the balance sheet both from net repayment fund from &#x2013; yeah, in the sense that charge-off is in the cash flow. So, the revenues that were coming in the loan book generated the cash and you can see cash from operating activities and cash from investment activities. That portion of the money that was used to &#x2013; nothing to do with transfers, we haven't made the transfers into the portfolio yet so there is no cash flows at all and that when you feel the operational activities for the nine months and really the cash flow changes and <mark type="inaudible" /> pretty clearly actually.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. I've just got two sort of follow-up questions. One was actually on net interest margin guidance, I think you were saying that Q3 net interest income was up in line with the first half of the year. I was just wondering in terms of obviously central banks have cut rates quite aggressively, LIBOR is beginning to come down. But, obviously you have a very strong customer deposit franchise but the rates on those are already relatively low so, would there be a negative endowment effect that will lead to some net interest spread pressure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if we take it from the liability side, clearly that is going to be less there but there on the active side there's the pricing path to reprise as well and we are unable to move some of that on already and that will continue but there is no &#x2013; we don't give a projection of what's it's going to be for the fourth quarter, but I mean you can read it through yourself, I mean we are a liability driven business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That have been except for that, I mean the &#x2013; one other factor is that the global &#x2013; global banking and markets business positions for rate with some efforts to the extent that it would have anticipated in rate reductions positioning the book to be over a land would give benefits in net interest margin coming through perspectively. So, there are as you said deposit margin is getting squeezed, this rate is coming down, alike the fact is as asset prices, asset yields, price up is as facilities priced it today's levels and then there is the ongoing managements of our treasury position, our position for interest rate movements and that's a complicated equation. And effects of what happened in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>And my second question is just on &#x2013; just drilling down a bit on the &#x2013; I think Tom had many  questions on RWA guidance. So, I mean other banks have &#x2013; I think obvious in particularly we are talking about increase in risk related assets due to difficulties with some counterparty hedging. This seems to imply that you haven't seen the &#x2013; is that correct and what's your outlook for RWA growth obviously in light of the kind of deteriorating credits conditions that we are looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think on a simple statement to how it our works, I mean, as your question in the current marketplace, the volumes of activities are lower and therefore the rates of growth we have seen in past years won't be experienced. There is also the pro-cyclicality or the risk-sensitivity of Basel II which means that even for the same balance sheet size, you can have a variable amounts of risk weighted assets depending on the probability of default loss given default characteristics of the assets. But of course in some resects we are winding down some of our most capital intensive assets the finance company is taking its balance sheet down quite quickly, we are doing a lot of work to mitigate the impacts of increased risk. And as we said, I mean the risk weighted asset position at the end of the quarter was modestly down. So, there is a lot of drivers to it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering, you had good results in India and China in the third quarter, you've just bought almost all of the Indian broker but maybe the low of the Indian markets, who knows. But the key question here is are you seeing strong opportunities to make attractive purchases in the Asian markets given your stronger balance sheet and some of your potential competitors might have, and part two of that is how does the proposed stimulus program in China affect your opportunities to make new investments there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, firstly pricing of investments in Asia is still on to the levels that we'd like to see them. Our acquisition in Indonesia was a one-off opportunity to buy very strong bank with a large Chinese customer base that we've &#x2013; we are happy to take at the price we paid. But overall I'm not yet convinced pricing is right for the Asian markets to make further acquisitions. I'm sure it will come about in time, but it's not there yet.</p>
          <p>On regard to the stimulus package, frankly it's too early to say. It was only announced yesterday but you wouldn't expect that stimulus package to feed through to middle market customers, international customers, and all the types of customers that make up in the largest international bank in China. So, we will benefit from that and clearly Hong Kong will benefit as well. But lot of the projects that it seems to have been announced yesterday very long-term infrastructure project success of it that will play to our strengths in global banking and markets, et cetera. But other than that I can't really give you a forecast, it's just too early to tell</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone. Very easy question I hope, I just actually, your tolerance on the dividend payout ratio, because I guess we are currently running about 6% up on the dividend for this year, but as you have highlighted profits are down and I suppose if you would take into account the 4 billion plus of fair value gains on our index you take that out being it is not capital accretive, then the underlying picture is slightly worse than that. So on my numbers you end up with something north of 70% on the payout ratio and I just wondered if you could comment on your tolerance there, as I said. And also do you have any particular, anything particular to add, on the take-up of scrip for example, in that context, that'd be helpful, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will take the first part, Douglas may want to add. Maybe obviously we can't give you a forecast where the dividend payout is going to be, I mean we've paid out on the third element obviously &#x2013; and clearly and we will look at the fourth element on our underlying results for the fourth quarter. But as you know, this is a company that is focused on paying a dividend, have a compound growth in dividend for the last 15 years, and we are aware of that. Douglas, do you want add anything on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean I think that we will look at &#x2013; we look at in the run, I mean the other elements obviously is the rate at which risk weighted assets are growing. And as we have said, I mean the capital consumption from balance sheet growth will clearly be north or stronger it has been over the last couple of years from the balance sheet risk weighted assets were growing strongly, subject to the Basel II impacts on &#x2013; on risk sensitivity, but we'll look at it in the range when we get to February or March of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just one thing on the scrip take up, can you remind us what the sort of historical level of scrip take up is and also are you seeing anything changing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's entirely related to the &#x2013; for the price we promise over the period, this year has averaged around 30% for the dividend that we paid. And we model a take-up of around 20%, it tends to be is it rarely goes below eight, and it can be up in the 40s, I think this year's averaged 30.</p>

          <p>A follow-up question from Lee Goodwin. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thanks, thanks very much. Yes, Lee Goodwin, Fox-Pitt, Kelton. Just three quick ones actually, Firstly, there is no mention on the &#x2013; yes, three &#x2013; last three questions. Just on bank accounts, profits and losses to where we know the names of the counterparties that have where the losses have been incurred in the third quarter by other banks and you're not mentioning again here, and I was just wondering we should have a conclude that they haven't been any.</p>
          <p>My second question was on &#x2013; we know deposit margins in Hong Kong are going to be compressed by low interest rates probably for a while, what is the extent to which that is offset by asset liability managements income in GBM? And third question really just on Europe. Mike you made a comment, the interims about the extent to which you're seeing credit withdrawn from some of your clients on the commercial and corporate side. I wondered whether there is any updates on the trends we are seeing, i.e., sort of the credit crunches as it spreads in the company sectors particularly in the U.K.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, left to counterparties failures &#x2013; in other words clearly there has been some counterparties fairly &#x2013; they're not of such a substantial nature that we need to mention, but some of the names we don't know, some of the names that we were aware of. But it is a work in progress in regard to some of these and that we will watch the space.</p>
          <p>On deposit margins, yeah you're right, I mean the Hong Kong, in particular, the margins have gone to essentially nothing in this regard and there has been an inflow of money. Not so much now with the guarantees have come to the banking system generally. And clearly, as Douglas stated earlier on, balance sheet management through Global Banking and Markets does give us opportunities in these situations.</p>
          <p>On your question on Europe, there's no question, banks are pulling back the amount of credit they're granting and this has always been my concern that good companies may be starved of credit not &#x2013; for no reason but banks don't want to lend or can't lend because of the balance sheet side. We are endeavoring to assist as many customers as we can, but we can't be lender of the last resource to the whole corporate world. And I think the corporates have realized that some have already taken tensile steps that have committed lines to them are doing that and obviously we benefit from that to the higher pricing. But other than that, there's nothing really changed in the last 90 days in regards to credit crunch per se, I mean it continues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, that's me again. Just one follow-up question from me. Michael, I think you're quoted on the newswire today that they are saying that you will consider acquisitions in both developing and developed markets. So, I just wondered with your other comments about acquisitions in Asia still looking too expensive on the whole, whether this was sort of indicating any shift in strategy away from emerging markets as being the sort of the sole focus really for acquisitions going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean on the wire, probably to add to what was said in the wire, we were discussing between developed and developing markets. I said, in developing markets, we hadn't seen prices reduced to any great extent yet, and obviously that was of interest to us when they did reduce. In regard to the developed markets, I just think I'm not sure of it and what people have been buying is that cheap. And &#x2013; but I'm not opposed to buying anything, but I'd like to know what I'm buying. I mean these acquisitions were done in Saturdays and Sundays, there didn't seem to be an awful lot due diligence there and we'd rather &#x2013; understand more about the assets over there. And I suspect there will be opportunities. We've never said that we wouldn't look at the developed markets. What we've said is, it's got to have some connectivity with what we are doing in the developing markets and we are watching these spaces in this regard.</p>
