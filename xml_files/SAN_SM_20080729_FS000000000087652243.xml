        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We're going to begin the presentation of the second quarter's results, first semester's results 2008. And we're going to divide the presentation into three parts as usual. First I will speak about the Group's main aspects during this first half 2008, and the second half Mr. Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez will present the figures for each of the business areas. And finally, I will briefly sum up our conclusions for the semester and our outlook of the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>First point I'd like to stress is the fact that in the current economic environment, this cold environment, the economic deceleration, nevertheless the Group has once again demonstrated its ability to obtain earnings with new record profits of 2.5 to &#x20AC;4 billion, a little bit &#x2013; 22% more than the ordinary recurrent profit at the same period last year. And I'd like to underscore the recurrent and the solidity of the Group's profit quarter-after-quarter. In fact, Santander first posted ordinary profits of over 2 billion in a single quarter, the second quarter last year, and we have actually surpassed that number every quarter since. And, in fact, this year this last quarter we've reached 2.5 billion for the first time. As a result, our quarterly EPS, which was at around 32, $0.33, is now on $0.37.9, which is also a record figure and is also on a very solid quarterly trend. I'd like to remind you that in calculating EPS in 2008 we're already including in the denominator the total number of shares in which the Santander shares will be converted over the next five years.</p>
          <p>As a result, we've obtained 4.73 billion in the first half 2008 in profits, just 22% higher than the same period 2007 and 12% higher than the second quarter, the second half 2007. And this number includes some profits on ABN, basically Banco Real, &#x20AC;291 million. Subtracting the financing cost and that of taxes, their contribution is &#x2013; growth was 477, net 291. And since, as you know, there was no definitive separation from Banco Real, these profits were recorded in the quarter in the equity account method, line, in financial management and equity stakes, and do not appear within the operating businesses. Last week we finally had the separation approved and so in the accounts of the third quarter those profits will be incorporated.</p>
          <p>The EPS for the first half was $0.71, which is 14.3% up versus the first half 2007. These growth rates are based on very positive year-on-year comparisons of our business units in Europe. Profits were up versus the first semester of 2007 by 13%; the UK, where profits were up 20% in pounds Sterling. And our businesses in Latin America which grew at 20% in dollars, which is, as you know, the currency we use to manage that area. In fact, growth was 25% if we accounted for it before discontinued operations. Additionally, ABN Amro has contributed a profit of 437 million as I've explained.</p>
          <p>Comparisons are also excellent with respect to the second semester of 2007 since, as you can see in the charts, every area has accelerated its growth. And the question to ask now is how we can keep up these growth rates in the current environment?</p>
          <p>I will focus over the next slides and those at the end of the presentation in explaining how the Santander Group can maintain its upward trend in a difficult banking environment. In fact, the first thing I'd like to point out is that in such a complex environment our Group strengths, our business model, and our ability to quickly adjust our management priorities &#x2013; including prices, spreads, costs, risks, and recoveries and the strength of our balance sheet in this new environment &#x2013; are enabling us to maintain the quality of our results and to remain optimistic but our ability to outperform our competitors and achieve our growth targets.</p>
          <p>The first point I'd like emphasize is price management. Price management has enabled us to improve our spreads, especially for loans, continuously over the last quarter. This management has enabled us to offset the lower increase in business volumes in a general decelerating environment. So in this context, I'd like you to look at the top right hand side chart where you can see that the lower growth in lending is going hand-in-hand with a faster rise in deposits, which in relative terms, are growing faster than lending, when a year ago, they were only growing at half the rate. And this combine management of prices and volumes is being done successfully throughout the Group. And as a result, all our units in Europe and Abbey and the main Latin American countries are growing notably in their net interest income, and therefore clearly improving their return on assets.</p>
          <p>And this growth in our net interest income together with growing fee income means that the Group's most commercial revenues, that is net interest income not including dividends plus fee income plus insurance have been growing continuously each and every one of the last 15 quarters. That is, for almost four years now our revenues have been growing continuously. This performance reflects a very successful behavior of our units and the solidity afforded by our high degree of diversification both geographic and by business areas. Also, as you can see on the screen, it's not only the Group overall which has been growing but also each and every one obviously major geographical units, which have been growing quarter-after-quarter. Second point I'd like to refer, that our main growth engine is our efficiency gains. Our combined management of costs and revenues has given us in the last two years just at around 10 percentage points, and we will continue at the same level for 2008. In this lower growth environment for gross operating income, it is essential to manage costs successfully, and we have an excellent track record in this context. In 2007, our expenses rose by 10.5%, slightly higher than usual for the Group because of on-going business projects launched in previous years, including the opening of new branches in Spain and Latin America. We have begun 2008 increasing our costs by only half as much, 5.7 in the first quarter, and we're still containing cost growth. And they're currently growing on at least 3.4%. I have said many times that we're committed to an ongoing efficiency improvement, and we stay on track in 2008. We've closed the semester with a cost-income ratio of 40.4%, which is 4 points lower than in the first semester of last year, 9 points lower than in 2006.</p>
          <p>We have been for years now amongst the top banks in terms of cost-income ratio improvement. And this year, again, we've not just been one of the best to improve, but also are currently the top bank in terms of cost-income ratio amongst our benchmark, including pretty much all banks except the British.</p>
          <p>This performance at the Group level is the result, as you can see in this slide, a successful "jaws" management and therefore, of the cost-income ratios of all our major business units. You can see that our retail network in Spain, plus Santander net consumer finance, and the UK all have margins of over 8 percentage points, even greater in Latin America. As a result of which we see improvements between 2 and 4% percentage points in cost-income ratios, which I'll remind you, always include amortizations.</p>
          <p>Third point in income statement, is always provisions. In the chart on the left, you can see an increase of 65% versus the first half 2007 in provisions, similar to what we've shown in the first quarter. The inter-annual increase is due to several factors. First, again, a less favorable macroeconomic environment, which has meant rising NPL rates in some markets where we do business. Also the growth in lending which in Latin America was around 20% to the Group's growth strategy, which was meant a change in the business mix in some countries. And to the release of provisions in some units during the first quarter 2007 which have not occurred this year.</p>
          <p>In any case, as you can see in the chart on the right, the Group has the capacity to absorb this increase in provisions. Our net operating income grew by 26%, which has enabled us to increase the result minus provisions by 15%.</p>
          <p>Let us now look at the comparison by business areas between the provisions this first half of the year and last year's first half. In the chart on the right-hand side, you can see generic provisions. In this semester, we have continued to assign generic provisions and to increase the total volume. In specific provisions, there's nothing new. Growth is still located in Europe and Latin America.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we continue with the trend of the previous quarter, perhaps slightly faster growth in Mexico and slightly slower in Brazil. In Europe, the largest rises were in Spain, both in our retail network and also Santander Consumer Finance because of the rise in NPLs in the sector. Finally, we have smaller allocation at Abby with excellent credit quality.</p>
          <p>Just to give you some details about Spain which is probably of most interest to analysts, we can see the impact in the increase in specific provisions is being offset to a large extent because of a lower need for generic provisions. Hence they go against the cycle. If in the future there were to be additional increases in specific provisioning, it will have a very limited or negligible impact on our results since we would start to free up generic provisions. I'd like to remind you in this context that the generic provisions we have in Spain add up to &#x20AC;4.4 billion, or 1.8% of our lending portfolio.</p>
          <p>Fourth chapter is the strength of our balance sheet. Now you began with risk quality. The trend as anticipated over the last quarter is general upward trend for NPLs in almost every market we, where we operate. This makes sense, especially in Spain, where the sector had had several years of continued improvement and NPL ratios were at historic lows. In this context, although we do see this growing NPL in the last quarters, our quality standards are still excellent. Our NPL ratio at the end of June for the Group was 1.34% and coverage was at 119%. In both cases the main components are in the lower part of the chart. As for NPLs, we can see that for all the businesses in Spain, that is Santander Banesto, Consumer Finance and so on, the ratio is at 1.08%. Abbey, since it has a much larger mortgage component, has a much lower ratio of only 0.7%. And Latin America is at 2.16% after an excellent performance in the second quarter; since last March the ratio was at 2.13%. And we can say the same for our coverage levels. Spain and Latin America remain well above 100%. And Abbey's also at a very good level, although not so high because of the lower needs of its portfolio, which is mostly mortgage based. If we excluded secured mortgage loans, the coverage ratio for the rest would be 150%. These high coverage ratios correspond to total provisions in our balance sheet of over 10 billion, of which Generic amount to almost &#x20AC;6.3 billion. And how do our quality ratios compare?</p>
          <p>Basically, actually, as you can see in this slide, beginning at the top left corner we compare excellently with international standards. Specifically the average for European banks drew in our peer group was in March &#x2013; this chart is for March to be the latest figures available &#x2013; 2.7% NPL and 73% in coverage, so double our NPL ratio and almost half our coverage. But also if we compare ourselves by business areas or by geographical areas, that is Spain, UK and Latin America, the results are on our side &#x2013; very clearly since in all of them our NPL ratios are clearly better than those of the markets. Furthermore, our evolution in recent years has been clearly better in Spain, where, especially in the last few quarters, we're doing much better than the banking sector as a whole. Something similar happens also in the UK, and it's only in Latin America that we have lost something of our edge because of our policy of growing strongly in retail products, which have a high risk premium but also, of course, greater returns.</p>
          <p>Second point in our balance sheet strengths is solvency. And of course this is a basic aspect in the current environment of intensive capital searches by international banks hit by the loss of value of their assets. There's nothing new here, either. As usual, we've managed our capital in a most efficient way, considering our shareholders' interests, and we've maintained the core capital ratios at over 6%; using Basel II, 6.32%.</p>
          <p>In June, the Bank of Spain circular on determination and control of minimum equity came into effect and this is why we're providing June's figures using Basel I calculations and also Basel II, the new ones which will be the ones published from now on. As you can see, our core capital improved in the Basel II because of the positive impact of applying our own IRB models approved by the Bank of Spain; in Abbey's case jointly with the FSA.</p>
          <p>Part of this improvement is offset by incorporating operational risk to the model and some limits on generic provisioning. Summarizing, our results have continued to grow basically throughout the whole income statement. This is what we call vertical quality. Gross operating income is up 16%, triple net 4.5% raise [sic] (rate) of expenses or costs. Combined management of costs and revenues have brought about an increase in &#x2013; of 26% in our net operating income, which has enabled us to absorb the growth in provisions and to have net operating income after provisions to rise by 15%. And ordinary attributable profit to rise by over 22%, largely due to taxes, since those corresponding to ABN's revenues are already deducted in the income accounted by the equity method where results are entered net. All of these increases correspond to the Group's management that is without taking into account extraordinary capital gains obtained in the first semester 2007. In 2008, there were no extraordinary capital gains, including the 582 million in capital gains in the first half last year, the rise in attributable profit was still 6%.</p>
          <p>Now to close this part of the presentation, since we don't yet have the data for the first half of the year for most of our peers, we've included a comparison for the first quarter where you can see how we comfortably surpass the average and generated profits in-line with our growth targets.</p>
          <p>And now our CFO Jos&#xE9; Antonio Alvarez will explain in greater detail the different business areas.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As we do every quarter now that our CEO has reviewed the main aspects of the Group's results, I will take a more detailed look at the different business units, starting, as usual, with the main geographical areas and continuing with the different business areas; retail, global wholesale banking and so on. Before I begin, I'd just like to explain where the Group's revenues come from. There's something unusual on this slide because we've included the Banco Real as part of this pie chart showing the breakdown of our attributable profit. This is what we'll do habitually, starting in the third quarter to show the Group's profit breakdown. Currently, 42% of our profits comes from the main European operating areas &#x2013; Santander Banesto, Santander Consumer Finance and Portugal &#x2013; 21% from the UK, 10% Banco Real and 6% basically global banking and markets in Europe, although there's also a few smaller units in there such as Banif.</p>
          <p>Beginning with the four major units, you can see that profits are up 13% and they represent <mark type="inaudible" /> 42% of the Group's total profits. In the UK, in Euros, growing at &#x2013; I'm sorry in Sterling, at 20% and Latin America in dollars at 20% &#x2013; 25% excluding discontinued operations because of the divestment of the pension fund business last year. In general, all areas have shown significant improvements. I'll go into detail about the evolution for global wholesale banking end markets where there's been a drop, but as we will see the trend is actually quite favorable in there as well.</p>
          <p>Focusing now in Continental Europe, you can see first of all the retail units where we have double-digit growth, gross operating income up 12%, net operating income 17% up, attributable profit up 13%. So these retail units in Continental Europe showing excellent results.</p>
          <p>Step down the Santander and Banesto branch networks have shown similar performances. We see very good profit growth for both networks, profits up 15 and 18% respectively. For Santander Consumer Finance business in a definitely more difficult environment, it has shown very good growth in profits, 17%. Costs are still growing although they will decelerate over the coming quarters. They're growing fast because of the expansion projects began in the second half 2007. They will slow down towards the end of the year, towards inflation levels &#x2013; maybe 4, 5%.</p>
          <p>There is a rise in attributable profit in Germany drive and the Nordic countries, offsetting Spain's worst performance in consumer finance business. Portugal's profit &#x2013; well gross operating income fairly flat. This because of the nature global wholesale banking operations last year. Retail banking is growing at double-digit rates and therefore, this trend will gradually become more apparent over the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>As for the other units, we see a significant drop of 51% there, which is a sharp drop in profits for global wholesale banking, but I will speak in more detail about this when we look at the secondary business segments, and when I refer specifically to global wholesale banking and markets as we call it.</p>
          <p>Going into a bit more detail about what's happening, what the different drivers are for income and profits in these different business areas in continental Europe, we see a growth of lending in the Santander branch network slowing down. It's currently at 6%. Same thing for Banesto at 11%, while deposits are accelerating. We see very good business volumes at Santander Consumer Finance and in Portugal with double-digit growth as I mentioned earlier. In Portugal, we see a very positive evolution &#x2013; retail banking. However, and as was pointed out by the CEO at the Group level, in each unit we also see that margins compared to the first semester of 2007 have improved very significantly in every unit and that is the reason to a large extent for improved results considering that in this context volumes have been growing more slowly.</p>
          <p>If we look at our net operating income and our net operating income minus provisions &#x2013; which is the way in which we're going to report results in the future &#x2013; we see that net operating income for Santander Branch Networks growing at 19%, 11% [sic] (13%) in Banesto, net of provisions Santander is 13%, Banesto 14%. Santander Consumer Finance based on growth and income and net operating income and operating income but minus provisions only one digit growth 8%. And for Portugal, there is a drop in spreads. whilst volumes have been growing, costs are well under control, provisioning law and profits remain at the same level as the first quarter but the main effect is from global banking and markets where, as I've said, there were very significant operations in the first semester of 2007.</p>
          <p>Looking at the next area, United Kingdom, or Abbey, we see that they've performed excellently at Abbey; income growing at 11%. Remember that the target was between 5 and 10. So we're over our target. Costs, very well under control, 2%, significantly below inflation. And with that, our net operating income on our attributable profits are both growing at around 20%.</p>
          <p>You can see on both charts on the right that the trend is very solid both in net operating income and in profit generation, all of these figures in pound Sterling. Both in retail banking and in global banking, the trend is very solid and has been maintained over the last quarters.</p>
          <p>And going down to the next step to look at the sources of these profits and these income, we see on the one hand that volume's growing faster than it was a year ago. The volume of mortgages has grown by &#xA3;8.3 million in the first six months of the year, more than last year. The spreads have improved noticeably. The same thing we can say about deposits where volumes have grown by &#xA3;3.9 million as compared to 2.8 last year. And as far as the rate of growth of lending and deposits has accelerated in the past few quarters and this has an impact on the results. A very good performance of the net operating revenue. Also, an improvement of the cost to income ratio. And the level of provisions that remains basically the same. Credit quality is very good. We mentioned the NPL ratio earlier, and we see that the increase in the net operating income is higher before provisions than with provisions because the credit quality is excellent. Therefore excellent performance for Abbey and the trend is continuous improvement quarter-after-quarter because it's taking advantage of its competitive situation as compared to its competitors in the British market.</p>
          <p>If we look at Latin America now, I'm referring now to Latin America in dollars, and before including the Banco Real &#x2013; I'll talk about that later &#x2013; attributable profits grow at 20%, 25% eliminating the impact of discontinued operations. The growth rates are very strong. Gross operating income rose 39% and net operating income grew by almost 50% and attributable profits by almost 20%.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side of the graph, we see that there is very good performance of retail banking in Latin America quarter-after-quarters, giving very good results. And this basically is based on some of the drivers &#x2013; the fact that there is a larger number of our customers, very good management of the spreads and costs that, after the strong investment that were made in the past three years in installed capacity, we will start to see the results of this in the next two years where we'll have better results than in the past three years.</p>
          <p>If we look at the main units now the truth is that there aren't too many differences. Revenue is growing about 40% in all units, at least in the main units &#x2013; Brazil, Mexico and Chile, but also in the other countries. And we see that net operating income is very good in all units. After absorbing the impact of greater provisions and discontinued operations we have a performance of 27% up in Brazil and 15 to 20% in the other units. Also Santander Private Banking is growing by more than 20% in revenue as well as in net operating income and profits.</p>
          <p>If we look at the drivers of these results, we see that growth is quite strong, growth of lending and deposits; in Brazil particularly, where deposits are growing 21%, a significantly more than the market. The lending activities continue also to increase in Mexico and Chile, and also deposits.</p>
          <p>So the net interest revenue improves in most countries, although Mexico is improving its spreads as well as Chile more than the other countries. And in the last 12 months interest rates have been going up, and this has had an impact.</p>
          <p>If we look at the net operating income, as we did earlier for Europe, in Brazil it grew by almost 30% compared to the same quarter last year, and 45% after provisions is growing by more than 30%. Which is also applicable to Mexico and in Chile as are growing at slower rates about 14% which is also very good performance despite the increase in provisions in a context where the risk premium are stable in Brazil and in Chile and have gone up in Mexico because of the deterioration of credit quality and the credit card business that we've seen in the past few quarters. Banco Real, I will talk about that later because all the <mark type="inaudible" /> has not been included here. So, I'll give you figures for Banco Real. Of course, the criteria used for these figures is different. Banco Real became part of the Group last week, after we had the official approvals and the acquisition was completed as I said last week. So, if we look now at the results, we see that the, that their generating a lot of revenue, up 24%, more than 20% in deposits, good credit equality, good levels of coverage and results are growing by 20%. Therefore, we can say that Banco Real is following the trend of the other Latin American units, particularly Brazil, when it comes to result generating capacity.</p>
          <p>And finally the corporate center. We see that there's a difference in the results if we compare year-to-year results. Basically there are three factors that explain this. A positive aspect is the equity method, accounting that we use. The figure should be 450 and then we're also &#x2013; last year we had capital losses because of exchange rate effects. Last year we sold the S&#xE3;o Paulo shares in the second half of the year, &#x20AC;567 million. Therefore the net of these three figures gives us the difference in results that we see in the accounts. The other items have very small variations.</p>
          <p>If we look at the secondary segments now, first of all, we see very good performance of Retail Banking with the increases in net profits before taxes in Europe of 11% and in the UK and Latin America more than 20% in their respective currencies. In Euros, obviously, they're growing at lower paces because of the dollar and the pound Sterling effect.</p>
          <p>Global wholesale banking. Global wholesale banking has had a very good second quarter in a very complicated environment for its business, and it did so backed by the strength of its customer activity. On the right hand side we see that business with customers continues to increase as you can see from last year. So we're still generating very good results. The costs are flat or decreasing because of the adjustment to the new market circumstances, but in any case the worst performance compared to last year is due to the specific transactions that we had in Spain in the first half of 2007 and also in Portugal, which didn't happen again in 2008. We had lots of trading profit that we haven't had this year, and in the first half of 2007 we released generic provisions when we haven't done that this year, this first half. So in year-to-year comparison, the results are very good.</p>
          <p>Now where does is it come from? I think this can be one of the things that can call your attention the most: our increase in customer business. Well geographically, we have two different worlds: Latin America customer revenue grow 34%, and in Europe customer revenue grow &#x2013; fall, sorry, 4%. So, the Latin American market is growing very strongly. In Europe, it's flat or revenue is going down. If we look at it by business, so we see that the credit business or the lending business and investment banking is falling in terms of revenue. And lending because of the situation of the credit market and because a market, we don't see any transactions to sell debt. But transactional banking and equity securities &#x2013; well, transactional banking because of the situation of cash management and improvement of the spreads, and interest rates because of the selling of coverage of interest rate and exchange rate to customers, we have improvements of 30%, 20% and 10%. Therefore by geographies we do see a significant difference between Latin American and Europe and by businesses we have see a fall in the businesses most affected by the market situation and increases where the customer franchise acquires a greater value at this time.</p>
          <p>And finally asset management and insurance. If we start by the right-hand side, revenue is growing globally by 3% at a rate of &#x20AC;1 billion per quarter in these activities. To differentiate, whereas the insurance world is growing strongly as it has been growing in the past few years, revenue growing by 22%, asset management or assets under management are falling &#x2013; this is a global phenomena -where revenue falls 16%. Basically in Spain because in volatile markets with high deposit remuneration deposits in relative terms turn into a product which is competing very well with traditional and mutual fund products. If we look at it in terms of profits before taxes, well &#x2013; were flat. In insurance, the &#x2013; it's higher, the income &#x2013; sorry, the profits before taxes. But they're falling in the other businesses. So they offset each other.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn, give the floor to the CEO who will give us a conclusions and also how we see the future.</p>

          <p>Well to end this presentation, I'm going to give you a summary of the first half of the year. In the current difficult environment for the banking business and in this environment, which is very difficult as I said, Santander has had a very solid second quarter which has led us to improve our results and also to improve or to do better than our peers in the first quarter. I think our results are very strong attributable profit increases by 22% higher than the first half of 2007 and the EPS is growing by 14.3%, in-line with our target for the year. But apart from these being very significant results from the quantitative point of view, this is &#x2013; are also a very high quality, vertical quality, because we still have our "jaws" wide open, about 10 percentage points which allows us to absorb high provisions. And of great &#x2013; a very good horizontal quality because all the networks are improving their profits by two digits in their local currencies. And also the global businesses, with a good second quarter in consumer and consumption in Europe and in the U.S., in other words, in the SCF business and in wholesale activity whose revenues, as we have seen, increased year-on-year despite the difficult environment. And apart from having these very good quality of results, we focused our strengthening that balance sheet at the level of credit quality and also in terms of liquidity, but also in terms of capital. In terms of credit quality, we have maintained better NPL ratios than our peers. At the Group level and in the main areas where we operate, we have increased the generic funds in Spain, which, as we have seen, our fourth time these specific annualized provisions of the first half.</p>
          <p>And we are also improving the quality of new operations. For example, in the Santander there is a branch network. The new mortgages have a loan-to-value which is 8 percentage points less than in the first half of 2007 or Abbey where fewer of, than 1% of the mortgage applications of the last few months have a loan-to-value of more than 90%. We have also increased the level of NPL recoveries in all units. In other words, at the level of credit quality we are doing very consistent work. We still have a comfortable liquidity position due to a lower needs of our business model. In other words because of the fact that we're growing less. And also the Group has demonstrated its high capacity to issue medium and long-term securities, enabling it to capture more than 18,000 <mark type="inaudible" /> in senior debt and mortgage coverage funds in the first half by taking advantage of our high ratings and the liquidity windows offered by the market.</p>
          <p>And lastly, our core capital has remained comfortably above 6%. This means that we have enough levers to keep increasing the Group's earnings, offsetting the downturn in some markets. Our geographic diversification enables us to take advantage of those countries when they are in their best situation. Spread management and control of costs enabling us to maintain wide "jaws". The capacity to link customers. I can tell you that in the first half of 2008, we have linked 700,000 customers and the ratio of linked to active customers is still below 45%. So we still have a lot to do there. We're also making improvements in development to improve the quality of service, such as a corporate contact center which will generate cost savings and improvements. In sales, we're going to serve our customers better. We have programs such as the Plan Mejora 500 and the Target 100 that we're extending to all units. In other words, not only managing spreads and controlling costs but we also have the capacity to link our customers and mix them with a good quality. Plus we have specific advantages in some units. The networks in Spain have generic provisions to leverage our revenue growth and cost control. Consumer business has the critical mass to grow organically and the potential to obtain synergies from the latest acquisitions. Abbey, despite the tough market environment, we will still grow profitably in mortgages while continuing to advance toward our goal of becoming a universal bank. And thus our bid for Alliance &amp; Leicester. Finally, Latin America will continue to grow, backed by solid macroeconomic fundamentals, the increasing degree of "bankorization" and improving capacity to execute projects in the region. And lastly Banco Real will contribute growth and also synergies. So this is why we remain optimistic about our ability to outperform our rivals and to meet growth targets which management has set itself. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

          <p>[Operator Instruction] First of all we're going to take questions from the web and then we'll take questions over the phone. The first question is from Marco Trollano from Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research.  He asks several questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one is where do we see the NPL ratios in Spain? What will happen with these NPL ratios in 2009, 2010? He also mentions the sale of the financial city in <mark type="inaudible" /> since we haven't registered anything on this, what is the update on this? And he also asks for an update on Sovereign?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the question on our vision of NPLs in Spain in the future, I don't usually like to give these forecasts because we tend to get it wrong in these forecasts. The truth is that the NPL ratio is going up in Spain. We have finished this first half of the year with 9.08 and our economic talk for ourselves and we think this year we're going to end this year in Spain with an NPL of less than 1.5. I am sure it won't reach 1.5%, but from the information we see perhaps for the whole banking industry it will be 2% and for say &#x2013; retail banks and savings banks included perhaps a bit more than that. That's for 2008, about 2% in general. And for 2009 or 2010 since we will be meeting in future quarters, then we'll be able to give better opinion when we meet in three or six months time. This is how we see things now. We can only make a forecast for about the next six months. The sale of <mark type="inaudible" /> has not yet been concluded. We hope to be doing this very soon, and this is why, in June 30th, we have not included this because it has not yet been completed, although we hope to complete it in the first few days of August. And regarding Sovereign, there is nothing new to report on. The situation, I think, is well known, and we've been talking about this in our, all our results presentations that we have a contract that prevents us from carrying out any movement until the middle of next year. From that moment on we will have the chance or the opportunity and the capacity to think what we do. So, nothing new to report on Sovereign.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>From the same, I notice that we have two questions about Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What do you think is going to happen with growth there? Where is it is going to come from? And what about the competition in the world of mortgages? And the, a more specific remark on the results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net operating income is flat he says in the first half of the &#x2013; first quarter compared to the second. Well, I'm not going to say much about Brazil because we have a specific appointment with the market with the analysts that is and investors at the end of October. We will have a special meeting with them because I think what is of interest to the market is the plans that the Group has for the integration of Banco Santander and Banco Real. So at the end of October we will meet with analysts and investors where we will give a very specific vision of how we see Brazil. On the macro side we will talk about the Brazilian economy as well as on the micro side, in other words, our own integration plans. And therefore our forecasts or our business ideas or what we results we think we're going to obtain in Brazil in the future. What I can tell you now though is that our vision of Brazil is very optimistic. Brazil is performing very well, it's growing well. In fact we are growing our business well in both banks in the wholesale banking sector as well as in retail banking. Perhaps the mortgage loans, well that's not the best example of growth in Brazil but we can't forget that interest rates are still very high there, about 13% and so obviously interest rates at those levels do not make it easy to develop a mortgage market. But for the other businesses including the consumer consumption or personal loans or credit cards, all of those are performing very well and growing more &#x2013; by more than 20 or twenty-some percent.</p>
          <p>But to be more specific, well, I can only tell you that we will have this special session on Brazil in three months time, and there, of course, we will give you much more information on our plans there and how we see the economy et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>From Javier Bernard of <mark type="inaudible" />, he has several questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one is on Brazil. I think it's already been answered by our CEO when he answered the last question. Then he also has a question on profits in Latin America and <mark type="inaudible" /> are going below the CPI in Spain. I guess you're looking at these in Euros because that's not the case in local currency. But he does make a comment on net profits in continental Europe which is increasing 13%. But the aggregate of profits of the whole unit practically basically does not go up. Perhaps you would like to answer that question? And lastly, if we have anything to say on what has appeared on the press on the selling of the fund and asset management unit? There are several questions from several analysts on this matter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I have nothing more to add about Brazil. Profits in Latin America and the UK are what they are in their currencies. It is possible &#x2013; I don't have the figure with me right now &#x2013; but it is possible that if we transfer that or transferred it into Euros it's lower than in pounds, but I don't think we should insist on the idea that &#x2013; Abbey is having a brilliant year. I would say not extraordinarily good I would say it's a brilliant year for Abbey even more if we compare it to the development of the personal financial services in the British banking industry and the same thing can we said about Latin America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net profits in Continental Europe, it is true that as a whole it falls 3%. But we have to understand how we built our geographical profits, because geographical profit is the addition of the units and of the small pieces that the global units have in that geography. In other words, in Continental Europe we have the profits of Santander as a legal institution, of Banesto, another legal institution, of Santander Consumer, all the businesses of Santander Consumer and our Santander Total unit in Portugal. And then we have the pieces which correspond to businesses in Europe of global banking and markets, global wholesale banking and asset management and insurance. Apart, of course, from other smaller things which I'm not going to mention because they're not very significant. Now, all this pieces, the global banking and markets which comes from the Continental, business in Continental Europe, has fallen a lot. Global banking in markets which as a whole has behaved quite well, as a whole, but our CFO said that where it's fallen the most is in Europe and where it's grown a lot is in Latin America. The net figure gives us a very small fall, but with the disequilibrium between Europe and America what does it mean that the part of global banking and market which is allocated to America is about minus 30 or minus 40% as compared to last year. Which is compatible with the unit doing relatively well globally because it's growing a lot in Latin America and the low peaks that, which is added to the businesses of Continental Europe means that these businesses as a whole, the banks plus these pieces have less growth. And the same thing happens with asset management because of fall of the mutual funds has happened mostly in Spain and therefore the loss of season commissions from this business and asset management affects Spain. And I can say the same thing that I said about global banking and markets. The American pieces are doing well, not so the European part. So this component means that when we include all these figures under the title of Continental Europe eliminate &#x2013; without the UK &#x2013; we see a growth of 13% of businesses as a whole. These are Santander, Banesto, Consumer et cetera, but we have that minus three.</p>
          <p>And asset management in insurance, I think it's all been said and there's nothing else to add. We're exploring this possibility, we're looking at it. There's still nothing specific, nor how we're going to do it, or if we're going to do it as a joint venture or how we're going to do it. So when we have more information we will report on that. But for the time being there's nothing else to mention.</p>
          <p>I'd like to insist on the exchange rate issue in the series that we show you in the web, they might be net of the exchange rate and the counterpart you have in the corporate centre.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Santiago L&#xF3;pez from Credit Suisse has a comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>the reason why the, our reserves have fallen by about 4 billion and assets at risk about 9%, why? The second question &#x2013; again, about coverage, NPLs I think that's already been answered pretty much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's true that the reserves show a drop of approximately &#x20AC;4 million and that has sort of two parts to it. One, which corresponds to the dividend pay-out, the complimentary dividend from May of 1700 or &#x20AC;1800 million, and the rest is basically due to the exchange rate differences derived from the goodwill and the intangibles which offset one another. The goodwill volume drops for intangibles and the volume of reserves drops and that's the two reasons. As for &#x2013; that's for the 4 billion in reserves. And as for the risk in assets, I suppose you are comparing June's risk weighted assets and their Basel II with risk weighted assets in March and the Basel I, basically what Basel II represents is a drop in risk weighted assets or in the consumption for credit risk which in our case is just over 1 percentage points in terms of core capital. And arrived, derived from operational risk and from the dividend which used to be accounted for when it was paid out before. So that's the difference between Basel I and Basel II, and that's why there's a drop in the risk weighted assets &#x2013; it's only that effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonio Ramirez is asking about this and he's asking about latent losses in reserves available for sale which are dropping from 1 to 2 billion. What's the reason &#x2013; he's asking again about the NPL levels and the growth in lending we expect. When do we expect to recoup generics? When do we think that the Bank of Spain will enable us to use internal models for calculating generics? Our IR base, if we have provisioned any substandard lending and if we've been buying assets from customers in trouble, in what amount and what our policies are for the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay I think the thing about the reserves and if you want to add something, Jose Antonio has already been discussed, the NPLs have also been discussed, when will we start to, just to use a fairly common expression, to draw on these generics. We don't really know, but probably not this year, probably starting next year if the NPLs increase, more or less roughly, we &#x2013; it's not very scientific &#x2013; feel that from .5 credit costs you should generally start with the generics, I think that's more or less the not very technical rule, sort of rough guide. And so we're below that level and so we're not yet, in fact you'll be able to notice that in 2008 in the second quarter &#x2013; of course in the first but also in the first &#x2013; we have provisions, generics in Santander Spain. And we haven't done any substandard provisioning because we don't really have any need to do so. We are following the circular from the Bank of Spain to the letter. And finally, we are as Banesto has also pointed out, acquiring assets, real estate assets. Basically with the same philosophy Banesto also expressed to, on the one hand reduce the debt developers, and also to establish more efficient sale processes for these assets. We -- Banesto in fact has bought, I think, for an amount of 300 and some million and we, for just over a billion. Yeah, 1, 1.2 billion together, Banesto and Santander.</p>
          <p>There was a question about whether we had voted any, we had pro-, we had established any provisioning for any substandard and I guess none.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And <mark type="inaudible" /> from Lehman is asking again about the outlook for quality in Spain. We've already discussed that. And he's asking if you think Basel II criteria, where we have quite a constable capital position, do we have any idea of where we might use that capital? And he's specifically asking about Mexico, about the fact that the NPL ratio is up a lot in Mexico and whether credit cards are the main reason? And what our forecasts are for NPL ratios in that country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in Mexico it's true is that the reason for that NPL ratio is basically the increase in NPL ratios from credit cards. We don't think that's going to get worse. In fact we think it's contained and in fact we already have the days out, week-on-week and month-on-month, we see that is contained. So, we think it's reached its peak. And it is credit cards, basically that are behind it</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonio Ramirez is asking why the tax rate in the second quarter is around 19, 18.5%? And could we update the capital gains that we expect from the Santander City and the sale price? And are we planning any early retirements in Spain, employees and costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay we don't expect to do any early retirements. In Spain we don't have an early retirement plan. Before, Jose Antonio was saying that I didn't answer, and he's right about the capital. We are at 6.31, as I showed you in the presentation, which is where we want to be and where we're comfortable and probably where we should be. So there really is no plan to spend the capital or whatever the question was about. We are fine and we are where we want to be. And about this question, he's also asking about capital and the tax rate. I'd rather have you or Pepe answer that. Tax rate, Pepe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, tax rate for the second semester is very similar to that of the first semester for the same reasons. Corporate tax rates have gone down in Germany and Spain and so, it's structural, plus circumstantially, there is a tax credit I think in Mexico if I'm not mistaken. So that's circumstantial as I've said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos Garcia from ING is asking about the Santander City.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the numbers are the same we published. The sales price, the capital gains off the top of my head, I think it was 600 million in capital gains after taxes, sale price, 1.9 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos Garcia from ING is asking about the split, about our, the breakdown for those new NPL in the geographical breakdown of those 2.4 billion, and if the 1.1 billion adjustment in negative valuations are deducted entirely from the core capital and in fact they are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't quite catch that second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. One is whether the, those new NPLs, the geographical breakdown? And the second is whether &#x2013; that negative adjustment, those 2.2 are subtracted from the core capital? In fact, they are. And there's other questions, so there is no issue there. In fact, it's more about the geographic split for the NPL.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More geographically the split for NPLs, the 2.4 billion, approximately 70 or 80% is Spain and the rest, more or less, half Europe, including Abbey, and half Latin America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos <mark type="inaudible" /> from BPI is asking about Chile. The other's been answered already. About Chile, and we see that there's a significant increase in provisions and in about the NPL rate, if we can elaborate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Chile, what we've seen is a growth in provisions but the risk premium is basically stabilized. I think it's &#x2013; last quarter it was 1.8 or 1.81 and now it's 1.85. So it's relatively stable. What we have is an increase in provisions, but it's seasonal effect. There's no worsening NPL in Chile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian <mark type="inaudible" /> from <mark type="inaudible" /> Asset Management is asking about advanced models in Basel II which don't include assets in Latin America and do we have any idea about when they will and what the impact will be on risk weighted assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, off the top of my head, perhaps you know better, but I think with the models that we've had authorized, we already have seventy-some percent of the risk weighted assets already included in these advance models. And what remain are approximately 28%, more or less, which we have understanded models. That's basically Latin America. And we have a timetable for that which ends in 2013 if I'm not mistaken, with &#x2013; there's milestones. In fact, in some countries we start three years from now, '11, '12 and '13. By the end of '13 we'll be done with all of them. But again, with the models we have already, we have over 70% of our risk weighted assets subject to advanced models.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pierre Alexander is asking whether we can give an overview of the drive business in the US? The calculation of, from Santander Valores with a totally diluted shares &#x2013; that's the 7 billion issue divided by 16.7 which is the exchange rate for those convertibles? And asks, can you, again, about the assets we've bought? And another questions about income statement or contributions from UCI and how the business is doing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So two questions really. Well I guess the BPA and the Valores questions been answered already. For drive, drive's doing okay. First quarter I think it was &#x2013; well, it's on target, &#x20AC;23 million earnings; second quarter, &#x20AC;29 million. So it's grown 20% in Europe &#x2013; I'm sorry it's on target. No surprises there.</p>
          <p>As for UCI, tell you the truth, I can't, I don't know &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> I think it's proportional method, so we have 50% in the profits, 10 million &#x2013; profit 10 million, I think it is, or 20 million. So, it's 50%, 10 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> from <mark type="inaudible" /> Bank is asking about Abbey and the LTV and why we've increased our activity so much this quarter, both the activities this quarter in lending and whether there's a lot of contribution from <mark type="inaudible" /> your similar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at Abbey, what we're having is, in the new businesses, a loan-to-value which is very stable because in fact in Abbey and this policy and this market circumstances where Abbey is having an increasingly solid and strong position, we're seeing significant margin growth. And so what Abbey is doing is to toughen, let's say, it's risk criteria so that there will be a virtuous selection; doing away with things which have a more implicit risk, like the self-classifieds they call it. And they also have a very low percentage, I would say ridiculously low, loan-to- value of over 80%, and almost nothing over 90. And that's been a deliberate policy to improve the risk quality. And it can be done and the market is favorable in promoting this kind of situation. And that's what we are doing. That's in terms of risk quality. In terms of volumes, clearly Abbey is having very significant market share growth, sort of as it did when we bought it, 13, 14%. And in, at some particular point, because the British markets had some more difficulties, occasionally we've &#x2013; we had in applications in requests, or how, that's how we would call it &#x2013; it had higher rates, But our normal rate in Abbey is about between 13, 14, between 13 and 15%, which is really the share where we should be, and where we are, and where we want to remain in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there's a question from Hector Martinez from Venture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a bit technical and perhaps we can answer this later, because it's about the freeing-up of provisions in UK and LatAm, though it's not generics in the UK, it's something that's been recovered over a year-and-a-half. And LatAm because there's still a cushion in Mexico, but I think we should discuss this in detail later with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a question from Roberto <mark type="inaudible" /> from ABN about the ROF in Mexico and why it's up? And could we elaborate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically there was a sale of the Alco portfolio in Mexico, the interest rate risk portfolio, I can't remember the capital gains exactly, but there were some and I think that's really the only reason why the ROF is up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Giovanni <mark type="inaudible" /> from Executions got several questions, the majority have been answered already. I think there's maybe two we might still answer. One is that some of the securitizations have been issued are showing worsening asset quality. Could we consider this a leading indicator that securitizations issued in Spain, where in some cases there's been some deterioration, could this be a leading indicator for NPL ratios in Spain? Could we elaborate? And he's also asking about inflation in emerging markets. And can we foresee the impact? Do we feel it's a concern in Brazil and Mexico? Any other countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the best indicator for NPL rates in Spain are the data, what we, the banks and savings banks, have been reporting which have our different rate depending on our mix and our position in the market. But, obviously, that's obviously having an impact on securitization such as you say. But really the best leading indicator is the actual fact which we handle every day, and which we report to the market right now. And the second question was about what? If it's true and that's bringing down growth, economic growth slightly in these countries and it is also causing in some of them interest rate rises. And it's something which we are also contemplating in our growth forecasts. In fact there is a certain slowing down of the banking business and the demand for lending in these countries in the last quarters, probably because of that kind of phenomenon, slightly higher inflation, more restrictive monitory policies. Therefore, rising interest rates and that is to some extent decelerating economic growth and generating lower demand for loans. But all of this within a very strong, solid substrate. It's dropping, maybe from 30 to 25, or from 20 to 18, but it's still high. And we're dealing with it with-- and it's being dealt with  very orthodox and serious monetary policies. And so, we see it &#x2013; I'm not saying it as a positive thing for the banking business, because we are seeing a slight slowing down, but we are seeing overall that it's positive for the economic stability of these countries and their economic policies.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Edmund <mark type="inaudible" /> from <mark type="inaudible" /> securitizations just a comment about the securitizations as a leading indicator In the Group's specific case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mortgage securitizations in our Group, within our mortgage portfolio we have a policy which is that loans below 80% loan-to--value aren't qualified to issues, and so we don't securitize them. Those where long-to-value is over 80%, we have securitized. So the securitizations have a clear bias. They don't represent the average quality of our mortgage portfolio for this reason. And so, to use them as a leading indicator for our mortgage portfolio overall is not appropriate, because our mean loan-to-value is below 50% and the mean loan-to-value of securitized mortgages is over 80%. So in that sense, it cannot be used as a leading indicator for the Group, not for the market. Market, I guess is another story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay <mark type="inaudible" /> from <mark type="inaudible" /> is again asking several questions which have already been partially answered, and the reasons for growth in Mexico credit cards, which we've already explained, talking about the impact of the currency hedging and on our NPL, and accounting in the corporate center, so it's just over 200 million, 220, 230 million? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John Raymond from &#x2013; asking whether we have a minimum NPL rate we want to maintain? Whether we could be below 100%, above it &#x2013; 100%? Do have any criteria for that? Where do we want to stay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are clearly over 100% in coverage. If we were to stack mortgages, and that's done in a lot of markets, and it's sometimes done in Spain too, we would definitely be and always will be, clearly above 100% coverage. We could be at 100% or close to 100% because of the great contribution in our portfolio of the mortgage business. When I say our portfolio I don't mean Spain, I mean the Group. But again, our coverage will always clearly be above, I'm not saying just now, but also in the future; above 100% in the norm mortgage business</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> and other analysts are asking several questions about Alliance and Germany, we've been discussing it in different forum. We don't discuss rumors, ever, but they're asking us our vision for Germany as a market, both from the Consumer Finance business and also for other businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our vision for Germany is based only on our own position at Santander Consumer Finance because we're not in Germany except through Santander Consumer Finance and we're now actually integrating the acquisition from Royal Bank of Scotland and General Electric. But our vision right now, our view is that Germany is doing well in terms of its economy. In fact, our business unit in Germany is growing very well, satisfactorily, close to 20% not just in businesses but also in results. And so, good. Demand for cards is strong and that's probably not &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> because it's recovering from the containment it showed last year because of the effect of VAT, so it's a good thing. And it's also good in deposits, because although we're not, bank <mark type="inaudible" /> in deposits we do have some activity in Germany, bringing in deposits through this unit which is doing very well too. So, it's a very optimistic view. But we don't really know much more about the market than what we know through this unit. In fact, the reason why we've been involved in these Royal Bank of Scotland operations and General Electrical operations, is because we feel that Germany is in our business a good market where we have experience and we have a strong position. And we have critical mass and we have management in place. So we have everything we need in order to grow in this business at above market levels. And that's why we've decided to integrate or purchase these two small units. Small enough at times that they are useful for our business in Germany, which over the next three or four years could even perhaps double its income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. There are several questions about Abbey, <mark type="inaudible" /> from Standard and Poor's and somebody from Citigroup basically they're asking about spreads for the new business and margins and how they've evolved in the first quarter versus &#x2013; in the second quarter versus the first and why the spreads for deposits have dropped? And what our expectations are in that context? And what percentage of the new business is buy-to-let or self-certified? And since there's &#x2013; well and then there's something about in many instances, there's a low price-to-book of banks in the US. market. Whether we might have any interest? And there's another question from Michael <mark type="inaudible" /> of RMNA and whether we might think some kind of acquisition or something in Italy if our strategy in M&amp;As.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, start with Abbey &#x2013; spreads, assets, liabilities, new business. Well, the spreads in Abbey we're clearly having growth of our spreads in assets. In deposits there is a reduction &#x2013; sorry, in lending a slight reduction because of competition in spreads and deposits, like in Spain. But very good margins in investment products, which are a business which is not so obvious in our balance sheet but where we are being very active. So, investment fund, investment products which generally earnings. Overall our spreads in Abbey, and our return on assets in general, has grown very significantly as you can see.</p>
          <p>What's the question again, this next one? I can't remember them all. Oh, the buy-to-let and the self-certified, we've already answered. We're not really doing any buy-to-let -- no, sorry, any self-certified and as far as I can recall in the second &#x2013; in the first quarter I said something about buy-to-let but if I'm not mistaken right now, we have in all of our mortgages, under 2% is buy-to-let. And probably that's maybe less than one right now because we have been reducing, as I've said earlier, authorizations for these kinds of mortgage requests.</p>
          <p>Other question was about mergers and acquisitions, and the American market because now price-to-book are so low. Italy again. Anything about M&amp;As. Well, right now we're very comfortable where we are. Our priority, number one priority now, is to integrate Santander with Real. Our second priority is to integrate the other businesses we still have to integrate: Alliance &amp; Leicester, if that operation works in our favor as we expect, and the businesses we've bought in Germany, mostly and in the UK from General Electric. So we have enough work to do over the next quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About Spain, several analysts again asking about whether we can say something about our Alpha and our Beta. In Spain, if we have included <mark type="inaudible" /> in the provisions? Just those two questions for Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alpha and Beta in Spain is about 1% and 0.3, basically. For <mark type="inaudible" /> yes, it's included. We have included it in the Group figure and therefore it has an immediate <mark type="inaudible" /> in the provisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's question on Basel II if we expect any impact in the second pillar? I understand that the answer is no. And if we can elaborate on the details of contributions that have been used in expected loss, operational risk et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The impact of pillar II we hope there will be almost zero. On the one hand we have the impact of the risks that are not in the capital consumption of the first pillar, which is where we have the credit risk and the operational risk but we also have a positive effects of diversification. So almost zero if not zero. And the calculations, the rates for the calculations, I don't remember. I think the department of relations with investors can answer your question directly because I can't remember any questions or ratios right now that we used in the calculations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Several analysts ask about the net interest revenue in the corporate centre compared to last year's figures, if it has to do with <mark type="inaudible" /> liquidity, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well yes, the only difference is that Anton <mark type="inaudible" /> was closed last semester so there is a difference derived from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a question on Wholesale Banking. I think we can answer this question in our department of relations with investors because it's about the increase in the net interest revenue.</p>
          <p>There's a question on Abbey. I don't know if you'd like to answer this. The increase of revenue is slightly lower and what do you expect in terms of revenues in the next few quarters? I think you already answered. Would you like to give an outlook for revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, fine. For us, the outlook for Abbey is very delicate, because as you know, we are right now restricted in terms of information because of the Alliance &amp; Leicester deal. So we cannot give any guidance on the Group. Just because we're going through this deal, so we're a bit restricted there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a few questions on the contribution of Banco Real in each one of the two half of the year. We can answer this question later on. Then the exposure of Santander to the developers' business, which we already said was 16.8 billion.</p>
          <p>I think &#x2013; oh yes there is a last question perhaps. It's from <mark type="inaudible" />. Do you expect to generate organic &#x2013; capital organically from here to the end of the year without &#x2013; in other words if you're going to generate capital organically from now until the end of the year is the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well excluding possible capital gains, which might come from things that since they are public <mark type="inaudible" /> usually the way we generate organic capital and in this case given the rate of growth of our assets can be of about 30 basis points, approximately. A year, yes a year. Jose Antonio has told me, say it's a year, yes a year. That would be our organic growth, and to that we would have to add, if it occurred, capital gains that we might realize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And we would finish with one last question on dividend policy, which I think you already paid out because it's about a 50% payout. But what about our policy in Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have a vision on Asia, well we have an interest in Asia, but for the time being what we're doing is to work on a first business client there, which is trade finance. We are concentrating on that. So we have our office in Hong Kong which acts as a hub to get as much business as possible from Europe, but also from Latin America and Brazil, Chile, Mexico basically. And ever since we did this, which was last year, in one year the volume of trade finance that we are processing or that we're acting as intermediaries in, in this hub in Hong Kong has multiplied by three in less than 12 month. That means it's working. That's our first priority there. Then our second priority, which is something we're already working on, is working with large corporations where we have global, that we a have global relationship with. These are large corporations that might be international &#x2013; not in all cases, but many of them are international. For example there're some Indian companies, some Korean companies, some Chinese companies. That is the second priority for us there, and for that we are opening corporate offices. In some cases, these are operational branches where &#x2013; like a branch office, and in other cases we have representation offices and their intention is to supply market intelligence so that later on they can turn into operations offices of corporate banking or global banking and markets. And that's basically our vision for the time being for Asia. For the time being, we don't have any interest in making any other types of investments there or investing in other businesses there. And but what we already have there, we have a lot of work to do in the next two years: develop the trade finance business and exploit that business environment to implement where we want and how we want our offices to deal with large corporations.</p>
