          <p>Good day and welcome to the Q2 2011 Result Presentation Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Rodney Alfv&#xE9;n. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good day, everybody. This is Rodney Alfven from Nordea. Welcome to the telephone conference where we will present our second quarter 2011 numbers. With me today, we have also Jan Larsson, our Senior Officer and also Fredrik Rystedt, Group CFO. And later on we will also be joined by our Group CEO, Mr. Christian Clausen.</p>
          <p>Now, I will hand over to you, Fredrik Rystedt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rodney. I will take you through the results, a little bit about the business development in the quarter and also some details on our plans looking ahead. And if I start with the Slide 3 on the key messages, to summarize a bit, we are proud to say that we have a maintained solid business momentum in our business and very good revenue growth in the customer area. However, partly due to volatile times and other things, trading results are down from last quarter's very high levels. However, having said that, loan losses are at their lowest levels since 2008.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead from here on and also into the following years as we also elaborated on in the first quarter presentation, our ambition is to be one of those in the top league of the European Banks in terms of return on equity. We estimate that league, in the top league to be in the approximate range of &#x2013; or an approximate level of 15%.</p>
          <p>The way primarily to reach this target over time is to focus more on cost efficiency and specifically we are implementing plans to contain cost growth also towards the latter part of this year and, thereafter in 2012 and onwards, keep cost largely unchanged for a long period of time. The other primary metric is to reach to that level in the capital efficiency side, ensuring moderate risk-weighted asset increases despite continued growth.</p>
          <p>So, I'll come back to these issues and let me start little bit with the results. As I said, we had in comparison to last year's year-to-date figure, we increased income with approximately 8% and as you can see it declined somewhat with 7% in the first quarter, the main reason being net items at fair value. Profit before loan losses &#x20AC;1.067 billion, up from 9% from year and minus 14% from first quarter. Operating profit at 30% up versus last year and minus 5% versus the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, the income is stable after a very strong quarter one income level and we had a good continued strong growth in the customer areas up by just under 5%. The main reason for the decline, as I said, was lower trading results from the very, very high level we had in Q1 and also a lower net interest income in Group Treasury and this is primarily due to increased and prolonged funding, and I'll come back to that.</p>
          <p>The growth in customer areas 5% and 10% compared to Q2 and, of course, the reason primarily for the non-customer area result is volatility in the financial market that has lowered the trading result.</p>
          <p>If I go to the different lines starting with net interest income on Slide 7, we as expected continue to see a good development and income increase from the profit margins. We also have a good lending growth in the quarter. Household lending is up by 7% annualized and actually on a quarterly basis, the same is for &#x2013; the same level approximately also for the corporate sector.</p>
          <p>Net interest income is affected by lower levels in interest rate and there are primarily three things that have contributed to it. The first part is we have prolonged the long-term funding of the group. So, we have done approximately &#x20AC;22 billion of funding in the first half year and redemption for the full year is approximately &#x20AC;18 billion, so we have refunded quite significantly in first and second quarter.</p>
          <p>We have done also a prolongation of the funding maturity in the shorthand of our funding book. In addition, we have reduced the interest rate risk in our funding operation and we have gone through more or less neutral position now, not exposed to interest rate increases and, of course, we've done that in anticipation of higher interest rate.</p>
          <p>And the third component is reduced return on liquidity buffer, not in terms of absolute yield. It's more into funding of the liquidity buffer, so the net result of the liquidity buffer is lower. Those are the three main components and, of course, they have been done in anticipation of higher interest rates, also in anticipation of market volatility and as a consequence, higher spreads on funding. So, those decisions have been costly, but served us well. And you can see the impact from them on Slide 8.</p>
          <p>So, if I go on the details of the net interest income, you can see that we have a good development from volume primarily from the corporate end and we also have a good development from the deposit margins, &#x20AC;30 million in total. And then we have a corresponding negative impact from the Group Treasury operations that you can see a little bit further down.</p>
          <p>On Slide 9, you can see the interest rate sensitivity, which is largely similar to what it was and that may be a contradictory message to what I just communicated before, having reduced now interest rate sensitivity in Treasury. But the reason for this being unchanged is that the Treasury interest rate risk is largely within the given timeframe of one year, which we measure the interest rate sensitivity on. So, we have a positive or a reduction of the interest rate sensitivity in the short-end and consequently an increase in the long-end. So, it equals out to zero, but of course, we are much less exposed to the shorter-end of the curve than what we have been before.</p>
          <p>By turning to net fees and commissions, we reached the highest level of these commissions that we've ever had, an increase of 3% and savings commissions remain on a high level with also a good trend in impairment commissions. Assets under management continue to experience an inflow in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Fair value result was affected by market turmoil. The market was, during the quarter, typically characterized by high volatility but non-directional and it's clear that that affected the interbank operation in the bank. But we continue to see a good stable trend in the customer areas.</p>
          <p>Going to expenses, you can see that it was largely in line with the level in Q1. Staff cost decreased somewhat and other expenses increased correspondingly, and the reason for the latter was mainly due to higher IT expenses as we had planned.</p>
          <p>Net loan losses on low level, significantly lower than previous quarter, 12 basis points, excluding the impact on the guarantee, Danish deposit guarantee that we are participating in. The main difference, you will say, perhaps to last quarter is an improvement in Denmark.</p>
          <p>Typically, we also see very low losses in all other Nordic markets and continue to see also as we did in the first quarter of the European market. The only area having a higher loan loss level than the previous quarter is shipping and this is due to a very limited handful of exposures that also previously were in travel, so to speak, sp there are no signs of new problem areas in shipping.</p>
          <p>Impaired loans are down as you can see on Slide 15, impaired loans ratio is now 136 so it's slightly down and the impaired loss loans were down by 4%. And it's important to remember that 59% of our impaired loans are now performing so that's an increase. Provisioning ratio is slightly down, positive at a high 50%.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, total lending is up by 10% versus last year, approximately in local currency without the currency impact approximately 2% for the corporate side in about the same for household side. So, there is a clear increase in this quarter from larger corporate which has been very slow for several quarters in the past. Now, if that is a trend or not, well, I think it's too early to say but it is clearly present in the second quarter. Generally, we have improved credit quality. We have 72% now of the exposures in high rating levels of core minors or higher and we continued to see a good improvement in rating migrations.</p>
          <p>You can look at our capital position on Slide 18. We have reduced risk-weighted assets and this is partly a consequence of the migration but also an optimization of risk-weighted assets. As a consequence, we have improved the Core Tier 1 ratios and, of course, the large impact there is strong profit generation as you can see on the next Slide 19.</p>
          <p>Clearly, as part of the new normal plan, we had communicated that we will work extensively with risk-weighted assets optimization and what we mean by that is several things, First of all, ensuring that each customer has an appropriate lower core and a minimization, so to speak, of the assets, risk-weighted assets that we consume for every customer. But there are also other components including better collateral sourcing, model optimizations et cetera. And we have achieved in this quarter, as you can see there, risk-weighted efficiency gains of approximately &#x20AC;2 billion as you can see on the top left graph on slide 19. So, we're quite pleased to see that and of course that also has had an impact on the Core Tier 1 ratio, approximately 12 basis points.</p>
          <p>So, all-in-all we have improved our Core Tier 1 from 10.7% to 11%, the main factor, of course, being income from on that profit generation, but risk-weighted assets efficiency has clearly contributed as also credit quality. We are continuing, as I said, to generate strong capital. We have increased equity continuously since 2006 with 9.1%. We have high profitability in our capital position and, of course, this is very much a key to maintain the flexibility of either increasing capital should we wish to do that or grow for other purposes.</p>
          <p>I've talked about net migration, but you can see on Slide 21 that we have significantly more up rating now than we have down ratings. And as a consequence, we also have improved risk weight. So, with those words, I will turn over a little bit to the development per customer area and you can see on Slide 23 that we have continued to do quite well on the corporate segment. It's up by 6% versus the first quarter and 8% versus the second quarter of 2010. This is largely in the quarter driven by improved relationships in the CMB segment, and this is, as we elaborated on quite a lot in first quarter, the driver ancillary income. So, also from a profitability standpoint, this is a good development.</p>
          <p>On the household side, it is up by 2.5%. We continue to generate more customers or to attract more customers to the group, 41,000 in the second quarter. We see generally a good business development &#x2013; business momentum for the household customers in Nordea. But having said that, we're also seeing a little bit more moderate growth on household lending on, of course, not only on the mortgage side but generally. So, household customers tend to be a little bit more cautious now than they were particularly during 2010. The primary driver of the household income improvement is, of course, the deposit margins as interest rates are coming out.</p>
          <p>One particular thing that we wish to highlight and we're quite pleased about the development is, of course, all the new applications we have for both smartphones and iPads and other tablets, which are becoming an increasingly important way for us to do business. We have at the current moment 6.4 million e-banking customers. We have 250,000 mobile banking customers for applications that actually has been launched fairly recently. And just in a month or so, we have grown our presence on Facebook and, of course, this enables us to do banking in somewhat of different way. We get better feedback. We access immediately customers and are able to have a very open and good dialog and, of course, also learn quite a lot from the industry. So, this is becoming increasingly important for us and the start of our ventures into this part has been very promising.</p>
          <p>I'll end this presentation with a few comments on the adaptation to the new normal as we go forward. And on Slide 27, you can now see that the revised and changed organization that we announced earlier has now been put into force. And as of Q3 2011, we will also financially report within that structure. To remind you, we have three business areas: Retail Banking, Wholesale Banking, Wealth Management. And of course these three business areas will contain the full scope of the value chain and the objective of implementing these organizations is, of course, to improve efficiency, increase the ROE, deepen the customer relationships, and being able to set very strict and rigid targets for each of these segments.</p>
          <p>Our ambition is of course to be, as I said initially, to be in the top league of performers in terms of ROE and our estimate is that European banks within the top league generate returns of approximately 15%. The way we intend to go about reaching levels of that nature is, of course, through cost efficiency and capital efficiency along, of course, with some income growth. The cost growth, as you can see on 29, will be reduced until end of 2011. So, we will focus on reducing cost growth in the latter part of this year, hence from there on 2012, we will try to keep the cost largely unchanged for a prolonged period of time.</p>
          <p>In terms of asset efficiency, you can see on Slide 30 that we have been generating a good improvement in asset efficiency over the last year or so. This is coming both from efficiency measures and of course all through to some extent on credit quality &#x2013; from improved credit quality. And these efforts will continue as we go forward and we will be more elaborate on the road map going forward.</p>
          <p>It's important to point out that we have been working with productivity and efficiency ratios both on the cost and on the capital side for some time. So, we will continue these efforts and strengthen them, and you see some examples what we have achieved in the last couple of years on Slide 31. These are just one or few examples out of many things in many areas where we have achieved improved efficiency.</p>
          <p>In summary the top league risk adjustment profit, we are tracking the line of reaching the full target of doubling risk adjusted profit in 2013. We still believe that ambition is within range. The reason why we are below the solid line that you see at the left part, the left side of Slide 32 is, of course, the low interest rate environment that we're still risk there and working in. And as interest rates over time normalize, we believe we will be able to reach that target. Total shareholder return, also there we are within the top quartile in line with our financial target.</p>
          <p>So, to sum up, we have a solid business momentum in the business. We have a good revenue of approximately 5% in the customer area. Trading result is down from the last quarter's high level and, of course, we also have higher interest cost in Treasury. Loan losses, are however, at the lowest level since 2008, and we have continued to strengthen our capital position since the last quarter. We believe we are standing on a solid platform for implementing the new model plan, the ambition, to repeat, is to be one of the top &#x2013; one of the participating banks in the top European league of ROE performers and approximately 15% is where we believe that we need to be. Cost efficiency, implement plans to contain cost growth, and of course, as I have mentioned, keep costs largely unchanged for a prolonged period of time and continue and increase our efforts on capital efficiencies.</p>
          <p>And with those words, we are open to questions and we have also been joined now by our CEO, Christian Clausen.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question from Nick Davey of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you very much for taking the time on the call. I'VE got two questions if I may. The first is related to currency on the balance sheet in your Slide 126 of your fact book, you split up very helpfully dollar assets and dollar liabilities. It's obviously been a hot topic really domestically about match funding or the banking system's dollar positions. Could you just talk us through a little bit about how you see your own balance sheet position?</p>
          <p>I mean, I noticed &#x20AC;24 billion of loans to the public. Could you give us a sense of the vague maturity of that loan book because it looks to me like it's funded relatively short-term? The second question, please, is on Swedish margins. It looks like in the quarter you've seen some lending margin expansion alongside some deposit margin expansion. So, could you please elaborate a little bit about the margin progression you're seeing in Sweden? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me try and perhaps answer your first question, Nick. There has been a debate in Sweden relating to the currency exposures and that debate has been so far, you can say, fairly basic in its nature because, of course, we use the dollar funding market for primarily the short-term funding where we swap it into the currency we actually need. We also do that, for instance, the covered bond issues and we've done a couple of them or several of them throughout this year and also before.</p>
          <p>So, we are accessing the dollar market both in the short and the long-term end. That is not a problem from a risk exposure side. This is just a way of accessing funding markets and swapping them into the currencies we actually need. I think the debate is much more, or the concern is much more actual lending, direct lending on a dollar basis for corporate customers. And there again, we believe that we have a very, very solid position. We think that the exposure is actually limited and the problem is not of the nature that has been portrayed so far in the national debate.</p>
          <p>Your question relating to maturity, I wasn't actually sure of it, but the way we measure maturity is behaviorally on the asset side and equally also on the liability side. And when I say behavior on the liability side, of course, that relates to an estimation of the maturity of deposits without maturities, so basically transaction accounts or savings account, et cetera. And there we have a maintained asset maturity of approximately 2.7 years in average and about 2.3 on the liability side. So, we are pretty closed on the behavioral sense to be match funded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and if I could get some color around the Swedish margins, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Swedish margins, yes, the question I guess, Nick, is that why it has increased? We have, first of all, generally speaking we believe firmly that interest rates should actually go up on all markets reflecting the higher funding cost that most banks have and, of course, as you know, we have, in comparison to pretty much everyone else, very good funding terms. So, I think it's fair to say that margins should go up and, of course, we have strived to do that on both the mortgage and the corporate side.</p>
          <p>We have been doing that on the household side during the quarter and that's an effort to, of course, do that and so it should improve. It doesn't mean that it will continue to do so. We would like that to happen. Of course, that's a market-related issue. On the deposit side, competition is of course fierce for the deposit that goes for all market as you've seen from the report. But I think in all fairness, it's fair to say that the deposit income impact from a higher interest rate is in fact coming through in line with our estimations on interest rate sensitivity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Dave John (sic) [Dave Johnston] of Macquarie, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much for your disclosure on the risk-weighted asset mitigation measures. Could I just ask you in terms of, very broadly speaking, what's the &#x2013; in terms of further efficiency measures, what's the size of the opportunity do you think in terms of risk-weighted asset reduction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we haven't quantified the exact extent and, of course, it's always difficult to measure. But there are many different sources of this. First of all, as I alluded to before, we have these more regulatory model issues and they're the primarily &#x2013; the primary source of the efficiency is likely to come from the application we have for advanced IRB in the corporate portfolio. Of course, that some time in the future, we expect an approval some time during the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>And of course, there are also other model changes, for instance, in the counterparty risk in the market area, et cetera, but that's of course one source. The other source is more related to housekeeping registration of the collateral ensuring that credit commitments that are no longer valid or in force or actually taken off the books that may &#x2013; that's also another source. And the third thing, of course, in that area is to basically source collateral where possible.</p>
          <p>We have, you can say, throughout this quarter achieved benefits to the tune of approximately &#x20AC;2 billion as I talked about in all of those areas. And we did the same in the first quarter in last year, the total efficiency gain from all these three were approximately about &#x20AC;5 billion. So, we have opportunities and we continue to have opportunities going forward.</p>
          <p>I think, however, it's fair to say that the biggest opportunity we believe we have is also walking through the entire portfolio of customers ensuring that we have an attractive or good low core and that we utilize capital for all customers that is beneficial to the customer and to the bank and ensuring that we have a good balance or usage of capital.</p>
          <p>That may, of course, entail several different things. It may entail pricing movements for individual customers. It may, of course, also entail more ancillary business, and particularly the latter we are focusing quite heavily on, as you saw both in the first quarter and second quarter. So, there are many sources of capital efficiency and, of course, we will continue to work with this in the next several years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Matti Ahokas of Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Matti Ahokas, Handlesbanken here. A couple of questions if I may. Firstly regarding the risk-weighted asset management, as pointed out you've been really successful in bringing down the risk-weighted assets. Do you believe that there's actually a risk that, since you and most of the other banks are doing the same, that the lending margins would actually be under pressure because the capital requirement is falling and so the risk adjusted margins are actually up quite a lot?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding the cost side, your new cost initiatives. You're clearly more stringent on costs. Is this a reflection in any way of a lower revenue outlook or is it just better housekeeping? And the third one is a small detail question. Did you make any collective provisions on the shipping portfolio or were all of these individual in the second quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Matti, your third question perhaps first, we had no additional collective provisioning for the shipping sector in the quarter. If I may start with the lending margins and the risk of those decreasing because risk-weighted assets efficiency is improving, I doubt that's a fact &#x2013; of course, there's always risk so you can never exclude it, but I doubt that's a fact that that's not likely because I think we are striving clearly to achieve a higher risk or a higher return on equity and so are other banks.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's not necessarily a very likely thing that the banks would give away, so to speak, the benefit created by capital efficiency when all banks at the same time also need to improve the return on equity. And of course you need also to be reminded of the fact that funding costs has gone up quite dramatically, so if anything, profitability on lending on both corporate and household side is generally too low. So, I don't think one should be so concerned about that risk weighted assets bringing lower margins. Of course, as I said, it cannot be excluded. Yes, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, yes. How do you then see the kind of intense competition on the margin side in the region? Is it just irrational behavior and will this change going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think there's many reasons and it depends a little bit on the segment of the market. I think particularly in the very high end there or very large corporate, we see deals sometimes being made at rates that are not simply profitable. And there, again to remind you, we have very, very effective funding rates in comparison to competition.</p>
          <p>So, I think that's done for other reasons and one potential explanation is, of course, that lending is bringing also potentially over time at least ancillary business and improved profitability. But it's not necessarily irrational behavior. I think that also goes for the mortgage side. There could be other factors such as scale, et cetera, that would trigger aggressiveness on that.</p>
          <p>But as I said the trend for quite some time has been on higher funding costs and generally higher capital levels as you've seen from many banks. So, risk-weighted assets efficiency has not in any sort of ways compensated or will not compensate fully for the increased capital in the banking sector, not in any of the country. So, there are so many other cost increases coming, of course, that have been coming in from the new normal that risk-weighted assets, of course, is a mitigating factor but not suggesting lower margins. Again, it's more of a speculative argument that we will have to see.</p>
          <p>The cost side, whether it's a revenue issue that we are focusing on costs to mitigate a weaker outlook for revenues, that's not the case. We are not &#x2013; we haven't anticipated lower income in the future and compensated through cost. The cost efficiency should be seen as a way of, of course, reaching the return on equity side. And, of course, that will have some implications for our ability to grow, needless to say, but largely we believe that the growth prospects are good in the future. And of course, part of that growth is likely to come from our interest rate sensitivity and higher interest rates.</p>
          <p>But we have also put a lot of initiatives in place in the last two or three years or four years that is continuously generating good revenues and we'll do that also going forward. The estimation we have for income as we go forward is not anything dramatic. We are not seeing dramatic growth levels in terms of lending or other factors such as GDP. We have moderate increases estimated as we go forward and we haven't changed those estimates largely.</p>

          <p>We will take our next question from Jan Wolter, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Jan Wolter, Deutsche Bank. Just a quick couple of follow-up questions from the press conference this morning. First, just a clarification there on the trading which fell obviously during the quarter, in your opinion what was the main driver behind the low &#x20AC;58 million number booked in trading other? Because you previously &#x2013; you've alluded to widening credit spreads et cetera when that number has been at this low level. And secondly, again a clarification there, your aim for approximately unchanged costs, again is that the same as saying, keeping nominal costs unchanged or should cost follow largely inflation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the trading income, if I start with that end, I think we elaborated, Jan, both on the press conference and the analyst meeting thereafter, that we've had during the quarter a non-directional high volatility market and typically in our hedging of the customer flows that we have. Of course, we are exposed to the market conditions. So, this is not a spread issue in the market. This is much more the general sentiment. And of course, you have seen exactly this happening a few times before and when markets are very, very good, of course, you see very high results.</p>
          <p>So, for the unallocated market result, there is always an element of volatility. I think the other part, of course, is Treasury that had an extremely high quarter in the first quarter and, of course, a more normalized or low end of the normalized spectrum, if you like, in this quarter and, of course, the reason is largely similar to what we have in the unallocated markets. So, we will see, of course, for high volatile non-directional market, you will see the kind of shift that is expected. And Q1 was exceptionally strong and Q2 was at the weaker end of the spectrum. And your second question, yes, flat cost is what we have communicated, Jan, not taking into account the inflation, so flat cost means flat cost.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Okay. Very clear. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Riccardo Rovere of Mediobanca. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to everybody. I have a question on the funding side. I see that debt security is an issue, had gone up additionally, is almost &#x20AC;21 billion versus the last year, in June last year. So, I'm just wondering why such rapid growth and is this going to continue over the next few quarters and has this anything to do with the net stable funding ratio?</p>
          <p>The second question I have is on the risk-weighted assets. Has there been any migration from the standardized to IRB in the corporate book, currently subject to the standardized? And the fourth question I have is more of a general one. Do you think that your Core Tier 1 ratio will have to be more or less aligned to the one of SIFI institutions, regardless you not going to be classified as global SIFI to be competitive with them on the wholesale funded market given your reliance on wholesale funding? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The debt, if I start with the issue, the debt has increased quite a lot. We had an issuance volume of over &#x20AC;30 billion in last year and, as I previously alluded to, we had &#x20AC;23.3 billion in the first half of this year. So, we've done a lot of long-term funding and, of course, that is the nature of new normal requiring more long-term funding cost.</p>
          <p>Now, I think part of that increase has been impacted by a high level of short-term issuance also in the second quarter that short-term issuance is more of a technical reason. Of course, our balance sheet will fluctuate depending on settlement dates for payments, et cetera and we have a fairly high level at the end of the &#x2013; on the second quarter. But of course, we have been driving more funding or long-term funding in particular into our balance sheet and the reason is both, of course, growth which we've had quite a big share of as you've seen the lending has increased by 10% from last year, and the other part is, of course, more long-term funding generating increased stability.</p>
          <p>Now the second question was risk-weighted assets. Yes, it has been impacted by IRB changes to a very minor detail. And you would remember that we purchased the bank or acquired the bank Fionia last year and that is, as required by the FSA, was entered into the books of Nordea in a standardized approach. And during the quarter we've had an approval for that part of the portfolio into the normal IRB, foundation IRB that we have for the rest of the corporate book. And then it has had an impact on the risk-weighted assets in the quarter of approximately &#x20AC;620 million, I think, impact.</p>
          <p>The Core Tier 1 ratio, I think this is somewhat premature because I think the communication so far by the Swedish FSA of course which is the head supervisor for us has been that they tend to consider all Swedish banks as SIFI in some sort of respect, but what this actually entails for us in terms of required Core Tier 1 ratios as we go forward, is a little premature to speculate on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's actually &#x2013; it has not been safe in others and the fact that they believe that Swedish banks should be running with a Core Tier 1 ratio of between 10% to 12%. Now, of course you've seen our Core Tier 1 ratio of 11% which happens to be in the middle of that range. But it's premature to actually speculate on whether we're in fact in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> or not in the Swedish community, but I think it's likely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just maybe one little follow-up again on the standardized as to the IRB, the corporate loan book that today is still under standardized, is it reasonable to assume that the once it migrate progressively on to the IRB models will have more or less that same risk-weighted we currently see on the corporate book under IRB today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we &#x2013; and I mentioned it briefly before, we are a foundation IRB for the corporate book. Of course, one impact is becoming advanced as we are planning to be in 2012. The impact of that is of course still uncertain, but it should be a good development in terms of capital for us. Then the other areas that are non-IRB is that the main part you can say is the NEM countries, so Poland, in particular Russia and the Baltic countries, our international branches and we also have the finance company, finance companies, I should say, also understands us. So, it depends. The risk rate will depend a little bit depending on the jurisdiction, but typically I would expect that the risk rate without actually knowing that would be somewhat higher...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...in the Baltic area and in NEM than it would be on the corporate area should we be IRB. Of course, we expect to be IRB at some stage for the NEM countries. we've made such an application and we'll simply have to see.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Three questions, if I may. The staff cost is down quarter-on-quarter, and we have for certain periods seen a trend down in FTEs in Nordic banking area. So, could you please just tell us kind of what we have done in the trend, how we can see this going forward? Also on the cost side, the IT cost was coming up in this quarter like you had previously mentioned and could you also please add some color going forward into 2012 here?</p>
          <p>And thirdly on corporate deposit margins, they're up but not in Norway. And as you say there is fair competition, forcing the profit volumes and you're part of that competitive landscape and we see examples of prices well above senior debt funding and where you have the cheapest, of course, from the Nordic banks. So, could you please say some more how you consider the need for taking the large stakes of deposits currently at those prices which we see in Norway obviously? Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can answer these questions. Maybe the staff costs, yes, but we have taken down FTEs in a number of areas over the last four years but we have also invested in new areas. So, taking out FTEs will very much continue along the lines we've had but we will double our increase at the same speed in other areas. Now the FTEs, the staff will come out very much in the distribution. I spent some time on that today because our future distribution model was advisory branches, service branches supported by the insurance channels, is becoming much more efficient and requires the staff.</p>
          <p>So, that in particular will mean that we can continue this staff takeout there and maybe even accelerate it. And then the other major areas, in the back office area, administration area where we have very good experience of moving administrative process to our offshores and in Poland, which is very efficient with a low cost and good availability of labor. There we can move more processes to and we have a pipeline of quite a few. So, we think that will be a major thing as well and then a number of other areas.</p>
          <p>And then at the same time, we've been enlarging this because we don't think we need to add more advisory capacity. We have done that in previous year in the global area, in private banking and also some parts of the corporate area. We think we are more or less there and we think efficiency, also by the decline channel means that is not necessary. We will also not grow to the same extent in Poland and so on. So, net we will reduce FTEs in this period of time to some extent.</p>
          <p>IT is up in Q2. It was seasonally bit down in Q1. The trend in IT is also that we are holding back and we're cutting off some of our development projects but also continuing others. So, IT is an area which will not maybe contributing to a reduction but more stable. And corporate deposit margins, no we do generally not participate in the competition for our price deposits which are very &#x2013; which is unstable by nature and the fact is, as you correctly point out, that we have lower costs of funding and international sources that we need to do in the corporate deposit market, for that matter the savings deposit market. So, we tend to stay very disciplined on the pricing there.</p>
          <p>However, we also have to serve our customers. So, there is sort of a trade-off as we're giving up the deposit base to customers and the pricing. But we are certainly not price leaders and we also have no target or no fixes of increasing our deposit shares in those areas. But we do want to have stable deposits and that we are very successful in getting but there we need to get stable deposits. That's why attracting the customer relationship and this transaction counts, but you cannot price yourself there because there's no price on it, in customer relationship and also services like cash management which attract these kinds of deposits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good. If I may follow up there. The definition by stable-unstable deposits, do you see them related to the NSFR ratio or is it internal definitions here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was both but it's very simple. It's the fact that if you give a quote for a one-month deposit, it will lead one month from now, if you do not give the quote again which is better. So, it's stable and the very simple thing is that it will move away if you are not &#x2013; if you don't price it up. That type of deposits, we don't like and we don't need it for funding reasons, but we surely do need to keep the customer relationship intact. So, we need to be competitive every now and then.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We will take the next question from Jacob Kruse of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jacob from Autonomous. Just a couple of questions, first on Denmark, could you just talk a bit about what you're seeing in terms of the improving asset quality? What are the metrics that makes you feel more comfortable? And secondly on competition, I think we've heard from some of your competitors that you have been taking a step back in terms of aggressiveness in pricing and being more focused on margins. But it looks like the margins are still overall declining. Is that the strategy that you are pursuing?</p>
          <p>And then lastly just on the EBA stress test, a small question, it looks like your coverage ratio on commercial real estate is currently just 4.6% and as compared to Swed, that's 50, and SEB at 37, Handelsbank at 16. Is that correct and why does that number look so low? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to make the start on Denmark, we see improvement across the board in Denmark. It's mainly among small medium-sized companies. There's no real clear metrics we see in our books simply that we get fewer new cases coming in with problem and we see improvement and the way the problem cases are being handled, coming better out and then generally just because that sector is better. Of course, what is not seen in our books is that problem within development and other speculative areas where a number of banks have had problems in Denmark, we are not involved in that area at all. So, also we don't see that and I would also question whether there's an improvement there. So, our improvement is mainly on the small medium-sized companies.</p>
          <p>Competition on margins, no matter what competition are saying, we are not being the price leader in margins for sure. We're trying to get our margins up and we are taking steps to that. But again, as, Fredrik, also eluted to few minutes ago, there are banks out there which are super aggressive and sometimes we have to lose a bidding contest for that reason we do that. And in other cases, we just don't win. I still think the margins are going to go up in the coming future because everybody is hurt by the higher funding cost and the extra capital requirements, and that was grouped into margins, especially in the top segments. And then you have a question on EBA, which I don't know, I'm not sure we actually understood the question or maybe Fredrik did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so. Could you, Jacob, repeat that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just where they disclosed the coverage ratios for your books that's in line for commercial real estate and it says here that the coverage ratio is 4.6% and that's the provision stock to NPLs, the definition. That just looks like a very low number compared to any other bank and I just wanted to see if that, first of all, is correct, and secondly if there is a reason why it's so low?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we are, in my knowledge at least, lower than anyone else in that area. But I think I suggest Jacob that you contact Rodney after this meeting and we'll try and answer that question. We got to check it out. We don't have the answer straight out right now. But please call Rodney afterwards and we'll look into that issue.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I have three questions, just one follow-up on the cost side. Firstly, is it so that we should assume you had three quarters of pretty flat cost now? Is it so that you should assume this level to stay on and this is really the run rate into 2012 or are you talking the second half a little bit higher before you have the cost to 2012, just clarify that?</p>
          <p>Secondly the government of Sweden had said that they will start to sell some shares. Do you know if they will have to announce anything when they start off or communicate with you in anyway? Thirdly, just a small one, volume in the performance fees in the mutual funds this quarter and it not was a normal level for your book? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jan Erik, if we start with the cost guidance, we have said that we will contain cost growth towards latter part of this year. So, we have not stated that this is the sort of our cost level going into the next year. So, again the flat cost development is from 2012 and onwards, of course, and we'll gradually during this year reduce the cost rate to contain cost growth. The Swedish Government, whether they will announce or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they will announce. In a certain sense they will announce when they start selling on the market. They said that in the first meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course, they need to abide by the flagging rules, needless to say. And then the final issue, the performance fees are typically in the fourth quarter or in the latter part of the year, so it's very limited or nothing in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. What was the reason why it was a big drop down in the quarter? Any particular reasons then, otherwise that the market fell off this quarter and the last quarter?</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think I don't have the exact answer to you there, Jan Erik. But I think generally speaking we had a good development in the first quarter, so because of the lower, you can say, general trading activity in the quarter on the back of a fairly weak development on the stock market primarily, brokers' fees were considerably to be lower than they were in the first quarter. So, I think that was primarily the reason.</p>
