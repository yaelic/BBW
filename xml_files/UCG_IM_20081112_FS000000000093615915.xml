        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to everybody. Many thanks for being connected to us. I will start immediately with Page Two of the presentation, the usual executive summary. The third quarter Group net profit at 551 million.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter the revenues have been 6.7 billion with a solid and consistent Commercial banking and in Private, the revenues year-on-year are up by 9%. And with trading income negative due to market dislocation. Change in the IAS 39 resulting 856 million of lower pre-tax charges to profit and loss.</p>
          <p>CEE Region is the best quarter so far, with a pre-tax tax profit which is up by 20% year-on-year. The costs are down 1.6% quarter-on-quarter and up 3% year-on-year in the third quarter with an only modest year-on-year rise of costs on FX and perimeter is 1.5% up year-on-year driven by a reduction of 0.9% in Western Europe again year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Capital integration is completed in one year and starting to show up in profit and loss. The prudent approach to risk was 1.3 billion did not effect fully charged the third quarter. You will see the main items on that later on.</p>
          <p>Core Tier1 free capital increase is 5.67 and Tier 1 is 6.46. We are decreasing the risk-weighted assets quarter-on-quarter. I think that we can summarize the quarter with some franchise in a difficult market.</p>
          <p>Moving to Page Four with the main figures at the Group level here we have four different counts. The first one is number in absolute terms and the second one is quarter-on-quarter change. The third one is year-on-year change. And the four one is year-on-year normalized.</p>
          <p>Normalized it means at current constant FX and perimeter. You know that we have ATF, Ukrsotsbank and Bank BPH that change in there in this year. So in terms of perimeter revenues, we are down quarter-on-quarter by 11.2% with year-on-year changes minus 1.5, normalize is minus 5.2.</p>
          <p>The operating cost quarter-on-quarter we are down by 1.6%, this is I think quite relevant. Year-on-year we are up by 3%, while a normalized growth year-on-year is 1.5%. The operating profit is down by 23.2% year-on-year at 8%, normalized 15.7.</p>
          <p>Year-on-year is in line which is Other Net Write-downs of Loans, without considering the effects of &#x2013; the current effects the climate mainly Iceland and Lehman is 8% or 93 million of the Net Write-downs of Loans up on the previous quarter by 2.8% &#x2013; sorry down by 2.8%. So we have an improvement quarter-on-quarter and we are up year-on-year by 12.5% and 17.7 on a normalized method.</p>
          <p>On the Net Write-downs on loans due to the crisis I will comment later on with more details and this is, as I said mainly Iceland and a portion of Lehman, another portion is in the revenues, because it's a negative trading transaction. The other non-operating items are 415 million due to provision for risk and charges mainly in the London Stock Exchange and Babcock &amp; Brown as write-downs so impairments we did in the quarter.  So the net income before PPA, we see standard and up PPA and CNI. This is quite important because of the PPA is reducing, that's entirely &#x2013; on the capital basis in terms of capital creation is 600 time.</p>
          <p>Revenues from recurrent assets we have total of 53 as a cost income ratio is at 61.2 the cost of risk is 56 basis point. Net one-off would be 43 basis points stable quarter-on-quarter. I think gives you also a very important point.</p>
          <p>Page Number Five, this is a very important in our opinion, because the commercial banking turmoil is impact, as you can see we are slightly growing in terms of operating income during the time. There is a significant growth year-on-year from 2.6 billion to 3.09 billion. If you compared to quarter-after-quarter, the cost income ratio is slightly down. It means that the commercial banking is entirely resilient and other parts of the operating income.</p>
          <p>This is also in dollar on the following page; Page Six, where we have the numbers for the different divisions. CEE Region year-on-year was up by 33.5% at cost on Private and Retail it would be 13.5%, which is quite significant growth that we will see it later on again daily base country-by-country.</p>
          <p>In retail we have pretty stable revenue based despite the lower fees. You have to consider that we've been able to the keep on commercial growth, total financial assets due to the switch from assets under management to other assets out of profitability end of this year.</p>
          <p>Today due to the low subscribers that we have, already there is contribution of the target is pretty significant. So at the interest margin was more than offsetting reduction, we have on the few side.</p>
          <p>Corporate as well, a good performance year after by 8% in terms of Private clearly is affected by the impact of the market condition in this generation, so it down by 11.1%. Overall the Commercial Banking is up by 9% and there is moderate 96% of the total range.</p>
          <p>The massive dislocation is having an impact on the revenues in Asset Management and maybe so you can see reduction by 31% in Asset Management and 55% in MIB.</p>
          <p>If we go to the following page we have solid volume development. Here we have loan and deposit growth on the two areas, Central Eastern Europe and Western Europe Retail, Corporate and Private.  So along side, as you can see is growing in Central Eastern Europe pretty significantly with 32% of cost and products and the perimeter Retail we have as small growth 2.1% negative in Italy.</p>
          <p>Corporate is growing by 6.8%, but on Corporate I would like to stress the growth on the lot on the deposit side, which is creating a significant contribution on the interest margin. So we have a growth in the interest margin in Corporate more coming from the deposit side and from the lending side.</p>
          <p>Private banking has grown significantly under deposit, because as I said before, the customers are moving assets from assets under management to deposits. This is important because as we think that we are still keeping a strong relation with the customers in waiting for the change in the market conditions and moving back to assets under management.</p>
          <p>Page Eight we have the different revenue lines, net interest is going up by 17.4%, the net commissions is a quite resilient in our opinion because the reduction of 15 .9% is driven by asset under management.  The others fees are substantially stable, which is also very important. And as I said before, the growth we have seen in the perimeter is mainly coming from the deposit side which is again very important because this means further tougher financial assets of customers are generating a positive contribution which is more than offsetting the commission trend.</p>
          <p>Trading income clearly we have and you see the details later on, a significant impact on the equity location the huge enlargement that's traded will have an impact on the credit market related activities. So obviously its having an impact on the position we had in the portfolio, but you will see all the details later on.</p>
          <p>Page Nine; this is a very important page because the profit and loss see impact of the financial crisis post IAS 39 amendment. On the revenues we have advancement of 530 million. 181 is related to Lehman bonds and counterparty risk always Lehman related. The 349 million is negative in the credit related business, but will you see the detail later on.</p>
          <p>Net write-down of loans 365 million mainly related to Lehman 53 million, 252 million on Iceland. We had coverage of 90%. So I will say that to consider at a coverage ratio of 10% is pretty conservative and this is the usual stance we have at the Group level.</p>
          <p>And 80 million our impairment on these assets we have made from our trading assets we have move from up-trading asset to loan and receivables. So really these related to that investment income as I said before we have the impairment of Babcock &amp; Brown 113, and London Stock Exchange is 215 million Lehman 30 million.</p>
          <p>Overall is 1.252 billion where the &#x2013; if we don't consider the 349 our credit related businesses all the average really one-offs. This is again important concept we are as usual very conservative also and seeing one-off, because we think that there will be not other finding to chapter 11 all American investment loans. But really did not also we had a for &#x2013; sure so is very important to say that these one-off impact.</p>
          <p>Page 10, International Accounting Standards 39 Effects. We have reclassified 18 billion of assets. We have assets we have reclassified 10.9 our ABS portfolio held for trading &#x2013; held for trading to loans. 3.4 financial institutions securities again from held for trading to loans and other portfolios in structured credit move to loans as well.</p>
          <p>The impact on the revenues is positive from 939 &#x2013; 937 million. We have an increase in net write-downs from loans of 80 million, so as the pre-tax profit and loss impact is 856 million. And this growth related to revenues side.</p>
          <p>Moving to Page 11, we have retained on the cost side. I think that also this is a very important because, as you can see the actual number in the third quarter in Western Europe is a negative by 2.1. If we consider a normalized number is a 09 &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; 2.1%, 09% lower year-on-year.</p>
          <p>In Central Eastern Europe, again have this &#x2013; a growth by 29.5 normalize the 13.6 now considering this ATF, Ukrsotsbank and Bank BPH. So at a Group level, we have respectively three and 1.5% growth. Quarter-on-quarter, we have a significant reduction in the staff cost because clearly this is an area where &#x2013; due to the reduction of cost on one side and lower variable compensation we have with significant reduction.</p>
          <p>The other costs, we are reducing significantly in Western Europe, as you remember in 2007. We've had the impact of the new branches in Central Eastern Europe and now we have started this positive growth of our branches in this area.</p>
          <p>Moving to Loan Loss Provisions on Page 12, we have a growth by 12.5% quarter-on-quarter that what is relevant reduction of the third quarter on the second quarter. We have a reduction of 2.8% in the third quarter in term of managing Basel I. But if we don't consider the impact of the crisis, 355 million of impact of the crisis &#x2013; as I said, is coming mainly from Iceland and from Lehman mainly &#x2013; only sorry. There are this 80 million of impairment on the assets we have mostly &#x2013; we lost. You can see the number of the cost of risk for the different regions have a growth <mark type="inaudible" /> may be with a gain related to Iceland and Lehman, but we will give the details in the following pages.</p>
          <p>In terms of asset quality, we had a great impairment, up by 5% in the quarter, this is 1.2 billion; one billion is Italy and 400 million is Central Eastern Europe.  Austria and Germany are flat we are experiencing a small growth in Austria which is completely offset by the reduction in Germany.</p>
          <p>In Italy, we have a growth which is by 282 million in &#x2013; 280 million more or less in Retail and 300 million in corporate, 300 million in the previous Capitalia perimeter there is alignment of UCG and standard of UniCredit you know that the completed immigration of the other banks in the third quarter. So this is again expected which is at the end of third quarter, but we will not see approvals and then our mainly the assets managed by <mark type="inaudible" /> are accompanied by $100 million. So this is the breakdown, and later on if you want I will provide further details.</p>
          <p>So if we go to the Non Operating Items, Page 14, it is pretty clear that we have 2.6 billion operating profit, 50 million of provision and charges, 18 million of integration costs, net write-downs of loans due to the turmoil impact 365, the other net write-downs of 693, net income from investments negative by 346 million and as I said 112 to Babcock &amp; Brown, 215 million on London Stock Exchange, 30 million at Lehman.</p>
          <p>The tax rate is ranking higher than year-on-year at 35.2%, so due to the fact that the negative result at &#x2013; in account disposals at difference tax rate and London Stock Exchange and Babcock &amp; Brown we have a gross and net impact which is a exactly the same. London Stock Exchange out of 215 of gross impact 212; this the net impact. And Babcock &amp; Brown out of the 112 of gross impact 110 is net impact.</p>
          <p>So when add the minorities, the PPA and we go down to this number, 50 million we are talking about. Capital Position, we are at 5.67, we have to considered that in the third quarter in terms of cost. We have the payment of the HBV squeeze-out and the Pekao put option with some of the two &#x2013; 32 basis points. So you have to consider that the other activities have offset this capital absorption.</p>
          <p>The restated assets are slightly down quarter-on-quarter despite of the fact that, in Italy and in these core countries, we are growing quarter-on-quarter in terms of loans. This is due to the fact that we are consistently managing our loan network value. So this is again very important that the focus in terms of underlying activity is clearly on our core countries in order to continue to sustain activity in the economy. Also structure, I think it's also very important. Tangible assets on tangible equities, we are at 31.6%. Pro forma for the capital increase we are at 28.9 and we expect to be even lower at the year end. Customer loan and customer liabilities, we have ratio which is 0.97.  So with overall position is quite sound.</p>
          <p>Now we move to more divisional &#x2013; sorry, Divisional Results, one more page. I will go through and Sergio will be, as well as Roberto Nicastro, Sergio Ermotti, Paolo Fiorentino. So afterwards all of us, we can answer to all your eventual questions.</p>
          <p>Page18, Retail Division. I think very good example Retail Division with the operating profit year-on-year with profit of 8.5%, thanks due to the fact that we have properly managed the revenue side. And we are significantly downsizing the cost of structure. So this is a very good example, so to &#x2013; I like the fact that quarter-on-quarter, demand write down on loans slightly down. And that is also a signal that what we said in the second quarter presentation; there was a &#x2013; that after that we are not seeing other significant deterioration in semester.</p>
          <p>If we go to Page19, we have the breakdown of UK, Germany and Austria. Italy is still performing quite well, as you can see, in terms of revenues; many thanks to the interest margin. In Germany, I think that Germany is pretty resilient, very important, with very good net interest revenues are stable thanks to deposits growth because we are still reducing the volumes of loans in Germany. So at the end the area of Germany is growing because we have less capital absorbed. You will see the costs are down significantly, so it is in line with our expectation.</p>
          <p>This might be more difficult diversification in Austria, where we have a higher pressure on the spread. Austria is a very competitive market. We have reduced significantly the volume of markets in terms of pressure, and along you will see that the cost of risk in Austria which is a IS that we have, so we are managing aggressively the credit risk in Austria. And you can see that on the interest margin, we have a slightly higher pressure.</p>
          <p>But I think that the most interesting page is following down on Page 20, because we do see that everywhere we are reducing significantly the cost structure both in the direct and indirect costs. We will have the final improvement with the migration of the Germany and Austria in 2010, 2011 on the IT platform &#x2013; sorry 2010 in Germany, 2011 &#x2013; sorry 2009 Germany, 2010 Austria, and by the most to the next year. In the &#x2013; so this cost structure will be reduced even more in the future. So overall, we have a reduction of 4.6% in the cost structure of the Retail Division, which is also counting in Italy and the same integration of Capitalia and also there we will have other improvements.</p>
          <p>Cost of Risk. Cost of risk, we have Austria, we have &#x2013; cost of risk 100 basis points.  This is a reason that &#x2013; why we are reducing significantly the new loan activity in Austria. Germany still improved &#x2013; it's five and improving and you know Germany has been affected very heavily I think since 2005 in terms of redeploying of the credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>Italy, we have this deterioration of 69 basis points &#x2013; are stable quarter-on-quarter, and this is important as a number. So the intervention we have made mainly in the mortgage area in &#x2013; at the beginning of &#x2013; at the beginning of the second half of last year in 2007 out of that we have showing finally who wanted STD in the deluxe channel is going down in almost 10%. So it's very difficult to achieve; an important signal of our improvement. The total portfolio in terms of &#x2013; at peak we end &#x2013; at the beginning of this year of 126% of the range delivered our portfolio in Austria down to 104, so we have signal of improvement of probably <mark type="inaudible" /> profit.</p>
          <p>Moving to Page 21, Central Eastern Europe region is the best quarter so far. We are fully aware of the potential difficulties of the area due to the deterioration of the economic cycle. So we wouldn't want to have a wrong impression by you that we are under-evaluating the potential impact of the financial crisis. But the actual number has been quite good. And I think this is very important because of this must be considered also in the future activities.</p>
          <p>So you see the numbers at Page 21; we have &#x2013; the revenues are going up by 13.5%, cost and products and perimeter, and mainly things &#x2013; this is clear to net interest income. The fees and commissions are down, cost and products and perimeter are at 19.5 in absolute terms. The operating costs are up by 13.6%, the operating profit is up by 13.3%, so there is a good effect due to the leverage we had.</p>
          <p>So the fixed income ratio is down from 49 to 47.3%, which is an outstanding level of efficiency. The write-downs on loans at constant foreign exchange and perimeter are slightly lower then the previous year mainly due to the fantastic quality of the portfolio that we have in Poland.</p>
          <p>Overall the cost of risk is quite prudent. We are at 62 basis points, amortized in the third quarter 64. Mainly you and we see later on the fact that we are aligned at the Group of standard Ukraine and Kazakhstan. We have a constant growth of deposits, especially in Russia, Turkey, Croatia, Romania and Hungary with a balanced loan to deposit ratio.</p>
          <p>Following page, Page 22. We have the gross operating profit in the third quarter, you can see also numbers country by country. So Poland, in Poland there is an effect due to the mutual fund industries. Go down you are seeing the number of Pekao. But, we are continuously growing quarter after quarter so the integration of BPH is being completed and we have good development in the net interest income and cost growth is significantly below inflation.</p>
          <p>Bulgaria, which is the only other country where you see a negative number year-on-year and we have &#x2013; it is on the budget, we had a positive one-off or less. So also countries are performing overall better than the budget but Poland, which is in line with the budget. So I think that this is very important. And if you go to the following page I would like to draw your attention on Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</p>
          <p>In Ukraine, we went up in terms of the cost of risk at 138 basis points. This is higher than June by 55 basis points. So we had aligned the Group to with every the countries to the Group and in Kazakhstan we end up to 259 with a growth on June of 67 basis points. So, the two countries are significantly up on the previous year. So just I'd like to say one word on Kazakhstan and Ukraine in terms of gross operating profit, because &#x2013; and I'd like to read the trend so, Kazakhstan the first quarter '07 till the third quarter of '08. Third quarter gross profit &#x2013; gross operating profit 19 million, first quarter this year 34, second quarter 43, fourth quarter 56. Adjust that to have in line the trend.</p>
          <p> Czech, Ukraine, and we start from this year because as you remember we have done this year recent number of constant ForEx, 28 million, in the first quarter, 45 in the second quarter, 77 in the third quarter. These I think are quite important because number give you the trend of these two countries.</p>
          <p>One page on the macroeconomic effects, so we are fully aware of the significant slowdown in this area. I think it's important for you to have a view on what is implied in our forecast, so we have a significant slowdown in '08,'09 but we see a recovering in '010. So we continue to be conservative on the area and clearly as you can see on the right side of the page, we are also following very carefully all the different specific situation of the different countries. I think that this is very important also if you go to chart, Page 25 and 26 because we said diversification is very, very important for us.</p>
          <p>We had revenues on the third quarter, Group revenues of Central Eastern Europe region and of each of the countries. I think that the diversification effect and that must be considered for us unless we have a wrong view on our position in the countries. Clearly all of them are providing a good contribution to the Group, but again, deliver few visions is very high, and the IS weight after bond with a 9% of the total revenues as account receivable, Turkey 3.8%.</p>
          <p>So again, we have a good diversification, which is also then important for the following page. We have a chart showing the impact on the Group Core Tier 1 due to ForEx rate in all activity.  Again, I think which is very important because clearly we have a portion of our portfolio which is in our currency with the volatility of the ForEx exchange ratio, so I think the capital is in local currency and a portion of the portfolio is in our currency you can have an impact on the risk-weighted asset and consequently on the Core Tier 1</p>
          <p>If we consider the first segments we had a positive effect of 4.9 basis points overall and you can see that we have accomplished this positive and negative effect. Also in October when there has the highest volatility in the market we had a negative impact of 2.6 basis points. So overall in the first ten months we are still in a positive territory. But you can see that each of the country has a different impact. So again, this diversification is very, very important to consider our present translation effect.</p>
          <p>Now we move ahead to Page 27, Corporate Division. The Corporate Division had a very good performance in terms of revenues. I'd like also to address the fees and other performance because if we don't consider the lower hedging activities by customers that brought the lower revenues year-on-year by 19 million. We are flat in terms of fees and commission and GBS, our global transition activity, mainly cash management, trade financing and GTB, Global Transaction Banking is providing a good contribution to the evolution of EBITDA.</p>
          <p>The operating cost are slightly up year-on-year, but down quarter-on-quarter, so the operating profit is growing by 11.4% and it's also growing quarter-on-quarter. Net write-downs we have a significant growth, but we have to consider the 67 million is due to Iceland, so we consider the one-off.  90 million are on few specific position, two position do have a weight of 68 million. These are position moving to restructuring and clearly we have provision on these restructuring activities.</p>
          <p>If we go to the commercial results, Page 28 in the different countries we see what is going on in Italy, Germany, also in Global Leasing. In Italy the revenues are up mainly thanks to the net interest income in Germany and Austria.</p>
          <p>The net interest income is driven, as we have seen before, mainly to the deposits area, which is quite important. In Germany the fees are going up thanks to domestic payments and foreign services. Global Leasing is improving both net interest income and fees and others.</p>
          <p>If we go to the cost of risk, Page 29, you see what is &#x2013; sorry, cost and cost of risk, you see how we are moving in terms of cost. The costs aren't related only to Germany, the costs also are in Germany in Leasing where we are investing in order to &#x2013; we have invested in 2007 and so we had an impact in 2008 and lasting till the present in Germany for covering the country and introducing many expenses in Europe.</p>
          <p>Italy and Austria are flat, but they're slightly down in terms of cost. The cost of risk is growing in Germany mainly due to Iceland and in Italy due to this deterioration of the credit environment specifically in this few number of positions I was talking about.</p>
          <p>MIB, MIB clearly is impacted and we are aware as well of the volatility of the results in MIB by the really dislocated market conditions of the market. You can see that in terms of total revenues.  We are significantly down and we are down afterwards. The net write-downs on loans are due to Iceland, 150 million and this impairment on the IAS 39 reclassification effects. As I said before, the reclassification have been significantly impacting MIB with a positive impact on pre-tax profit of 815 million.</p>
          <p>So clearly we are aware of the fact that this impact of the market condition is quite significant in this area due to the enlargement of spreads. In fact, if you go to following page you can see what is the contribution of the different activities. We had a very good quarter in recent products so this means that the franchise is quite resilient, but this is very important. Also in equities, the third quarter is better than the second quarter, because we had an improvement in the fraction of equity and the reduction in the cash activities transaction but there is an improvement. The credit-related business is not significantly impacted by the actual condition we have daily many impact which is a more or less 190 million on that. And then we have the spread widening, dislocation of cash and CDS and convertible market reduction, that leading to a mark-to-market loss of 349 million in the credit-related activities.</p>
          <p>This is the main impact on the market side later on <mark type="inaudible" /> market clearly we are available to answer to all your questions. What I think is that quite positive and again is a key element for answering to many questions on the investment banking side is a lot we have in Investment Banking Division might be with a positive growth in the third quarter in terms of advance can be found from with significant positive results of capital markets and not by the retained financing. You can see that we're growing significant year-on-year as well as quarter-on-quarter. We have a negative impact, as more negative impact on principal investment brought by <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Page 33, Private Banking Division &#x2013; the Private Banking Division has been impacted by the market condition. We have a reduction of total financial assets despite the 4.2 on following page as positive inflow of assets from customers in the three quarters, also 1.4 in net sales in the third quarter. What I think is very important, the fact that the revenues on average total financial assets are stable. We have lost only 1%, which means that the quality of services being fair and the operating costs are stable. So the income ratio is similar and quite excellent. There is 62% of cost income ratio.</p>
          <p>There is a negative impact in the revenue side of one-off and trading income 33 million, mainly due to mark-to-market of securities in the portfolio of DAB. DAB is long application, so bond portfolio and had a negative impact due to the market dislocation.</p>
          <p>If we go to the following page, you see the evolution of ordinary total financial assets. We are coming out of ordinary because this is not considering the big we can have coming in and coming out from three or four institutional customers we have so that this is as we have shown always the numbers so is pretty consistent. We had a top in the total net sales of positive of 4.2 billion. We have a negative performance from the market. So at the end the total financial assets went down by 8.3% from the end of the year. I think it's important because this means that we have a stronger capability of customer retention.</p>
          <p>Asset Management also here we have a negative impact due to market conditions and outflows of assets. We have on the right side of the chart the evolution of assets.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we are significantly restructuring the business. So you can see the operating costs are down by 14.3%. So the continuing ratio is quite excellent. We added 45% in terms of cost to income ratio.</p>
          <p>This is an activity significantly impacted by the market conditions. Also considering what is going on in the external market, we assume that in the future the main problem to solve to our customer basis will be our own liabilities, bonds and assets under management. So clearly in the long run <mark type="inaudible" /> will be returned. The loan portfolio will be impacted by the actual market conditions because there will be quite significant change in that of customer relations.</p>
          <p>I have closed my presentation and now we open the question-and-answer session and we are ready with the solution of your questions. Thanks a lot.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, this is a conference operator. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Mr. Marcello Zanardo of KBW. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to you and to your colleagues. Mr. Profumo, it's Zanardo from KBW. The first question is on CE, <mark type="inaudible" /> you stressed the point because, I think after investment banking and capital, this is where a lot of people are looking at to invest or not to invest in your price in your stock, or I guess that is where I get a lot of attention. So it would be really helpful if in addition to the comments you made in Kazakhstan and Ukraine, you could give us a little bit more of flavor maybe to countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, looking at which kind of loan portfolio you have there, where our losses heading to in terms of provisions on loan loss charges rather than losses. And then if with the information you have today you think that any other country are expected to post a loss in 2009, even your projects on loan loss charges? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is more of a detailed one. If you could give us the breakdown on your revenues, especially on your net interest income you said that 856 million after deducting 80 million from provision is the positive impact on revenues coming from IAS. So if you could give us the detail on the revenue line how much in the net interest income and how much in other revenues. And most importantly on net interest income, what is your opinion of this line taking into consideration many variables such as very likely deposit spread pressure in Italy next year coming from ECB rates maybe at 2%? Competition on best clients where the asset quality environment getting tougher so we're seeing a replacing now but I think a lot of banks will compete much more to get the best client. So where should we see net interest income next year at the Group level? And clearly you have better advantage I think because you are diversified, so more than half of it is outside Italy on this line. And the final question is on asset quality. You mentioned in Italy some provision for corporate names. It will be very useful again if you could give us more flavor. Now we are seeing a deterioration in the corporate in Q2. We saw some that, let's call it one-off deterioration the retail which, as you explained, I remember was third-party brokers, then alignment of Capitalia but now we're heading to the corporate. So again if you could tell us here, is it a small business? Is it the mid corporate? Is it the large corporate to have a better understanding on this line? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mr. Zanardo, on that Central Eastern Europe the different countries perspective I would ask to Roberto to answer. So I will answer to the other question and then we'll go back to Central Europe. Deposit and loan repricing, first of all, we have to clarify that we are working in this period of time on the next year back so this has to be clear. We don't provide the guidance for the budget next year. But overall, we see a positive growth in net interest margin growth because of the fact that clearly there would be a pressure on the deposit side in terms of lower in dollar interest margin but there would be a reprising on the loan activity. Clearly as the cost of equity is higher to therefore all of us and is due to as we said to continue to have a positive activity on the lending side in terms of sustaining the real economy. So it's a matter of quantity, but clearly the pricing will be different. This is in interact as we know, the cost of equity is going up. The banks of our franchise, we have 10,000 branches and clearly give us a positive due on our capability of the retaining the best for customers. And this is what is going on and we will see this significant presence as of plans for the future. Talking of the IAS 39, the impact is as we said that positive impact is 866 million pre-tax, I said that there are 80 million of provisions so it's a negative number. The positive impact is for 866 in the trading line and 70 in the net interest income. So it's mainly trading profit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking of the credit risk corporate is mainly feel like a small corporate and we have to be very clear, it is more corporate also because, just to give you a view if we consider first 10 position in terms of total migration of that we have in the different banks. We sum up 350 million so talking all of that our largest position of the three banks we already have 30 positions. So the highest migration we have in terms of absolute number so, the biggest acquisition is 67 million, which has been more from a number to watch these. So as you can see is not exactly a large exposure. So we are still confident that the underlying business is relatively good as I said before you see this is something, which was implied in our plan and budget. So we are aligned to the model we had &#x2013; we were considering at the beginning of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On CE, one, I want to find role from outlook and also the next quarter been for 2009 CE. The first thing to keep in mind is that we have been seeing quite a stronger result throughout 2008. It means that we get out of 2008, we've a quarter that will be much stronger than the beginning of 2008, the entering of 2009. The other important point to keep in mind is that why clearly everybody is revising downward, the projection core GDP and volume growth. But still the average consensus the most recent average consensus for GDP growth in 2009 we see is around 3%, which is completely different from the situation we have in Western Europe. As the result of this 3% that is cash mainly from the drivers on one side that you see internal demand that is growing. On the other side there is a possibility for the EU members to actually discover for the used structural path. So in constant one can see a little bit of volume growth in deposits as well as in loans next year. So that all in all in the revenue line, a client can have still some fairly positive expectation that will not be very abolish while that we had few months ago but still very positive. On the cost line as we've already disclosed, we are going to &#x2013; we have put on hold <mark type="inaudible" /> clients are opening new branches and clearly 2009 is going to be a year of cost effective, cost controlling, cost actions to our CE. On the cost of reapplying let me say that as far as today, we are not seeing any significant sign of deterioration, but clearly we are keeping the eyes very open, and in light of potential areas of relation to corporate and as more business and retail work. Moving on stand covenant country-by-country. Let me say that if one has to think is there any chance to going to be in the red next year. The only area we like to think of entering red at this stage based on <mark type="inaudible" /> a margin of our overall portfolio. Romania is performing well, at the moment in line the budget also in the third quarter. Clearly in light of one of being the guarantee in evolution is a chance on which we have very special costs. This is once again Romania is not &#x2013; thanks to the global diversification of our portfolio is not a country that can make a difference in terms of the overall CE performance. And in that comment we could make for in terms of also for Bulgaria. So, overall, we are looking with caution obviously towards the future, but also aware that there are a few quite positive aspects so that meaning the future outlook of CE performance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to everybody. Good morning, Mr. Profumo. I have a couple of questions. The first is on capital. The target remains 6.7% including the 15 bps benefit from the real estate project. If you could give us an update on your real estate fund and also my question is how confident you are after the capital management initial is with your 6.7% target that you don't need to raise capital on the market? And considering that 6.7% in the current environment seems to be slightly below what it is the average Core Tier 1 ratio in the market? And secondly, on strategy. What is the &#x2013; your strategy now? I mean, you presented the business plan at the end of June and following <mark type="inaudible" /> was growing in Central and Eastern Europe and saving costs and in the Western European country. Now after having done all of your Central Eastern European expansion I was wondering how you are thinking to manage the bank in the second part of your business plan so 2009 and 2010? So we should expect what your focus on at the moment? You are preparing the budget. If you can give us a kind I mean a little more color on what is the focus of a CEO of a well-diversified bank in the moment in the current environment. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And many thanks, Cicconetti, for your question. First of all capital, clearly as you have outlined, the 6.7 is related as well, that was real estate and closing. We are working on that. This is what we can say today, an amendment to all of you that this is 16 basis points. And clearly, we are focused on closing the transaction by the year-end, but as all the disposal activities this remains uncertain. So this is what we can say. I have to amend to all of you that there is some confusion of Core Tier 1 and Tier 1 because they target these, or they target the position of the other banks in some case of the finance for the money, in some case they finance Tier 1 ratio and I amend to you that our target is 6.7 in terms of Core Tier 1, 7.7 in term of Tier 1ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is &#x2013; it is a target in...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is a completion of the two, these are the numbers. We have seen sometime there that at the time a Core Tier 1 level of 7% by the year-end. I remember to you that our 6.7 is in any case having put on all the series of other business and that in any case we are working on, so we not consider to go to the market furthermore. Clearly, in all the countries now there are the government intervention undergoing, so this &#x2013; the level of capitalization of the other banks are also related to this government intervention and many banks issued preferable stock. As you know as well the Italian government is working on, and I thought of this of intervention in order to, as I said a few days ago, for the capability or the banks to sustain the lending activity in order not to have a credit crunch in the economy. In this perspective, I think that perspective that has been provided by our shareholders is made this very important, is allowed us for intense to launch a new project in order to finance a small, medium-sized of companies by five billion which is I think quite important always and adding the usual credit standard selection. But I think it's very important. So we are fully focused on this activity.</p>
          <p>Talking of the strategy, clearly we have to be very clear and honest today there is a visibility of the external world, which is pretty low. So this is completely I think to all of us. But we are fully convinced that a model like ours is very strong commercial banking franchise will be the winning model in the future. We are fully convinced of that. So the focus will continue to be on one side to five customer level service because this is a focus we continue to add very well, a stronger cost reduction so customer level service &#x2013; strong cost reduction also we think that these kinds of events are a great type in order to change accounts. I think banking sector is still an important quarter, accounts for each business and we have not yet aligned with industry level. And I think is also an opportunity so that the customer service cost structure and a full focus on serving with all our business clients our customer base. I think that the number we have just seen, for instance in the ForEx and fixed income activity in investment banking. In investment banking area, in the rising area, in the GTB area are all example of the fact that having a strong customer base you can gross sale on this customer your products are creating value and this is our focus which is not different from the one we have presented in this year plan, clearly the market conditions are different. So we have to be by far faster than we're planning again on the priority sector explained.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a follow-up question if I may, a very short one. Could you give little bit more about the government intervention because we had yes, the one of your competitors saying that shouldn't be dilutive and should be an instrument that would go to improve the cost Tier 1 ratios? I was wondering if you have the same feeling or if you have the same information? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Mr. Profumo and good morning everyone. Few questions the first one is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk &#x2013; speak after because the voice is not very loud.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The first question is on net interest income, we've seen 17% increase year-on-year, I'm just wondering what the impact is from the adoption of IAS 39 you mentioned a figure of 937 million impact on revenues, just wondering whether that is all included in the net interest income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I just said before that the impact on net interest income is 70 million, 70, so is also very, very small, I answer to much <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The second question is again on net interest income, the growth in the Retail Division has been 5% and in the corporate has been 12%. And if you look at the breakdown there is obviously very strong growth in corporate in Germany and in region. Just wondering how sustainable is this growth going forward? And the final question is on the cost of risk in region and corporate. Both in region and corporate we had very limited cost of risk in terms of base points in Germany of around 30 basis points, and just wondering how sustainable is this low provisioning rate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking our provisioning here we think is sustainable because as we said, we have variest significantly the balance sheet. Talking of our net interest margin and the net interest margin growth as I said, you were asking for Germany, mainly corporate is kindly significantly from the deposit side. And so we consider that is sustainable, clearly, we assume that the companies that we start to use their cash flow that end user. So they have generated in order to finance the actual activity. It is very important that the portion of the growth on the deposit side is coming from the fact that we <mark type="inaudible" /> exact number of mandates for cash management. As I said before, GTB is very important for us, GTB growth on transactional banking. So, and when you win the mandate for cash management, you keep the cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just going back to the net interest income and the growth in corporate, in the third quarter was 12% and in retail was 5%. Just wondering, if you can give us some flavor in terms of future trends in corporate and retail, it seems to me corporate will slow down and retail might remain favor just wondering &#x2013; what's your thoughts on these?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When I leave the floor to Roberto Nicastro and Sergio Ermotti, may give that they gave the wrong impression. I think that corporate in terms of net interest margin will have a positive impact from the actual conditions because on one side, the deposit side was cooperate if, as you can imagine there are stronger internal negotiating power on the deposit side and fact that will be a marginal spread on the banking side because we have to recharge the high cost of everything. In retail there is a &#x2013; there could be a negative pressure coming from the reduction of Euribor factor, we have a positive contribution from the other activities. But in &#x2013; I think that the Roberto and Sergio can add something if they want to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well in realty &#x2013; yes, in trend that, we will see, let say that deposit taking activity will be impacted by the Euribor movement. So the expectations were decrease in Euribor that's going to impact negatively in the net interest margin on the side deposit. On the other side, we clearly see a strong opportunity to enlarge, spread all of the lending activities, I would say across the board in the Retail product. This concept applied effectively more or less in the same way between Italy, Austria and Germany.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in addition to what my colleague mentioned, I think that one of the levers that we have as to focus on EVA negative clients, clearly this also something that this environment facilitate the discussions about turning those clients from EVA negative to positive or the marginal positive one to sustainable level.</p>

          <p>Okay. Sure, sure. Okay now the second question is on the net Inter-bank position of the bank and I think this is now &#x2013; I think the second quarter that I ask this question and the reason why I ask it is because it seems that the net Inter-bank position goes up by around &#x20AC;5 billion every quarter. So you started the year with roughly 60 billion net Inter-bank position, you are now at 70 billion and I think the previous quarter was 65 billion.

          <p>Thank you, as you can see from already from the balance sheet, you are looking at the net inter-bank position, but if you open up the deposits from banks are actually going down, while the loans to bank are actually &#x2013; obviously going down as well, so what you can see is that, yes, there is increase on the net inter-bank position, but the trend is actually going down in terms, particularly strong on the loan receivables to banks which is also a part of this leasing, so may not use of assets with a bit some of income deposit. And the net inter-bank deposits are actually down quarter-on-quarter by 2.3 billion. Obviously, you need to take into account and that I think under the eyes of everybody that clearly there has not been any issuance of institutional bonds in the market that paid throughout all of the quarter. So clearly some of the movement on the balance sheet due were present, obviously the substitution of our funding sources with other funding sources the date expires.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very clear. And then I just have two short questions. The first one is on the bank aid packages in some of the countries where UniCredit operates, particularly in Austria and in Germany. The capital being offered there essentially, the press being offered to the banks and on very favorable terms. I mean Austria banks are paying 8% fixed rates and...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, sorry for interrupt you, it still unclear because the European commission is analyzing help this government intervention and the expectation we have is that the cost will be aligned.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Yes, that goes again, the banks can announce what they want, but if European commission will not agree, unfortunately a wrong announcement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fine. So let's make it more general question than &#x2013; let's just say have you under any point in &#x2013; or has UniCredit under any point in time considered participating in any of the regional bank aids packages and if not I guess the questions is why not?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I can't answer to this question because without having a clear picture of the different intervention I think is useless to consider about this.

          <p>Okay. Fine and just the last question is then, you read out very helpfully the profit development at your Ukraine and Kazakhstan subsidiary.

        <plist>
          <p>You're right clearly, I would say there is a conditions that bit different because in Kazakhstan there has been a liquidity progress back the country is stronger in terms of national wealth. Ukraine do have a more difficult situation of the country, the bank is the common factor. So clearly is difficult today to foresee what can do &#x2013; can these revolution, as usual we are conservative in our future view.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>The impact that we are adjusting the process of doing that. And &#x2013; but as you know, so the banks are performing in line with our expectations. This is a quite important. In the case of any impairment, and I tell again, I'm not saying that because we foresee any impairment but just to clarify, there are no impact on the capital.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I have three questions and I apologize if I make a repeat. I just came in half way through your presentation, so sorry if some details I'll ask you again. Especially starting on the statutory of the searchable portfolio is 156 million. Can you actually detail a little bit more what has been the basis for the mark-up and exactly what are you taken up and on which basis? Thanks for the detail of how that has been, I look at the two P&amp;L lines, there's only 17 million in net interest income. Then can you explain why net interest income in the Investment Banking Division is actually quite so strong in the third quarter versus as the second and first quarter? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, Slide Number Nine, the 349 million credit-related business impact. What is that exactly? It's just simply current spread widening? How does alluding to the creating of results breakdown were rather given in the Investment Banking Division? Also on Slide 14, one clarification, these are all non-operating items, I'm not entirely clear what actually is in the 693 million which you classify as other net write-downs on loans. I didn't realize it was the 693 million one-off in loan loss provision but I may be incorrect in my understanding. Capital, I thought capital actually would have been &#x2013; this quarter will be a little bit higher, your quarter one ratio of, if I believe of 5.7%, have you already taken the benefit of effectively canceling the dividend particularly the portion that you had accrued in the first half of the year? If that is yes, then I know that I have a 55 basis points impact coming from the three billion capital increase by the end of the year. But how do I get actually from 5.7 to 6.7 is your target, I'm still missing 50 bips which is worth about three billion? And what is the difference there to bridge? It may simply, that actually from what you have declared, I'm not entirely sure what has gone really through the Q3 and what will go in the Q4?</p>
          <p>My last question is on Central Europe. How are you looking at your &#x2013; hedging your currencies in Central Europe? I know that you hedge your P&amp;L one year out on the main countries, and are you looking at changing the policy? And are you hedging any of the equity invested in any of the countries; if not, why? Will you reconsider hedging that? Other banks actually do hedge investments in their emerging market exposure also from an equity point of view. If you could just talk a little bit about that and how you look at it also going forward. Thank you. I hope it's not too much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Francesca, don't worry, third quarter cap line serves to the present, and I think gross margin in mld, and that's the end of 49 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So basically if we break down, there are some reclassification. And first of all I think we have around 70 million disposable products at on the ABS portfolio due to the recent reclassification. We have around 35 million coming from trading-related activities at particular rates and affect and fluctuate. So she talked about operating lines to influence last end. We have also 33 million coming from the consolidation of the countries as we announced a few quarters ago, which are creating 30 million of net income lines at a negative one and it welcome an effective move on the trade. So that answered the first question.</p>
          <p>With respect to &#x2013; 350 million mark-to-market, mainly market &#x2013; they are basically mark-to-market &#x2013; they are as we've seen on Slide Number Five we are basically experiencing a different scenario. First of all, spread widening on Corporate and stockholder financial institution assets not related to Capitalia and that are burying the most biggest part of it are coming from a basis spread widening, between long bonds and ABS that we are hedging, and so since we are obliged to mark-to-market as you know the basis has been widening through our very identicals in the second quarter. And also we have in terms of markdown, some convertible inventory that we have which also there we have through our sell off and disposal hedge funds where different for politics really well . Now convertible or accreting as bond value without basically any premium for the ABS components. So that's the three million. Of course with the net interest because we have different activities, but those are the three drivers for the negative contribution of credit already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear. Thank you very much. For the basics of your essentially mark-up on the ABS portfolio, what has actually been the basis for the 850, 860 million that you calculated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer. As you know obviously we are applying the new accounting rules as of the 1st of July. So effectively the books, the assets have been transferred from trading book to effectively loans are receivable, and to transfer then, we effectively transfer them at the value of the 1st of July. So that is the majority of the benefit that you see. The non mark-to-market markdown that would have occurred throughout the third quarter if we would have not reclassify the asset. As you know...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>According to accounting principle they will disclose the impact going forward pointing those after the main the banking book. Your second question was related to the recertification of our &#x2013; the interest. The interest is basically related to the fact that as we move them into the banking book, there is an especially an affect of who to part over time as long as the asset remain obviously not impaired. And that's why we see the 70 million on the net interest income line. By the way I would like to point out that we also have 80 million of charges on the loan loss provision, which are related obviously to our impairment and to the provision understated to this loan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is not entirely clear to me is other banks have done exactly the same, but actually no positive impact has actually gone through the P&amp;L because effectively if you cancel the book, the assets of the value of the first July; in your third quarter numbers, you don't take the markdown, so you said, well if I had taken it, it would be this much but it in itself it doesn't appear as a positive add back to the P&amp;L. Does that mean that actually underlie you took the markdown and then you actually add it back?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are just simply, because we have to by the way, disclosing what would have been the impact if we would have not done the accounting. Now what it goes into P&amp;L, it's clearly the 80 million of loan loss provision -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Because you have 181 of lower revenues due to Lehman bonds and counterparty risks, a trading &#x2013; for a negative trading profit, again related to Lehman. Then you have write-down of loans, again, 33 million on Lehman and 252 which is 90% of coverage ratio -</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>A very conservative view on item branch. Then we have the 80 million, which Ranieri was talking before, and we had made an impairment on Babcock &amp; Brown and the London Stock Exchange.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So this is in the P&amp;L what I've also said before, I don't know if you're aware of that, Babcock &amp; Brown and London Stock Exchange being an impairment is a gross format. So in reality, the net impact after tax of London Stock Exchange is 212, and the net impact of Babcock &amp; Brown is 110. So this is also the reason why you'll see a higher tax rate when you go to Page 14.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's correct. We do hedge our bad debt and income, so for the year we are hedged in terms of our net income, and we will grow that obviously as we have to. <mark type="inaudible" /> and you should take into account that the hedging, the equity of the investment. It's actually extremely complex, because not all currency goes into the same direction, so not all currency move the same, it's a correlation, which obviously if you tend to hedge the investment back you're actually taking some correlation risk.  As we look in the recent phase in this 8.6 as you can see, effectively, given the diversification of our capital in the different countries, and the fact that the currencies don't move necessarily in the same direction, and some of the assets are actually denominated in foreign currency, the effect on the investments are actually at this stage, I would say, negligible. The cost of hedging investment is actually, in some instances, fairly significant. And in some instances in many case cannot be hedged long term given the currency that we are talking. So effectively, although we look at the possibilities to mitigate the risk, at this stage we not hedge our investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how do look at you're total currencies portion there, because actually the correlation may change at this point in some of these countries? How you're looking &#x2013; because obviously, seeing now that it's going to be a very important topic. Not just because of the underlying trends, but also exactly for the fully various currency impacts. How do you look that? And how are you looking at potentially changing your strategy for hedging there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Francesca &#x2013; Roberto Nicastro speaking. In reality, even the past October has shown that main drivers for currencies performance, and microeconomic performance, tend to be not so much correlated. In reality, we know that there are a few currencies that are more linked to the dollar, some are more linked to the euro and that has to hold during the <mark type="inaudible" /> October, and some of the microeconomic drivers for that need to grow from this country. So once again, seem to be very uncorrelated. When the price of oil goes up, clearly this is a positive aspect of for, let's say, Russia and Kazakhstan, is less positive for our our third year than Poland. And the reverse is when all the prices go down. Some countries have access to Ukraine, some other countries don't have access to Ukraine. So there are lots of examples that show that why it's nice to have one label CEE. In reality and practice the driver tend to be quite different and so having a broad, diversified portfolio as we have, is the most powerful natural hedge one can have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And how do you look at the currency mismatch in the main banks in the country? What kind of limits do you set and how you manage that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Normally we don't tend to take significant currency mismatch in all the countries. What you'll have is merely a funding gap mismatch within the accounting in foreign currency.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Just have one question. Is &#x2013; on the interest margin, which was obviously pretty good, is &#x2013; has it been affected in any significant or important way by any of the non-recurrent or one-off, or in any way from the readjustment of the portfolio say passing from mark-to-market, to market to more than and things like that, which might have distorted the figure? That is my first question, and then I have a follow-up if I can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, you can. As we said before twice is that 70 million is the impact that we have from the reclassification, because as any areas that &#x2013; that area in the market, as I explained before. Having reclassified the assets from, as operating or to long-term receivables, we have put apart on one side and an impairment debt on the other side. So you have always to consider the two effects. This would be the current because clearly the portfolio goes to maturity. And the impact you have to consider on the profit and losses being at 70 million positive on net interest margin, 80 million of impairment on the provision side. So as being almost zero in terms of net depending on negative this is quite important because it reduce the dollar activity of profit and loss. I hope that is clear now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. No, no. That's very clear. And I have a different question. These results go to the end of September, and October has been one of the most complicated months in financial markets probably for decades. Can you tell us, or can you shed us some light on what happened to the trading book of the bank and whether in &#x2013; at the year end we should inevitably find some damage from some of the dislocation in the markets in that very month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Sergio Ermotti has explained before, we have portfolios in the credit rating activity that clearly has been impacted by the actual market dislocation. Today is too early to understand or to foresee what will be the impact by the year-end because, clearly, we think that the actual condition are very, as I said before, we dislocated as I said October, and as you were saying, has been a month not easy for the financial markets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you were unable to quantify the damage at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are internally able back as you can imagine this is something that has to be seen by the year end. We are adding a daily profit and loss of everything but this is not considerable because the all activity as we've seen is pretty high.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The final question is Mr. Arturo de Frias of Dresdner Kleinwort. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning, Arturo de Frias from Kleinwort. I would like to ask a bit more or again about Eastern Europe loan loss ratio trends. I heard them &#x2013; I heard you before saying that you haven't &#x2013; do you haven't seen so far any material deterioration, but I guess, do you expect as we do that we &#x2013; that there is going to be for sure very material deterioration in the next 12 to 24 months? So if you could give us some guidance of what kind of cost of risk would you expect in Eastern Europe in 2009? In particular, I'm looking at the &#x2013; some countries here, you have a page in your appendix? You are talking about 29 BIS for Poland, 2 BIS Ukraine, 20 BIS for Bulgaria, 46 BIS Serbia, 38 for Baltic. These are obviously extremely low cost of risk ratios. I'm sure that you expect these ratios to double or to triple in the coming quarters. And I would like to know, what's your impression?</p>
          <p>And then second question very related to this one: What comfort do you have yourself with your own cost-of-risk projections?  And I'm asking this because, I find myself completely in the dark when it comes to cost of risk of emerging markets for the next two years. In most of the countries you operate in &#x2013; you have been there only for a couple of years. Some of these countries haven't had a proper banking system for long, and I think everybody agrees that we are going to see probably the worst slowdown or global recession since the 20s. So I think it's absolutely impossible for us to understand if the cost of risk in Eastern Europe is going to go to 50 basis points or 100 or 200 or 500 &#x2013; we have absolutely no clue.  And I would be really curious to know your views on -particularly to know how comfortable you are with your own views? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, as you are seeing today it is difficult to foresee two or three year times and that's all right on the cost of &#x2013; the refinancing that has not understood from your question because if you go to Page 23, for instance, we have 138 basis point in Ukraine and 259 in Kazakhstan, while you are referring to lower numbers or soc and we are improved significantly from the previous year. And in the three-year plan, in terms of cost increase we had increase relatively significant because we went up to 86 BITS of the overall cost of Central Eastern and Europe &#x2013; today, we had a 52, so relatively below that threshold. Clearly now we are not revealing this year's plan, we are working on the budget for next year and we work as you know in a conservative way. Going to your question on how confident we are on our model &#x2013; till now the model has worked quite well, so ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but &#x2013; sorry, really sorry to interrupt, but that's probably exactly a problem. Now all the models and all the time series that we have already seen are very distorted by the fact that probably the last 15 years have been the best 15 years in economic history. And that's going to change substantially -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do agree, I do agree.  As I said before, when you work in a conservative way preparing the budget. So we are concerned, as you are, on the future. We have a macroeconomic view that we have shown very clearly at Page 24, because we don't see a recession in these countries. We have to be very clear on that. We don't see a recession; we see a significant slowdown, but not a recession. We think, as Roberto Nicastro was saying before, that the significant diversification is an important element. And we will work in a conservative way in terms of future provision.</p>
          <p>What you can be sure is that today, in terms of classification and provision, we are quite pleased. And we are not seeing yet, as you can see from the number, a significant deterioration. This is very important; we will work in a conservative way for the plan, for the budget. We are not highlighting the plan because it's impossible to have a view on two or three-year plans in terms of a macroeconomy and &#x2013; but again we are seeing a slowdown but not a recession. And before, you were asking the model we are working well at orientating now the market the model at work well. Also we have always been considered as conservative in the past. When we were talking of our cost of risk projected vis-&#xE0;-vis the one was presented by others. And we will continue to work with the same intents.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you have an impression of how high was the cost of risk in these countries? I mean, by which multiple the cost of risk in these countries went up in the previous recession or slowdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unfortunately, many of these countries were under a different regime, so it was not a market economy. So it's very, very difficult to check or to consider the models vis-&#xE0;-vis a different market condition. So unfortunately, we are unable to answer to this question. But I think it's almost impossible, and again and their economies &#x2013; it's also not so easy to talk of economy cycles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the reasons you will also probably want to keep there &#x2013; in consideration the fact that, as a group, we've been clearly quite conservative in a number of areas. And roughly, I'll give you two numbers that are quite relevant: The effects of mortgage exposure that in Poland is for the market up 53% of outstanding retail market, for Bank Pekao is 28%. But in interpreting give you a good cost growth of different position in terms of cost of risk.</p>
