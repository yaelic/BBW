      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and good morning. Thank you for joining us this morning for Zurich's first quarter results announcement. I just want to highlight a few elements of our results and then will ask Dieter Wemmer, our Chief Financial Officer to provide a more detailed review of the financials. Clearly, in this difficult environment, generating our 25th consecutive profitable quarter is an accomplishment.</p>
          <p>What is significant is the fact that since the economic crisis began in the third quarter of 2008, we have shown consistent quarter-on-quarter improvement. This record shows that the proactive steps we have taken to protect our balance sheet are working and that our focus on financial discipline and operating excellence continues to generate results.</p>
          <p>In General Insurance, our disciplined approach to underwriting is reflected in the premium drop. The real story there is the sustained improvement in rates we are seeing across even the most competitive general insurance markets; as the economy recovers and the appreciation for the need for rate increases expand, we are confident that we will be well positioned to capture the upside of these two important trends.</p>
          <p>In the meantime though, we will continue to stay focused on writing profitable business. In global light, we are clearly seeing the strains of the global recession and turbulent financial markets. Certain investment product markets are reduced, but our strategy of expanding our businesses in targeted areas is paying dividend as recent acquisitions and the early execution of our six pillar strategy compensated for reduced consumer appetite.</p>
          <p>We are using these times to put in place the people and platforms that will allow us to deliver on our expanded light vision which I'm confident will position us for profitable growth both in the short term and long term.</p>
          <p>Farmers continues to grow even before the recently announced addition of AIG's U.S. Personal Auto business. Our entry into the independent Asian markets in the East is gaining traction while our broadened product base and targeted marketing initiatives are expanding our customer base every day. Farmers has solidified its position as one of the leading personal lines insurers in America and the business model continues to generate reliable low volatility profits. We will be holding an "Investor Day Presentation" in London, May 20th, to deep dive into this business model, we're hoping to see you there.</p>
          <p>Beyond our solid operating results though, perhaps the most significant highlight of our first quarter result is the continued strength of our balance sheet; as we maintained our strong solvency ratio and added the shareholders' surplus over the period. Achieving this in today's environment reflects our unwavering commitment to reserve and protect our capital base as well as our continued disciplined approach to investment management.</p>
          <p>First quarter of 2009 was a challenge and the rest of the year continues to present shifting customer expectation and turbulent financial market. However, our ability to deliver against the clear and consistent strategy, to do so with disciplined and increasing confidence is why this period of disruption continues to be an opportunity for Zurich. Now I would ask Dieter to provide a deeper look at the financial results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jim and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Before I start into the results, I would like to put them in context. Going back to mid year 2008, we entered the financial crisis with a strong balance sheet and the fact that we have been taking decisive actions as needed in the face of continuously deteriorating markets, this has resulted in a continuous improvement quarter over quarter in the said time.</p>
          <p>It has been very encouraging to see improvements markets have made since the beginning of April, but I would like to remind you that the market position at the end of March to which these results refer was clearly weaker than at year end with equity markets down 15%, corporate bonds was higher and government bonds lower on increased interest rates.</p>
          <p>In this environment, Zurich strengthened its balance sheet through the periods both in absolute and relative terms. So, we are pleased to have announced another solid operating performance with the business operating profit exceeding $1 billion and BOPaT ROE at its full strong level of 14.8%. This pattern is much the same as in the third and fourth quarters last year. In our core operations, we have pavilion businesses, as the results remained strong although the economic environment continues to affect the results.</p>
          <p>Operating profit again demonstrated the underlying strength of all operating segments, which can be seen on the operating profit summary slide number eight. Before getting into the numbers, I should point out that under IFRS 8 we have adjusted the segmental reporting structure marginally. This is more aligned reporting structure to management structure; we have included a reconciliation of the 2008 comparative from the old to the new basis in the appendix on the slides 37 to 40.</p>
          <p>The core operating businesses achieved the business operating profit of just under $1.4 billion. This was down 22% from Q1 last year and, as I will come to, about $100 million or 6 percentage points of this reduction was due to financial market impact. The balance arose largely from currency effects mainly British Pound, also about 6 percentage points and from lower underwriting results and investment returns.</p>
          <p>As you can see the largely &#x2013; larger relative variance was in non-core businesses, which is largely the business previously described as "other businesses" but now excluding Farmers Re and Banking, which are shown above the sub total, the non-core business was again where the financial market impact most affected the business operating profits. This can be seen in more detail on page number nine.</p>
          <p>We showed you an equivalent analysis at year-end although most investment movements do not affect business operating profits, the fall in capital markets have affected the operating results in a number of ways.</p>
          <p>In Global Life, there have been effects from an acceleration of deferred acquisition costs and other amortization, provisions for guarantees, and the reduction in fee income arising from the lower managed assets value; each of these three effects contributed approximately $30 million to the results.</p>
          <p>In non-core businesses, the operating results have been particularly affected by losses on bonds held in Centre of $60 million. These are designated as fair value through Profit &amp; Loss where cash flows match corresponding Life Insurance reserves and an increase of $210 million in run-off of life reserves which are sensitive to equity markets and interest rates.</p>
          <p>In contrast to the fourth quarter, hedge funds had a small positive return this quarter. I will now go to the detail by segment of the operating results starting with the top line on slide number 10. We continue to achieve positive growth in selected areas of business but we have seen top line reductions in some areas where we were prepared to lose less profitable business when we were not able to achieve the rates necessary to maintain our margins.</p>
          <p>For General Insurance, gross written premiums decreased by 3% in local currency, nevertheless we are pleased with the top line results. Three out of four divisions have achieved local currency growth; in North America Commercial, we are continuing to manage our margin accepting the impact on the volumes this is having, in particular, in an environment with falling levels of insured customer exposures. For North America Commercial, this has resulted in rate improvements and targeted growth being more than offset by the effect of lower economic activity mostly in the automotive and construction industry, as well as lower levels of new and renewed business. As a result, the top line for North America Commercial decreased by 14% in total.</p>
          <p>Also Global Corporate in North America experienced a reduction in top line by 7%. There we were pushed hard to execute our strategy to ensure premium levels are consistent with our technical way. This resulted in a decrease in renewal retention by 8 percentage points. However, on a total basis, Global Corporate's gross written premium increased slightly driven by the transfer of the corporate lines of business for Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>In Europe General Insurance, gross written premium increased slightly, this was driven by the recent acquisitions in Turkey and Spain, where its ongoing business was mostly flat; the strongest organic growth came from Italy where we saw double digit growth in the Agent channel.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., volume reduced by 9% due to our rating actions and the slowdown of the economy. In our international markets, the top line grew 9% with the acquisition of Minas Brasil contributing for the first time. The integration is well on track and is expected to be fully finalized by year end. On an ongoing basis, all businesses in international markets are showing growth in local currency.</p>
          <p>Turing to Global Life, APE grew by 16% in local currency, solid results in the challenging financial markets; the business acquired in Spain in the third quarter of 2008 contributed $176 million to this quarter. This combined with growth in market share helped offset the general decline in many markets.</p>
          <p>Farmers Management Services saw growth in fees of 6%, this was driven by the good levels of premium growth at the Exchanges largely supported by the transfer of the small business portfolio from North America Commercial. Farmers Re gross written premium has increased as the All Lines Quota Share Reinsurance Treaty with the Farmers Exchanges has already reported was increased from 5 to 25%.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to look at the General Insurance segment in more detail on slide 11 with the Rate Change Monitor. I am very happy to report that overall General Insurance rates for the first three months of 2009 are up 2% on average. Looking at the individual businesses, you'll see that we manage the rate increases in a differentiated way, reflecting the respective market environment and underlying levels of profitability. While all business divisions show rate increases, the largest increases have been achieved in the United States where last year we saw the greatest pressure on rates.</p>
          <p>Global Corporate in North America is up almost 6% as all lines of business contributed. Also North America Commercial achieved rate increases of 2% primarily in middle market and specialty. Staying in the commercial segment, Global Corporate in Europe has achieved positive rate development through the quarter with average rates increasing 2%. Both the U.K. and Continental Europe are contributing to this increase with Global Corporate U.K. leading the way with 5% increases.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, Europe General Insurance continues to increase by 1% overall with most countries contributing, reflecting the differing needs for rate reductions. So, to sum it up, we are delivering what we said we would. We are leading the market and pushing for higher rates in those markets where margins were under pressure even if it comes at the expense of top line volume.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to slide 12 to dive into our General Insurance key performance indictors. Overall, General Insurance is delivering robust operating results as shown earlier; business operating profits are down 25% compared to the first quarter 2008, with a total profit of just below $900 million. The main components of this decrease are foreign currency effects where the dollar continued to strengthen against other currencies particularly sterling; this effect amounted to a third of the reduction; the remaining balance arose from higher combined ratios and not surprisingly lower investment income.</p>
          <p>Overall, the combined ratio deteriorated 1.2 percentage points to 95.8% driven mainly by the increase in expense ratio, which I will come to later. The rate increases we are seeing now will earn through later in the year and along with a more benign inflationary environment, we remain confident in the ongoing profitability of this business.</p>
          <p>Moving on, I will now go into more detail along the expense ratio development. The commission ratio remained relatively flat, although it benefited from the transfer of the small business book from North America Commercial to the Farmers Exchanges.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the other technical expenses which increased by 1 percentage point over Q1, 2008 but were generally in line with the quarterly variances seen over the last two years.</p>
          <p>As you can see in the slides, the increase was mostly driven by one-off items including the impact of the small business transfer. Through our continued focus on expenses and operational improvements, the total head count in General Insurance reduced by more than 5% adjusted for acquisitions since April 1 last year.  This resulted in a reduction in our internally managed expenses and the internal component of the expense ratio staying flat.</p>
          <p>Our $400 million 2009 expense saving initiative of which General Insurance targets around 60%, will begin to feed into the numbers from second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a more detailed look at the loss ratio. While the overall General Insurance loss ratio for the first three months was awfully flat year on year, there were significant movements in the component resulting in a slightly improved underlying loss ratio.</p>
          <p>Looking at the last loss experience, this improved by 200 million or 1.8 percentage points; the largest improvement originated out of Global Corporate where we returned to more normal levels compared to last year. North America Commercial and international markets also improved.</p>
          <p>Moving to the prior year movements, which is lower year on year; these movements are made up by many segments across the whole segment, for instance, in Italy we increased provisions on bodily injury claims. Having said this, our approach to reserving remains unchanged and this is a normal variation in the numbers.</p>
          <p>The underlying loss ratio was mostly flat, but showed a small benefit from the impact of currency movements changing the business mix. This is really great improvement mitigating the earning in effect of rate decreases of last year as well as claims inflation impact. This is encouraging since the rate increases achieved in the last six months are expected to earn through in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>This said, it's time to look into the Global Life results starting on slide 15. As I mentioned before, the new business growth of 16% in local currency reflects the volumes from the businesses acquired last year in Spain. In total, on the like-on-like comparison, the APE volume declined 3%, by country, we saw growth in the U.K. and Latin America, demonstrating the diversity of the Global Life business and balancing challenges in Ireland and in emerging markets in Asia.</p>
          <p>The new business margin at 20.6% overall remains within our target range; our strategic product including unit-linked individual savings and protection are still delivering strong margins and profitable growth. Obviously, the lower interest rate impacted guaranteed savings product in Germany and Switzerland. The strength of the Zurich brand allowed us to maintain our premium rates, while building market share, this combined with strong expense control allowed us to keep our profitability high.</p>
          <p>The growth and sustained margin resulted in the new business value of 149 million, down 7% in dollar terms but up 5% in local currency. BOP of 222 million decreased by 35% in dollar terms and 25% in local currency; the Q1 result was adversely affected by the ongoing weakness in the investment markets, partly compensated by a reduction in U.K. policyholder tax. Overall, the result includes a net one-off negative impact of approximately $35 million.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the next page to see more details on the new business; this slide shows the progress made on executing on our Global Life strategy to manage new business through three global distribution pillars; bank distribution, IFA/brokers, and agents; and three global proposition pillars, corporate life &amp; pension, international/expats, and private banking client solutions.</p>
          <p>Bank distribution was the main growth driver principally from the acquisitions in Spain; the growth in both BanSabadell and Caixa Sabadell exceeded once again our quarterly business plan. The corporate life &amp; pension pillar increased in local currency terms driven by strong sales of protection business to international groups and from local protection business sold in Latin America.</p>
          <p>The IFA/broker pillar decreased by 4% in local currency despite the tough market conditions; these effects were partially offset by growth in the U.K. driven by successful pension sales and an increase in our Broker Relationship Managers. For both our agents and international/expats pillars many territories continue to be resilient to the ongoing financial crisis during the first quarter. Our Hong Kong business, both domestic and international/expat business were significantly affected by the falling consumer appetite for insurance products.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to page 17 and to Farmers Management Services results; this quarter, we show for the first time the results of Farmers Management Services and Farmers Re combined in our segment Farmers. As in the past, let's tackle Farmers Management Services first. The gross management result has increased by 11% driven by two factors; firstly, management fees are up 6% reflecting the continued good levels of underlying premium growth at the Exchanges, to which I will come in a minute.</p>
          <p>Secondly, corresponding management expenses are up only 1% as strict expense discipline and continuous operational transformation started to kick in again. As a result, the margin on gross earned premiums increased by 50 basis points to an excellent 7.5%. Looking at the business operating profit at the bottom of the slide, it increased by 7% to $322 million. The increased management result was partially offset by lower investment income largely as a result of higher dividends and cash transfers to the group, which lowered the average investment rate.</p>
          <p>With that, let's move to the performance of Farmers Re on slide number 18, Re increased the All Lines Quota Share Reinsurance Treaty from 5 to 25% in September last year which explains the gross written premium increase of about $650 million. Farmers experienced significant catastrophe events in the quarter, particularly two large hailstorms in Texas; the effect catastrophes on the combined ratio of Farmers Re was 3.8 percentage points. Excluding the CATs, the underlying loss ratio was 0.5% points better than the first quarter last year. The expense ratio increased by 1.6 percentage points due to changes in treaty terms.</p>
          <p>The All Lines Quota Share ceding commission was increased by 3% on renewal to reflect an emerging change in business mix towards small commercial, specialty, and personal best.</p>
          <p>Overall, these books have a higher expense ratio and lower loss ratio than the previous business mix. Within the quota share, the loss ratio emerges automatically as the ceding commission is a fixed rate and was therefore amended.</p>
          <p>The new ceding commission level will stay unchanged after the closing of the AIG Auto Group deal as well. Moving on to the Exchanges results on the next slide.</p>
          <p>The Farmers Exchanges which we manage but do not own have maintained a strong track record, which started back in 2006. They continue to transfer of the small business portfolio from North America Commercial started in June 2008, which added 148 million in premiums or 3.6%. Excluding the small business transfer, the Exchanges achieved a largely flat top line overall. Therefore the Exchanges withstood the challenging and declining market conditions and outperformed the industry once more. The adjusted combined ratio is at 94.3%, up 1.9 percentage points; at the Exchanges catastrophe charges increased by 3.5 percentage points driven by the Texan hailstorms. Therefore, these higher CATs effectively marked an underlying improvement in the combined ratio, driven by improving loss trends in homeowners and auto.</p>
          <p>Throughout 2008, the Exchanges have continued to lead the market in the first quarter of 2009 by taking rate increases of 3% overall. Net surplus remained largely flat despite taking into account the higher CAT losses, the statutory treatment of equity and debt investment as well as the ongoing transfer of the small business book from Zurich North America Commercial.</p>
          <p>Taking account of increased quota share, the surplus ratio was at 37.3%, up from 36.1 at year end level, we consider to be solid and well within the historical range. Overall, the Exchanges continue to do well in these challenging times and provide the group as a growing low volatile capitalized income stream. It is against this background that we have entered into the AIG U.S. Personal Auto Group transaction further supporting the Farmers business growth in the future.</p>
          <p>Turning now to look at the performance of other operating and non-core businesses; our operating businesses include the results previously described as corporate function as well as our banking operations.</p>
          <p>We made a gain of $52 million on buying backs on subordinated debt. On the banking side, higher financing cost and increased provisions for loan losses explained the profit reduction of $26 million. As I detailed earlier, the non-core business segment was affected by financial market driven adjustments of approximately 300 million being charged to P&amp;L to operating profit in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the performance of our Group Investment, net investment income decreased by 15% in dollar terms, 4% in local currency driven by lower holdings of equities and investing at lower interest rates. Net capital losses through P&amp;L were $1 billion of which 683 million were for shareholders, about which I will give more detail in just a minute.</p>
          <p>As a result, net investment return was a positive 50 basis points in the first quarter 2009. An increase of $1.4 billion of unrealized losses on investments included in equity results in a negative total investment return of 30 basis points, a decent result in stressed markets in the first quarter, that saw new lows in equity market.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you of some key points of Zurich's disciplined investment approach. You can find further details as usually in the appendix. As emphasized, we continue to be very comfortable with the quality of our investments and our asset allocation. Our equity exposure is well controlled and amounts to 2.8% at the end of March taking into account our hedging programs, which protect about 15% of our equity exposure.</p>
          <p>Looking at the aging of our unrealized equity losses in the light of our impairment policy; in the very hypothetical case that all equity prices were frozen at March 31, 2009 position, we would expect further impact on equities to reduce net income by about $150 million in the second quarter 2009 after policyholder-shareholder split impact. The credit quality of our debt portfolio remained strong. In order to make more efficient use of our capital in the light of current stressed markets, we have started to invest new money predominantly in government bonds in the first quarter. You will see the impact on our economic solvency in a minute.</p>
          <p>With that let me comment on the capital losses in Profit &amp; Loss on page 22. Given that capital losses continue to be an important driver, we have included the slides analyzing capital losses and impairment by asset class again this quarter. Net capital losses through Profit &amp; Loss were a negative $1 billion for first quarter. Within this amount impairments, growth of policyholder allocation, and hedging is about 500 million. As you would expect in these markets, the bulk of this or about 300 million related to various equity securities. About 180 million of the impairments related to bonds, which were incurred across many issues reflecting the broad diversification of our debt portfolio. In addition, mark-to-market adjustment on fair value through Profit &amp; Loss assets added 300 million while losses from sale of investments added roughly another 200 million. These losses were driven by both debt and equity investments. In total for Q1, the gross $1 billion capital loss impacted shareholders after policyholder allocation by 683 million.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the movement of the unrealized losses in equity; in Q1 unrealized losses included in shareholders' equity increased by 1.4 billion although as we will see only roughly 700 million there for shareholders. Unrealized losses increased primarily on debt securities, of the total 1.2 billion increase on debt, roughly 700 million there on corporate bonds largely as a result of widening credit spreads, another approximately 500 million were on government bonds, driven by higher interest rates on longer maturities particularly in U.S. Dollars and British Pounds.</p>
          <p>With that let me comment on the movement on shareholders' equity on page 24. Shareholders' equity at $22.3 billion is slightly up on the 2008 year-end number. Net income attributable to shareholders of 362 million was net of an effective tax rate of 24%. The 689 million of adverse movement in unrealized investment losses represents 1.4 billion, which I mentioned in the previous investment slides, net of tax policyholder and other allocations. Translation adjustments reduced equity by another 229 million. The actuarial losses on pension plans decreased largely from movements in discount rates. These are based on long dated AA corporate bond yields, which increased. This is the opposite side of the effect seen in unrealized loss movements on bond investments. Looking at the movement in Swiss Franc, book value per share increased 8% in the quarter to 180.6 francs.</p>
          <p>With that, let's have a look at our capital position on the next slide, number 25. As we have previously disclosed the Solvency 1 final calculation filed with the Swiss regulator was 160% which was 7 percentage points higher than the estimates we published with our full year results. The estimate did not take into account of certain benefits including tax, as we were still in negotiation with the regulator at the time. The movement in the first quarter reduced the ratio by 3 percentage points to 157, mostly due to reduction in free reserves for policyholders. As you know there is much variability in the components of Solvency 1 calculations throughout Europe. We marked-to-market our bond portfolio, which reduces the ratio by about 21 percentage points. In addition, we need to deduct General Insurance debt, which accounts for another 24 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Moving on to economic solvency at the bottom part of the slide, including risk mitigation actions already taken, our economic solvency levels recovered during the first quarter to 102% on our internal AA calibration. This ratio already takes into account the dividend paid in April, but not the effect of capital actions in the second quarter. Looking at the right hand side of the slide you can see that the economic solvency benefits by about 8% from the AIG Personal Auto Group deal and from the issue of senior debts. I remind you that our model is based on policyholder view of capital adequacy and therefore includes senior debt.</p>
          <p>No other second quarter adjustments have been made to either of these figures. Finally, our numbers have no allowance for liquidity premium. Our estimate is that a liquidity premium of 100 basis points would improve the ratio by another nine points by adjustments to the embedded value and adjustments to the non-life discounting effects.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we can look at the movements in economic solvency in more detail. Starting with the movements on the available financial resources, the increase is largely due to the issue of the senior bond and the recent announced acquisition. Looking down to the RBC calculation, the acquisition caused a similar increase here, leaving a small positive benefit, which nets off at this level of bonding.</p>
          <p>The RBC however had a net benefit of $1 billion from quarterly movements in insurance risks. Partly due to our pricing actions in General Insurance which had resulted in lower premiums written than what was previously anticipated in the risk based capital model and there were also movements in operational ALM and credit risk charges.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have instituted the first of a number of risk mitigation actions, those implemented in the first quarter gave a benefit of about $1 billion. Firstly, we have hedged a portion of our fee income from unit-linked business in the U.K. reducing investment risk. Secondly, in the first quarter, we have been investing new and rolled-over money into low risk bonds reducing our rating in corporate bonds and credits. We have other actions we are taking and can, if necessary, take to de-risk and improve our capital position and these will flow into the solvency calculation through the year.</p>
          <p>So, let me summarize, we have improved our balance sheet strength in the quarter and we have continued during April to take further strengthening actions. We are not relying on the April financial market improvements, which may be temporary and will &#x2013; and we will actively manage our capital position to enable us to continue the journey of profitable growth and maintain our investment in operational excellence. Our operating businesses remain sound with good performances in difficult markets, achieving selected growth in those areas where we wanted to grow.</p>
          <p>Financial markets have affected the results, but the business operating profit ROE remains strong. We are well on track to achieve our 2009 Zurich rate targets and actions are underway to achieve additional expense reductions of at least $400 million during the year. So, now we can move to the Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Yes. Thank you. I had a couple of questions on reserving in general insurance and elsewhere. And the first question your reserve release numbers is down to 100 million and you mentioned Italy as one of the offsetting items. And can you say what the gross number would have been and also give an idea of what the run rate would be, and I know in the past you said our reserve releases should stay high, but if one looks on an annual basis, it's actually become quite volatile. I think four years ago the figure was 200 million then we have two years of a billion and now it looks as if the year might be 400 million, so I'm just wondering where this kind of stabilizes?</p>
          <p>And the other question is in the other segment there was a reserve addition, because the net reserve release for the group was 70 million, not the 114 you had at general insurance. And I just wondered whether you could explain why that is? And say also with reference to UK, asbestos exposure, at what stage you would envisage taking more provisions given that you serve new claims are still rising and pace is not really changing. A lot of questions on reserves, I'm afraid.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Michael before I ask Dieter to get on the detail for the question, I just want to clarify a couple of things. One, we had never given any guidance on the amount of reserve. As said is when we adopted more conservative preserving assumptions that we expected that the book would continue to rollout at a positive over time. I want to make sure that managing expectations here we have never given any guidance on that. Then I will turn it over to Dieter to respond specifically to the questions here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Michael, it's &#x2013; I was going to say the same that we have never spoken about a quarterly guidance. I &#x2013; to give you an answer to those questions specifically, Italy is between 40 and $50 million increases for a change effect on bodily injury claim calculation. In other businesses that is mainly coming from one-off businesses, which are booked under a London-based entity but refers to U.S. business and it is the difference you have described. Your question regarding asbestos reserves, we have actually strengthened our asbestos reserves in 2008 quite, quite a bit. That is a bit masked when you look at our annual report because the pound exchange rate to move to strongly therefore it doesn't look like an increase of the reserves, but when you look at the underlying PNL movement it was a good increase last year and we don't see any reason in the first quarter of 2009 as to touch our asbestos reserves.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon &#x2013; good morning, I should say. Just a couple of questions. Claims inflation, you mentioned that you were positive that the broader inflationary environment was going to contribute positively to the claims of face experience, I guess my question to you is just what the impact of this sort of inflection point we're at politically, socially and economically do you see that having an impact on claims experience? We're seeing the low level of more slip and trip type claims and employment tribunal, to if you watch on PNLs and at the same time, we are also seeing politically a little bit of sympathy more towards the claimants than away from the companies. I think the UK we've seen that with the recent <mark type="inaudible" /> Flora Plax experience. I was just wondering whether you factor that in, how you see that developing and just your thoughts on that generally.</p>
          <p>And the second question is just on rating migration and whether you see any issues in &#x2013; from your internal capital model or in terms of how you're managing your business from seeing, although the underlying value of the bonds and the credit size may not move much but the ratings might well move over the next little while. Just how you're seeing that develop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay let me first comment with again, I think you're coming to almost the term fraud and claim in the current economic environment that we are in, our antenna are very much up on that. We are &#x2013; in fact I reviewed in two locations I visited just within the last week a fraud claims group and how we are attacking that. So there is no significant increase in that area that we're seeing at this point in time but one looks back at historical trends, you can have an expectation that there will be increased. There could be an increase in at least claims, the question is do they get paid out? When you start to see disappearing jewelry that was never claimed for before and items like that, the cost of that gets passed on generally to the other insurance.</p>
          <p>We are very vigilant in that in terms of putting these types of claims through a second screen of review. Our outlook long-term on the claims inflation side, Dieter referred to a benign claims inflation environment in the near term. I think we see once the recovery kicks in, perhaps two years from now we have to be vigilant to a rise inflation and in particular claims inflation which makes the pricing actions we are taking today, particularly on the long-term, much more important. But I'm going to ask John Amore with us to give us a view of that and then as it relates to the rating mitigation in the bonds I'll turn it back to Dieter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jim, so the overall answer to the question is that we haven't changed our claims inflation, lost trend inflation expectations at this point in time. And that's really a result of many different factors, some which are negative, some of which are positive. Indeed the slow down of traffic activity, the slow down of industrial activity has caused some lowering of the frequency of claims and accidents et cetera. And of course though we have been on the look out and keep looking for increases in arson, fraud, other types of activity that can be commensurate with downturns in economic times.</p>
          <p>But overall, we have no trends to report at this point in time nor do we see any change in the demeanor of court adjudications positively or negatively. They had more or less stayed the same at this point in time. Obviously, sometimes there are adverse decision, some are beneficial, but overall we have not seen any significant changes in the demeanor of which courts are adjudicating on insurance types of activities.</p>
          <p>The other thing I would say, as Jim alluded to, we are definitely preparing for more types of arson and fraud types of activity by building up our capabilities to detect these at early stages and also to react to them more quickly.</p>
          <p>The other thing that we have seen is in sometimes the cost of replacement materials has had a sort of beneficial indication for us at this point, as building activities in general have slowed down around the world and there is an abundance of materials available. So we've been able to purchase materials at lower cost for our insurers as we are doing with placement activities. So overall the answer though is that we don't have a change.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Andrew, I can also confirm that the changes in claims inflation have not yet found entry into the reserving calculations. That is something where we need some more quarters of experience and how the inflation number will develop, but at the moment I would assume that this is more a positive than the negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so summary no change to pricing or reserving for inflation either way at this stage.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this stage correct. And your bond rating question, I interpreted, now because I am not sure whether I fully understood the question. We lost a little bit on average rating and the corporate fund portfolio, but with our rebalancing of reinvesting into government bonds on reinvestments and new money in as the overall average rating stayed at the AA level.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Okay, I guess, I'm just thinking as things migrate downwards, the capital charge, your internal and the S&amp;P models would typically go up I guess it's potentially not a huge issue for you guys but it sounds like you don't &#x2013; you are not seeing that as a major issue at this stage?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have two questions. First one on equities investments, do you see any change here going forward or did you close any hedges there or do you intend to? And the second one is on D&amp;O line, did you see any impact on your results in first quarter from D&amp;O claims?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. On your question on changes to the hedging, there is no specific change we are seeing. I think Dieter had mentioned in his introduction that the equity quarter was at 2.8% as of the end of the quarter, 15% of that is hedged and the intention at this point is not to initiate any significant change to that quarter. Obviously as we move forward we have a high priority on keeping our balance sheet strengths and to continue our disciplined manner to adapt to changes into marketplace if necessary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the D&amp;O side you have to remember the position we have in this market which has not been a very large market position particularly on the large scale upper end. We have been providing D&amp;O cover mostly for private companies, small and medium size companies. We are not having as much there. So this is an opportunity for us, as you had some dislocation of some of the other providers in this market sector and we will be compensating for that in our underwriting discipline as we go forward. So there is no significant change in the claims exposure for us here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had two questions please. One was on the running investment yield. I calculate that was roughly 4.1% in the first quarter. It's awfully difficult working out how that is going to change going forward, particularly given how you switch out of corporates and the governments. Perhaps if you could help us with that, just maybe say the rate at which new money is going in and the rate at which investment &#x2013; the yield at which investments are leaving your book would be helpful? And then secondly, I just wondered why are you selling corporate bonds and moving into governments? Is this is an investment decision or is it really based on your desire to &#x2013; to improve the capitalization? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dieter talked about some of the actions in terms of protecting the balance sheet, the solvency and the cost of capital relative to the risk we want to take going forward but I think that some of the actions that &#x2013; that you see us taking in these and the costs around &#x2013; capital around equity, but I am going to ask Martin Senn to specifically address the two questions you raised.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Brian, this is Martin Senn again. With regards to the first question on the running yield 4.1% that's about the number. It's probably a bit early in the year to make a good judgment on that how this turns out. I would say though that according to our planning I do not see a substantial change in the running yield we have planned. I think you have to recognize &#x2013; in fact the 4.1 is a bit lower than we expected and I think the bulk of that is due to the fact that rates have come off from the planning period versus the first quarter. But all in, for the rest of the year, I would expect to have a running yield of that number if not higher.</p>
          <p>With regards to the second question, we are not actively selling or have only on a reduced level sold corporate bonds versus government bonds. What we need to clarify is that with the free cash flow to be invested we took a prudent approach and have invested in high quality bonds only. I think that's what Dieter has been referring to. Moving forward as well here we will be flexible and disciplined and adopt our policy to the market and make sure that our balance sheet stays strong.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian maybe if I can add to it, you see that we had some real life losses from sales in bonds, but we have reduced some peak exposure mainly in the category of the Tier 1 bank debt increments. That is what we discussed also in the various meetings in February. And all others as Martin said are organic developments in the portfolio and we are not an active seller of our corporate bond portfolio.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. James Quin, Citigroup. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, three questions please. The first one is on the property casualty investment income which was down 19% in Q1 '09 versus Q1 '08. I'm just wondering if &#x2013; how much of that was currency and essentially whether you would consider that the absolute level of investment income is likely to reduce given the reinvestment in government bonds over the course of this year? The second question is just going back to the claims cost. I was just wondering simply is the 2% rate increase you are getting enough to compensate for higher claims costs, or essentially is &#x2013; would you see that as a net wash between high prices and higher absolute claims costs?</p>
          <p>And thirdly I was just looking at the NAC top line and obviously there has been some impact from lower economic activity. Having said that obviously you've also been out and hired a number of people, some of them from AIG and so ordinarily I suppose we might have expected to see you taking some market share. I mean is it a sense that you think that the market as a whole is down by 14% or is it the case that you are having to contract your top line more quickly as a result of what's happening in the competitive pressures more broadly? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me comment on the NAC top line and then ask John to also come in on that and the claims cost and come back to Dieter on the investment income and I think Dieter probably can give you also a better feel for the currency impact that we've been experiencing as a result of the decline of the British pound in particular.</p>
          <p>So, for sometime we have &#x2013; we said strategically as it relates to Zurich North America and Global Corporate, we would drive that business for margin and not top line growth. And that's what you are seeing reflected here to some extent. In addition I think what you're seeing here is our lead-to-market push on pricing. So our drive there is to get pricing in that business.</p>
          <p>As it relates to head count and the hires that we've had, again we've been upgrading our staff. We've had net staff reductions in Zurich North America and we're seeing a positive market impact from many of the people that we are hiring. A lot of the customers that we're engaging, particularly in the large Global Corporate and Commercial, were coming in as a second line. And some of those as they begin to establish a second relationship with a provider that they perhaps were not working with before. And so I think the shift in market growth that you will see, while most had hoped for and predicted a much more rapid shift in the market. I think we are seeing a more gradual shift and market transfer from some competitors as the buyers are more sophisticated and are looking to establish a relationship, but we are getting more submissions and our hit rate and win rate on submissions is consistently improving. So we feel we are in a very good place as that market trend continues to move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could I just ask you a little bit more on that because if you are getting more submissions and you are winning the same percentage, then I'd have thought your top line would be going up.  I mean obviously that's far too simplistic but do you understand where I am coming from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I understand exactly because I asked the same question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is John Amore again. So let me address the NAC question a little specifically because in NAC we have very significant market positions in a couple of segments that have been not typical for the rest of -- or the general economic condition, and that's in automobile dealers and where we have a very significant and successful business but a big market share in automobile dealerships, which has hurt them in the first quarter in particular.</p>
          <p>And the other big position we have is in construction and homebuilders &#x2013; new homebuilders, which is a business also impacted more than the general economic condition. But we do believe as those adjustments take place in those industries and we are starting now to think that the bottom has been hit in those businesses and is now starting to pick up, we expect that that business and our market share has stayed as strong in those businesses as it has been in the past. So we would expect that to correct.</p>
          <p>But NAC was hit inordinately hard because it had a bigger focus in that. In general, we have seen the exposures submitted by our customers as they renew their business to be down much more in the low-single digit ranges. And that's what we would expect to continue as we &#x2013; once we get through those &#x2013; through industry hits that have gone through the general economy in the U.S.</p>
          <p>You had another question about the loss inflation and whether the pricing is commensurate to that. I think we have a good feeling about that as well because where we've been &#x2013; we gave you a general number of 2% overall for all of GI but where you look at where the increases have been taking place, it generally matches very well where the highest points of loss inflation are. So we think we've got that matched and covered fairly well in the way the business plays out.</p>
          <p>We also of course keep applying our Zurich way disciplines, which also helped combat the ways in which we reduce the losses and fight the loss inflation along with that. So that continues along with the general pricing improvements that are taking place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John.  James it's Dieter here. I think it's a very good question you are raising on the FX impact on the specific line you have asked. About half of the reduction is coming from foreign currency movements. So from the 19 I think 9% is foreign currency movement.</p>
          <p>And if you look at the foreign currency impact overall, in particular when you compare to the previous year, you can actually look back over the last years, about 15% to 20% of our volume from the U.K, so the profit was produced in British pounds.</p>
          <p>And so the reduction of the exchange rate for dollars of 30% that contribution of cost has been 30% lower in value when you look in dollar terms and that's revaluation of the dollar &#x2013; of the pound exchange rate and not being made up so easily by the businesses. That will take some time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and broadly, I mean all other things being equal, would you assume that the P&amp;C investment income might ease off a little bit through the course of this year or do you think it's potentially going to start to plateau all other things being equal in terms of currency obviously?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I had one question on the life business to start with. Basically could you give some indications in terms of the organic growth versus the overall growth and also provide us with some more details about the Spanish acquisition and the consolidation effect of this acquisition in Q1 and how actually the Spanish business is performing?</p>
          <p>And my second question would be with respect to the price increases considering that overall the interest rate level in most markets are down. I would guess your budgeting on investment income going forward should be coming down as well. So how much on top of the price increases that you think in the environment that were not more or less &#x2013; not really kind of adequate? What on top of that, do you think you need to increase prices so that you can maintain your hurdle rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me address the pricing. I mean obviously we're talking about and have been dealing with individual elements on pricing whether it's claims inflation or investment returns and we take all of this into effect in terms of coming up with price increases. We come with our technical price with a gear towards achieving our internal hurdle rate.</p>
          <p>We've got a BOPaT hurdle rate of 16%. That's not the same rate across all lines of businesses. In some we expect a higher rate. So I can assure you the pricing discipline and the lead-to-market that we're implementing right now is to achieve those kinds of rates over the year and long-term and we will maintain that discipline.</p>
          <p>Back to I think it was James Quin's comment earlier about the movement, I mean there is some less disciplined players in the market who are underwritten by government. There's a lot less price discipline in there. And we're just going to have to deal with that.  But I think over time that's value disruption for those kinds of franchises.</p>
          <p>And we see that we've got to maintain our spot in driving lead to market. And I would say we are not alone there. There are a couple of other major insurers that are with us in the same position. So you should come away with a sense of confidence. We're very much aware of the need to make up for lower investment returns, balancing claims or looking at the risks and pricing it so we can achieve our hurdle rate.</p>
          <p>On the life business I am going to turn it over to Mario Greco to respond to the impact of the acquisitions in Spain, the growth that we are getting <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think your question was initially on how much is organic, how much was not. Now two things influence the comparison between 2009 and 2008. One is the acquisitions in Spain, Banco Sabadell and Caixa Sabadell. The other one is the restore effect in Germany, the restore effect in Germany was quite significant in Q1 of last year because it was worth over 40 million APEs a year ago. And the Sabadell, Banco and Caixa acquisitions of course were not there in Q1 2008 and have a positive influence on 2009. So it has a negative APE growth number of minus 43% in this quarter just because they are recovering from the effects of restore. Without restore Germany is flat this year.</p>
          <p>Spain has 190 millions of APEs in this quarter compared with 11 a year ago. Actually we have growth in Spain in all distribution channels because we have growth on tied agents. We have growth on brokers, quite significant although the base numbers are not that relevant as they are in bancassurance. The Caixa Sabadell produced 40 millions, Banco Sabadell, 120. They're both above the plans we had for Q1. So they're still confirming for the second quarter that they are more than reaching the targets of sales that we have given to them.</p>
          <p>The integration has been I would say very positive, very fruitful for us. And we're very pleased with the results &#x2013; is there a question? No and we're very pleased with the results. But by the way we are officially the biggest life company in Spain at the end of Q1. So this confirms that Spain is still progressing very well.</p>

          <p>And Michael it's Dieter here, maybe I should use this opportunity as &#x2013; also to point all of you to a new disclosure we have added to our financial information, you will find a  BOP number before amortization and interest expenses, if you're more inside in how those numbers are developing and if you look under the life settlement you will see that this number pre-amortization is about $40 million higher than post-amortization and this $40 million <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you very much. I was just interested on slide 49 that shows the breakdown of your investment risk exposure, you've been talking about some of the changes you're making so far, how do you expect that pie chart on the right hand side to be changed by the end of the year?</p>
          <p>Do you expect the changes to have a significant impact on your split of risk exposure or are we just taking about marginal changes and within the answer if you could talk a bit about the actual investment changes you are making and whether you envisage any methodology changes to how you are calculating the risk capital for investments, at least to me it stands out as quite interesting that you're down to well under 3% of your investment portfolio in equities, but they're still absorbing a quarter of your calculated risk capital, I mean while you've got 45% of your investments in corporates and MBS and credit in total is only at 38% of your risk capital, so I just wondered if there's any methodology changes as well as asset allocation changes that may occur this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah okay so, it's Dieter, I'll take your questions. We have not done any changes in methodology to our risk-based capital calculations so the comparison between what we presented year end and Q1 now is a perfect one, also what's just changing the underlying mixes and weightings &#x2013; we have always part of our credit exposures also shown in the other categories, so maybe the way we are splitting and presenting the numbers is not a perfect clean cut, it is a more complex story.</p>
          <p>And the billion dollar I have reported as reduction in our RBC, quite a bit of it is coming from the changes which are already being taken and also which we will continue over the next month as this RBC consumption calculation is always a forward looking statement for the whole year.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe we can ask of Martin Senn to give you some of his views on this.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. William just coming back to I think the second part of your question on how forward looking you would see the risk exposure changing particularly against the way we show it here against liabilities and you're making a very important point in saying that while equities' only have 2.8% you see it on the left side in the asset allocation relative to liabilities if there's a weight of 25% that's exactly where we sort of come with our discipline and say we strictly manage asset against liabilities and make sure it's risk adjusted and I think with that it is difficult to argue if you want a balance to drive those risks against liabilities, you say you should have a much higher rate of the quarter, for example forward looking. That's I think one statement.</p>
          <p>The other statement is your point to the credit &#x2013; the way that see credit here at the 38%, I think this number has come off slightly because obviously this is not actively driven by the way but this is very much driven by the changes in credit before the spreads and the weight will be determined on how the underlying markets move, obviously if credit before spread should widen again moving forward, the weight we have against liabilities would increase, so I think we all have the same crystal ball and we shall not get too much into crystal ball gazing, but if anything we are looking at is to continuously try to balance these risk drivers against liabilities predominant not so much on the pure asset &#x2013; we only as you see it on the left side. What we cannot and will not comment on is any potential strategic changes to the asset allocation or any tactical changes to the asset allocation that again is very much dependent on our overall risk &#x2013; risk appetite to investments.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you all very much. This concludes this conference I thank you for calling in as we all know and realize these are very difficult and challenging financial economic times I think that, as I said earlier I think there's still a lot more challenges ahead of us and I don't think we are at the &#x2013; the tipping point in terms of moving towards better days, we prepared ourselves as a company to be able to manage and navigate in these kinds of difficult market environments.</p>
          <p>We will continue to pursue our growth strategies as we've laid out for you. I think there's no real need for us to abandon our strategy, however, we are extremely mindful of the need to protect our balance sheet, most of the discussion and talk that you hear off today is financial strength and liquidity &#x2013; you'll see that we have 157% solvency as Dieter pointed out at the beginning of our discussion. We've improved that in April by three points as a result of the actions that we've taken with respect to capital market actions and the acquisition of 21st century, we have not adopted or made any accounting changes and I've been speaking out about this, I think this is not the time when people should be coming to improve financial fixtures as a result of movements of accounting changes, I think this is a time for maintaining consistency.</p>
          <p>And I'm concerned the impacts of mark-to-market accounting have already been affected and seen, changing mark-to-market accounting does not change the substance or evaluation of principles, I think we have to make sure that regulators and politicians don't get too involved in this and trying to change and clarify the picture on the screen as opposed to helping to improve the substance of the transactions that are below and I am sure that you see that as you go through and analyze in your own cases and try to measure comparability among companies. I apologize that that gets made more difficult for you as people shift the sands of accounting and transparency.</p>
          <p>We also look at this market environment and see enormous opportunities for ourselves and the question is how do we take advantage of those opportunities, the capital and liquidity we have is to protect the shareholders on board, the policy holders and our employees. Any opportunities that we see for potential inorganic growth as we've stated before we will come to the market to capitalize and have the market judge the benefits of those transactions in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Though you can rest assure that we have our hand on the tiller. We are very focused on financial discipline as you can sense from Dieter, we are really looking at all the levers of profitability, analyzing them and making the necessary adjustments. We have more data today than we did five years ago, this is the time this company prepared for, we said that you had to be an organization that can make money in the most difficult of times, not just be part of the rising tide when it was coming in.</p>
          <p>So, we thank you very much for your support, I have to thank also the 60,000 people in this organization who are extremely focused on doing the right thing and keeping our company on the right course.</p>
