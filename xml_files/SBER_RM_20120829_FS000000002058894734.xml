          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Sberbank Q2 2011 IFRS Results Release and Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Anton Karamzin. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everybody. Welcome to our traditional results call. I am asking my colleagues to mute their line, so that there is only me who is heard by the audience please. And we released the results this morning Moscow time. As usual, they are available for you on our website sberbank.ru. And in the Investor Relations section there is a PowerPoint presentation for your convenience of use, and we may refer to some slides of it during our call, so that it is more convenient for you to perceive the information.</p>
          <p>I am speaking to you from a very remote location in the geographical center of Eurasia in Altai. So if for &#x2013; there shouldn't be any communication difficulties, but if just in case I may drop off, you will probably need to be patient with me. It will take me a minute or two to reconnect.</p>
          <p>Now to the contents. We have published condensed interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with our IRFS standards for the first half of 2012. Our net profit for six months ended on June 30 reached RUB175.3 billion, which is RUB8.03 per ordinary share, and it's 0.5 percentage point decrease on the results of the same period the first half of 2011. However, revenues come mostly from core banking operations, which account for 93.2% of total operating income before provision for impairment. And therefore, our operating income before provision increased by 22.7%, as compared to the first of 2011 was driven mainly by growth in net interest income and net fee and commission income.</p>
          <p>Our net interest margin was &#x2013; for the first half of 2012 was 6%. Whilst this is 20 basis points lower than in the first half of 2011, this is still a very stable comparison to the first quarter of this year, and this doesn't change our full year guidance for 2012 on the margin. We see that the repricing of the assets is starting to catch up with effect of the repricing of our liabilities that have taken early effect in the first half of this year, and by the end of this year we will stay within our guidance of net interest margin full year 6.2%, 6.4% range. We may stick to probably medium to lower side of this range, but nevertheless we will be within it.</p>
          <p>Our cost-to-income ratio stays at adequate level of 47.6% versus 44.1% in the first half of 2011. We know that this is a sensitive issue for everyone, but we still assure you that this is under control and we know what we are doing, with most of the increase coming from our continuing investment into the strategy and some of it, of course, comes from the consolidation of the acquisitions that we've completed in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>This, nevertheless, keeps our return on equity quite high at 26.1% for the first half of this year. This was versus outstanding 33.2% in the first half of 2011. Nevertheless, this still keeps us within one of the best ROEs globally. We do continue to see solid retail loan growth, and our overall gross retail loan portfolio has gone up by 29% for the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>Our customer deposits and accounts increased by 10.3%. There is a particular increase of deposit certificates, which compensates on lower deposit growth, but this is a very good product, because being a security it carries less mandatory reserve burdens from the Central Bank and therefore, offers attractive cost of interest for the bank, and attractive &#x2013; at the same time attractive rates for client.</p>
          <p>Our loan quality continues to improve. Our NPL portfolio decreased visibly. There was a somewhat one-off effect within it due to reclassification of one of the larger problem loan transactions. But this problem &#x2013; this is not a problem. This is a problem loan transaction that has been with us for quite a while already, and this reflects just a next stage in our recovery process. The recovery process is planned to be relatively long, and we're just recognizing the legal part of the process by taking over the asset and reclassifying it from loan to the investments. Net effect on bottom line P&amp;L is zero, but there is a certain write-offs that are matched up by the write-ups that need to go through the accounts to appropriately reflect this on the books.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, outside of this particular technical re-class, the quality of our loan book continues to steadily improve. And there is &#x2013; that is coming in all the balance sheet ratios, not only from the fact that our loan book is growing healthily, but equally contributing factor is the fact that we continue to recover the problem loan books in cash or reinstating back to good quality and good performance, as in accordance with our quite aggressive business plans.</p>
          <p>I guess that should probably conclude my &#x2013; the part of my initial remarks that talks about our own results. I'll probably make couple of words on how we see the macro. We do see the sector &#x2013; liquidity for the banking sector remaining quite tough. The level of borrowing from the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance by the overall banking sector remains quite high. Money market rates for three months are 7.15%, six months at 7.35%. So as part of the overall banking community discussion with regulators, Sberbank works closely with the government discussing various options for source funding for the sector.</p>
          <p>And so far we see that despite high volume of borrowings from the authorities, so far the situation remains under control by the Central Bank. However, we do not exclude some continuing pressure on funding costs for all of the system. As compared &#x2013; as relates to Sberbank itself, we do not see this as a big concern for us. We will, all-in-all, be comfortable in maintaining more or less synchronicity between the increase in the pricing of both assets and liabilities and keeping our margins more or less stable.</p>
          <p>We do see some slowdown in the overall macro as the public statistics are published by the government. However, the unemployment rate in the economy continues to be more or less stable, if at least if a little bit of improving. And net disposable income of the retail consumer has continued its growth in annualized terms. Therefore, we see that there is no risk as yet of any overheating in retail credit quality. There is bit of a warm up as we see, but nevertheless it is far from concerns &#x2013; any serious concern by us.</p>
          <p>The reason is not only that the real net disposable income is growing, but also when we studied in the second quarter the data of on the banking sector of how much is the monthly payment on average as compared to monthly disposable &#x2013; the total monthly income for the average retail borrower, it remains well within 50%. So we don't see any triggers for any kind of shift, meaningful shift in the retail credit quality. Nevertheless, we monitor the situation and see how things are going.</p>
          <p>In the corporate side of the loan quality, again, for almost a year all of us have been asking &#x2013; all of you have been asking us, do we see any early sign in real material, potential for deterioration in the credit quality in the corporate. We do remain very much watchful, but we don't see yet any material signs that may lead to trend that will be significantly visible.</p>
          <p>I guess, that's to probably conclude my opening remarks, and I would like to open it for your questions. We should have just under hour and half to complete this. Hopefully, as per normal, this is enough to cover most of the concerns. And if we don't get all of them answered, we will remain available offline for all individual questions through normal channels of our Investor Relations functions. So I am welcoming your questions. Thank you very much.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We take our first question today from Alex Kantarovich of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Anton, could you please provide us some color on operating costs. Obviously, you might have heard such concerns. I look at the first half and OpEx is up 24% year-on-year, which perhaps means upside to your guidance of 20%. And if you can remind us if there was any sort of acquisitions discounted in your guidance. Obviously, it's not the only element in the equation, but still it would require better everything else sort of to keep things equal. That will be my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there is two components in the cost growth. One is acquisition; the other is continuing investment into the core business. Of course, back at the end of last year when we were looking at the acquisitions, not all of the information was available to us in terms of the scale and the exact numbers that we're going to be consolidating. And then the pace of continuing operating &#x2013; operation spending that the newly acquired businesses are going to be taking after the acquisition. So there, of course, some rounding differences that are coming.</p>
          <p>I would rather encourage you to focus on comparing consecutive quarters or six months period of our cost growth to see the trends and dynamics. And if you compare the first half of this year with the second half of last year, I guess the growth is only kind of 6%. And you also remember that first half of &#x2013; the first half of 2011 and the second half of 2012 did have some kind of one-off effects that have discontinued. You remember, we were completing our staff pay review and catch-up to the market back in the tail end of 2011, so those things are distorting it.</p>
          <p>I'd say we are moderating the growth in the cost to the pace that we have guided on the previous quarterly call. I wouldn't necessarily say that, yes, it is going to be the guidance of precisely 20% year-on-year nominal growth. As I've mentioned on the last quarter's call, it's kind of around 20%, maybe bit less and maybe little bit more. So we don't yet fixated on those percentages, because now the way we manage the investment in the core business and the strategy and the transformation is as proportionate to ensuring the quality and the quickest return in terms of increasing efficiency or increasing the top line and then the sales.</p>
          <p>Therefore, things like investment in the branch network, for example, we are moving on target. We've reset the number of branches being reformatted or relocated. And therefore, well, the seasonality in that schedule accelerated a little bit closer to the year end. But we, for example, for this part of the spend, are seeing the efficiencies and the sales improvement factors pretty much immediately once a particular branch is completed, and then reopening its doors to the public. So some of that investment that we accelerate. For example, we do see much sooner improvements in the overall bottom line, be that from increased sales or improved efficiency.</p>
          <p>And some other investments, like IT platforms, as we were discussing on previous calls, we may make certain significant investment into things like data centers, et cetera. But the efficiencies are going to be filtering through only as they not only become fully operational, but as and when we are able to start cutting off the older parts of the infrastructure and stop spending money on them. And, for example, in case of large scale IT architecture consolidation, that process has prolonged for the horizon of two, three years, as I was mentioning before.</p>
          <p>So what my point is, we may and we actually are sometimes taking decisions to accelerate certain spending, but on things that are getting us quicker returns in terms of the top line or sales or efficiencies, and that relates mostly to branch network. That is where &#x2013; it makes sense to do those things, and that is where we are saying, so you please keep with us in terms of our attitude to this. We don't get excited on an extra percentage point or two in the face of nominal growth, of course. But focused on cost/income ratio being still very efficient and making sure that we are using this time while to continuing to make wise investments that will be contributing to the top line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Anton, would you tell us this cost-to-income target well before us and maybe remind us your plans in terms of cost-to-income for the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For this year, we were saying, again, probably mid to high-ish 40s. We also &#x2013; I will confirm the guidance we were giving before that this kind of spending years 2012 and 2013, and then 2014 is going to be on a slowdown pace in terms of the nominal cost growth. So we are still sticking with that guidance as long as -</p>
          <p>In the grand scheme of things, if you look at the rating of &#x2013; The Banker magazine published, I think, five or six weeks ago its annual Top 1000 bank rankings, and they rank banks, as we all know, by Tier 1 capital and we are within the top 50 banks, top by Tier 1 capital in the world. Within there, we are number one by ROA and ROE, but more importantly in relation to this question we are number seven by cost/income ratio. So we're pretty decent there. And we see that as long as a modern, very big, large scale geographically bank is keeping its cost/income ratio below 50, and at the same time manages to be in the very active and intensive investment and transformation mode, this is still very healthy approach and it's wisely using the opportunity to position oneself to be much more competitive and dynamic on the horizon of next five years than anyone else who cannot afford to be quite efficient cost/income ratio, and at that same time invest into its turnaround.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Clear on that. Thank you. My second question is on capital adequacy. We notice that Tier 1 ratio declined. I presume there was a significant effect from dividends. But with Deniz acquisition still ahead, what do you see as a minimal level the &#x2013; how do you think it will develop in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will just reconfirm that our soft internal comfortable limit is to try not to get below 10.5%, which is still &#x2013; is quite healthy capital adequacy ratio Q1 basis. But I'm not seeing Deniz acquisition bringing us very close to that. If you calculated in kind of nominal terms, it may be, but look no one takes away the pace at which we generate new capital every single month. Therefore, we are pretty comfortable about not approaching it to close for anyone liking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fair. And last question is, how do you see rates developing from September till the end of the year on loans and deposits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do see the pressure, the upward pressure on rates both in assets and liabilities for the banking sector overall. To certain extent for Sberbank as such <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:04) comfortable, again, that in terms of -- not on a like quarter to quarter basis, but on longer periods of time like six months and longer we will be much more comfortable than any participant in the banking sector to keep synchronicity between the repricing of assets and liabilities, and therefore keeping our margin stable in that situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We take our next question today from Dmitry Trembovolsky of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Anton. Well, I probably have to just follow-up quickly on what Alex was saying, because I don't think there are many other issues with the exception of the two that you covered. I just wanted to ask you, look, on the cost growth, I think we discussed it a number of times, and I mean &#x2013; I think the main issue we had previously was the fact &#x2013; is not even that the costs were growing so fast, but the kind of notorious guidance revisions that we constantly were getting with this line. And so I just wanted to check with you, because when I am looking at these numbers, I mean, clearly the cost growth over the last five quarters has been 30%. Starting from the second quarter 2011, every single quarter we had a 30% year-over-year growth. And yes, first half versus the second half of 2011 was just 6%, but if you look at the seasonality of 2011 or 2012, the second half has always been more cost than the first half, clearly because of the fourth quarter where you accrue bonuses and there is more marketing and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>So again, coming to the guidance question, I mean, 20%, 21%, 22%, I don't think like people will really be that much disappointed. But it clearly implies right now the range of 25% to 30%. That is what I think anyone who would not ask the company about the guidance would be tempted to put in the model. So I'm asking you here, how comfortable are you with the 20% figure that you've given us in the first quarter? And I think if you guys have doubts on that number, it is better to discuss this in the second quarter rather than at the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me address it this way. The reason why I have given remarks on cost like the ones that I have given a bit earlier is that, any increase about nominal growth of 20% per annum that we are going to be doing, we're going to be target to areas which give much quicker returns in terms of compensating revenue growth or efficiency extraction from the process and technology.</p>
          <p>And therefore, let me put it &#x2013; let me give some feedback from you in this call. How comfortable would you be if we were to go to, say &#x2013; let's pick a number, I don't know &#x2013; 25% nominal growth full year this year, which is referring to the data that you just mentioned is still lower than 25%, 30% growth that we've been showing. While still keeping our cost/income ratio within the ranges that I've mentioned before, that are quite comfortable, would it be a very big problem for the investors if they see &#x2013; still see that we keep doing it efficiently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you want my opinion, I think it will not be &#x2013; in case of two kind of conditions. First, there has to be core income, i.e., we're not talking about like other trading, FX, these kind of things which we cannot really forecast. We are talking NII or fees. Second, I think people need to understand that this is a sustainable increase, i.e., we can put this in the model and we could use it as a base for the future increase. And just to give you an example, you can accelerate volume growth, but then you can have your margins suffering along with it and still your costs will be going up.</p>
          <p>So from the modeling perspective, or from the forward-looking earnings perspective, I'll have to put higher growth most likely because the base is higher to which I'm applying the nominal increase. But then my revenue growth will not be high, despite the fact that you showed a good increase in volumes, because your margins are suffering or your profitability on the fee is suffering, and hence the revenue are not growing as much as the cost.</p>
          <p>So if you are able to show 25% cost growth, along with that you can show 25% or like 30% revenue growth, and you can kind of &#x2013; we can be sure that we can extrapolate this in 2013 and 2014. I don't think people will have a particular problem with that. Having said this, you are not increasing your revenue guidance, right? You haven't told us that there will be bigger loan growth or whatever margins; everything is about the same, it's only cost that we're discussing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I've mentioned in the opening remarks that core revenues, we have shown pretty strong growth in the first half of this year over &#x2013; what was the number that I said &#x2013; here we go -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:45) where we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>20 &#x2013; just one sec &#x2013; it is breaking up, sorry. If &#x2013; because there were deferred tax assets -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>24%, Anton. It's 24% on our number, that NII plus fees, if this is what you were referring to year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>24%, so look, we are showing core revenue growth from the main business, A. B, we stick to our words on stability of the margins, whilst we are still showing very healthy loan growth. We are showing anywhere between 15% and 24% fees and commission growth pretty much every quarter. So we do not only guide for this, for the stability of these things, but we also demonstrate this sustainably six months after six months, quarter after quarter. So the conditions are met.</p>
          <p>I suggest I wasn't going to go out and say, oh, the guidance is 25%. But if you are putting this view in this particular way, then I'm very much tempted to propose to analyst and investor community to say, okay, we'd rather give you positive surprises later on if you see all the conditions are met on the revenue side and the volume growth side. Let's have it in your model the 25% nominal cost growth, it will not be out of pace. Some of you might want to still stick it within 30%, that's fine. If we're sticking to our cost/income ratio outlooks and we are and volume and stability of margins, it's fine to have. If we beat it, let it be a positive surprise a bit later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But how comfortable are you with even the cost/income thing, because as we discussed, right, we had 24% increase in core revenues, we had 30% increase in cost. So this is what is called &#x2013; in our world this is called the negative jaws. So I guess the problem here is that you are moving from 42% cost/income in 2010 to 48% in 2011 and now to 50%. And your fourth quarter is always very bad in terms of cost/income just for the reasons that I have mentioned, like the seasonality. So the thing is that I'm not sure you can -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fourth quarter is also very good on revenues due to the same seasonality. This is just a way the whole &#x2013; this whole country lives, both the government, the corporate world and the consumers. They just spend and consume and earn much more money in the third and the fourth quarter &#x2013; well, actually much more in fourth quarter than in any other quarter. So we are comfortable. There may be negativity or positivity in the jaws, like quarter-on-quarter or six months-on-six months. But on &#x2013; if you ask me about the longer-term horizon like a year or two or three, we are pretty comfortable with stability of the jaws or kind of keeping them in parallel more or less.</p>
          <p>We do see positive effect of our investments in terms of efficiency. Our investments in terms of growth in revenues, our introduction of new products and fees and commissions, and the change in the mix of assets, higher earning interest and lower risk assets contributing as a positive factor that would have said any kind of investments that we continue to do or even sometimes accelerate or any kind of negative margin pressure that comes from the rate environment. This mix that we've been looking has pretty much been there plus or minus in the past two, three years. And we &#x2013; there have been quarters where we have been showing ROEs of 33%. There have been quarters where we have been showing ROEs of 25% overall. So &#x2013; and, yes, there is some volatility, but the overall mix doesn't cause us any discomfort in terms of longer term keeping our strategic promise to our investors.</p>
          <p>And we &#x2013; as we always said, look, there will be volatility quarter-on-quarter on provisions, on cost, on some of the seasonality things, election cycle. We've all gone through this together in the third &#x2013; in the fourth and the first quarter, and you remember we dissected it on our previous calls showing how it impacts the monetary supply in the economy, how Sberbank profited from certain things, how we were catching up a bit later on some of the other things in pricing, and all of these things. And once we were going through this, we've all seen the logic, we all have been able to pretty calmly observe this, and we are all in this mix of &#x2013; in the soup of multitude of factors. I don't see longer term any discomfort that we will &#x2013; we could possibly disappointed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me also quickly switch to, let's say, more favorable or more pleasant topics. I mean, your retail loan growth, if I look at year-over-year numbers have been over 50% in first half. And I think you could &#x2013; presented in the presentation that we saw, I mean, it says 29%, but if you just look first half 2012 versus first half 2011 it's like 50%. It's actually a very, very solid number, and that's ahead of the sector. Do you think this is something which you can sustain in the second half, or that has to moderate maybe to 40% or whatever? Because the numbers are very, very strong at the moment. And how you feel about that?</p>
          <p>And also do you &#x2013; when you &#x2013; in conjunction to that, have you had to cut rates? I mean, I think you were raising the retail rates both on consumer and mortgages. So I presume this growth is not a function of lower asset yields, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we were repricing the retail loans already twice this year, and the whole sector is talking &#x2013; I'm not giving our own guidance, but these &#x2013; the whole sector is talking about retail credit being probably bit more expensive for the consumer going forward. But we do not &#x2013; as I mentioned in the opening results, we can see a little bit of a warm-up there. So in the retail credit demand, for example, mild things. For example, the seasonal troughs, like summer, when normally the number of consumer loan applications and mortgage loan applications decrease because of holidays, et cetera. This season we haven't seen that. They've remained stable.</p>
          <p>So what we have done &#x2013; just to give you some color in terms of perception, what we have done, we said we're gradually increasing the sophistication in the way we price the retail loans. And we were the first consumer bank to actually in the grand scheme of things to introduce risk-based pricing for individual consumers, what were on very same retail product we priced it differently in three to five different categories depending on the quality of the individual borrower and the type of the scoring model applicable to individual borrower.</p>
          <p>So having done this, we have said, okay, there is little bit of warm-up going on. It's still very far from anything that one could imagine being a bubble. Let's go into little bit of quality and price little bit more conservatively. What that has, of course, is that we've improved the expected losses, and therefore the profitability of the product, whilst we still didn't in any material way impact the approval rate on the loan applications, like that quality increase that significantly moves our expected losses into lower category has only resulted in 1 percentage point decrease in approval rate, which is quite high that we already have. We approved around 60%, 70% applications, whilst the market on average is somewhere between 45% and 55% only, whilst we show losses in NPLs much lower than the rest of the market.</p>
          <p>So this type of sophistication allows us to do these things, going into better quality and still not suffering on the volume of loans that we are getting. So this is just the mild type of things that are saying, okay, some other people are running out of money in the banking sector, so a bit more client flow goes to us. And without facing any adverse selection, we can improve the quality and still keep the volume and can get the profitability higher. So that's the type of the environment and logic of thinking within which we are now operating. So &#x2013; it's mainly that for the full year, as you say, there may not necessarily be like 50% growth. It is probably still going to be like 35%, 40% overall, or maybe a bit higher. But for us it is a very comfortable situation, where our margins are healthy, our credit quality is improving, and our volumes are continuing to grow stably.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Okay. Thanks, Anton. Just one technical also. Your tax rate this quarter was 26%. Is &#x2013; that has to be a one-off. I'm not sure if it's related to the write-offs you've done, but if you have any quick comment here would be helpful. And then, does it have to normalize in the next quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It is a one-off. We have actually said to ourselves &#x2013; it's due to these reclassifications that don't really do any net P&amp;L impact, but we said to ourselves let's stay on the conservative side. We kind of derecognized the tax assets, and we may actually have a very strong basis to recognize it back on the horizon anywhere between the nearest six months or 48 months, or maybe to the tune of like two, three years, maybe four. Because of a little bit of that uncertainty in terms of timing, we said, well, let's derecognize the assets, let's pay a little bit more taxes now, let it be a better surprise later on, because God knows we &#x2013; I don't know, whether we may need it or not, but let's be conservative. We are saying to ourselves &#x2013; this would be consistent with the way we approach all of our things in terms of financials, being conservative, and that's what we've done.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Okay. And the very final one is just under &#x2013; <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:12) as far as I understand, this is strategic session there. I mean, when do you think you will be able to share with us the kind of takeaways from this brainstorming that you are going to be doing? Is it by yearend or you think it's like a longer work that you would be expecting? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is the early stage. I'm sticking to the guidance that I've given you on all the last calls that, we're just in a middle of the process, closer to the end of this year that we're going to be starting to give out first nuggets of the information and we will publish this probably early &#x2013; maybe in the first quarter or maybe &#x2013; I don't know, probably somewhere around first quarter of next year.</p>
          <p>But we've &#x2013; as I mentioned also, we are looking at it in two horizons. Unlike the previous set of strategic goals that we are setting ourselves for five years, we will be coming up with two horizons both five and ten-year horizon. Regardless of the fact that this world is very much fast changing. Even if you compare it to three, five years ago, the pace has changed, especially in the banking sector; has accelerated. So it's more difficult to see on the longer horizon. Nevertheless, we found that unless a big institution like ours does this, you are not going to be &#x2013; you are running too big a risk of not being competitive enough in the long term. So we're going to be coming with the two-horizon strategy of five and ten years, which we'll be then communicating to the world.</p>

          <p>We take our next question from Olga Veselova of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have several questions. One is, if you could just tell us a little bit more about this problem loan on which you recovered provisions in the second quarter, how well it was provisioned? What was the provision coverage, and what was the size of this loan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was more than adequately provisioned. Net-net, there isn't really much of a financial impact &#x2013; there isn't any financial result bottom line from us just recognizing in the accounting the changes in the technical legal status of this asset on our books. I don't think this asset in terms of any meaning for you as an investor has changed any &#x2013; in terms of the substance and probability of recovery and the rate of recovery has changed anything. It has been more than adequately provided.</p>
          <p>Our horizon of recovery is a few years. We are actively managing this asset ourselves for quite a while now. And there hasn't been any big change of plans, and we are very much on track to recover this within the horizon of next year. I don't think it deserves much more details at this point. This is really more technical and legal and accounting &#x2013; not even adjustment &#x2013; a reclassification than any meaningful financial move, so not really means on this side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Let me put it another way. If we disregard this one problem loan, would you say that NPL declined or increased in absolute terms in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I have mentioned in my opening remarks, if you remove &#x2013; if you ignore this one large transaction, we still have improved our NPL absolute size and ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolute size as well. Okay. Thank you. Then my other question is about the employees, number of employees in the bank. I notice there was a material decline of number of personnel in the second quarter. I understand that part of it was the deconsolidation of GOTEK. If you can tell us what was the decline or increase of personnel in Sberbank itself quarter-over-quarter, and if the bank has now plan to decline personnel for the full year and by how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the second part is the bank was -- what was the second part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If the bank has plan &#x2013; if the bank has target on reduction of number of personnel for the full year this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the core head count, it has remained flat. We have consolidated &#x2013; yes, there is a page actually on this <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:23) &#x2013; yeah, page 17 on the presentation. It has remained pretty much flat, in fact, even reduced a little bit. But we have been consolidating certain new subs, of course, due to acquisitions, but we are also deconsolidating due to the sell-off to large-ish, in terms of head count, companies like GOTEK, which is the carton producer, and GSU, which is the development and construction company. So &#x2013; but the core numbers have remained flat.</p>
          <p>In terms of our plan going forward, I'll just repeat what we've always said: that we manage two streams differently. One is growth of head count that's associated with growth in top line revenues, i.e., new products and growing ability to process and sell &#x2013; sell and process, the growth of the core business. That continues and there we obviously acquire &#x2013; continue to acquire head count as needed to process the business. And separately, efficiency introductions that lead to decrease in head count cut due to our technology and strategy implementation.</p>
          <p>And there on the head count cuts, certain divisions we continue to cut in support functions, like the base of 5%, 10%, sometimes 12% head count reduction pyramid. What that blend comes to net-net, overall head count movement, we don't really target because it doesn't make sense. As long as you do manage the most efficient way the two components individually, the rest is less important; you automatically get financially efficient. So there is no more for two years now. There is no more overall absolute head count target that we manage to. There is two head count targets, how much reduced due to efficiency and how much we grow in proportion to how much new &#x2013; more new business we generate, and of course there has been M&amp;A effect on this horizon in the past year that you have to take into the account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. So this slide is actually the reason for my question. There were two quarters of decline of personnel, which is one small detail, which can be at least welcome to the cost side. But I hear you point that it's not a targeted decline <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:03). My other -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is relevant when you just for the first year two or three when you start attacking below the head count and cost base, which was what we've been doing in 2008, 2009 and 2010. But beyond that, you really need to be managing in a bit more sophisticated fashion, so that overall target has been removed after the first three years when we've done pretty radical cuts of about 40,000 staff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I see. My other question is about interest rates, about the recent changes, actually of interest rates. I noticed there were several increases of interest rates on corporate product in July and in August, and of course we can only see in media sources that there were &#x2013; you said that they declined, but not the magnitude. If you could tell us by how much your &#x2013; on average increased your interest rates on corporate products that would help us to understand your margin outlook for the second half of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't see how I practically can, because in corporate all the rates are individually priced, so &#x2013; and the product is different, how you can blend or even weighted average. It's on 2.2 million, or maybe I think 2.5 million of corporate clients that we have, which includes everything from Rosnet and Gazprom and Lukoil on one side and, for example, Russian Federation bonds that we have in our securities portfolio on one side. And on the other side a small pig farmer in the village or it is a shop owner in a little town that borrows $50,000 loan from us. I just can't see how I can answer the question.</p>
          <p>What we have been rationally saying to everyone, that corporate loans repricing has been steadily going up since the beginning of this year, and this trend actually continues and it will be filtering through P&amp;L continuously over the end of this year and beyond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. But you do confirm that there were increases in July and in August, ongoing increase of interest rate on corporate products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>You do confirm that there were increases of interest rates on corporate products in July and in August, is this -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And there will be continuing increases in September pretty much through the end of the year. As I mentioned again in my opening remarks, we do see upward pressure on all the rates in the system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Very good. And my last question is about renegotiated loans. Were there any big ticket loans or maybe one-offs or reclassification, which explain &#x2013; can explain to us a material decline of renegotiated loans quarter-over-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really, not this quarter. You remember every once in a while we mentioned this number where there would have been things going through, but no, not this time</p>

          <p>We take our next question today from Mikhail Shlemov of VTB Capital. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening. A couple of questions from me. The first one actually is coming from the net interest margin and in you are citing that your net interest margin outlook remains the same, close to the lower end of the 6.2% to 6.4 % range. Given that the margin has been just 6% during the first half according to your calculation, where do you see this 40 basis points increase in the margin coming from in the second half of this year? That would be the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's repricing on the asset side and change of the mix in the asset side in favor of more &#x2013; of high yielding and lower risk products that we do see catching up in the second half of this year, with some early effect of repricing also on the liability side that we've seen in the first half of this year. That's the structural trend that we do see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also touching this yields on the corporate side, I have noticed that the yields on the corporate loans were up by some 40 basis points in the second quarter. Do you see any more room to go there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just like judging on the historical perception that your rollout of the loans and repricing has been used to be somewhat slow &#x2013; rather slow process. The question I have &#x2013; the question basically I am asking, don't you see a risk that your margin would be recovering in much slower pace than you anticipated, particularly given the pressure which is obviously coming from retail deposit side and cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. We do take into the account any experience that we've learned in terms of the pace of repricing of corporate assets in the period of between 2008 and 2009. So we are confident that we could keep the margin stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my second question comes on this one-off loan related to the recovery, which you're making. When I'm looking through the disclosure in the note seven related to the changes in the provisioning, I see quite a bigger release of something like RUB23 billion related to the specialized loans to legal entities. Can you confirm that this RUB23 billion release relates to the recognition &#x2013; or partial release of a provision to loan which used to be on the books related to this particular citation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a meaningful part of that is &#x2013; sorry, my colleague just corrected me a little bit. Sorry, I'm confusing two different parts. On this line actually specifically, it's &#x2013; there is no one-off thing. This is more or less regular items that we have. There is maybe one or two largish, but not particularly large items where we're having effect. But overall it's pretty homogenous to lot of regular corporate transactions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The reason I'm asking because we were not seeing this kind of recovery in the first quarter or any coming quarters, because the number seems quite huge. Maybe you could break out this RUB23 billion number into what part we should think about a sustainable one for at least for the next couple of quarters, since you would definitely have the stability on the recovery procedures, and the part which we should treat as one-off trying just like to get a sense of your normalized cost of risk in Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, that would require me going into the details on individual transactions, which I don't think is appropriate here. Again, I probably refer &#x2013; you're asking me to do the things that we have been asking you not to do, the provisioning release and accrual process, we call-in, call-out from every quarterly call, I really just repeat this is a very lumpy and unpredictable process. And averaging and smoothing it out in terms of your models only works on the horizons of much longer than six months. So there is no point of defactoring and dissecting any particular quarter number to try and rationalize out of it what is going to be the pace. It would be wrong for us to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The problem is basically it simply coming from the fact that this time this number is quite lumpy. Okay, anyway. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Look, this &#x2013; any quarter could be lumpy in both directions plus or minus. We've always been warning for last three, four years consistently about this, so this just continues to be another proof of the fact that this is what's going on.</p>

          <p>We take our next question from Svetlana Kovalskaya of Renaissance. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Anton. Just couple of follow-up questions from me. First of all on your new plans, so yes, I understand your guidance for the full year it remains intact, 6.2% to 6.4%. However, do you think will you already see some recovery as early as Q3 on a quarter-on-quarter basis?</p>
          <p>And second question could be, you mentioned that you are seeing not by any means a bubble, but a kind of warm-up in terms of retail loan quality. Could you just elaborate a bit as in what do you mean by warm-up, what kind of indicators are you looking at, and what are they showing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd just reiterate. Most people are &#x2013; the way the questions have always been put to us in the past few months is, do you see any overheat in the retail loan demand that may result subsequently in the problems with retail loan quality. And if we start gauging this in temperature terms, how far are we from overheat, that may subsequently mean there could be a bubble, but we are very far.</p>
          <p>And on this temperature gauge I would say if, say, last year was pretty cool, then now it's just a little bit warmer. The reason why we are only saying it's just a little bit is because of &#x2013; and nothing more than that &#x2013; is because of the factors that I've already mentioned on this call, is that monthly payout on the loans on average we've analyzed the data of all credit bureaus in this country, one of the top three biggest ones we own, but we cooperate with all of them in the market. And the monthly payout on the loan as compared to monthly income of average borrower is way below 50%.</p>
          <p>Normally, overheats and bubbles in retail happen when this parameter gets much higher than 50%, but this is not the case. And again, our NPL levels in retail, all of the banking sector's NPL levels in retail and overall offers that we see are still way, way, way below from &#x2013; away from anything one could call an overheat or any potential for any bubble in the future. And we also monitor how much of our loan growth comes from continuing penetration in the banking sector, i.e., new loans for people that may have not taken a loan before, or who have been borrowed before which is much more of a case, have been borrowed before, but they've repaid all their loans and they are just &#x2013; after certain pause they are kind of taking new one and how much of loan burden they carry. So it's &#x2013; most of the growth is coming from there. It's not individuals increasing their leverage from existing levels to much higher level. This is not what is going within the consumer universe. So we see that the consumer is still heavily under-leveraged overall.</p>

          <p>We take our next question from Jason Hurwitz of Alpha Bank. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I have two questions. I'll just say them both right away. The first one, could you please provide a little bit more color on the decline in the renegotiated loans? There was a question earlier on it, but I didn't really get any understanding of how you went down by so much in one quarter.</p>
          <p>And the second question is, given the declines in capital adequacy, in particular on the domestic side down to 13.1% as of the end of July, what options might you be considering in terms of supporting your regulatory capital level, subordinated debt share capital or even just moderating your loan growth, what are you thinking? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We sense &#x2013; on the second one, we sense that our revenue generating capacity is going to be sufficiently &#x2013; or wouldn't need much of a worry or possibly any at all of &#x2013; in the near future definitely of anything else to continue keeping the capital adequacy at sufficient levels.</p>
          <p>The first &#x2013; and renegotiated loans, again, this is where the loans would have been falling back into the regular category after showing &#x2013; having been renegotiated, but showing very much stable performance in servicing. And therefore, <mark type="ph" /> relocked (1:03:12) into the regular type of a loan that just becomes not renegotiated. There are certain formal accounting requirements under IFRS that require you to trigger the classifications one way or another, depending on how longer you've renegotiated them and how well they have been performing.</p>
          <p>Again, as we've discussed number of times on the previous quarter's calls, the way renegotiated loans are accounted for that whenever you change the terms, regardless of which way credit quality goes, whether you change the terms of the loan because the credit risk might be increasing or you change the terms where the credit quality of a particular borrower might be improving, like reducing the rate or keeping lower collateralization level or changing the tenure of the loan, whichever way you go, good or bad, this triggers accounting as a renegotiated. And it gets off of this line when it's &#x2013; after formally meets certain conditions, including the timing since it was renegotiated. Or maybe sometimes things get refinanced, and therefore they're not necessarily &#x2013; or refinanced not like immediately, but after a certain period of time, for example, that is where changes may be showing in this line.</p>
          <p>So it's a little bit of a lengthy process, yes, but seamless of provisioning. But we've always been warning the users of our financial statements that we're bit of a special case, and material changes in renegotiated loans account in any kind of way should not be, as a rule of thumb, viewed as a sign of any particular deterioration in the credit quality, because, in our case, it's not really that straight forward. We have been seeing consistently this item growing on the way out of the crisis when we were improving the quality of the loan portfolio and changing the terms to reflect that, freeing out some collateral for borrowers, changing the rates, et cetera. So dynamic in this account is not necessarily straight forward one direction indication that something goes wrong. It also equally still means that you could be going in the positive direction, which has been the case for the past like couple of years, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It seems to have actually improved quite a bit in this period, at least if you read the positive direction as an improvement. Was there any kind of big repayments, or is this just more like reclassifications <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:06:15) you were saying?</p>

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the details my colleagues in Moscow have provided me that there's been a little bit of a nuance there. Some of the new consolidations that we've done from the acquisitions of the new subsidiaries, when those companies have started applying our own accounting policy, transferring from their original one to our own Group policy, they have gone a little bit too conservative, and marking up things as renegotiated where they actually shouldn't have been marked as renegotiated. And following the first two months of review that we've done we said, guys, you don't need to be that conservative, nothing has changed in these transactions.</p>
          <p>So part of this number, not a very big one, but probably worth to mention, relates to the fact that we've gone back to our subsidiaries and said, guys, well, look, we've looked at this, this isn't really renegotiated. And the correction is applied to mostly the first quarter of &#x2013; the things that happened in the first quarter of 2012. But that, again, just to give you a little more color, this is not like majority of this number. There's some portion just worth to mention. Okay, we can start taking next questions.</p>

          <p>Hi, Anton. Just one question from me. I notice that your share of FX deposits have gone up quarter-on-quarter by about 3.5 percentage points to 22%. Can we view this as a strategic decision and should we expect this trend to continue? Or if not, some color on this would be great. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is &#x2013; there is no kind of strategic decisions. It just reflects a slight change in the demand structure from both the retail and corporate deposit. There is on the corporate side that relates to just normal activities of most of our clients that are exporters. And on the retail side, this is just regular ways of mood from the consumer, sometimes they flow a little bit more into the currency, sometimes they flow little bit more into the ruble. Russian consumers especially in retail favor, especially in the urban areas, are quite sophisticated in the matters of currency as compared to some other &#x2013; public and some other banking sectors. But this sophistication brings much more calm approach to things, and therefore you see those rates, but they are not particularly sharp. So we don't see in those changes any kind of trend forming things or anything that will cause a material concern directionally.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Stanislav Ponomarenko of Barclays. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Your finance structure changed tremendously over the last 12 months and during the first half this year. So the question is, should we expect similar changes going forward? Or say, more specific question, should we expect similar bond market activity that we saw in the first half this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If your question relates, Stanislav, to the fact that we've been issuing a little bit more actively on the international bond markets in the first half of the year than in the previous quarters and years, then, yes, we have replenished our foreign currency sources of funding a little bit more actively to reflect the seasonality and some of the &#x2013; somewhat increased demand for foreign currency from our corporate borrowers. We don't really see this as an accelerating trend. We were just using the favorable windows in terms of pricing to access the markets, because as compared to other sources of ruble and currency funding that we had, those opportunities appear to be attractive. And again, because the debt investors like us very much, we were using those opportunities to borrow at very attractive rates as compared to the rest of the market.</p>
          <p>So these are the two reasons, the pricing opportunities were good and some of the demand from the corporate borrowers was asking for it. We see that coming down a little bit. We don't see this as a start of any big trend. This is just regular fluctuations related to seasonality and favorable market conditions, I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And in terms of, say, financing from the Central Bank, do you see a further potential to increase this &#x2013; to utilize this source of funding and to what extent? So what would be the maximum level of comfort for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, the proportions of this funding for us are not really driven by any particular target from the balance sheet structure that we set for ourselves. This is similar to access to the international financing market, our use of Central Bank or Ministry of Finance money from the deposit auctions, the repo markets and various other instruments that the offer is driven by pricing considerations. We have always been and remain the price chooser. It's not really any kind of primary liquidity or volume driven concern for us.</p>
          <p>I am not saying that, of course, we're totally insensitive to the volume because, yes, the liquidity in the overall sector and globally is kind of a scarce resource, but still pricing for us is the main driver. If we were borrowing from the Central Bank and then various other regulatory instruments at the point in time when we particularly saw the pricing there was more efficient than in most of the other sources.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far we are targeting to be relatively quick with that, because the structure of the deal that we have with the seller incentivizes us financially quite meaningfully for that. However, it may happen either in the quarter three or quarter four. And, let's say, the last thing to do in this type of things is to get into rush on the later stages of your deal and your transaction closing process. Therefore, we're not giving more specific guidance. We would rather be very prudent and quick, but not at the cost of being prudent, so either third or fourth quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick final perhaps. In the specialized loans to legal entities, is the loan growth in Q2 affected by the write-off that you made? I'm just curious as to see sort of what the underlying dynamics are in that part of the business. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah. There was a little bit of an impact from derecognizing a loan, the specialized loan related to the problem assets, and then reclassifying it into an investment. But overall if you strip this, there isn't really much unusual going on in that particularly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is &#x2013; I mean, should we expect perhaps slightly higher growth going forward than we've seen in the first sort of two quarters, or do you think what you've been seeing over &#x2013; just to understand the cyclical trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't &#x2013; maybe this is a logical assumption to make. However, I would be cautious there, because this type of loans, which is basically in terms of classification that we have, is anything other than plain vanilla working capital short to medium term loan. This process is also little bit lumpy and it's also quite seasonal. Most of them do happen to be issued in the second half of the year rather than in the first half of the year due to the seasonal &#x2013; normal seasonality. So it's a bit of a lumpy process, likely to keep it up, but then we'll see how the quality of the growth and the credit risk on the macro level is going on and how is liquidity &#x2013; long-term liquidity availability is stacking up for both the economy and the banking sector.</p>

But, Bob, thank you, you can ask your question now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Anton. I have a question regarding your subsidiaries and acquisitions. I am a little bit worried about the profitability of your acquisitions. They seem to be bringing a lot of costs, but not a lot of profits. So could you give an indication of how much of the profits were coming from subsidiaries in the second quarter of 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far not much, but look, most of them &#x2013; I am talking VBI, of course, have only just been consolidated and also are in the regions where profitability itself is not at a particular peak level. So let us start jointly rationalizing that in the &#x2013; on the horizon of the next two, three quarters. So far, I don't think it's time to start building up trends from the results of just consolidating the quarter and half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And later this year you plan to complete the Deniz acquisition that will probably bring the &#x2013; on the cost sides the contribution of subsidiaries at about 20%. So could you give an indication of the targets that you have for the profitability of subsidiaries? Where should that ROE be and the cost/income ratio of your subsidiaries, say, one or two years out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, DenizBank is totally different profile from VBI. It has been itself generating pretty good profitability levels and ROEs of 17%, 18%. So that addition to the mix, if anything, should be neutral to positive overall. But those are different businesses: the ones coming through VBI, the ones coming through Deniz. And also the dynamics of the Troika are reflecting structural changes in the markets where it does business, where some of the markets are booming and we &#x2013; not booming, but our market share has been skyrocketing, whilst the volume of the markets has been stagnating. This is the various directional dynamics, and the art of efficiently and successfully managing this is addressing each market individually and developing a smart way of navigating those.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we don't really set a universe target, and I'll revert all of us back to the main strategic rationale that we were outlining as the point of the position of each of those big three acquisitions is that, the horizon and the strategic targets there are much longer than three/five-year time period. And therefore, setting individual targets already right now, a few months after acquisition, for things like VBI, with its eight markets in Eastern Europe, is not right, is not rational. The rational longer-term strategic investor's behavior is, okay, let's learn this market, let's learn these countries, let's make sure competitive advantages are &#x2013; scale efficiencies are transferable to those markets.</p>
          <p>And then when we're comfortable that we're doing that on a small scale, let's start pumping up volume. And then when this becomes kind of regular and we get the better sense of the control handles there, we would be rationally saying, okay, guys, for this market the target is doing that in the next four years, for this one doing this in the next five years, this one should be coming much quicker in the next three years.</p>
          <p>So that particular target and the target should be different. Some of them are going to be efficiency, some of them are going to be volume, some of them are going to be ultimately ROEs, et cetera. So &#x2013; and the averaging due to the difference of those assets from strategic directions is not going to do any good. That will be more like average temperature in the hospital type of a parameter. So there consciously isn't one universal.</p>
          <p>Of course, our overall global strategic guidance as we say that the big group should be using stably more than 20% ROE on the longer-term horizon, but individual terms it could be different, different in each particular case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My last question, I promise, is regarding the margin, and particularly the cost &#x2013; your funding cost development. I think one and two quarters ago you were saying that the deposits will be repricing upwards until at least the third quarter of this year, but I'm hardly noticing an increase in your average deposit costs. Could you explain why they are not increasing simply to reflect the increases in deposit rates that you made in the second half last year and in January this year? And would you expect those funding costs regardless of the steps that you are taking now and the trends that you are seeing on the new funding coming in, would you still expect those funding costs just to be repriced upward just from the impact of the previous deposit rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is tailing off a little bit, the results of our moves from November and January, but also don't forget we've done another move. This is public offer &#x2013; well publicized in the press. We've done another move back in March. So it normally peaks up immediately when you do more or less, not kind of rounding error, but visible moves there, there is two horizon effects. One is in terms of cannibalization and we've discussed this at length in last quarter and the quarter ago, where the cheaper deposits within your own product line migrate into higher costing deposits, but that's any bank moving the rates up would always observe. And the quick nearest type of an effect, which &#x2013; most of which we've already seen, but yes, maybe a little bit; let's say less.</p>
          <p>And then there is a longer term effect, which relates to the overall duration of your term deposit portfolio in the liabilities, and that duration is, kind of, over one year in our case. So there will be gradual repricing as those things mature over the nearest 12 months. So that's the way it works.</p>

          <p>Okay. So with that, I would like to thank you all very much for your insightful questions, and for your understanding and the deep knowledge of the way our business works and the quality of your model construction, which one can clearly see from the depth of the questions that have been asked.</p>
          <p>So, again, any further questions that you might have, our Investor Relations function is always at your service through all the channels that it operates; website, telephone, e-mail, all the contacts are there on the website. And we'll be glad to see you on our next call. Thank you very much.</p>
