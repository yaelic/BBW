        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to our conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 results.  We have a simultaneous webcast on the Internet that can be accessed at the site www.petrobras.com.br/ri/english.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, I'd like to draw your attention to the Slide Two.  We may make forward-looking statements which are identified by the use of the words will, expect and similar that are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Petrobras management and on information currently available to the company.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me mention that this conference call will discuss Petrobras's results prepared in accordance with the Brazilian GAAP.  At this moment, we are unable to discuss any issues relating to U.S. GAAP results.</p>
          <p>The conference call will be conducted by our CFO and Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa.  He will comment on the company's operating and financial highlights and the main events during this quarter and he will be available to answer any questions you may have.  Mr. Barbassa, please begin.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.  It's a pleasure to be here with you and have the opportunity to talk about the third quarter 2008 results.</p>
          <p>Looking at the cover slides in the past calls to discuss the results, our coversheet has had a picture of most recent platform installed since our last call.  This time we had the pleasures of putting three platforms on the cover page as all three have begun producing oil since our last call, installing three platform facilities with total processing capacity of 460,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>In the last 90 days highlight why we are confident that we can meet our goal of producing 1.3 million barrels per day in the pre-salt layer by the end of 2015.</p>
          <p>Next slide.  Slide Three, please.  Next.  Let's talk about production.  Since production drives our business plan and our cash flow, let us begin with an update.  As you can see, for the fourth quarter, production declined by 1%.</p>
          <p>Let's go to the fourth quarter.  We had year-over-year an increase of 7%, even considering this 1% decrease from the third to the fourth quarter.  And we reached the record of 2,012,000 barrels per day at beginning of this month.  We are, as I explained, in the ramping up of three important platforms.</p>
          <p>Let's go to the next slide.  As we are showing here, the three platforms and as you will see, the three units recently installed are already producing 127,000 barrels per day.  You can also see that Cidade de Niter&#xF3;i is producing almost 33,000 barrels per day with just one well.  The production from these three new platforms has led to record production of two million, as I just said.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please.  Pre-salt, a brief update on the pre-salt.  This year we expect to drill nine wells in the Santos Pre-Salt blocks that we operate.  Eight of these are exploration or appraisal and one is the second well for the Tupi extended well test.  This year will be &#x2013; we will have available seven additional drilling rigs capable of drilling in water depths greater than 2,000 meters.  This will help our effort not only in the Santos Basin, but in other exploration, development and maintenance needs along the Brazilian coast.  The Tupi extended well test is scheduled to commence in the second quarter of this year.  We are near completion of the first well, which was the regional exploration well in the block.</p>
          <p>Next, please.  Let's see prices for the E&amp;P.  The price of oil is the biggest challenge Petrobras is facing now.  As you can see, the average price of Brent fell from $114 to 54, a $60 per barrel decline from the third quarter to the fourth.  Given the narrowing of light heavy differential, our own crude fell less by $53 per barrel.  In either case, it's still a decline of more than 50%.</p>
          <p>Next, please.  Lifting costs.  The decline in the price of oil did they have a positive effect:  the reduction of lifting costs.  Lifting costs expressed in U.S. dollars and, without government take, declined by nearly 20%.  Although, as you can see, there was a small increase in reais lifting cost because of the devaluation of the real.  Government take showed a much more substantial decline, as should be expected given the linkage to the international prices.  Expressed in U.S. dollar, government take is down almost 50%.  Lifting costs and government take on a combined base are down 45%.</p>
          <p>Next, please.  Despite the drop in the price of crude oil during the third quarter, Petrobras has maintained pricing of diesel, gasoline and LPG unchanged.  This is consistent with our policy of pricing at international parity in the long term.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the graph, only in November did we reach parity with the U.S. price for the basket of Brazilian products.  For the year as a whole, we average $11.91 below parity.  A portion of the decline in U.S. dollars occurred because of the weaker real during the fourth quarter.  As you can see when expressed in reais, our revenues were much more stable.</p>
          <p>Next, please.  Trade balance.  To discuss results, we need to put into perspective how our products and our costs adjust prices.  Last year, we produced 1,855,000 barrels per day of oil in Brazil.  1,416,000 barrels per day of that amount went to our refineries in Brazil and 439 bpd was exported.  We imported light oil to blend with our heavy oil to optimize our throughput.</p>
          <p>Additionally, since our refinery produced some products in excess of what the Brazilian market consumes, primary fuel oil and gasoline, we export those products, while we import what the market is short primary middle distillates and LPG.  The trade balance between barrels of oil and oil product exported and imported continues to improve with a surplus of 102,000 barrels per day in 2008.  However, we exported low value products and import higher value products.  The result is a negative trade balance expressed in U.S. dollars of 928 million.</p>
          <p>Because of our inability to fully process the mass crude in our refineries, Petrobras last year gave up margins equal to 100,000 barrels per day of oil and oil products.  Capturing this margin will provide the economical returns for our refinery investment program.  Next please.</p>
          <p>Difference in timing between revenues and costs: over the long term, with adequate investment, Petrobras can do much to improve its refining margin basin &#x2013; based on international pricing.  In the short term, margins are affected by domestic pricing policy and accounting practices.  These policies and practices have an important impact on the quarterly results, especially in an environment of rapid rising or falling prices.</p>
          <p>This slide shows the composition of our products, broken out into those products that only adjust over the long term and those that adjust more frequently.  Because we adjust diesel, gasoline and LPG price only to maintain parity over the long term, these prices did not move even as the price of the products in the international market declined by more than 50%.  The remaining products sold domestically adjust with the exchange rate and the international price of products every two weeks.  Revenue from export adjusts with each cargo.  Therefore, revenue declined during the fourth quarter because of domestic sales that adjust biweekly plus export sales.</p>
          <p>The decline in the cost of imports of crude oil and products over time should roughly offset the decline in revenue from exports of oil and products adjusted by the relative margins between exports and imports for each period in comparison between quarters.  However, the difference in timing of the recognition between revenues in the quarters can create differences.  Revenues on exports and prices that adjust biweekly quickly reflect international price, but Petrobras averages the costs for products sold over the 60-day period.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the reduction costs, particularly of imports and government take, is not coincidental with the reduction in price.  In a flat price environment this has no impact.  But when the price of products raise or falls rapidly, this has an important effect.  Next please.</p>
          <p>Operating costs: this table demonstrates the impact that this timing differential has during the fourth quarter.  The negative impact on our results were R$2.719 billion, which includes not only the benefit from lower price that was not recognized this period but also retained the costs from the third quarter.  Low oil prices had several other impacts on results for the fourth quarter.  The declining value of oil also affected fourth quarter results to inventory reduction and the impairments.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, inventory reduction to the lower of cost or market caused a reduction in income of R$1.089 billion.  Impairments of E&amp;P assets in the amount of 925 million were deemed uneconomical at the year ended oil price of 36 per barrel, adding to the impact of the fourth quarter.  The table in this slide shows all the extraordinary items that occurred during the fourth quarter and reconciles them to the third quarter operating profit.  As you can see, inventory reductions accounted for R$796 million, while impairment another 925 million.  The effect of inventory averaging cost another R$2.532 billion.</p>
          <p>It is also worth noting the impact of hedging upon our results.  Financial revenues from hedge operating reached R$603 million in the fourth quarter against 156 in the third.  As you can see, together, these extraordinary items bring fourth quarter operating income to a difference of only R$1.378 billion between the two quarters.  The difference can be attributed to the lower price on those domestic sales that adjusted biweekly.  Next please.</p>
          <p>E&amp;P segment: turning now to a discussion by segment.  Exploration &amp; Production is the segment most affected by the decline in the international price of oil.  The selling price of Brazilian crude oil was $47.95 per barrel versus 79.75 in the prior period &#x2013; prior quarter.  Average production decreased from 1.883 million to 1.865 million barrels per day as a result of natural declining of existing fields and program stoppages.</p>
          <p>As we saw earlier, lifting costs including government take were reduced with the decline in the price of oil.  Included within the results of this segment during the quarter was an impairment of R$603 million, which was based on conservative long-term approach for oil price group as was in Petrobras business plan of '09 -'13.  The R$30 million in the oil price caused us to write-down 1.2 billion of barrels of our proved reserves.  This relative minor adjustment to our productivity facilities, and our proven reserves at such a low oil price, are reflect of the strengths of our E&amp;P portfolio.  Also included is a recognition of R$2.551 billion for exploration expense, which were higher than last year because of higher drilling costs related to exploration and a larger number of well drilled.  Next please.</p>
          <p>Downstream: the downstream segment benefited from lower costs, but not nearly to the extent that would have been reflected had costs not been averaged.  As mentioned earlier, cost averaging means the downstream segment did not benefit from the reduction in costs from lower price of oil and products.  Next please.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Energy segment: the International and Gas &amp; Energy segments are relatively small segments within the large consolidated company.  Some of the results, particularly of Gas &amp; Energy, are reflected by their position within a larger consolidator hold.  For example, Gas &amp; Energy is independent on supply from &#x2013; is dependent on supply from our E&amp;P operation.</p>
          <p>International is exploring and developing new deepwater frontiers that have synergy with our Brazilian operation.  Consequently, its exploration expense relatively to earnings is proportional.</p>
          <p>To better understand the contribution of these areas, it is better to look at their full year results.  Results from Gas &amp; Energy segment demonstrates substantial improvement during the last 12 months as a combination of growing supply of gas, growing power generation and the higher gas commercialization margins.</p>
          <p>The increase in higher gross margin is the increase in margin from the re-negotiation of supply contract with the gas distribution company as well as increase in sales of gas and generation of power.  As mentioned earlier, gas sales increased by 26% during the year while electric generation from our own plants increased by 256%.</p>
          <p>With the increase of domestic gas supply by E&amp;P as well as ongoing completion of the gas pipeline network and the commissioning and testing of the Pec&#xE9;m at the Northeast of Brazil and Guanabara Bay regasification facilities, Petrobras is now well positioned to supply foreseeable demands for thermoelectric power.  As a result, penalties paid in the past, largely as a result of our inability to meet our supply commitments, are not expected in the future.  These penalties totaled R$449 million in 2007 and 434 million in 2008.  As we look to the future, results from this segment will be driven by the amount of thermoelectric generation required by the national system operator and the value placed on that generation.</p>
          <p>It should always be remembered that having a complete gas distribution and thermoelectric generation capacity provides a profitable market for the rapidly growing production of associated and non-associated offshore gas.  Next please.</p>
          <p>International: the International segment's operating income were a negative 881 million for the year.  In the waterfall graphic, we show the contribution of the International area as expressed by EBITDA and add back exploration expenditure as well as other non-recurring provisioning.</p>
          <p>Higher price for our upstream production were offset by lower production volumes, as declines in natural fuels in Angola, Colombia and Argentina were not offset by the start of the ramp-up of the Agbami project in Nigeria.  Reduced refining margins and the unplanned stoppage from our Pasadena refinery also reduced the gross margin.  As discussed previously, we have adjusted this year for the impact of the hedge accounting that more accurately reflects the true operating costs.</p>
          <p>Impairments of assets substantially reduced operating income as we recognized impairment of our production in Cottonwood field in Gulf of Mexico and the write-down of goodwill related to the Pasadena refinery acquisition.  We also wrote down inventory related to our international activities to reflect the lower op cost to our markets in the amount of R$699 million.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we should see additional improvement as the continued ramp up of Agbami and the start up of AGPO just start last week &#x2013; on last week, yes.  In 2010, we will begin producing oil from Cascade and Chinook.  And we had participated in significant discoveries in Stones in the Gulf of Mexico, U.S. portion, and bought 1506 in Angola waters.</p>
          <p>Next, please.  The net income, as we can see from the waterfall slide, shows that we had a reduction of about R$3 billion.  But when we add back the non-recurrent expenses of about 1.7 billion, it &#x2013; eliminating these non-recurring items, we come back to a near R$9 billion of net income, what shows a reduction of about 20%, largely explained by the reduction impacts during the period.</p>
          <p>Next, please.  Let's see the cash flow.  Because of the changes in accounting law, we did not produce a quarterly cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Given the concerns over cash flow in today's environment, we can show the cash flow from the first to nine months of 2008 and the full year 2008.  As you can see, even with investment of R$52 billion, net contract debt increased by R$11.8 billion during the period.</p>
          <p>Next, please.  The increase in debt for the full year is distorted by the exchange rate since more than 60% of our financial debt is denominated in U.S. dollars.  Gross debt increased by R$25 billion, 63% of the full year. Last, increase in cash of approximately 2.8 billion for the year also.  Net debt to books cap ended the year at 26%, which is at the low end of our net debt to net book cap target for 25 to 35%.  I should caution that the leverage rate does vary slightly, very, very, very slightly, when calculated in U.S. dollars in accordance with the U.S. GAAP.</p>
          <p>Next, please.  Here we have a reconciliation between the two GAAPs we have in Brazil.  The previous one is expressed by Law 6.404, is the one that prevails up to last year.  And then we adjusted according to the new law, 11.638 of '07, that showed us the net income for the period, for the year of nearly R$33 billion.  The change between the two GAAPs was about R$900 million, what is not much when you take 33 as a base.  And the main change, or the one that I believe causes that impact, that has improved the condition, accounting rules in Brazil, is the transaction.</p>
          <p>Transaction has eliminated the change that was caused by exchange rate when you translate at the end of the period.  All the variables, like income and expenses, that were done outside Brazil in other currency into reais, taking the exchange rate of the end of the period.</p>
          <p>And the second item in the transaction is the translation of equity the company holds in other currency.  The translation, the gain or loss due to this translation, does not go to results anymore; it goes to the equity, stockholders' equity.  The other item does not give as much change.  The leasing is the consequence of recognizing lease as a financial lease.  It comes to the balance as a debt.  So you apply all the accounting rule for a debt or depreciation, the exchange rate impact on debt.  You have, for example, net financial expense of 1.6 billion is due to the &#x2013; greatly due to the variation of the exchange rate.</p>
          <p>Next, please.  This is a very, very important item, very important slide that shows how market perceived their business plan of Petrobras.  If you look at Ibovespa, for example, Petrobras was following closely Ibovespa.  But just after releasing the business plan, it decoupled.  Petrobras has had a much better performance, and this is showing in the New York Stock Exchange when you compare Petrobras with Amex Oil, as well.  What shows that our business plan for the next five years was very well perceived by the market.</p>
          <p>This is &#x2013; I believe this is all.  If you have any question, we'll be glad, and together with my colleagues, to answer you.  Thank you, very much.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I was wondering if you could provide any color on the well in BM-S-22 that finished drilling in the quarter, the Azul&#xE3;o well, whether the results were consistent with some of the other wells that you'd been drilled in the play and how your understanding the view of the reserves in the play or any other indication has been changed as a result of the well in BM-S-22? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  No problem.  Can you provide any comments then also in terms of any cost reduction initiatives.  Obviously with steel prices coming down, some of the oil service and drilling costs coming down, how should we think about that flowing through Petrobras? Are you able to bring down your costs with some of the service companies providing services to you all or is there some lag? Can you make any comments on cost reductions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  This is a very important point.  We are really working very hard on this block, not only on the operational area but on the CapEx as well.  When we announced our business plan, we made it very clear that we were working on that business plan with prices that were in force in the second half of last year.  But we were doing our best to have better price, I mean, lower price than that.  And we are really very committed to that, and we are working also on the operational.  We have adopted internally in the company at the last year, at the end by November last year, many policies towards general and administrative costs.</p>
          <p>We are having some indications that they had been truthful.  They are providing some cost reduction.  We are looking for opportunities to reduce costs in other areas.  For example, the P-61 and P-62, we just cancelled the bidding process due to the &#x2013; 61 and 63, sorry, we cancelled the bidding because of excess price.  And we are working redesign the units and standardized as much as we can and going back to the market trying to get a better price.  So these are only some example.  This is one maybe the most important items for the management of the company right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Hello, good afternoon, everyone.  Two questions, first, you showed on the quarter a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.85.  I was wondering what your target is for the end of the year? And then on Page Four of the presentation, you've shown that you have had a good productivity per well and the industry platforms.  My question is, I should expect or are you confident that you'll be able to lease big production with less wells that you were previously forecasting and that we could see actually a &#x2013; and a lower lifting costs? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the EBITDA, we have no target for such index.  So we intend to be strong in it.  And we are really very strong, having 85 &#x2013; 0.85 in this ratio.  Regarding to the second question, Molinari can help us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course we are always seeking to have wells more producible.  One example is the one given by Mr. Almir <mark type="inaudible" /> a single well is producing around 33,000 barrels per day.  In the Pre-salt region, we expect to have a better productivity per well.  So that will help to reduce the lifting costs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, two quick ones.  On the dividend, wondering, do you have a rough idea that when the payout is going to be made of the R$9.9 billion? Also, when you're looking at that, your interest on capital is only R$7 billion that you declare.  So why don't we declare a much higher number that you get the full benefit from the tax? So that's the first question related to the dividend.  Second question on your capital spending, can you give us a rough estimate what is the percent of your CapEx maybe related to the new project for the current year? In other words, that the percent of the spending that have not been tie up with the old or existing contract and will be benefiting from the drop in the current spot rate?</p>

From the plan, this five-year plan, we have 35% that were not yet under contract &#x2013; were flexible.  But for the current year, a higher amount is read with established price.

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Good afternoon everyone.  Good afternoon Barbassa.  One question in relation to costs.  Drilling costs is a big component of your future spending.  And as recently as last week, we saw this new contract between Petrobras and Vantage Energy for the Titanium Explorer at a fixed year rate of $550,000 per day for an eight-year contract.  This is one of the highest rates on record for the industry.  And given the status of things, I would like to understand why is this contract good right now?  Why couldn't you wait a little more to try to get a better rate if you are really willing to see lower rates going forward?  So why having this contract in place right now?  And what is your feeling in relation to drilling costs going forward?</p>
          <p>And the second question is in relation to the potential financing deal with the Chinese.  If you could provide a little bit more color on what has been proposed in terms of the financing conditions, in terms of potential oil supply to the Chinese, a little bit more substance to the potential agreement so we can understand how good it will be for Petrobras.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Emerson, regarding the cost of drilling, this drill ship was hired, was contracted by the international area.  Unhappily, I have no representative here.  I will make some clarification on our website to you and to the audience later on.  I really &#x2013; I don't know the reason.  Probably, they have some commitment on the drilling, but I have to make it clear with the international area.</p>
          <p>Regarding the negotiation with the CDB, the China Development Bank, where we are negotiating a large amount of financing to Petrobras in exchange to the possibility of a strategic supply of oil.  It does not mean that we have to supply every day.  We have a commitment in the case to supply a certain amount of oil in case they require.  And the details on these contracts are not yet available.  We are still under negotiations.  So we don't have neither terms neither conditions for such contract.  They are being built at this moment.</p>

          <p>Hi, gentlemen.  Thanks for the call.  Could you give us any color on the outlook, the possibility for lower prices in the domestic market for oil and diesel and those products that are being re-priced, being kept stable this year?  And can you give us any guidance on what you expect your EBITDA level to look like for the full year 2009?  Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this moment, we have no decision on this subject.  No, &#x2013; I mean no change in our current strategy prices.  If you look at the future prices they are higher than the current one.  So, according to our policy we did not arrive to a moment to adjust costs.  And if you look back during '08 our PMR were about near R$19 per barrel below the international.  So to average longer run the international we shall beyond the level we are today.  I don't know how much, how long it's going to take.  But and how soon we're going to perceive that really prices are going to stay where they are for a longer period.  So, I cannot be of much help at this moment.  What I can tell is that we are keeping the prices we are practicing today.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Barbassa, how are you?  Two questions, one on the debt side.  In order to maintain investment-grade status, what kind of credit ratios would you be looking at?  Would it be the net debt to capital, net debt to EBITDA?  What kind of a metric should we monitor in order to make sure the company would continue having that investment grade?</p>
          <p>And the second question is related to Page Four of the presentation.  I wanted to know if there is anything different from previous wells that were drilled and the pace of the ramp up as this seems quite amazing with one well being drilled, already 30,000 barrels being produced.  I wanted to know if that's something unusual there, there's something new that has being implemented in these platforms that weren't before or if not why so?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The metrics we are following is the net debt to net cap.  As we have announced, we are aiming to keep this metric within the range of 25 to 35%.  And I would like to make here, to stress one point.  Based on our business plans, if you look at our business plan, you are going to see that we work for financial purpose with oil price, Brent oil price of $37 per barrel.  And of that price, according to our calculation, we will be able to produce $10 billion of net cash flow after paying dividends and the amortization, debt amortization.  And we said also that every dollar in average for the above that $37 would give us an extra cash of $500 million.  So far, the oil price has been higher than the 37 in average per day.  If it remains like that, we will be generating more cash flow than expected.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we work with very conservative costs, I mean the costs for CapEx and operational costs that we're taking the costs of last year second half.  And there is a good chance that we are going to have cost reduction for the year or for most part of the year.  And this is going to reflect as an extra cash generation for the company.  And all this together will help us to keep our ratios in the range we are aiming at.  Regarding the opportunity of the last platform, <mark type="inaudible" /> I'll ask for the help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  It's a platform with 100,000 barrels per day capacity.  We are producing light oil, it's 28 degrees API.  So the productivity is characteristic of the reservoir.  So we expect to have also high productivity in the Pre-Salt of the Santos and Esp&#xED;rito Santo Basin.  So it's not a new technology but it is characteristic of the reservoir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys.  I had one question per the request <mark type="inaudible" />.  You mentioned in the Brazilian event that over the course of the first quarter, we might have a better feel for how the cost-cutting effects might be planned out of the company and the short mention that we might even have a feel of how the CapEx might be looking at.  What I wanted to understand is if when I look at the guidance that you have given out, the $28 billion guidance for 2009, is that number subject to any kind of relevant downgrading, if you can negotiate lower prices or is most of that already locked in?</p>

Gustavo, we are looking for the opportunity to realize, to execute all the jobs, to execute all the plan we have for the next five years, but expending less than $174 billion, and this applies for this year too.  Probably this year has less flexibility than the old plan, but we expect to spend less than that by doing the same.</p>

I just wanted to have a feel from your end as CFO.  If it came to a serious strategic decision between doing something that would keep the investment-grade rating and I'd say slowing down on the pace of investments in Brazil, which one of the two do you think the company would take?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you.  Two quick follow-up.  One on the &#x2013; Page 11 of your presentation, you list all the inventory losses in three item.  The losses with devaluation of inventory, I presume this is mark-to-market on your existing inventory level? The inventory turnover, the effect, I presume this because of the average costs, so &#x2013; in the ongoing operation &#x2013; that, that have the loss.  And the inventory loss trading operation, R$964 million, can you explain to me why that we have this loss and what causing it?</p>
          <p>Second question is related to some of the very promising drilling result in West Africa, Ghana.  Looking at that, is there any lateral implication to the offshore Northeast part of the country? And wondering that have you guys looked at that, and if there is any comment you can share? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the inventory losses in trading operation, these are losses &#x2013; the reason is almost the same as the first line where we have storage.  The inventory losses here in the trading are operations that we do offshore Brazil, outside Brazil.  We buy from one source and sell to other destination oil and oil products.  What happened here that is not &#x2013; we had, for example, for the fourth quarter, R$964 million of losses.  This isn't affecting our operational results.  But most of these were get -were brought back through the hedging system.  In the financial, we have R$603 million of gains on the hedging of this oil.  Usually when we buy this oil to be processed, for example, in the Pasadena refinery, we have sold already the oil products in the future.  So we have a loss here.  If we had a loss in the physical, we have a gain in the financial, in the hedge.  So this is affecting the operational income, but it's returning to the financial down below.</p>
          <p>And the second question regarding Ghana, as I said, we have no representative of the international area.  I can answer you through our...</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I understand you don't have operations in Ghana.  I'm talking about that -since the belief in the geology is that million years ago, Latin America and West Africa is in the same continent and it drift apart.  So what we seen in Ghana, I'm asking that is there any lateral implication to the Northeast part of the offshore Brazil that you guys are &#x2013; you're seeing? And is there any indication or anything that you can share from that aspect? I'm not talking about Ghana per se; I'm talking about what is the implication to you.</p>

          <p>This is more a question for a geologist.  I don't know if Molinari would like to add something to that.  In fact, we don't know.  I believe no geologist knows where the pre-salt broke when there were the drifting apart of the two continents.  How much remained in Brazil and how much were taken west &#x2013; eastward to Africa &#x2013; with Africa.  This is, today, I believe we don't have this answer.  I don't know one geologist that would have.  Of course, there is a lot of speculation at this moment, but it always is a guess.</p>

But I'm curious about the inventory adjustments that you took given the higher &#x2013; on the declining prices.  So you have higher costs, I guess, feed into your refineries.  I'm curious if that is &#x2013; what we should expect into the first quarter of 2009 if, let's say, we're now sitting around a level that maybe is hopefully stable.

        <plist>
          <p>My question is in relation to lifting costs going forward.  We have seen lifting costs in the range of eight to $10 in the recent quarters.  This quarter, we had an improvement coming from the currency depreciation, and we have those new wells which have high productivity levels.  I was wondering, I mean when we think about the overall production in Brazil, if we think just offshore, the average productivity per well is 20,000 barrels per day.  So what sort of improvement for the average lifting cost of the company do we get from these new wells with such a high productivity? Should we expect a meaningful improvement in the lifting costs going forward? Or this range from eight to 10 is still reasonable given the startup of new systems and the heavy fixed costs that they bring together?</p>
