          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the presentation of BNP Paribas 2011 First Quarter Results. For your information, this conference is being recorded. Slides of the presentation are available on BNP Paribas Investor Relation website, www.invest.bnpparibas.com. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like now to hand the call over to Philippe Bordenave, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome to all of you. Thank you for attending this conference call dedicated to our first quarter results. I will start with a few introductory remarks before taking your questions, as usual.</p>
          <p>These quarterly results, again, illustrate BNP Paribas recurrent ability to strongly perform. Revenues reached 11.7 billion euros, up from 11.5 billion euros a year ago and beating the consensus.</p>
          <p>I would like to insist on three points. The first thing is a 3.6% increase in Retail Banking revenues, thanks to in part sustained volumes in our domestic networks for loans, as well as deposits. Those deposits grew by 8.5% and loans by 3.9%, driven in particular by mortgages.</p>
          <p>These paces of growth are a clear indicator of a trend. Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg are sound and wealthy domestic markets with room for further development. Indeed, the level of household indebtedness in all of these markets is reasonable and below eurozone average, savings rates ranging from 14% in Italy to 18% in Belgium are at a high level.</p>
          <p>So it's not only the networks which benefit from these strong fundamentals, but also Personal Finance and Equipment Solutions with our cross selling strategy. On top of all that, networks offer a wide range of products to clients thanks to very effective cross selling with CIB as well. For example, cash management, trade funds, capital guaranteed structured products and with Investment Solutions, charge credit protection insurance. So the Retail Banking revenues are really benefiting from the soundness and the wealth of our domestic market.</p>
          <p>Second thing, I would like to stress the 12.2% rise in Investment Solutions revenues with strong performance across all businesses, plus 20.7% in Insurance, plus 14.4% for Security Services and plus 7.6% for Wealth and Asset Management. The main drivers of this performance and this double digit growth are a strong sales and marketing drive and the unique integrated business model in which each business feeds each other.</p>
          <p>In terms of regional performance, Europe did well, as usual, and Asia was a significant contributor thanks to the particular efforts made to accelerate the development of all our Investment Solutions businesses in this region.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you as example, the new Security Services that we recently set up in Singapore for the region, the Cardiff insurance joint venture with the State Bank of India, number one bank of India, our asset management and insurance joint ventures which enhanced in Korea and so on. What's more, net asset inflow reached 8.3 billion euro thanks to positive contribution of all the businesses, and really therefore Investment Solutions truly is the growth engine for the group.</p>
          <p>Third thing, CIB revenues reached 3.5 billion euros thanks to the very good performance of all its businesses, declining by only 8.6% compared to an exceptionally strong one first quarter 2010. These revenue figures are close to the upper range of our guidelines, you remember 2.5 billion euros to 3.5 billion euros per quarter.</p>
          <p>And while Fixed Income ranked number one once again in bonds in euro, in international bonds in euro, and did a breakthrough in Yankee bonds, Equity Derivatives benefited from a strong contribution from flow and structured products, and financing businesses provided, once again, provided a stable and recurrent revenue base, especially in energy and commodities.</p>
          <p>That's for the revenues. Now about the operating expenses, while they were under control, as can be seen with a further improvement of the cost income ratio in Retail Banking minus 40 basis points to 58.3%, Investment solutions minus 1.4 points and 0.3%. And as for CIB, the cost income ratio of this first quarter stood at 52.7%, still at the best level in the industry,</p>
          <p>Now a few words about the cost of risk, down 31%. As <mark type="ph" /> first on page (6:37) of customer loans it stood at 54 basis points against 83 in the first quarter of 2010 and 72 for the full year 2010. What's more, and for the first time, in fact, non-performing loans have started to abate.</p>
          <p>These figures confirm I think the continuing improvement in asset quality across the board, even though the cost of risk differs from one market to another. French and BeLux Retail Banking continued to experience low level of provisions, while provisions in Italy have just stabilized at a still high level.</p>
          <p>Most significant declines were seen at BancWest and Personal Finance, most of which are recovering from their crisis peaks. Therefore, for the whole year 2011, we indeed expect and reiterate our expectation of loan loss provisions to be below the level 2010.</p>
          <p>Thus, net income attributable to equity holders rose to 2.6 billion euros. That's a 14.6% increase from a year before, illustrating BNP Paribas's strong profit generation capacity once again. Solvencies at the high level, illustrated by common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.5% at the end of March compared with 8.3% one year earlier.</p>
          <p>Overall, the group's strong results enabled the return equity to reach 15.1%, up 70 basis points from the first quarter of 2010, that is to say an improvement by 5%. As the number of shares is virtually unchanged since the last period, earnings per share rose to 2.1 euros, up 13.6%, so quite significant indeed.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that BNP Paribas shareholders have virtually not been diluted over the last past year. More generally, you know that we at BNP Paribas we are keen to avoid any significant dilution during the crisis, so all these figures illustrate, once again, the effectiveness of the BNP Paribas business model <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:17).</p>
          <p>I'm now ready to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We have now our first question from Derek De Vries from Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Just have two questions, if I might. Starting with the French networks where you saw very good loan growth on the corporate side this quarter, and I was wondering is there some seasonality in there? Or is that the kind of loan growth we can expect to see going forward? And then second question deals with some of the Basel III liquidity rules and while your capital is clearly a positive, there's not much in there about liquidity. I was just wondering if you could share some thoughts on where we stand with the liquidity rules and how that's going to impact pricing for you? Are you already starting to change the pricing? Or do we need to have more clarity on the rules? Any real thoughts on Basel III liquidity would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. About the loan growth on the corporate side, I think we have seen some beginning of a pick-up on the SME segment, the small and very small enterprises and SME segment. So it's encouraging, but it's a bit too early to say that it's the beginning of a sustainable recovery. On Basel III liquidity rules, while you know that contrary to the capital rules, the liquidity rules proposed by Basel III are somewhat kind of <mark type="ph" /> company (11:41) rules. In the Basel document itself it's written that it saw some changes, and that's the <mark type="ph" /> mark (11:59). So I take the tax. In order to address unintended consequences, the committee is prepared to make revisions to specific components of the standard if it proves necessary in light of the analysis conducted under tax collected during the observation period.</p>
          <p>So there will be observation period between now and 2013 for the LCR, liquidity coverage ratio and between now and 2015 for the other ratio, the NSFR. So I mean we are still in the middle of, well while nobody knows exactly what are going to be those rules, so I think it's probably a bit early to say. As far as we are concerned, we have started really good thing, the observed increase in the liquidity causing the market into the internal pricing. And I observe that that has not been made by everybody, by the way, it seems. The competition on the market you see very different attitudes.</p>
          <p>So we think that those, while the liquidity costs that have increased over the recent period are going to remain, and we think selectively somewhat sustained and likely be high for the period to come. So we have introduced that in our internal pricing, so we take that into account. And for the rest, we wait until we know the exact rules and then we'll adapt to them, so because anyway we'll have further time to adapt because well of course for the short-term liquidity coverage ratio, once they will have set the rules in 2013, they are going to be implemented only two years later, 2015. So for one month liquids ratio, so we'll have time to adapt.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Delphine Lee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have a few questions. First of all, just on the Greek government bonds that you have in the banking book, mainly in SS, I assume. Is it possible to get a kind of how much marks you have taken so far just to get an idea of where we stand in terms of losses that have come through equity? Second thing is on the banking tax, whether the U.K. or France when exactly will we see that in the P&amp;L and kind of what kind of estimates do you have so far in the different divisions? Just to get an idea. And thirdly, just on the cost in the IB, CIB division. I mean, I know you have this target of 60%, below 60% cost income ratio, but we're coming from very low levels. Should we expect a sharp increase this year, given that this quarter will likely be high versus expectations? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Delphine. Well, on the Greek bonds, we &#x2013; as they are in, literally all of them available for sale, we are of course marking them to market for the purpose calculating the evaluation reserve, what we call valuations reserve that is called the change in equity through CI by others. And so we make that sort of calculation and we put them in the calculation of the book value per share, re-evaluate it, well every three months. So we have made to answer to your question, I mean, we have made that calculation again at the end of March. And at the end of March we have made the calculation that the markdown at market price for those Greek bonds plus <mark type="ph" /> for to get their response (16:17), of course, we have made a lot, package are representing for the markdowns would represent something like 1 euro per share in terms of book value, of impact from the book value. It's the equivalent of 1 euro old per share.</p>
          <p>So you don't find that 1 euro old per share of course in the difference between the book value per share. It's nominal, if you want, and the book value per share re-evaluated because we have also, we have Latin gain as well. And those are part of our portfolio, and in total, the available for sale portfolio is in Latin gain by 300 million euro in total. But if you isolate only the Greek and Portuguese and Irish bonds, of course it's Latin plus, of course from that part. And in the market price at the end of March in terms of presenting in terms of impact under book value, per share it was the equivalent of 1 euro. So it's something that show that it's a limited issue for BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>As far as the banking tax is concerned. You have on Slide 5, in fact, we call that the systemic tax. So we use that word systemic, but while others are using the word banking tax. But it's the same, in fact. It's been imposed in France and in the U.K. So we have started accruing it since the beginning of the year and for the &#x2013; and it's part of the cost because it's going to be deductible in France, and it's &#x2013; well, at start of the cost. So it's representing 45 million euros for the first quarter. That is to say 0.7% of the cost of last year's first quarter. So it explains why I would say that the total operating expenses are growing by 2% instead of 1.3%. And for the whole of 2011, we are expecting 186 million euro in total, subject to the final wording of the U.K. tax because the U.K. tax has not yet been voted, so it's subject to changes. But according to the current tax we have under the eyes it would 186 million euros for the whole of the year.</p>
          <p>CIB, the cost income ratio of CIB, yes we &#x2013; well, we stand at 52.7% for the first quarter. That being said, the cost, well it's the first quarter. It's quite a good quarter. While usual, there is a kind of seasonality, and say the first quarter is always a little bit stronger than the average. When we say below 60%, of course our aim is not to get close to 60%. We are just thinking that the current level is extremely low compared with the competitors. We are benefiting from the Fortis synergies, clearly, so progressively it could go up a little bit, but we'll be extremely happy if it stays at the level of around 55% I would say.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. I had a quick question on your cost of risk. I seem to remember you talking about your normalized cost of risk being the in range of 45 to 60 basis points. And you're already down to about 54 basis points at present. So my question is, if large cap is virtually zero at the moment, it's large cap corporate, do you think your aggregate group cost of risk could even drop below the normalized rate towards the end of this year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I don't know because the risk is really something you don't mask completely. We would say that a normalized level by definition is not something where the cost of risk it will stop and stabilize. It seems a kind of average line with the actual cost of risk moving around that line up and below over and below it. So probably &#x2013; well, in the past it used to be much less. We have &#x2013; before the crisis we were at something like 30 or something like that basis point. So it went up large, and so it come down probably at some point, which will be below that normalized level, but I can't tell you if it will happen this year or later. Sorry. It's difficult to predict the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I could just ask in a slightly different way. You sort of referenced a little bit of seasonality in the cost of risk in the, perhaps in the French Retail business and in the BeLux business. What do you consider sort of a more representative run rate in those businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you're right. There is a seasonality. If you look at the evolution over this last year, for example, the high point was 35 basis points, and for the probably &#x2013; the run rate is in the region of 30 or something like that both for BeLux and the French Retail, something like that.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from J.F. Neuez from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good afternoon. I just had a few questions here. I was looking at the BeLux and French Retail banking revenues, and they look as though they had quite a big jump from Q4. I know you always say that you should look year-on-year. Yet, for example, in French Retail you show revenue growth of like 2.5% on already tough comps. I was just trying to understand if there is an element of seasonality in there? Or if perhaps the current account, the mix of current account in the deposit, something like that, are playing to a more sustainable growth rate and run rate of these two divisions for the revenues? My second question was on capital management policy going forward. It's becoming increasingly clear that you will be well, well past the minimum threshold of Basel III and obviously well ahead of the implementation schedule. You've mentioned in the past that you though that 7% was an appropriate minimum. I was just trying to understand how you plan to manage the equity of the group? We see volume growth pick up, but still maybe call it rather still pedestrian in aggregate compared to some other businesses maybe. I was just trying to understand what your plans are there. And my last question is probably relating to the second question on the mitigation effects that many other of your peers are disclosing. Are you starting to see that happening? And what's your positioning towards this mitigation at other banks? Is it something that you see an opportunity for BNP Paribas? And has it started to happen or to play out already? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the BeLux and the French Retail, there is a seasonality indeed. We are &#x2013; yes, it's what? Retail business banking is not like a retailer business in distribution or food, but clearly there are months that are more active than others. The clients are working more in certain month than others. So again, you should compare each quarter with the quarter minus four, and not with the linked one. And so I can't tell you more than that. We have currently &#x2013; the pace of growth is 2.5%, per year, not per quarter. It's good. I mean, we are happy with that retained, and so we have a good growth in loans and deposits. We have a kind of renewed good trend in fees, but the relevant trend is the trend you can look at by comparing the quarter and the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>On the capital management policy, yes, we are ahead of the 7%. Very clearly, you are right. But while we still have to wait for the CC's decisions that are going to occur by the end of the year. So we'll wait until we see that in detail before changing the actual management. And as far mitigation is concerned, yes, I think to a certain extent it plays a role. I mean something that is barely visible in the day-to-day business. It just consists a number of probably competitive pressure to be reduced or in this number of margins to be widened due to the fact that a number of competitors are withdrawing from similar activity. But it's something that is really barely visible day-after-day, month-after month. And we are &#x2013; well as far as we are concerned, we keep making our business. We are also optimizing. You have seen that our integrated assets are down. So we have some kind of I wouldn't say mitigation, but optimization effect. But yes, probably indirectly we benefit from that.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Guillaume Tiberghien from Exane. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I've got four questions. One is with regard to the PPA reversal for Fortis. I think you had given a guidance of 600 million euros for the full year, or you did 200 million euros in Q1. So I was wondering whether 600 million euros is still a relevant data or we should expect more? Secondly, on the margins in Personal Finance. Can you give us a feel as to what sort of impact we should expect either in volumes or in terms of revenue margin of the change in the regulation in France and in Italy whether we should expect a plateau in profitability or maybe a drop in profitability? Thirdly, there was a regulator saying this morning or suggesting this morning that potentially the CC could be made of CoCo as opposed to equity. Do you have internally at BNP a view as to whether there's a wide enough market and investor base for broad-based CoCo in the banking sector? And then finally to come back on the mitigation impact, you say that you're optimizing your risk-weighted assets. Is there anything significant that you think may happen in the capital management and the other value measurement at BNP that could help the solvency? And maybe if you're keen to comment on the CEO of JPMorgan's analysis of other <mark type="ph" /> value (29:18) of European Banks, that would be very interesting? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Let's start with the PPA reversal. Yes, 600 million euros is right. It's not completely linear. The evolution is not completely linear because it depends on the maturity of each loan or each &#x2013; or even liabilities present in the banking book. Here you have both assets and liabilities. So depending on the exact maturities, the amount each quarter can change. But 600 million euros remains the valued assumptions for this figure.</p>
          <p>Yes, well I don't have a precise quantification yet about France and Italy, and I would say restrictive regulations, but clearly it will have some kind of tax. And while you have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:36), revenues are growing by 2% <mark type="ph" /> in the business (30:52). But at the same time, you have to bear in mind that beyond France and Italy, we have a widespread presence in countries with higher growth potential. We have a fast-growing Eastern European presence in the Czech Republic and Hungary. We have the so-called PF Inside, which distributes consumer loans through groups, local networks. That's clearly in Poland, in the Ukraine, in China, through the Bank of Nanjing. And we have <mark type="ph" /> 30 (31:40) as well.</p>
          <p>So we have a widespread in countries with high growth potential for that market. And then even in metro countries we have the very successful partnership with Commerzbank in Germany. That is working extremely well with a very strong growth in the production of new loans at the moment, because the partnership has been enlarged to the whole network. If you remember that initially it was limited to Dresdner. Historically it was coming from our partnership with Dresdner Bank. So overall if you want the new regulatory environment in France and Italy, yes, it's <mark type="ph" /> analyzing (32:24), but it has to be &#x2013; it's going to be kind of watered down by the fact that France and Italy are only part of what we are doing.</p>
          <p>The CC made of CoCos. While again we'll see, I don't want to comment too much on this issue because it's something that it is in the beginning. Up to now, difficult to comment on CoCos a lot. Only a few banks have issued CoCos so far, reflecting the pending uncertainties on this class of debt, including the fact that we don't know yet what should be their features in order for them to qualify, so you, for example, the trigger even for conversion, the maturities. Some CoCos have been issued they are dated. Others are undated, so we don't know. So I think that we have to see the final, again the final decision, the final feature that are imposed on CoCos, and then we'll see there are investors, probably, as for everything, at a certain price there will be investors. But at what price, it's &#x2013; well, nobody knows yet. Then concerning risk-weighted assets, you &#x2013; well, I don't want to comment on what others are saying, but it's difficult to compare risk-weighted assets in Europe and in the U.S. Clearly, the only way to compare is to compare on the basis of the real risk and at the end of day, the real risk content of the asset has been shown by the prices, to a certain extent. That's the only thing I wound mention.</p>

          <p>Hi, Philippe, everyone, Pascal Decque. I have still a few questions, one on the cost of risk at BNL. When do you think it's going to finally decrease because it's been five quarters in a row that's we are still fluttering? Second question on Personal Finance, is the liquidity issue going to be translated by a strategic review eventually closing some businesses or transforming sharply these kinds of businesses? Next question is on your &#x2013; you said you were not thinking of M&amp;A and were very focused on organic growth. Is potentially the 25% really your stake in Fortis organic or M&amp;A according to you? And the last one is Ukraine. Looking at the number quarter-after-quarter, revenues are sharply down, still some provision even if they are decreasing. The production is down. What is left now in Ukraine? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. About your first question, cost risk at BNL. Again, the cost of risk is always difficult to anticipate. That being said, I would say that most likely that the current situation will kind of plateau and be a small erosion of the cost of risk is likely to continue for the whole year. Well, indeed, we don't know likely when the situation will really improve dramatically. It will depend on cost; it will depend on the evolution of the Italian economy. But the Italian economy recovery is driven by exports at the moment, and so &#x2013; but the demand, Italian demand remains relatively weak. So again, we don't want to over-sell that, and we are &#x2013; well, we keep speaking of stabilization rather than of sharp reduction.</p>
          <p>PF, as far as this trend is concerned, I think in PF we have two type of businesses, as you know, the consumer loan and the mortgage loan. As far as the consumer loans are concerned, there is no &#x2013; liquidity, sure is not really that big an issue because loans are relatively short term. They are typically three years, and the margins are very good. And so they pay for the liquidity, if you want. So on that part of the business of PF I think there is no real &#x2013; well, of course, the cost of funding is increasing, but not in a proportion that would put the business at risk at all. On the mortgage side, it's a bit more complex because clearly the new regulation is punishing long term loans except if they produce deposits, so as long as you do that in a network, for example as we do in Italy where the PF, the mortgage, the PF mortgage part of the business has been completely fold into BNL. So when you &#x2013; and it's also entrenched. We have a close cooperation between and cross selling between PF and the French Network. So as soon as you manage to attract the customer with your mortgage loan and then get the deposit <mark type="ph" /> adjusted (39:20) through the relationship with the customer then it's okay because your deposits are funding to a certain extent the loans. Loans make deposits and well, the bank is finding a balance that is compatible with the new regulation.</p>
          <p>In other countries where we are purely lending mortgage loans through PF without being in connection with the network, it's probably going to be more difficult and we'll have to adapt either to widen the margins enough to justify the business or maybe to reduce that business. So this could be one of the adaptations coming from the new regulations, but &#x2013; well for PF as a whole, it's going to be relatively limited. Then your third question, sorry, I've missed it. Your question is about the acquisition strategy at the Fortis?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The stake of the Belgium state, I mean it's the stake of the Belgian state, so I think they are happy shareholders I think. We are turning around the business of Fortis Bank. I mean, BNP Paribas, Fortis in Belgium is recovering, and so I think they are here for a long while. And we are not expecting any change to that situation. And it's not especially tricky. I mean, it's working very well like that, and we have the best relationship with them. And then in the Ukraine, so in the Ukraine, yes, we &#x2013; in the Ukraine we are &#x2013; I understand your kind of frustration as far as Ukraine is concerned because we are in the middle of conducting a very strong, in fact, redeployment, restructuring of the bank. We are scaling down the mortgage business that we have suffered in Ukraine, and that's proven to be too dangerous, and with a lot of difficulties in recollection. So we have increased the number of people in the recollection department. We are really working a lot to try and limit the cost of risk as much as possible on that front. But at the same time, we have really almost stopped extending new loan, new mortgage loan. So it creates a reduction in the outstanding amount quite a lot.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are gradually launching or re-launching new activities, and especially two of them. The first one is lending to multi-nationals. So we are developing the corporate lending, especially targeting the multi-nationals in the Ukraine. There's a growing number of big international corporate investing in the Ukraine, and so we can accompany them and selling our trade finance, cash management and so on capacities. But clearly, the outstandings are small. They are still small because it's only the beginning. So they are &#x2013; it's only the beginning.</p>
          <p>And the other type of business we are developing on the basis of the network is very short term consumer finance loans in the Ukraine, so we &#x2013; in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:51) because one of the problems with the mortgages was that they were denominated in foreign currency. And clearly here we are speaking about <mark type="ph" /> Trevnar (44:00) lending, very short term consumer finance, big margins. And we are in the process of, I think, finding a good business model, but again, it's the beginning and then we are a little bit testing the market. So we are, up to now, well I think we have found a right way of doing it with a low non-performing loan rate, but it's the beginning, so it takes time. A restructuring and a redesigning of a bank takes time. I have said that our first try three years ago that was not successful, and has been completely damaged by the crisis. In fact, the crisis, 2008 was a complete disaster for the Ukraine and for the banks in Ukraine. Today, I think we are in the recovery phase and the redesigning phase.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Anke from RBC here. I have four questions, please. The first is on the optimization with respect to risk-weighted assets. I just wondered if you have &#x2013; is there more potential to do so or is it not really identified yet? Then secondly on net interest margins in France, just wondered if you can maybe give us a bit more of an outlook here? And especially I was wondering the strong growth in deposits, is this coming at a price? Or is there no pressure there? And then on the &#x2013; the third question is on financing revenues. Just wondered if you can help us here a bit more on the outlook of margins, as well I think on the webcast this morning there was talk about pressure on spreads. And I was wondering if cash management could play a role and potentially offset any spread pressure? And then lastly, just a question on my understanding of mark-to-market moves on government bonds. I mean, I understand it's currently not considered in your regulatory capital losses on government bonds, but at what point would it hit your Tier 1 capital? Would it be in the event of maturity prolongation, would there be a charge to regulatory capital? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, starting with your last question. We have made &#x2013; well, I was mentioning calculations about the impacts on the mark-to-market of some government bonds on our book value per share. By the same token, we have also calculated what would be the impact on the Tier 1 common &#x2013; or Tier 1 is the same, by the way, that impact would be the same at 15 basis point, 1-5, 15 basis points. So it's not, again, it's not a nightmare anyway. Now coming back to your first question about the optimization of the risk-weighted assets, while more potential, I mean, it's &#x2013; the way it's done it's a very decentralized way. It's not about cutting certain activities or things like that. It's a very decentralized way, so we are pushing down the constraint of the new regulation as soon as they are known and certain down through the businesses. And as the performance adjustment is made on the basis of those new constraints as well, taking into account those new constraints, the business, of course, in the day-to-day business are adapting to that and trying and optimize.</p>
          <p>The consumption of risk-weighted assets, according to the new rules or by definition in the previous world they were trying and optimize them according to the Basel II rules. Now they start doing that according to Basel III rules and by definition it's down at the same, so there is rule for it for some kind of optimization. But I think that we'll see the benefit of that all the year along probably and even probably in the following years because a certain number of activities are loans as &#x2013; well, the maturity is more than one year. So it's something that is seen over a long period. So I think that yes, there is certainly more potential. On the margins, the net interest income in France, if this was your question. Well, we don't have &#x2013; well in France as to now there is no deposit war, I would say. There is much less pressure on the deposit price compared with what we see in Italy, for example. And so I think that at the moment the net interest income, net interest margin in France has been harmed somewhat by the increase in the regulated rates. That started in February, so we have &#x2013; it was only two-third of the quarter or it's going to be a bit more in the following quarters. But well, there is no &#x2013; up to now I think the situation remains very competitive, as always, but without too much, I would say, exaggeration.</p>
          <p>The financing revenues, yes, we have seen the margins on the big international loans, I would say, and the structured finance loans. We have seen the margins are a bit under pressure. Not too much, but nevertheless what we call the risk-weighted asset productivity, I would say, meaning the revenues divided by the risk-weighted assets. That's an indicator we are following, has decreased in the first quarter somewhat, so after having gone up quite a lot during the crisis it's now coming down back, but we are still higher than the pre-crisis level quite significantly. So we &#x2013; so it's a little bit the same. I mean, competition is there. It's a permanent fight, but as you say, we try and mitigate that by offering different products, and by also maximizing the fee business as much as we can, so cash management is one aspect, direct finance and all the cross-selling with CIB product, the market products I mean, the financial market products. And that's it I think.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a few quick questions. The first one on your exposure to Greek government bonds.. Could you just give us an update on total amount you have on your balance sheet at the end of Q1? The second question is on IKB in Germany. You've been mentioned in newspapers as being interested in IKB, which is for sale. Are you having a look at the total activity? Last part of toxic assets have already been sold. I mean, what's your interest in IKB? Third question, when we have a look at your provision it went down substantially in Q1. Nevertheless, your coverage ratio is still up quarter-on-quarter. Could you just tell us what is your strategy regarding this coverage ratio? Do you intend to maintain it at the level it is right now? Or do you intend to continue to increase it? And then last question on the financing activity. You just mentioned that you are seeing the first negative impacts on margins from competition. The revenue is nevertheless up year-on-year quite substantially. Do you think the volumes that you're seeing right now are sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Greek exposure, so we have on the banking book and that is the only interesting exposure, it's 4.5 billion euros at the end of March on the banking book. On top of that, the trading book has some exposure as well, but the trading book is mark-to-market, so there is nothing &#x2013; the results are already in the P&amp;L. As far as IKB is concerned, we are the usual suspects. Every time something is for sale we are supposed to be the buyer or one of the buyers. So well, I won't comment on all of that because I spent too much time commenting I know, so we don't comment on rumors, and well, we are not <mark type="ph" /> a standard (55:14) buyer.</p>
          <p>On your question about the coverage ratio. The coverage ratio is not the result of a strategy. It's not macro managed. It's not managed from the top management. It's a bottom up indicator. It's just resulting from tons of decisions, of local decisions about the provisions that has to be made client-per-client, doubtful loan-by-doubtful loan, and decided in credit committees. And so it's just a result. So I don't know if the evolution from 81% to 82% is really significant, and it wouldn't have been significant reserve. It could have went down from 81% to 80%. It's just the result of we are adequately provisioning all our bad loans or our doubtful loans. In each case, the decision is taken according to the outlook for recouping a part of the money, and so the 82% is just the result. So I comment on it. We don't have any specific strategy on that. And the financing business, well, what we are seeing is that overall, as you said, the business is okay. And we have especially during this quarter, for example, we have benefited from the oil price and more actually the commodities price going up as we are number one in the world for energy and commodity finance. Of course, when we finance a shipment, the value is higher, so I mean even if it's the same boat and the same amount, the same amount of tons, at the end it makes more money for us because the price is higher. And so the loans with margins being equal, the revenues are higher, and even if the margins are somewhat lower, the revenues may be higher as well.</p>
          <p>So this is why the business is doing fine. That being said, it's true that we see a certain number of competitors aggressively pricing certain deals. While obviously no one is perfectly well known that their funding costs are higher than our funding costs, so we are surprised if you want to see a certain number of aggressive pricing. So we think that a certain number of competitors we have not tried to generate, they historically try to generate revenues, but it's not going to last very long. I mean because it's not sustainable for them, so we &#x2013; the future will be <mark type="ph" /> even better (58:36).</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just ask a follow-up question on non-performing loans. They are down 4% quarter-on-quarter. Do you see that as a kind of one-off event? Or do you see Q1 as a turning point in this credit cycle for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I am always very reluctant to give any guidance about provisions and non-performing loans, but normally it should be a turning point. Normally, as we see really the portfolios improving, and I think that for a few quarters already, remember. The previous quarters you or your colleagues were asking me about the cost of risk coming down while the non-performing loans were still a little bit edging up. So I hope that this time it's a turning point, and normally it should mark the beginning of a down trend.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions from me. First just to follow-up on Anke's question about margins in France, could you give us some sort of commentary on margins in BNL? I think historically when rates have risen it's been good news for Italian business, but obviously I'm conscious of the deposit competition there. So do you see sort of revenues improving with rising rates? Or is that going to be competed away? And the second question, almost a division that doesn't really get much attention, but the Equipment Solutions business looked very, very strong in the third quarter, and I was just wondering if there's anything exceptional in there? Or whether you feel that sort of Q1 is a good baseline for us to build forecasts on going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on BNL, contrary to the Italian banks, I have to say that we have &#x2013; well, we hedge our interest rate risk. So we are hedging, we have hedged it as well at BNL now, and so the revenues are not going to improve because interest rates would go up, so we are completely I would say hedged. And as you know, it's the policy of BNP Paribas to macro hedge the exposure of the Retail revenues to the interest rate risk. So that being said, we know that, expect revenues of BNL to go up, but not because of interest rates would go up, so not because of kind of windfall profits. But because of the development of the cross selling. There is a systematic implementation of the cross selling in Italy, like in the other networks of the group, especially in life insurance we have very good sales. We are beating the market in protection insurance as well, and as far as corporate are concerned, we are also gaining quite a lot of market share in cash management and structural finance. So we &#x2013; and we all those referrals, of course, are making referral fees and placement fees and so on for the network of BNL. So there is not only the net interest margin, but also the fee income.</p>
          <p>As far as Equipment Solution is concerned, it's not &#x2013; I wouldn't say it's exceptional, no, I wouldn't say it's exceptional. I think Equipment Solution went through a very difficult period during the crisis, and now it's recovering. And we are happy to see that now they are back to a very significant level of pre-tax earnings. And I think it should last for the next few quarters, barring some exceptional event. But we have a very good &#x2013; we are ahead of course by the rebounding of in the used car prices because this has an impact on the revenues, of course, on the Arval side. But we have also very good sales and marketing drive in Arval with the finance fleet going fast close to double digit figure. And on the losing part, the cost of resale has gone down a lot. It's well under control I think now. The quality of the portfolio has improved a lot, and so yes, we are positive on that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That very low cost of risk in Equipment Solutions, was that &#x2013; that wasn't then due to a recovery? That was just simply a reflection of the low level of new non-performing loans, if you like, coming through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's a reflection of &#x2013; it's a little bit like it's a reflection of the <mark type="ph" /> defined (1:04:15) situation of the corporates in our main markets improving with...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we can take that as sort of sustainable level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, in France, in Belgium, the corporates, even small corporates are much stronger than they were during the crisis, and that, of course, has an impact both on the plain corporate lending in the Retail Network side, but also on the leasing business on the Equipment Solutions side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Three questions, please. Firstly, just the relatively strong revenue growth in fixed income. Is it right to strip out the 108 million euro methodology change that you've got on slide 61? And if I do that, you get something like revenues down only 0.07 euros over what was a very strong Q1 of last year. So is that the right thing to do, to strip it out? And secondly, this performance is much better than peers. How did you achieve that when so much of your business is biased to euro rates, which has suffered somewhat, given some of the volatility? Secondly, could you give us an indication of what's happened to the gross balance sheet in the quarter, please? Perhaps excluding forex and the impact from credit spreads, if you've got that? And then finally just coming back to your comments on capital management without putting you on the spot, but can I read into that, that if there is a benign outcome on that on <mark type="ph" /> fees (1:06:10), and given your view that you're not currently interested in acquisitions, you may indeed look at the returning capital to shareholders over and above your current sort of earnings payout? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The line is not very good. I don't know if you hear me well. I had some difficulties hearing you, but I think I catch your questions. On the fixed income side, yes, you're right. It's a one-off, the changing of method. Until recently, the calculation of the net present value was done on swap. This is LIBOR three months curve basis, which became increasingly different from the curve based on the overnight interest swaps, the OIS. And since in fact at the beginning of the liquidity crisis the two curves have diverged with increasing liquidity cost on longer term maturities. Before the crisis they were literally at the same in fact, so nobody was caring from that.</p>
          <p>And the change, I mean it &#x2013; well, the change of the curve was <mark type="ph" /> a abuse (1:07:35) necessity for all the swaps that are collateralized because you get the collateral, so you have the day-to-day margin call, so you can place the margins day-after-day. So the overnight curve is more relevant than the three month swap. And so progressively, I think all the professionals have moved, including the exchanges have moved to this new way of calculating the values of the books. And so it's a big project because it refers to &#x2013; you have a lot of <mark type="ph" /> credit (1:08:13), support contracts who adapt with your counterpart and so on. So it was a lot of work, but we did it. We already did it on the fourth quarter of 2010 for equity derivatives, but it had virtually no impact. In fact, it just happened that the impact was negligible, and we did it for fixed income in the first quarter of 2011. And it's a one-off, yes. So your calculation is correct. Barring that, adjusted for that, fixed income had enjoyed a very good quarter, very good quarter.</p>
          <p>Now why? Well, just because they are very good. I mean, the business is growing. We have given a symbol of indications. We are in terms of bond origination, it was a quarter with a lot of new bond origination. It was &#x2013; we had a significant, in that booming market, we had a significant increase in our market share, and our debt-to-capital market, global market share. I mean global in terms of fees globally has increased from 2.7% in 2010 on average for the year to 3.3% in Q1 2011. So it seems small, but it's a big achievement. And the pool, the fee pool is very big. And this is used to boost an increase in our Western Europe presence, but also a significant increase in Central, Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa market positioning. I mean for those &#x2013; the issuers from those regions.</p>
          <p>And especially we have doubled, just to give you an example, we have doubled the proportion of overall European business denominated in U.S. dollars. We have really made a breakthrough in the dollar, and we are extremely happy. We have progressively built up a very stronger U.S. platform, and it's a good success. So this is why. And on the interest rate swap business, the business was very strong as well because when you have a lot of new issues, you have also a lot of interest for hedging and it creates flows on derivative side as well. So yes, it was a very good quarter. The balance sheet went slightly down in the quarter helped by the foreign exchange effect, and the capital management. Again, I'm not going to answer to your question because again I think we have to wait until the CC issue is completely clear before deciding.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I've got three questions, actually. So firstly wanted to start off with Personal Finance where most of the geographies were seeing improving cost of risk, with the exception of Spain and others. Just wanted to see if there was anything specific in these regions? Secondly, of course, the capital ratios have been benefited by or benefiting from the favorable FX, particularly the strength of euro-dollar. If that were to reverse would you have any hedges against that? And thirdly on equity derivatives, if there was any impact of the kind of short lived volatility spike that we had during the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the PF, yes, in Spain the situation is, I mean, while we are far from the spikes we had in the cost of risk in 2009 or even 2008 already, we have considerably improved the quality of the origination and strengthened just on that. But that being said, there is a lot of unemployment in Spain, and for consumer lender it's not an ideal situation. So yes, overall the cost of risk is coming down, but yet it's less so or not so in Spain for this quarter. But it's not, I don't think &#x2013; I think that doesn't change the trend, if you want, over all. On the capital ratio, yes, you're right that the capital ratios have been helped by the decline in the dollar, but not that much. We have calculated because there is an impact on the risk-weighted assets that are being shrunk by the fact that the dollar is lower compared to the euro. But we also have a negative impact on the numerator because the Tier 1 capital is also &#x2013; has also some link to the dollar through the forex differences. And you have seen that. We disclosed that. The forex difference has been reduced relatively significantly, even its impact on the Tier 1 is smaller than the total impact, but I'm not going to elaborate too much. But yes, we have both an impact <mark type="ph" /> a negative (1:14:19) or a decline in the numerator and the denominator because of the dollar decline.</p>
          <p>But it just happens that the net of that is an improvement of the ratio of roughly 5 basis points, 5 for 0.10 euros of change of the dollar versus the euro. So this quarter, in fact precisely the dollar loss between the &#x2013; lost 0.10 euros roughly between 1.33 euros or something like that at the end of 2010 and 1.43 euros at the end of March. So those 10 bps have helped the ratio by 5 basis points. So it's really small, if you want. This is not hedged, so because you can't hedge both the wealth of the company and the ratio. It's a bit complicated. So we have that exposure, but it's a small sensitivity, but it's a sensitivity. And yes, in case the dollar would become stronger we would have the reverse effect, again, 5 basis points for 0.10 euro in dollar &#x2013; in change in the dollar. Now equity derivatives. Yes, the market has been volatile in the first quarter, and especially following the earthquake in Japan. But we know we didn't have any significant impact from that, and even the higher volatility has boosted the demand for hedging flow products.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Mr. Bordenave. I have two, three questions mainly with an Italian focus. Looking at BNL, I see something quite unusual relative to local peers. I mean 5% of deposit outflow in one quarter coupled with 2.5 quarterly loan growth and flat 100 basis point cost of risk. It's quite an unusual mix versus the Italian peers. We obviously seen deposit outflows to large Italian banks, and we see not slow, but constant improvement in loan loss provisions over the last 18 months, which does not seems to be the case for BNL. The current 100 basis point cost of risk is some 20 bps above Italian peers, if you exclude UniCredit. And the recent business plan we got from Italian banks are guiding towards the 60 basis points in 2012, 2013, so to make it short, deposit outflows and no clear improvement in provision still running above the country. What's the reason? Is there anything strange in there in terms from the past? And why should BNL be one of the worst Italian trends we see at the moment? Secondly, on capital still remaining in Italy, you are cheaper than peers' cost of funding; is expected to be a major competitive advantage, in my view towards you penetrating your new markets, exactly like Italy. Given the recent wave of recapitalization in Italy, do you expect this to reduce your cost of funding benefit in the country? And more generally, what is your view on such action? How relevant is being the local regulator to push for that in Italy, and how does this compare with the attitude you're facing from the French regulator? The last question, do you consider a rating downgrade of France a possible event for this year? And how would this eventually affect your cost of funding? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see that you like Italy, Antonio. So BNL, we have &#x2013; well, deposit outflows is due to the fact that we have not followed the price war, the deposit war that started in Italy. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, clearly we see probably due to some difficulties in funding themselves outside of the borders of the country some more of Italian banks have considerably increased what they pay for deposit, especially that kind of volatile deposits from corporates or big institutions or municipalities or government and public institutions. And we have not done that because we don't desperately need for deposits like that. So we have tried and protect our top line, so this is why we had deposit outflows, and we accept that as &#x2013; because the core deposits, I would say, the deposits from the individuals are growing fast. On the provision side, probably the difference with some of the big Italian banks is the mix, if you want. Because in our &#x2013; in the BNL case we have market share in corporates and that is much bigger than our market share in mortgages and individual lending. And clearly, we &#x2013; and just what I've mentioned in the press release. And the proportion of corporate loans in our total loan is high; it's unusual. We have more than half. We have 39 billion euro of corporate loans compared to 32 billion euro of individual customer loans, so more than half of our loan book is made of corporate loans. And clearly, the improvement in Italy probably is coming on the individual side rather than the corporate side, I guess. And I guess this is why the trends are different on average.</p>
          <p>Then your second question about the cost, well the super reserve. As far BNL capitalization is concerned, of course, we have discussions, I mean with &#x2013; and I would say we had an agreement. We have an agreement with the Bank of Italy and our French supervisor. I mean, we are living under the relatively clear, but even complex network of relationship between the home supervisor and host supervisor in Italy. And the colleges of supervisors, so they are talking to each other, they are coming to agreements and we are following what they are asking us to do, and we don't have any specific change to that respect at the moment. So there is nothing to mention, nothing different to mention here compared with the situation in the previous years. And yes, the relatively low cost or lower cost of funding that we have both at the group level and also to a certain extent at the BNL level because BNL is one of the best rated banks, probably the best rated bank in Italy among the big ones. So well, yes, the cost of funding is for us clearly an advantage, and this is why we keep developing our business and our relationship with clients in Italy. And your third question about the rating downgrade of France. I mean, well, I'm not the right <mark type="ph" /> person (1:23:08) to answer to your question. You should ask the rating agencies. Well, it's not the most likely situation, I guess. I observe that the outlook is stable for the French republic with three of them.</p>

          <p>Just one question, if possible. Looking at the equity revenues in the first quarter, it was up 17% or 18% on the quarter. That seems to be a bit low compared to some of your peers, and also it's much below what you had in the first quarter last year. So I was wondering if you had any comments in that respect, what kind of explanation could there be? And a secondary question on Japan. You indicated that there was no impact on the equity business, but was there a little impact in the fixed income business, in your view? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Well, as far as Japan is concerned, really we were lucky enough not to be significant, well, not to be affected, in fact, in our businesses. So we don't have any problem on that front. As far as the equity revenues evolution is concerned Q1 versus Q4, frankly, while it's not something we are looking at that much. You know that we tend to look at the business comparing quarter with the quarter minus 4 rather than the &#x2013; but the first quarter of 2010, an element of your question is that the first quarter of 2010 had been the best in history for the business. It was 845 million euros. It was the best performance in history. So by definition, it was a big change compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. This quarter is a good quarter, maybe not the best in the history, but it's a good quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon again. Sorry, one more question and one follow-up. The question is on capital allocation for insurance businesses. This is sharply up 15 year-on-year or almost 10% quarter-on-quarter. Is there any specific reason? The second is the evolution of mortgaging funds. Many say that it is slowing down or it is going to slowdown very quickly and sharply. What's your view? And the last one is just a follow-up. When you mention Greek bonds and banking book, you said one small trading book it's okay because it's really mark-to-market. And you remain a 4.5 billion euro exposure on the banking book, but are we talking the same thing? This is also mark-to-market, of course, 5 billion euros, this is just mark-to-market for equity, but this number is already mark-to-market. Do we agree on that?</p>

          <p>When we get all those questions about the impact of restructuring, potential restructuring, or I don't know <mark type="ph" /> to what degree (1:27:28). I mean, I guess people have the P&amp;L in mind, especially I suppose. So this is why I mentioned that. That's why, but yes, I agree with you. I fully agree with you.</p>

What will be the stress test for this IFS portfolio on <mark type="ph" /> the goal (1:28:05)? It's wasn't very clear to me.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Well, up to now, well it's difficult to answer to your question about the stress test, but up to now the stress test we are filling a lot of templates, extremely detailed templates for the EBA. And we don't know yet completely what they are going to do with those figures. And they told us that they are going to tell us what the format of the publication, but we don't know it yet.</p>

So back to capital allocation in insurance. As far as the insurance business, the capital allocation is based on the insurance regulation, the so called, how do we call that? The...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. The minimum capital for insurance. So they have a special word that I have forgotten, but there is &#x2013; the solvency, minimum solvency something like for the insurance, according to the insurance regulation. And the &#x2013; so it's going up because the business is growing very fast. So the business enjoys a double-digit growth, as you can see by every standard, the revenues, the costs as well and the pre-tax earnings, everything. And in terms of size, in terms of capital requirements, they are growing by double digit figure as well, that's as simple as that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now the mortgaging front. Mortgage lending is growing, has continued to grow in the French market, while according to the French, to the Bank of France data, the French market in the first quarter of 2011 grew by 8% again in the French lending market for mortgages. And we grew slightly faster, 9%. So the market keeps growing. We are not expecting that market to slow down dramatically, maybe to slow down somewhat, but not dramatically because the situation in France is such that the demographics are good. And the number of children per woman is actually high compared with other countries in Europe.</p>
          <p>And there is a structural deficit of homes, of houses, if you want, compared with the need. It's mostly demographic and social trends because people tend to leave; the young people tend to get kind of small home relatively early. They leave their parents earlier and so on, but there is a structural deficit of homes in the French residential property market. And on top of that, France remains one of the European Union country with the lowest home ownership. So I think that there will be a sustainable growth in the home loan demand for loans. It's not just &#x2013; because there is structural supporting factors for that market.</p>
