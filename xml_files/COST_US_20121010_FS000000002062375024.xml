          <p>Good morning. My name is Tabitha and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End Operating Results for 2012 Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Thank you. Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tabitha. Good morning to everyone. This morning's report is our &#x2013; relates to our 17-week fourth quarter and fiscal &#x2013; 53-week fiscal year 2012 operating results, both which ended September 2. For comparison purposes the fiscal quarter and year are compared to last year's 16-week and 52-week periods for the prior fiscal year 2011.</p>
          <p>As with every conference call I'll start by stating that these discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, to begin with, our 17-week fourth quarter fiscal 2012 operating results, we reported earnings per share, of course, this morning of $1.39, up 29% from last year's reported fourth quarter earnings of $1.08. Sales for the quarter were up 14% which of course included the extra week in Q4 this year. Again, it's 17 weeks this year versus 16 weeks last year.</p>
          <p>Now comparable sale, which we do compare like 17-week periods both years, were up 5% on a reported basis and up 6% excluding gas and FX.</p>
          <p>Last year's fourth quarter results included a $32 million pre-tax LIFO charge that impacted last year's earnings per share by $0.04. This year's fourth quarter results included an $11.5 million pre-tax LIFO charge impacting this year's fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 a share.</p>
          <p>Several other items impacting the year-over-year fourth quarter comparisons of earnings include the following. First, the U.S. and Canada membership fee increase that took effect this fiscal year. This added approximately $26 million pre-tax or $0.04 per share in this year's fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Second, FX headwinds. Earnings from our foreign operations are converted into U.S. dollars when we consolidate and report our results. Year-over-year, in the fourth quarter, on average the foreign currencies where we operate weakened versus the U.S. dollar. This resulted in roughly a $20 million pre-tax or $0.03 per share after-tax hit, or impact, to this year's fourth quarter. That is assuming FX exchange rates were flat year-over-year, our foreign currency operating results in the fourth quarter when reported in U.S. dollars would have been higher by that amount.</p>
          <p>Third, our $900 million pay-down of 5.3% fixed rate debt this past March. This reduced our interest expense comparison year-over-year Q4 by approximately $15 million pre-tax or $0.02 per share.</p>
          <p>Fourth, as reported earlier on July 9, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our Costco Mexico operations. The impact to our fourth quarter 2012 P&amp;L was twofold. First, about a $0.02 per share benefit to fourth quarter 2012 for the extra earnings we now own, if you will. And second, a one-time charge of $8.3 million or $0.02 per share to our income tax line. This related to the dividend payment from Costco Mexico to Costco U.S. For the purposes of the year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter, these two items relating to the Costco Mexico purchase, were essentially a wash to earnings. The earnings accretion from our Costco Mexico acquisition will continue through the first anniversary of the transaction, or next July.</p>
          <p>And finally, a fifth item of comparison, we had an extra week of course this year in the fourth quarter: 17 weeks versus last year's 16 weeks. Simply dividing our fourth quarter earnings of $1.39 by 17 weeks, the positive impact to Q4 we estimate to be about $0.08 per share.</p>
          <p>For the fiscal year, net income came in at $1.709 billion or $3.89 per share. This compared to $1.46 billion or $3.30 per share in last year, fiscal 2011. Net earnings were up 17% in dollars and up 18% on an earnings per share basis.</p>
          <p>For the entire 2012 fiscal year, our LIFO charge was $20.5 million pre-tax or about a $0.03 hit to earnings. This compares to all of fiscal 2011 when it was an $87 million charge or a $0.12 hit to last year's earnings.</p>
          <p>Lastly on the FX front, the total negative impact of this year's sales was just under $600 million, and the earnings hit, if you will, assuming flat year-over-year FX rates would have been $31 million pre-tax or $0.04 per share.</p>
          <p>Sales for the fourth quarter, again our 17-week quarter as like weeks was up 5% and this included a U.S. number of up 6% and International up 2%. Excluding gas deflation, there was ever so slight deflation and a negative impact of FX. And the sales increase, comp sales increase, would be 6% for the total company as compared to the 5% reported. The U.S. would remain unchanged at 6%, again, very little impact, although there was minor gas deflation. And International, given the weakness in U.S. currencies &#x2013; the weakness in foreign currencies, international in local currencies, the reported 2% number would instead have been plus 7%.</p>
          <p>September sales results were reported last week on October 4. Briefly for the five-week September reporting period, U.S. comp sales came in at 6%, International at 7% and total company at 6%. And again, excluding the positive impact from gas and FX, U.S. comp sales on a normal basis if you will, were up 5%, International up 6% and total company up 5%. For September, the average ticket increased a little over 2% while frequency or traffic increased by about 4%.</p>
          <p>Other topics of interest, our opening activities and plans, we opened a total of 16 new warehouses during fiscal 2012. And again, that quarter ended on &#x2013; that fiscal year ended on September 2. Of those 16, 10 were new in the U.S., four in Japan and one each in Korea and Taiwan. In addition, we relocated one location during all of last fiscal year in Ontario, Canada. For fiscal 2013, our expansion activities include a plan for approximately 27 to 30 new locations with just under half of those in the United States and the remaining in the international markets.</p>
          <p>During the first four months of fiscal 2013, basically September through calendar year end here, we plan to open 14 new locations, almost the same number of new locations we opened in all of last year. Nine of these 14 will be in the U.S., three will be in Canada and one will be in each of England and Korea. I think most recently I'd mentioned that we've estimated 15 locations; one in Wheaton, Maryland has been delayed due to construction issues and we estimate it now to open in March or April.</p>
          <p>Also this morning, I'll go over Costco Online results and some recent activities, our membership trends, additional discussion about our operating results for the quarter, and our stock repurchase activities.</p>
          <p>On to a discussion for quarterly results, very briefly, sales for the fourth quarter again up 14%. Total sales at $31.5 billion this year in the fourth quarter versus $27.6 billion last year. For the quarter, our 5% reported comps were a result of a combination of an average frequency of traffic increase of 4.5% and a flat average transaction year-over-year. I mentioned earlier that we all of sudden have started to see quite a bit of a weakness in foreign currencies. That flat average transaction includes that impact, a negative impact of about 1.5% from FX so up a little assuming flat year-over-year FX rates. Overall for all of fiscal 2012, our average sales per warehouse for the 608 warehouses we have in operation on an annualized basis was $154 million, up 7% from the $146 million figure in fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>Moving on to sales by geography, for the fourth quarter, the strongest comp results in the U.S. were in the Northwest and the Midwest. All regions were fairly good, the range between the low and the high among regions was in the 4% to 8% range. Internationally, in local currencies, Canada, Korea, and Mexico were the strongest and Japan being the weakest. Japan mostly due to cannibalization resulting from the four new locations opened this past year in Japan.</p>
          <p>In terms of e-commerce, costco.com and costco.ca, sales were up 14% for the quarter and up 9% for the entire year. During the fourth quarter, as I think I mentioned, we're planning to &#x2013; as of the last quarterly report, during the fourth quarter we launched costco.com apps for both the Android and the Apple devices. And three weeks ago, on September 16, we transitioned costco.com and costco.ca sites to its new platform. The new platform certainly improves the visibility of the sites when using search engines and also we believe made several improvements to the sites from the end user perspective. And lastly, next week, we will open our new e-commerce site for the U.K., costco.co.uk. We go live next Monday, October 15.</p>
          <p>In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, softlines were the standout for the quarter, in the high single-digits. Within food and sundries, comps were in the positive mid-single-digits. Hardlines produced positive comps in the mid-single-digit range as well. Strongest sub categories within hardlines were hardware and lawn and garden which were in the very high single-digits. Consumer electronics produced positive comps in the mid-single-digits. Within the softlines, the strongest numbers were in small electrics and domestics. Lastly, all fresh foods comparable sales were up in the mid to high single-digit range with the strongest results in deli and produce. And on the inflation front, food and sundries, along with fresh foods continue to experience inflation in the low single-digit range.</p>
          <p>Moving down the line items of income statement, I'll start with membership fees. In the fourth quarter, membership fee income was $694 million or 2.21%. This is up 18% in dollars and up 7 basis points and representing an increase of $104 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from strong renewal rates rounding up to 90%, and in the U.S. and Canada and worldwide, 86%. We continue to experience increasing penetration of the executive membership. Incremental membership for the fee increase effective last November in the U.S. and Canada benefited the quarter by an estimated $26 million.</p>
          <p>The benefit from this will continue to show year-over-year increases throughout the four fiscal quarters of fiscal 2013 and into the first quarter of fiscal 2014. And that, of course, is based on the fact that we used deferred accounting to book those increases. Our new membership signups in the fourth quarter were up 2% year-over-year. Last year, in the fourth quarter, we opened 12 new locations including four in Asia and two in Australia. Those tend to have outsized new member signups through opening day. And that compares to six new openings this year in the fourth quarter which included two in Asia.</p>
          <p>In terms of the number of members at fourth quarter-end, and in terms of Gold Star, 26.7 million, up from 26.4 million at the end of the third quarter; primary Business, 6.4 million, both at the end of the third quarter and at fiscal year-end; add-on business, 3.8 million at year-end, that's up a little bit from 3.6 million at third quarter-end. So total households, 36.9 million at year-end, up from 36.4 million 17 weeks earlier. And with spouse cards, 67.4 million cardholders out there, up from 66.5 million a quarter ago.</p>
          <p>At the end of the fourth quarter we had 12.6 million Executive Members, which is an increase of about 245,000 or 2% since third quarter end and that's about 14,000 new Executive Members per week. Executive Members, as I mentioned, represent a little over a third of our member base and a little over two-thirds of our sales.</p>
          <p>In terms of renewal rates as I mentioned earlier, they continue to be strong. Business membership renewal rates ended the year at 93.7%, that's up a tick from 93.6% at the third quarter end. Gold Star, 88.7% at year end up a tick from 88.6% at the end of the third quarter. So total U.S. and Canada 89.7%, up a tick from 89.6%. And again as I mentioned worldwide 86.4%, up from 86.2% at the end of the third quarter. Based on our increasing U.S. and Canada renewal rates we believe that the last November's membership fee increase had little or no impact on our renewal rates which continued to move higher.</p>
          <p>In terms of gross margin, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 3 basis points coming in at 10.51% of sales this year in the fourth quarter, down from 10.54% a year earlier. I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers. We'll have six columns. Basically looking at the fourth quarter and the prior two quarters and each of those quarters will have two columns both reported and without gas impact being inflation in Q's 2 and 3 and a minor amount of deflation in Q4. Line items would be core merchandising, ancillary businesses, 2% Reward, LIFO, and total. So going across at core merchandise in Q2, reported minus 25 basis points year-over-year. And without gas inflation, minus 16. Q3, minus 21 reported and minus 14. In Q4 minus 10 and minus 10. Basically the Q4 columns will be the same in both columns because again while there was minor deflation it was very minor and didn't even change the basis point variances. Ancillary minus 2 reported plus 2 without gas &#x2013; I'm sorry.</p>
          <p>Let me correct that one. For the second quarter. Ancillary was minus 5 and minus 4 without gas. For the third quarter ancillary was plus 7 and plus 8. And for the fourth quarter, plus 1 and plus 1. 2% Reward, minus 2 and minus 3 in the second quarter. Minus 2 and minus 3 again in the third quarter. And minus 2 and minus 2 in the fourth quarter. LIFO, plus 2 and plus 2 in the second quarter. Plus 21 and plus 21 in the third quarter. Recall that last year in the third quarter we had the first sizable amount of LIFO. And in the fourth quarter, plus 8 and plus 8. And then total, in the second quarter of 2012 we reported gross margins down year-over-year of 30 basis points but without gas inflation it was minus 21. In the third quarter, we reported up 5 basis points total margin. Without gas inflation it would have been up 12. And in the fourth quarter, both reported and without that minor amount of gas deflation, minus 3 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now I'll focus my attention on the without gas column. Note again that in Q4 gas really didn't have an affect anyway. As you can see from these overall numbers the core merchandising gross margin in the fourth quarter was 10 basis points lower year-over-year. Actually a small relative improvement from the minus 14 in Q3 and the minus 16 in Q2 on the year-over-year comparison. Ancillary business gross margins contributed a small amount up 1 basis point. Unlike prior quarters where our gas business and again as inflationary price trends impacted the gross margin matrix it didn't really do a whole lot here in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On the core merchandising categories, food and sundries along with fresh foods were slightly higher. While nonfood categories hardlines and softlines margins were a bit lower. The 2% reward feature of Executive Membership was incremental higher or negatively impacted gross margin by 2 basis points, as I mentioned. And again LIFO while we did have a charge of $11.5 million this year, that compared to a $32 million charge in the fourth quarter last year. So that represented an 8 basis point improvement to our reported margin year-over-year. And we believe our margins are fine. Our inventories are clean. We had great fiscal year-end in fiscal inventory results. In all, as you know, heard from us in the past, we remain committed to driving top line sales as we enter the Christmas holiday season and into calendar 2013.</p>
          <p>Moving onto SG&amp;A. Our SG&amp;A percentage in the fourth quarter year-over-year were lower or better by 18 basis points coming in at 9.66% of sales in Q4 compared to 9.84% in last year's Q4. Again if you would jot down just a few numbers, the same six columns for second, third and fourth quarters, Operations, Core operations at central, Equity, RSUs and Total.</p>
          <p>So again going across for core operations in the second quarter we reported an improvement of plus 25 basis points. Plus means lower SG&amp;A. Without gas inflation it was plus 18. In the third quarter, plus 10 and plus 4. In the fourth quarter, plus 12 and plus 13. Central, in the second quarter, plus 5 and plus 4. In the third quarter, minus 8 and minus 9 and in the fourth quarter, plus 6 and plus 6. RSUs, minus 1 and minus 1 in the second quarter, zero and zero in both the third quarter and zero and zero in the fourth quarter and then total, for the second quarter year-over-year we reported SG&amp;A lower or plus 29 basis points. Without gas, plus 21. In the third quarter, plus 2 and minus 5 and in the fourth quarter, plus 18 and there is a bit of rounding to plus 19.</p>
          <p>So again, that's the matrix that I'll talk about. In terms of a little editorial here, again, operations were lower or better by 12 basis points year-over-year as reported, excluding the negative impact of very slightly deflationary gasoline, the core was actually better by 13. Within core operations, our payroll as a percent of sales improved year-over-year in the fourth quarter by 6 basis points with a 2 basis point offset to the healthcare cost lines.</p>
          <p>Our central expenses were better year-over-year or lower by 6 basis points. This is notwithstanding higher year-over-year IT costs related to our IT modernization efforts to our systems that we have embarked on. Overall, continued focus I think on expense reduction or expense improvement. And we think that was evident in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>I will make one other comment on the income statement, in terms of formatting, you may note or probably haven't noted yet, that we have combined our former income statement line item provision for impaired assets and closing costs within SG&amp;A because of its immaterial amount. I will mention that in the fourth quarter of 2011 we had a charge of $2 million in the quarter on that line so that's added to SG&amp;A. In Q4 2012 we had a minor charge of a few hundred thousand dollars. So both minor and historically very minor. We'll reclassify accordingly.</p>
          <p>In terms of factors that will impact SG&amp;A in 2013, the main items will continue to be sales trends, healthcare costs, and gasoline sales and inflation in terms of percentages and the increasing penetration of certain of our international operations, which generally have lower overall SG&amp;A percentages. In terms of the next line item, pre-opening expenses, pre-opening expenses were $22 million last year in the quarter as compared to $15 million this year, so $7 million lower or 3 basis points better. Note, as I mentioned earlier, last year we had 12 openings in the quarter compared to six this year. All told operating income in the fourth quarter was up just under 25% year-over-year from $762 million last year in the quarter, to $949 million this year, an increase of $187 million. Again, this includes the benefit of the extra week and the other items mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>In terms of interest and other, below the operating income line, reported interest expense was lower year-over-year by $14 million with Q4 2012 coming in at $22 million versus $36 million in last year's fourth quarter. These amounts again mainly reflect the interest expense on the previously $2 billion offering in February of 2007. $900 million of that, of course, on this past March 15 was paid off. And again, the anticipated pre-tax interest savings given that we're essentially paying off 5 plus percent debt and foregoing interest income on cash that's earning sub 50 basis points. That's around $46 million pre-tax a year. For the fourth quarter this represented a reduction in interest expense of $15 million. Again, on an annual basis that's about $46 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of interest income and other, it was lower year-over-year by $8 million. That's already coming in at $38 million this year in the quarter versus $46 million last year. It was lower year-over-year largely due to income last year in the fourth quarter related to gains on nonfunctional currencies held by certain of our foreign operations. Primarily this represented the U.S. dollars that were being held in Costco Mexico, which of course, in Mexico is their nonfunctional currency. Historically we'd always &#x2013; we and our partner had always kept a portion of our cash expressed in dollars. And again, we benefit on that given the weakening peso during this period of time. Overall reported pre-tax income was up 25%, from $772 million last year to $965 million this year.</p>
          <p>Tax rate, our company's reported tax rate this quarter came in at 35.6%. This is about 30 basis points higher than last year's fourth quarter rate of 35.3%. The income tax recorded due to the Costco Mexico dividend, the $8.3 million amount, accounted for about 85 basis points of our fourth quarter 2012 tax rate, and this was offset by year-over-year &#x2013; this was offset year-over-year by increasing earnings attributed to our foreign operations, again, which generally have had a little lower rate.</p>
          <p>Now for a quick rundown of a few other items. The balance sheet was included in the press release this morning. Some of you have asked me for the depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, it was $292 million, which then for the year was $908 million. We always look at our accounts payable ratios; on the balance sheet, it shows an improvement from 99% AP as a percent of inventories last year to 103%. A big chunk of that difference there would be the payables on non-merchandising payables given all the construction activities we have going on. So if we take out that and just look at just merchandising payables and merchandising inventories, it was about the same year-over-year: 91% last year and 90% this year at quarter end.</p>
          <p>Average inventory per warehouse was up $458,000 or about 4%. Last year in the quarter, at fourth quarter end, our average inventory per warehouse was $11.2 million and this year, $11.67 million. Electronics was about half of that, a little over half of that, $240,000, as we've been experiencing improving sales trends in that department. And as you know, we continue to focus on the bigger ticket items, selling lots of things like 60-inch and 80-inch TVs. The remaining balance of the variance is spread among many departments, again, good inventory showing we believe and good fiscal year end inventory results.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, in the fourth quarter we spent $580 million and for all of 2012, just a shade under $1.5 billion. In fiscal 2013, our CapEx is actually climbing quite a bit given the increased level of new openings as well as investment in operations and infrastructure such as depots in both Japan and Taiwan along with increased investment in IT relating to our systems modernization projects that I mentioned earlier. Our current estimate for CapEx in fiscal 2013 as compared to the $1.5 billion last year is somewhere in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion.</p>
          <p>In terms of our dividend, earlier in May, we increased our quarterly dividend 14.5% from $0.24 per share, or $0.96 a share on an annual basis, to $0.275 a share per quarter or $1.10 per share annualized. This annualized dividend amount represents a total cost to the company of just about $480 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of expansion, quarterly, we expect to open nine warehouses in the first quarter which ends in late November and an additional six in the second quarter, most of which, again, is before &#x2013; all but one of which I believe is before calendar year end. In the third quarter which stretches from roughly mid-February to roughly mid-May, seven and in the fourth quarter, the 16 weeks from roughly mid-May to the end of August, eight. That would bring us to 30 for the year. Now that's the budget, as I mentioned earlier, we're talking about 27 to 30. And inevitably, there's always a few that fall out, but happy to report that we've got a lot going on between now and calendar year end. Assuming we added the 30, on a base of 608, that would be about a 5% square footage growth, which would certainly be our largest square footage expansion in years. Also as of fiscal year end, our total square footage was 86,937,000 square feet.</p>
          <p>In terms of stock repurchases, for the year, we purchased 7.3 million shares at average price of $84.75, bringing total expenditures over the last several years &#x2013; over the entire fiscal year to $617 million, which I believe is about the same as &#x2013; roughly the same, within $10 million or $20 million of the amount we spent in 2011.</p>
          <p>With that, as always, we'll have a supplemental information packet that will be posted on the Costco Investor Relations site later this morning.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it back over to Tabitha for Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Well this is very general. I mean, probably the standout areas are things like protein, pork, beef and poultry. And the anticipation is over the next several months given some of the issues with wheat and corn that that will continue to go up. Some of the bakery raw materials for the same reason will go up and these &#x2013; they're still talking in the mid-single digit or a little higher range but that's a guess at this point. Don't hear a lot on the other areas.</p>
          <p>In fact, in just the first month, if you will, of this fiscal year in September, we saw essentially company-wide, as reflected through the LIFO calculation, of almost exactly flat. I mean 1 basis point of inflation. And there was a little bit again less &#x2013; well less than a half a percentage point in the food and sundries categories and a little bit of deflation in things like apparel and electronics. And again, the apparel has more to do I think with some of those prices are down from a year ago when they were quite high and still higher than a few years ago. So if you add it all up, modest inflation is the expectation with it being geared more towards some of the fresh food items and raw material food ingredients.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I guess about handling the pass through, do you guys expect to pass everything through or &#x2013; I mean I think you said the margin on food and sundries was up for the quarter right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Generally, look, sometimes we do and sometimes we don't. Generally speaking, things like refrigerated fresh foods, meat and things like that, those prices change daily and weekly. Certainly the input costs change daily and weekly in some cases and the sales prices. I mean we, like everyone in the fresh foods business, are price checking our competition and adjusting accordingly. Now as you know from history, there have been times when we're not going to change the cost of a 16 pack of muffins or the cost of slice of pizza when cheese went up. But generally speaking there's not those outsize areas. Now that being said also, things like fresh meat are &#xFC;ber-competitive and we're out there where we can gain a little strength in that area is the higher end cuts of beef and some of the organic aspects of beef where we can show a greater savings and make a little better margin. But those are still small percentages of the total sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I'm just looking at expansion over the longer term. Obviously 27 to 30, as you said, is the largest you guys have done. But what would you say is the principal bottleneck when it comes to club expansion when you get to that high upper 20s range? And then what would you say is maximum amount of clubs to add within a year that you can execute at a high level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean we've always, as you know, been hands on and I think &#x2013; I'm guessing operationally the collective view is we can easily handle 30, the challenge is operationally. The bottleneck really has been ourselves in terms of &#x2013; one, it takes a little longer to find and develop sites in some of these foreign countries like Asia and subject to other appeal processes. There are some countries where the competitors can appeal you just to appeal you and slow you down and &#x2013; which isn't very nice. But at the end of the day I think we've got a lot more in the pipeline, finally. We have more people devoted to real estate. We have people on the ground physically in I believe every country over the last couple of years. And so again the pipeline is more filled. I think that's evidenced in the amount that we're doing in some of these countries where it does take longer like some of the Asian countries, Australia and the like. So I think the bigger bottleneck was us and it's finally picking up a little bit.</p>

          <p>Hi.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to go through a couple things with you. Start with on the fuel. Can you talk about how profitable fuel was in the quarter and what the comp gallons were?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the profitability we really never talk about how profitable it is. We talk about how it is year-over-year when there's outsized changes to it because it can fluctuate quite a bit. Actually on a quarter-over-quarter basis year-over-year it was pretty &#x2013; less than a penny I think of difference, so really nothing to speak of there. As you know when prices are going down, profits are up. And there was some of that both this fiscal quarter as well as in the fourth quarter of last year. So both quarters had some pretty good profits year-over-year. And in terms of &#x2013; Chuck the other question was...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fuel comparable gallons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, our comp gallons in the fourth quarter were 6%. And that compares to 8% in Q3, quite a bit more in September, for whatever reason. I guess because prices were going back up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>

          <p>Yeah, that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Now, with the &#x2013; what was finished &#x2013; or excuse me at the end of fiscal year, what was your square footage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see here. Yeah, it was 86.937 million. 86 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you're looking at the nice performance you had, Richard, in the fourth quarter, what elements of the gross profit margin and the SG&amp;A, especially SG&amp;A improvement, do you think are sustainable into the new year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the easiest sustainable things for the next few quarters are those things that we've done like the debt pay down, the Mexico acquisition, and the membership fee increase and how that affects deferred accounting, so all those things are, they are permanent for a year. They continue for a year and then it's part of the base.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, I mean I think that we &#x2013; sales drive &#x2013; you always heard from us we're a top-line company. Certainly our sales strength &#x2013; relative sales strength has helped us here. I think the focus on little things, I've thrown out some examples over the last months and quarters about the past year. One of the focus items is overtime hours. And I think we showed for the first 40 or so weeks of the fiscal year, in one of our budget meetings, that while aggregate hours were up 3.5% or so for the year, overtime hours were down 25%. Not a lot of money, maybe $10 million, $15 million a year, but it's real. And maybe it goes over &#x2013; maybe you don't get it all first year. You get it over a couple years. But those are things that we see out there.</p>
          <p>Is that sustainable? I mean what's sustainable is our efforts to do it. I think on the margin side, as I've said in the past, it's more us than them whoever them is who we're completing with them. We tend to be proactive in it. We've been asked about the question now that come some of the quote, "Investing in price," is starting to anniversary from when it was being discussed a year ago, does that mean it's over or there's more of it? Again, we don't talk about that. I can assure you that when things are good we're going to continue to do things to drive the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks. And a couple more things Richard, Do you have a full year fuel sales figure that you can give us at this time? And can you comment on what the spike in retail gasoline prices in California on the fuel prices there, what's that doing to traffic and gasoline sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have anything specific on the total dollars. I think for the year it was like 12% or so of sales. The craziness in California had to do with all the moons lined up bad. And there was several days there of incredible supply shortage. As you would expect, we are a major consumer`. I think in the greater L.A. market we have close to 40 locations. And at the peak, or at the trough I guess, we had 16 or so of those stations closed for one or two days. Happily, that ended, I believe, Sunday, this past Sunday, and we're back to normal generally.</p>
          <p>The impact to us was &#x2013; again, it did get people &#x2013; my sense was, is what I heard was is that it was a little bit of a concern that there's gas shortage everywhere and people were topping off their tanks, so it created more volume. We saw a little bump in sales at those locations in-store. But we were also, in some cases, losing money at the gas pump. So my guess is it wasn't a big impact to us on the bottom line. We lost money, no doubt, in gas and made money with a few extra cars in the parking lot coming to get gas. It's really a blip for a few days in Southern California.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard. This is Nathan Rich filling in for Deb today. I wanted to go back to the decision that you guys made to accelerate club growth. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on where the international expansion is going to come in terms of what markets you're focused on and also, are there any new markets internationally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the markets &#x2013; in Canada, we open a couple, three a year, sometimes one, maybe three, but probably two to three on average. In Mexico, we'll probably speed it up a little. Over the last five years, I think we've opened two locations, so 0.4 locations a year historically over the last five years. It's going to take a little time here, but I would expect that to grow at least two or three a year starting after this year. We've got one or two in the U.K. this year after a few years of no growth. But the big expansion for us continues to be in the three Asian countries where we're at, Korea, Taiwan and Japan, and Australia.</p>
          <p>Now all those countries take a little longer because of the complexity. These are building up, not out, multi-floors and it takes a little longer. But again, we've got the pipeline full. The only other things we talked about is Europe, and I can't &#x2013; we are pursuing in a couple of Western European countries. And if all goes well, maybe five years from now, we'll have a few locations open in each. I cannot tell you whether it's going be 12 months or 30 months before our first opening in any country over there. It's just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then also if I can ask a question, it seems like you saw some improvement in food margin, both food and sundries and fresh foods. Those have been trending flat to down over the past several quarters. I was just wondering kind of what caused the change in trend this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Without looking deep into it, my guess is some of it has to do with the fact it was a year ago when we were explaining that there were some anecdotal comments I made probably, about the fact that we maintained pricing on some highly inflationary cost items like the Food Court with cheese pizza, like the bakery, and so part of that is I think just the cycling of perhaps some unusual things the other way.</p>
          <p>But &#x2013; I think a little of it, not a lot of it, but a little bit has to do with increasing penetration in some fresh food items with the KS, the Kirkland Signature name. Some of it has to do with the comment I mentioned earlier about organic. These are small things, but there is more and more of them. And if we can take $20 million to $30 million out of a few hundred million dollars a year of ground beef sales from a highly competitive basic ground beef item and put it into organic, that's good for us, because we can sell it because we have that kind of member. It's good for us because that member sees &#x2013; it's you say a higher price point item, but the member sees an even greater relative value because those are the items that aren't as competitive out there. So we can provide the customer more and do more. So all those things I think add up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just lastly, if I could, I'm interested to hear what you're seeing in terms of early selling for fall and holiday, and if you could comment on TVs in particular, which I think have been pretty good for you recently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the latter, the TVs have been strong the last couple of months that we reported. In large part I think because we focus on the higher end or the bigger ticket size. And we're doing a lot &#x2013; we have a lot of TV strength, if you will, in the 60 to 80-inch TVs, so the bigger, we do a little better on those. On seasonal, again it's still early, so far so good. I don't think there's been anything outlandish plus or minus in hearing from the buyers in the last month of budget meetings. We'll have a little more color at the end of October, which is really the more meaningful month.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi Richard. I was just going to ask you on the inflation side, you mentioned sort of a low single-digit increase this quarter for food and sundry. If you looked across the box, can you just give us a feel for that? Are we talking 1% to 2% range across the store right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Low tenths of a single-digit. It's closer to 1 so not a whole lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's across the store. And then just -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's all over the board. I mean, I was just looking at some items, I mean these are &#x2013; again, these are anecdotal items but year-over-year, eggs are up 22%. I'm looking down the list here. Blueberries up 37% year-over-year. Conversely, you've got items, always you're going to have some electronics items but beyond electronics items I can't tell you why, bacon down 17%, gasoline down a couple percent. So it's all over the board. But overall when you take the whole basket of things, up very little for the month on annual basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just thinking about moving forward you could see mid-single digit type inflation on the food side again. Does that translate across the store to something again that's maybe a couple hundred bps less than that, just given the other categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not necessarily. First of all, there's no &#x2013; when we talk about mid-single digit inflation, I was really talking about things like the expectations that our buyers have for things like meat and poultry and pork which again are more of the extreme inflation categories in terms of talking amongst the buyers. Again, food overall is by no means that level and then, of course, as I mentioned there are a few things that are ever so slightly deflationary right now like apparel and electronics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really there's &#x2013; I mean and my guess is inflation is going be very, very low single digits this year as we know them today. Life can change tomorrow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just maybe for a minute on the competitive side, are you seeing anything that's noteworthy versus this time last year in terms of how your club competitors are pricing and/or traditional grocers out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one housekeeping thing was on the FX impact for membership income. I was getting to around $7 million impact roughly. Does that make sense to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; hold on a second. I think that's close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hold on a second. Yeah, $8 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>$8 million. Okay, great. And then just lastly, with the new store openings accelerating and trying to go a bit more international in terms of the mix there, is it possible, Richard, to give us just an understanding a little bit of the pre-opening expense for international versus a U.S. store generically? And also on the CapEx side given the step up, is there a way to bucketize that in terms of X amount goes towards IT versus new stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has more to do &#x2013; the international generally is more &#x2013; it could be &#x2013; these are &#x2013; if you took the number of openings, there's other things that are pre-opening too like when we add a gas station or we open a depot or we open all those kinds of things. So generally speaking, this goes back several years but it used to be like U.S. warehouse was a million, plus or minus a little and international, I say international outside of North America might have been as much as a million and a half or a million and three quarters. Those are guesses. Yes, it's more in some of those countries but a big chunk of pre-opening is not just the &#x2013; you can't take pre-opening divided by number of warehouses and say that's the average per warehouse because you have a lot of other pre-openings. Every time we add a gas station that's going to &#x2013; it's a new operation. We've done it consistently from day one but there's lot of other things in there as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the CapEx side as well, Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the CapEx side as well, in terms of the cost for a warehouse domestic versus international generically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably 20% to 30% more on average. Sometimes there will be wide ranges. I mean, I think we said in the U.S. and Canada generally that land, building and site where we own is somewhere in the low to mid-30s. My guess is overseas it could be in the low-40s on average. But it could range from mid-30s to high-50s. I mean, all over the board but as you know, some of those higher numbers we could get a better return on investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And maybe just the last thing if I could ask it is on Affordable Care Act and what you all are hearing right now and doing to prepare for that. Is there anything you can share in terms of the percentage of your employees that would be covered today or the percentage of the coverage that you all provide? Or anything there would be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we provide as much if not more than anybody else I know in our space, in general big retail. All of our employees, both part-time and full-time are covered. It takes three to six months currently depending on if you're part-time or full-time. Each year, for the last two or three years, and certainly this year and next year under different parts of the new healthcare requirements, there's been some additional input numbers into our expense. One year it's covering people up to 26 years old. One year it's mental health parity. One year it's &#x2013; I forget the other ones off the top of my head. But at the end of the day, each of these things seem to have added an incremental 1% or 1.5% to our already outsized number. So we don't think it's going have a big impact to us like it may to others. But others may do some things that it may be less of an impact to them. I don't know. But it's fair to say from our perspective, it's kind of been built into our numbers and we've been able to handle it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Richard. It's actually Justin Kleber on for Pete. Just a question on the membership fee income. Can you help us understand how much that line item benefited from the extra week?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the simplest way to do it and this is not exact but I'd first take this number this year and subtract the $26 million from it. Because we know the $26 million is the deferred accounting for the fee increases. And from that number, I'd say okay this is 17 week number so I divide it by 17 and I'd subtract that amount from that number and then I'd compare the two, the adjusted number. And I think what you'll get something in the 6% or 7% increase range in dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then the $26 million of incremental NFI from the fee increase that you cited here in the fourth quarter does that absolute dollar number, should we expect that to build over the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And it'll build &#x2013; well, it'll build a little bit in Q1. Recognizing Q1 is a 12-week quarter versus a 17-week quarter. So but in absolute dollars, it'll build a little. It'll build quite a little bit more in Q2. It'll build &#x2013; then it'll start going the other way. But still pretty sizable numbers in each of these four fiscal quarters. It's $0.03 to $0.05 a quarter in each of these four quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And just any color on as it relates to traffic conversion rate, average ticket size, from the replatforming of the online business? Or is it just simply too early to tell with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's very simply too early. It's been a week or so. And the thing I'm most happy about is, is there weren't any big glitches and we got it converted in about an eight-hour period closing the old site, opening the new one. And so, we'll see over time.</p>

          <p>All right, great. Just lastly, housekeeping question here, within that interest income and other line item, do you have what the interest component of that was?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hold on. Actual interest income was almost $15 million last year and $16.3 million this year, so up $1.3 million.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, Richard. Just on the new store growth going up to 25 to 30 clubs, should we expect that pace to continue to grow over the next few years? And it's been a while since I've heard you guys talk about a longer-term club target. But with growth in Europe, Australia and more growth in Korea, Japan and Taiwan, can you maybe refresh us on kind of where your thoughts are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, given our history over the last several years of under opening locations, I think we feel very good about this coming year in the very high 20s. And we're looking at numbers. We had a slide recently that showed over five years somewhere in the 125 to 150 locations, which would imply 25 to 30 a year. Europe, again, if all goes well, maybe we'll have five years from now, five or six in Europe, or eight on the outside but more likely five or six. That's if it continues to progress. There are still a few hurdles to get over there in terms of timing. We will be there, is my sense, but it will take some time.</p>
          <p>I think again part of the &#x2013; as I mentioned earlier, part of the perhaps the renewed level of confidence that we've got, we've got a lot more irons in the fire, particularly in those countries where the lead time to get openings done, you got to work on more projects to get more open even though it takes a little longer. Again, for the last year or two, we've had people on the ground in some of these countries where historically we didn't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then we look at the complexion of your margin structure here in the fourth quarter, of course profit margins were down a little bit but SG&amp;A levered. You produced some pretty nice operating margin expansion of about 19 basis points. When you take a step back and look at your long-term earnings algorithm, is that a good recipe for success for you guys? Is that the kind of structure you kind of want to build out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the ideal world, as I think Jim said 25 years ago, that we'd sell things. The membership fee would be a lot higher. We'd keep lowering expense percentages and we'd keep lowering prices. But ideally, yes, we want to keep doing that because it makes us more competitive and keeps driving the business and puts a bigger wedge between us and others. But we're also realistic. But yeah, mission-wise that's fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My last question is just, I think I ask this every call, but you guys really do continue to build up cash on the balance sheet and we get a lot of questions from investors about what you're going to do with it. I realize buy-backs are steady pace for you guys. But are there any thoughts from the board to really step up the dividend? It's a lot lower than some of your peers despite having a much stronger cash and overall balance sheet position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, I mean, yield-wise it is. We continue to grow it at whatever, 13% or 14% a year. We always discuss it informally about what should we do But there's not a great sense of pressure to change our MO at this point. Probably the biggest pressure point is to spend more money on CapEx. I'm glad to see the fact that it's a number that went from the range of 1.4-ish the last few years to approaching 2 this year. I think that in 2014, if we continue to expand like we are, maybe it's about the same as this current year's budget. If it's a little less it's only because some of the unusual things we're doing this year like a couple of extra depots in some of these new countries. So overall, getting that number up 400 million or 500 million from where it has been, that helps.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. I did hop on a couple minutes late. But, could you guys just remind me of what the quarter on quarter gross profit margin was this quarter and walk through some of the categories within that outside of gas? I'd appreciate it. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In terms of margins, for the quarter, the core was down 10 basis points year-over-year. And with or without gas it's the same. There was minor gas deflation, but not enough to affect the basis points. So core was down 10. Ancillary was up 1. 2% was down 2 implying about a 1% increase in sales penetration of those numbers. LIFO was up 8 because of a lower charge this year versus last year. You add it all up and that's our reported and as adjusted with gas minus 3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then within that core, the 10, any major differences between the other four major subcategories?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, food and sundries and fresh foods were up a little. Hardlines and softlines were down a little. More than a little, but not a lot.</p>
