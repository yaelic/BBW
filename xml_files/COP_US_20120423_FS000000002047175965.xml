          <p>Welcome to the Q1 2012 ConocoPhillips earnings conference call. My name is Kim, and I will be your operator for today's call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Please note that this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Mr. Clayton Reasor, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations. Mr. Reasor, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kim. Good morning and welcome to ConocoPhillips' first quarter 2012 earnings conference call, our final conference call as an integrated company. Today, we'll focus on key financial and operating results for the first quarter as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2012. I'm joined by Jeff Sheets, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>As in the past, you can find our presentation material on the Investor Relations section of the ConocoPhillips website. And in addition, you can also find some presentation material that we've recently put out on each of the standalone companies, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66.</p>
          <p>Please read the Safe Harbor statement on the bottom of this slide. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our filings with the SEC.</p>
          <p>So that said, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to take you through our first quarter results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clayton.</p>
          <p>I'll start with some highlights for the first quarter. During the quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion. That's $2.02 a share. This is flat from the prior quarter and up from $1.82 per share in the first quarter of 2011. If you look back, in the first quarter of 2011 we had the same level of earnings that we did in the last quarter, but we saw a $0.20 per share improvement, and that reflected the impact of our ongoing share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Our annualized return on capital employed was 12%. We generated $4.2 billion in cash from operations. That's $3.23 a share.</p>
          <p>In E&amp;P, our production was 1.64 billion BOE per day, which was 3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2011. And if you compare that to the first quarter of 2011, our production per share increased by 9%.</p>
          <p>We had seasonally strong refining utilization of 91% globally. And during the quarter, we closed the sale of our interest in Vietnam, and we funded $1.9 billion in share repurchases. And that brings the total of share repurchases since we started the program in 2010 to around $17 billion. And as of today, we're about a week away from the distribution of the Phillips 66 shares to our shareholders, and we're executing the remaining steps of this transaction this week and right on target to complete on May 1.</p>
          <p>So let's turn to slide three and look at our earnings in more detail. Reported earnings for the quarter were $2.9 billion. This includes gains on asset sales of $987 million, offset by $562 million of impairments and $95 million of repositioning costs. The gains were mostly related to the sale of the Vietnam business. And the impairments were primarily related to the Mackenzie Gas Project and the associated leaseholds. Adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion were flat with the first quarter of last year. But as I mentioned, they were 10% higher on a per share basis as a result of our share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>E&amp;P adjusted earnings were $2.1 billion, and R&amp;M adjusted earnings were $444 million during the first quarter. And our other segments together provided an additional $32 million of earnings. But Chemicals had a record quarter, and we're going to provide more details about that later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>So next we'll look at some more detail on our segment earnings, and we'll start with E&amp;P production, which is on slide four. Our first quarter production was 1.64 million BOE per day. That's down 65,000 BOE per day from the first quarter of last year. If you exclude the impacts of dispositions and the suspension of our operations at Peng Lai field in Bohai Bay, our production would have been 9,000 BOE per day more than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Our growth opportunities are performing well, and we continue to execute on our plans to exploit the unconventional resources in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian, and Oil Sands. Our unconventional plays have contributed 85,000 BOE per day compared to a year ago. These growth opportunities are part of the 47,000 BOE increase shown on the slide. We also had less downtime and slightly increased production from Libya, which improved production. And these improvements more than offset our normal field declines. The suspended operations at Peng Lai combined with asset dispositions and the decline in our Russia and Naryanmarneftegaz production reduced production by about 94,000 BOE per day. And on the natural gas side, compared to the first quarter of 2011, North American natural gas production was 18,000 BOE per day lower, with about half of that coming from curtailments.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn to the E&amp;P earnings on slide five. E&amp;P results benefited from strong crude prices. However the strength in crude prices was offset by weakness in North American natural gas markets as well as NGL prices and a widening spread between crude oil and bitumen prices. Our E&amp;P adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.1 billion, slightly lower than the first quarter of last year. As this slide five illustrates, $156 million of after-tax impact, we had that due to higher prices and other market factors, and that was offset by about $225 million decreased associated with lower volumes.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., earnings in the first quarter of 2012 were $158 million higher than a year ago. This reflects the improvement in domestic crude prices, but this was offset by significantly lower Henry Hub gas prices. Henry Hub averaged $2.72 this quarter, which was 34% lower than it was a year ago.</p>
          <p>Year over year, we saw reduced earnings in our international business. International was impacted this quarter by lower crude sales volumes and, again, significantly lower gas prices in Canada. AECO prices averaged $2.15 per million BTUs this quarter, which was 44% lower than a year ago.</p>
          <p>So let's move to slide six and I'll talk about some of our E&amp;P unit metrics. As we just discussed on the previous slide, we saw strong crude prices, but this was offset by weakness in North American natural gas, NGL prices, and widening bitumen differentials. We produced around 110,000 barrels per day of NGLs in North America in the first quarter, and margins on this production were impacted by the fact that NGL prices did not move up as crude prices moved up. In addition, our first quarter results were adversely impacted by about $85 million after tax from differences between production and sales volumes and some other timing impacts. So year over year, these timing impacts and the weakness of natural gas and the relative weakness of NGLs and bitumen prices along with some higher taxes kept per barrel margins flat with the same quarter a year ago.</p>
          <p>So although we saw this disconnect between NGL and bitumen prices and crude prices in the recent quarter, this doesn't change our long-term view about our ability to grow cash margins as we shift capital towards higher margin production. As we've mentioned in our recent investor updates, we expect cash margins to grow 3% to 5% per year over the next five years in a flat price environment.</p>
          <p>So that completes our E&amp;P segment results. Now let's take a look at our R&amp;M segment results, which are on slide seven. First quarter R&amp;M adjusted earnings were $444 million or $36 million less than the same period a year ago. In comparing the periods, R&amp;M earnings were negatively impacted primarily by lower refining margins and some higher turnaround expenses. This was offset by higher earnings from volumes and improved marketing margins in the U.S. And we ran higher volumes at some of our Mid-Continent refineries, where the margins were the strongest.</p>
          <p>So overall, despite improved market crack spreads, refining margins decreased primarily due to less favorable crude differentials in Europe and the Gulf, East, and West Coast regions and some lower secondary product margins. Turnaround expenses were $176 million pre-tax, and that's in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>So we can move to the next slide and look at the R&amp;M per barrel metrics. First quarter 2012 income per barrel was $1.80, and the cash contribution was $2.62. The per barrel metrics for R&amp;M were similar to a year ago and up compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, R&amp;M benefited from both the more favorable crude differentials and improved market crack spreads, which together drove significantly improved refining margins and higher adjusted earnings.</p>
          <p>So we continue to look for ways to improve our margins in this space through capturing more advantaged crudes and increasing clean product yield. Our clean product yield of 84% was flat with the prior quarter and 1% improved compared to the same period a year ago. Wood River drove about 40% of this improvement in the clean product yield post the core implementation in the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Next we'll take a look at some of the results from our other operating segments on slide nine. Adjusted earnings increased in both our Chemicals and Midstream segments. Chemicals earnings were $218 million during the quarter. This record quarter reflects the very strong margin environment. Industry margins for ethylene during the first quarter were among the highest recorded in 20 years. With domestic ethylene utilization rates north of 100%, CPChem was able to capture these margins. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, Chemicals earnings improved by $25 million, due primarily to higher olefins and polyolefins margins and volumes, which were partially offset by lower margins and volumes in specialties, aromatics, and styrenics.</p>
          <p>Midstream earnings of $93 million were more than 25% over a year ago, primarily due to higher gathering and processing volumes. In the first quarter of 2011, we had significant reductions due to severe weather which we didn't see in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Adjusted corporate expenses were $265 million for the first quarter of 2012. That's $39 million improved compared to a year ago, primarily due to lower net interest expense and benefit related expenses. Excluded from these adjusted corporate expenses were about $95 million in repositioning costs.</p>
          <p>Let's go to slide 10 and look at our cash flow for the first quarter. We generated $4.2 billion in cash from operations during the quarter and closed the sale of our Vietnam business unit, resulting in proceeds of a little over $1 billion. During the first quarter, we funded a $4.4 billion capital program. $4.2 billion of that was directed to E&amp;P and around $200 million to R&amp;M. And E&amp;P capital for the quarter included over $500 million in exploration and Gulf of Mexico leaseholds.</p>
          <p>I want to explain an impact on our cash flow having to do with how we account for assets that we will be selling later in the year and that we've moved to the held-for-sale category during the second quarter. The impact of that is that when you look at the other line in the cash flow from operations segment, you'll see a negative, and $450 million of this negative was as a result of moving assets to a held-for-sale category. This was offset by a $450 million positive that is in the working capital line. So were it not for these changes, you would have seen a working capital for the quarter that was negative by about that amount.</p>
          <p>If you look across all the segments, almost all the cash from operations &#x2013; really all of the cash from operations this quarter came from our E&amp;P operations. R&amp;M cash from operations were consumed by working capital changes. In our Chemicals joint venture, CPChem has begun retaining cash in order to fund a complete retirement of their debt balances later this year.</p>
          <p>We also paid $2.7 billion in shareholder distributions. That's split between the $1.9 billion of share repurchases and $843 million in dividends, and these share repurchases accounted for 25 million shares during the quarter.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter was $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. And related to the repositioning, we issued $5.8 billion in senior notes at Phillips 66. These notes bear a weighted average pre-tax cost of 4.1%. Associated with this issuance, we are currently holding a restricted cash balance of $6.1 billion in addition to the $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. As part of the separation, the notes will transfer to Phillips 66, and ConocoPhillips will receive a cash distribution from Phillips 66 of approximately $6 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 11, we'll talk about our capital structure. At the end of the first quarter, our equity balance was $67 billion, up $1 billion from year end 2011. With income largely offsetting distributions, the equity increase is primarily related to foreign exchange impacts. Our debt balance increase reflected the Phillips 66 data just discussed. And if you adjust that out, our debt-to-cap is 25% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>I'll move to slide 12 and talk about some capital efficiency metrics. First quarter 2012 annualized returns on capital were 12%, which is flat from a year ago. If you break this down by segment, first quarter returns, ROCEs were 14% in E&amp;P, 9% in R&amp;M, 50% in Midstream, and 31% in Chemicals. This is a metric we're going to continue to focus on so we invest in higher margin assets across our portfolio. And it will be a key initiative for both companies going forward.</p>
          <p>So I will wrap up with some outlook comments and then we'll open the line for questions. So we're going to give guidance first for ConocoPhillips and then for Phillips 66. So starting with ConocoPhillips, our annual production guidance for 2012 remains unchanged at 1.55 million to 1.6 million BOE per day, and that depends on the timing of dispositions. Sequentially in the second quarter, production will be down from the first quarter. Second quarter production will include turnaround and maintenance activity of 50,000 to 60,000 BOE per day, primarily in Australia, the UK, Alaska, and our Foster Creek/Christina Lake joint venture in Canada.</p>
          <p>Production in the second quarter will also be negatively impacted by 20,000 to 30,000 BOE per day related to dispositions, including the recent Vietnam disposal.</p>
          <p>In the Peng Lai field in Bohai Bay, current gross production is 40,000 BOE per day and should continue at this level through the second quarter. We also expect continued gas shut-ins in North America of around 9,000 BOE per day due to low gas prices. We continue to evaluate this for further shut-in. And our full-year capital guidance for E&amp;P is approximately $15 billion.</p>
          <p>I'll shift now and talk about exploration. We expect exploration expenses to be in line with our previous guidance of $1.2 billion for the year as we continue to progress our exploration portfolio in several core areas. In Australia, we indicated last quarter that we planned to commence a five to seven well appraisal program around our Poseidon discovery. The Boreas-1 well spud on April 4, which is the first well in that appraisal drilling.</p>
          <p>In Angola, our seismic program has commenced, and recent discoveries in the area confirm the exploration potential. We expect drilling to start in 2013 or later.</p>
          <p>In Bangladesh Blocks 10 and 11, we completed seismic activity in the first quarter this year and we're analyzing the data. We have 1.4 million acres and 100% working interest in this opportunity.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, we expect to spud an exploration well in the second or third quarter this year to test the Coronado prospect. And the operators at Shenandoah and Tiber are anticipating appraisal wells in 2012.</p>
          <p>In our international shale plays, we exercised the call option for 70% operating interest in a 5,000-acre position in the western Baltic basin of Poland. We have a call option this year on the remaining 572,000-acre position. We drilled two horizontal wells in 2011, and we will continue our pilot program in 2012. We plan to start up the first phase of our program in the Frontier shale play in the Canning basin in Australia, and we should commence three vertical wells in mid-2012.</p>
          <p>In North America, we've initiated seven pilot programs in some of our new emerging plays in the Niobrara, Wolf Camp, Avalon, Canol, and Duvernay plays. And we continue to pursue high quality liquids-rich unconventional opportunities globally.</p>
          <p>Now some updates on our major growth projects around the world. Efforts continue to grow our liquids-rich shale plays in North America in the Eagle Ford, the Bakken, the Permian, and the Cardium plays. At Eagle Ford, we expect to maintain a 16 rig average and drill about 180 wells in 2012. First quarter production averaged 54,000 BOE per day, and current production capacity is around 60,000 BOE per day. It will be our priority to stay ahead of condensate takeaway capacity to reduce any further curtailments. System constraints are now primarily related to gas takeaway capacity and construction and some other infrastructure.</p>
          <p>In the Permian and Bakken, we are running a total of 13 rigs today, five more rigs than this time last year. We expect to average 16 rigs during 2012. First quarter production at Permian and Bakken averaged 51,000 and 24,000 BOE per day respectively.</p>
          <p>Our SAGD [Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage] projects continue to grow production. As you've seen, bitumen production from SCCL [Shell Chemicals Canada Ltd.] increased 11,000 BOE per day from the first quarter of last year. And we're exploring further opportunities to achieve better netback pricing such as improving the blend ratio, alternatives to synthetic and condensate as diluents, and application of new technologies.</p>
          <p>We expect to sanction the second train of APLNG during the second quarter and are currently on track to deliver our first cargo in mid-2015. And we are in Phase I development of the Jasmine projects in UK. Two of eight project wells were drilled, and so far subsurface results are exceeding our expectations. Jasmine production should start in 2013.</p>
          <p>And finally for ConocoPhillips, we are targeting $8 billion to $10 billion in asset dispositions over the next 12 months. We expect to repurchase $5 billion of shares in the first half of 2012. And the timing of additional share repurchases will depend on the timing of the dispositions.</p>
          <p>So now I'll turn and give some outlook on some items for Phillips 66 going forward. In R&amp;M, we expect turnaround activity in the second quarter to be approximately $140 million pre-tax. And global refining capacity utilization is anticipated to be in the low 90%s. The majority of the turnaround activity is expected to be in our international operations next quarter. And we reiterate our full-year guidance of around $450 million pre-tax for turnaround expenses.</p>
          <p>With the Wood River core project online, we're seeing a 5% increase in clean product yields at the refinery. And if you look at our WRB joint venture with Cenovus realized over $200 million gross profit from the core project during the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Next, I'll turn to a discussion of some of the growth projects into the Phillips 66 Midstream and Chemicals businesses. In Midstream, DCP has several growth projects underway. These include developments in the Niobrara, Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Granite Wash plays, along with logistic opportunities in the Mid-Continent region. DCP recently announced an agreement to construct a new NGL pipeline that will originate in the Denver-Julesburg [DJ] Basin in Weld County, Colorado, and extend approximately 435 miles to Skellytown, Texas, in Carson County. The new Front Range pipeline with connections to the Mid-America pipeline system; and the recently announced Texas Eastern Pipeline will help producers in the DJ Basin maximize the value of their NGL production by providing takeaway capacity and market access to the Gulf Coast. In addition, DCP is also building a Sand Hills NGL pipeline to provide additional NGL takeaway capacity in the Permian and Eagle Ford.</p>
          <p>In Chemicals, CPChem announced additional fractionation capacity of 30,000 to 40,000 BOE per day, barrels per day, at Sweeny. CPChem is progressing with one of its affiliates in Saudi Arabia to build a manufacturing facility that will produce olefins, polyolefins and alpha olefins. Production is expected to begin in the second quarter of this year, and CPChem has a 35% interest in this JV.</p>
          <p>CPChem also plans to construct a 1-hexene plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast that will have capacity of 440 million pounds per year. Startup is expected in 2014. CPChem continues to progress plans for construction of a $5 billion world-scale ethylene cracker at Cedar Bayou, Texas. A final investment decision is expected either later this year or early in 2013. And that facility would take about four years to construct following a final investment decision.</p>
          <p>And then finally, for Phillips 66, we have two of our refineries on the market. Due to increased interest from potential buyers, we're extending the timing for our Trainer disposition to late May. And we also continue to market the Alliance refinery.</p>
          <p>So that concludes our remarks on ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. As I mentioned earlier, the company is on target to complete its repositioning into two independent leading energy companies on May 1. We'd like to direct you to look at our Investor Relations website for the recent presentations given by Ryan Lance for ConocoPhillips and Greg Garland for Phillips 66.</p>
          <p>So that concludes the prepared remarks, and we're ready to open up the line for questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Now at this time, we have a question from Doug Terreson from ISI. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jeff and Clayton.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Doug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you guys have covered a lot the past few Mondays. But in E&amp;P and specifically in exploration, Jeff, you mentioned Poland and Bangladesh along with a host of others. And so I just wanted to see what the drilling plan was for those two countries during the next 12 months or so? It seems like there's momentum there, and also any commentary that you may have on recent exploration development activity in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Bangladesh, it's too early for us. We're just in the seismic phase right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we don't have &#x2013; too early for us to really give any thoughts around drilling programs there. In Poland, we're going to continue at the pace we are at and try to further delineate that play, but it will be relatively low levels of expenditure there going forward. On Bohai Bay, we are in the process of going through a ramp-up of production to the levels that have been approved by the authorities. We're still in the process of working through the long-term development plan for the field. That's going to take us up to around 40,000 BOE per day. It's about 19,000 BOE per day or so net to ConocoPhillips at Bohai Bay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a number of small questions. On the bitumen pricing for upstream, it looks like your equity affiliates' pricing was much lower than your consolidated operations and I guess historically, that number has always been much higher. I suspect that's because of the joint venture with Cenovus. If you could just elaborate a little bit what's going on there, why has the pricing shifted now to a discount versus your consolidated operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you'll probably see those move back and forth over time. I wouldn't assume that there's going be a discount on all of them going forward. There was a particularly wide WTI-WCS differential in the first quarter, which we've seen close somewhat in the first month of the second quarter. We're getting increased production from Christina Lake, which also has a little bit higher transportation differential as well. But as I said, I think you will see &#x2013; we don't expect to see differentials as wide as what we saw this quarter. I think you can also expect that over time that you'll see similar realizations from both the consolidated and the non-consolidated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair. On Alaska too, it seemed like given the production and pricing in Alaska that your earnings in Alaska were fairly higher than it has been in the past. Could you also give us a little bit more color on what's driving that? Sorry to bog you down with small questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that may be one we might have to circle back with you on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just generally in Alaska, there is a couple factors which can affect quarter to quarter. There's a bit of a pricing lag on some of the crude. So in a rising market, that can have a difference. And then, of course, the tax regime in Alaska; when you get up to these kinds of oil prices, there's a very high marginal take to you. But like Clayton says, we can get back to you with detail on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the last question to me. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that CPChem is investing more capital on its operations this year, so they're retaining more of their cash flows that was allocated to distributions. Is that the same for DCP, so if you could just give a little bit more color how those distributions from CPChem and DCP would be for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So yes, I think maybe I'll &#x2013; let me clarify and make sure that I was clear on what we said about CPChem. You are correct in that both of them have good opportunities to invest capital. But generally, we would think that distributions will be coming out of both of those joint ventures. They can more than fund their capital programs with cash flows.</p>
          <p>What's unique at CPChem currently is that we've made the decision to essentially delever CPChem and pay off their debt balances post the spin happening. So CPChem is not making any distributions to either the partners currently, so the record earnings that they saw in the first quarter were all retained at CPChem. That will put CPChem in a position later this year where they have a cash balance sufficient to pay off the debt at CPChem, and then I think we would start to see some distributions from that joint venture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. And is it the same thing with DCP, or can give us a little more detail on that too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think actually, we continue to see distributions out of DCP, but their cash flows are...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My understanding, Faisel, is that the funding for DCP expansion, about two-thirds of that financing comes from dropping assets down into the MLP inside of DPM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And about a third of the funding of their expansion comes from either non-cash expenses like D&amp;A or from about let's say 10% of their net income or any cash they have on the balance sheet. So they're expecting to continue to dividend out cash as well as fund their expansion programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks for the detail. I appreciate it.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Clayton.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess some clarifications, then a question on CapEx in SAGD. Firstly, just on that $450 million in the held-for-sale category, so if we were trying to think of cash flow before working capital, would $4.6 billion be closer to the right number to use?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. So were it not for that, we would have seen about &#x2013; when you look at our supplemental information, you'll see that working capital is basically a push for the quarter. So were it not for that reclassification, you would have had about a $500 million use of cash from working capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you're looking at cash flow before working capital changes, what you said is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on CapEx, obviously, if we take in the upstream the $4.15 billion, take out $500 million for leaseholds, multiply it by four, rack back the leaseholds, you get to about $15.1 billion. And normally, CapEx in the upstream companies tends to be a bit back-end weighted. So, just trying to see what might be different this year in terms of being able to hit the $15 billion of guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what's different this year is it's not back-end loaded. We had, as you mentioned, the large leasehold acquisitions. We also had a fairly high spend level at the APLNG project in the first quarter as well, and we're running a pretty consistent spend through our unconventional developments like the Eagle Ford. So you won't see the same level of back-end loading in our capital program this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the final question on SAGD CapEx. The presentation that Lance gave last week, it was $2.3 billion spend in SAGD. As we focus in a little bit more granularly on some of these assets, can you maybe just talk through what the run rate of spend you have on the SAGD would be going forward, if there's any lumpiness to it or trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so I need to break that into a couple pieces there, Ed. So if you look at how we fund the Foster Creek/Christina Lake joint venture, it goes back to how the venture was set up to start with, where we are making payments into the SCCL joint venture of around $800 million or $900 million a year every year for what will be ten years. We're about five or six years into that right now. And Cenovus is doing the same thing on the WRB side. So between the contribution that we make and the cash flows that are generated inside the joint venture, that funds SCCL CapEx for us. So the $800 million or $900 million that I talked about is the SCCL CapEx, and the rest of it is the development of the Surmont project, our 50:50 joint venture with Total.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon, Jeff and Clayton; a couple of things for me, hopefully both relatively housekeeping. The first one is on your comments, Jeff, on shutting in gas. Can you just give us an idea? What would it take for you to bring your gas production back online? And given that prices have deteriorated somewhat since you made the decision I guess at the end of the fourth quarter, can you just give us some thoughts as to whether the portfolio that you have still producing to date is resilient at current gas prices, or are you likely to get a little bit more aggressive there? My follow-up is on share buybacks, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, I'm not sure that we'll see much change from where we are right now, again, maybe to reiterate some comments that we made when we talked about this previously. If you look at our gas production across the Lower 48 and Canada, North American natural gas production, probably two-thirds to 70% of the economics of gas production are driven by liquids prices, so you don't see much. There's no real reason to be shutting in that gas production. It still has strong economics.</p>
          <p>Of the 30% to a third that's left of that, we operate about half of that production. Generally, our partners have not wanted to shut in production. Then we'll continue to monitor the balance of what we operate, where the gas is more dry gas, for potential additional shut-ins. But right now, we wouldn't expect it to be markedly different than what we saw in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, when you say shut-in gas, are you actually shutting in wells, or are you choking them back? I'm thinking about shut-in royalty commitments that you might have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It probably varies from place to place. I think for the most part, we're actually shutting them in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Royalties and things like that are things we look at in evaluating whether or not we shut in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. My follow-up is really a very simple one, hopefully, on share buybacks. Whatever shares you've repurchased by the end of this month, does that still impact the share count for PSX? And can you help maybe quantify what that number would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it would impact the share count for PSX, and we've talked about doing $5 billion by the end of the second quarter. We did $2 billion, basically, in the first quarter. It's a pretty ratable purchase across the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to be clear then, if you did, let's say, $3 billion in the balance of the second quarter, I'm trying to understand how much. I know it's a very small point really, but how much would be allocated wholly to...</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just wanted to confirm when you all talk about $5 billion to $10 billion of asset sales, you're not counting the Phillips 66 dividend within that? Then I guess a related point is when you talked about using asset sales for stock buyback, does that dividend also count as potential proceeds to supplement your stock buyback? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. So what we are saying on the ConocoPhillips side is that we would anticipate over the next year that we're going have between $8 billion and $10 billion of asset sales. And then ConocoPhillips is going to have about $5 billion of share repurchases by the end of the second quarter. And as I just mentioned, we'll probably have about $3 billion of that done by the time of the spin. Then we'll do another $2 billion probably in the balance of the second quarter. And then after that, the pace of share repurchase will sync up with the pace of further asset sales. So when we talk about asset sales, we're not counting the dividend. We're not counting the Phillips 66 shares. It's just a straight asset sale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I got it then. So if you do sell $8 billion to $10 billion or some other number, that would be the ballpark by which you'd do future stock buybacks beyond what you just talked about for the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we would &#x2013; of course, we're going to be evaluating everything going forward. Just where are we in cash from operations, what the investment opportunities in the portfolio look like, and where we want to be on the debt balance. There will be a lot of things that go into the mix. But if you go back to really what Jim Mulva said back in his presentation in March, where he said $5 billion by the end of the second quarter and we hope to be around $10 billion depending on the pace of asset sales, that's the same kind of guidance we would give.</p>

Obviously, there's opportunity cost. We can guess at that, but there's some adjustment we have to do for the fiscal regime there, the cleanup effort directly, and then also the settlement.

          <p>No, not that we really wanted to &#x2013; no, we don't. We're still in the middle of discussions on Bohai Bay with the authorities there. It probably would be better for us to get everything resolved and then talk about that.</p>

I know you had contemplated a return of Libya, I'm not exactly sure at what level, but obviously Libya has come back fairly quickly. In your assumptions, can you talk about what's embedded in there? In other words, are the shut-ins and natural gas already in that 1.55 million to 1.6 million BOE per day number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, part of the reason why we give ranges on production and guidance is that &#x2013; that is we have our uncertainties of exactly what rate Bohai will ramp back up with and just other things in our portfolio. Just as far as Libya is concerned, Libya production I believe in the quarter was around 36 million BOE a day, which is about 6 million BOE higher than it was in the first quarter of 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't really &#x2013; based on our forecast, we don't see that going higher than that for the year. It's pretty flat looking out through the remainder of 2012.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. The last one, if I could ask one on APLNG, I know it may be early days on this, but you're looking at FID potentially in the second quarter. My understanding is the real, I guess, incremental returns from that project were going to come from Trains 3 and 4. Do you have any clue when we may be evaluating those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're going just have to see how things develop. Whether ultimately there's a Train 3 and 4 or whether it makes sense to take any additional resource we find to lengthen the life of the first two trains, we don't know whether there may actually be capacity in other trains that could make sense to use longer term; so it's really too early for us to try to make an estimate on whether or not there will be additional trains there. There just would be a lot of options for what we think is still a very high quality resource.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. I'm going to come back to buybacks and asset sales again. Given the fact that you're forecasting $5 billion by the end of the second quarter and you're now linking pretty closely your share buybacks to your asset sales, is it a fair assumption to say that by the end of the first half, you'll have sold $5 billion of the $8 billion to $10 billion you're talking about, and what production impact is that going be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think when we think of the share repurchase program we're currently doing in the first half the year, we're more looking backwards at the asset sales that we have done in the previous &#x2013; both the first part of this year and the latter part of last year. So I wouldn't carry that link across to things being done in the second quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And just a couple questions, about &#x2013; you mentioned taxes and also an underlift as being fairly significant negatives in the first quarter. Is taxes the continuation of the North Sea effect and Alaska, or is there something else which we don't know about?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was fairly substantial. We see numbers of about that size. Really, it's a fairly high number for an under-lift. It's not completely unprecedented. It just has to do timings of when cargos get lifted.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to make sure I understand. You're saying that the underlift is primary related to Australia, or is it not related to Libya? I thought the underlift would be primarily related to Libya.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The underlift is primarily &#x2013; you have underlifts and overlifts all throughout the portfolios. So it's a netting effect that this quarter netted to that kind of number. So we were overlifted some places. We were underlifted in others. It's just that the balance this time ended up with a number that we felt was significant enough we should mention it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Jeff, maybe I must be missing something. Maybe you can help me. I was looking at, in the first quarter your oil and gas realization is roughly about $66.70 per BOE. It's about $2 higher than the fourth quarter. Even after I take into consideration of the underlift of 85 million BOE, your net income per BOE is still about $15 versus in the fourth quarter it was about $16. Your production is actually somewhat up. And you're saying that &#x2013; is that the reason &#x2013; why is the unit margin is down? Is it because sequentially we have a higher unit cost, or is there something that we're missing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's primarily driven by things like the timing on the underlift, like we mentioned. It's driven by the fact that natural gas prices were lower in the first quarter than they were in the fourth quarter of last year. NGL prices were lower in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter last year. Bitumen prices were lower as well. Crude prices were up. And the mix of all those things...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Jeff, I'm sorry. But when I did that, I didn't look at what you reported as your crude price, your bitumen price, and your natural gas price. I did a calculation based on what you report your actual realization per BOE net of all those &#x2013; what you mentioned actually sequentially is up about $2 per barrel. That is why it seems like I'm at a loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll have to work with you on that one. I'm not sure what your calculations are doing. We'll have to take that one offline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will do that. If I could, Clayton, do you have an actual fully diluted share count at the end of the quarter, on March 31?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I just have just the average in front of me. No, I don't. We can get that to you.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the reposition cost, Jeff, do you guys have an estimate of what that total is going be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it was $95 million in the first quarter. It has been $120 million if you look across the fourth quarter and the first quarter. It's going be &#x2013; you'll see it. It will be hard to track after this because it's going to be reported in two separate companies. But probably the majority of the repositioning costs are behind us now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on a going-forward basis, on a standalone basis, what is the estimated increase in your higher G&amp;A costs at the two separate companies? Do you have a number that you can share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will split evenly between the companies. And for both companies I think we're saying it will be around $75 million to $100 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, final two questions. In Bakken, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford, do you have a breakdown on what is your production as percentage of frac volume, condensate, and NGL?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so Eagle Ford is 60% crude or condensate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have a further breakdown between crude oil and condensate?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't, but those two price very similarly.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>About 20% NGLs and about 20% natural gas. The Bakken is basically 90% crude and 5% NGLs and 5% gas. Permian is...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I got it, 53% &#x2013; 50% to 55% crude, 10% to 15% NGLs, and the balance would be gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's of our current Permian production. So if you look at the things we're bringing on there, I think that's probably a higher weighting to the liquid side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it seems that &#x2013; we find we &#x2013; don't we need one condensate per state? So that's why I wanted to see a breakdown between the condensate and frac oil. As of today, I don't think that's such a big difference in terms of the pricing. But is it possible that over the next two or three years as we continue to wrap up the condensate and ready the local market for that, we will start to see a big differences between the condensate pricing and the frac oil pricing?</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm sure we will see some short-term dislocations in the market as we build out these plays in the next few years. But longer term, when you think about products like propane, butanes, condensates, those are something that you can export, so that will also help any differentials that might be there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If there's any possibility if you can maybe help us out by giving us the breakdown between your condensate and your frac oil mixed in those areas, that would be really appreciated. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my question, guys. I have a big picture one about the dividend. You will have unquestionably the highest dividend yield of any independent oil and gas company. I'm curious on your thoughts on how that positions you vis-&#xE0;-vis the investment base. It's obviously not a typical, not a commonplace model for independents, so just your thoughts on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That's a great question because that is really a fundamental difference of ConocoPhillips and much else that's out there in the marketplace today. And you can see that when we put out our investor update, we were title it as a new class of investment, pointing out that difference. In many ways, we've got the assets of a major. We're going to try to have the nimbleness and culture of an independent. So from a distribution point of view, we feel like we're of a size and of a maturity in an industry where shareholders should be expecting that a significant portion of cash flow comes back to them in the form of a dividend. We've talked about that being 20% to 25% of our cash flow. And that ends up giving us a dividend that's like what the integrated company has today. We recognize that that's going give us a pretty high yield going out of the box, but we think that's an issue not with the dividend but with the share price. That's going be something that will change over time. We still would be looking to maintain that kind of payout ratio longer term and also to see increases in the dividend as our earnings and our cash flow grows over time.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just a quick follow-up on that same point. Is there an oil price level where you would begin to be concerned about maintaining share buyback at the rate that you're currently doing, especially given that, I think as you indicated, your asset sale program may not extend that much into 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As prices change, we're always looking at the whole mix of things that we use our cash flow for, though basically we want to maintain a capital program that's fairly consistent across the years. We don't want to be moving that up and down. We want to have a dividend that's like I just discussed that's at the level it is today and grows over time. We've got a lot of capacity on our balance sheet to handle short-term swings in prices. If we get a big change in prices we'll look and adjust. But in the near term, you probably would not see large adjustments on the upside or the downside as prices move either up or down to the size of our capital program. And on share repurchases, we're always going to be evaluating what the best use of our proceeds are. As we look out today, we think it's reasonable guidance to say that we'll be using proceeds from asset sales to fund share repurchases.</p>
