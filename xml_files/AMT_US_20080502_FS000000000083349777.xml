        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Danielle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining American Tower's conference call regarding our first quarter financial results. We'll begin with comments from Brad Singer, Chief Financial Officer, who will then turn things over to Jim Taiclet, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. After these comments we will of course open the call up for your questions.</p>
          <p>However, before we begin I'd like to remind you this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include statements regarding our 2008 outlook, our stock repurchase program, our international business development initiative, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31st, 2007, as well as our other filings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn things over to Brad Singer.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Michael. American Tower began 2008 with a strong performance during the first quarter with significant revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. In our core rental and management division, our revenue and gross margin increased 8% and 9% to 374 million and over 290 million respectively from the first quarter in 2007.</p>
          <p>Our rental and management revenues and gross margins included a decrease of over 5 million of non-cash straight-line revenue compared to the prior year, and over 4 million on a sequential basis from the fourth quarter. Adjusted to exclude the non-cash straight-line elements, tower revenue increased 10% and gross margins increased 12% from the prior year. The combination of our new business and the renewals and extensions of existing leases increased our non-cancelable lease commitments to 8.8 billion or nearly six years of revenue. We expect the non-cash straight-line revenue will decrease sequentially in the second quarter of 2008 by approximately 2.5 million.</p>
          <p>Our total selling, general, and administrative and development expense was 48.9 million including 16.3 million of stock-based compensation expense. The stock-based compensation is seasonally higher primarily due to the vesting of our &#x2013; all employee annual grants in March. We anticipate stock-based compensation expense of approximately 14.5 million in the future quarters in 2008. Our selling, general, and administrative and development expense also included 0.6 million of additional costs associated with the stock option review and related matters.</p>
          <p>Our adjusted EBITDA increased 11% to 262.5 million, and our adjusted EBITDA margins increased approximately 200 basis points to 69%. Adjusting to exclude non-cash straight-line revenue and expense, adjusted EBITDA increased over 14%. Our operating income for the quarter increased 59 million from the first quarter of 2007 to 145 million. Of the increase, 30 million was attributable to the change in our estimate of the useful life of our towers and related intangible assets.</p>
          <p>As previously disclosed in our third quarter 10-Q and our 2007 10-K, we've reviewed the estimated useful life to determine whether we should modify our current estimates based on historical operating experience. In connection with the internal review, we retained an independent consultant to assist with the analysis. As a result of the internal and independent reviews, we have concluded that we should increase the estimated useful life of our towers and related intangible assets from 15 to 20 years and will account for the change prospectively effective at the beginning of this year. As a result, we have reduced depreciation and amortization expense by approximately 30 million in the first quarter of 2008 and anticipate reducing annual depreciation and amortization in 2008 by approximately 120 million.</p>
          <p>Our net income for the first quarter was 42.2 million, which includes approximately 18.8 million net of tax related to the change of useful life.</p>
          <p>Our capital expenditures totaled 44.6 million. During the quarter we completed the construction of 18 towers and three in-building installations. While the number of new towers was slightly below our expectations, based on our current construction pipelines we continue to anticipate completing 300 to 400 new towers and in-building sites in our existing market. We've also signed our first build-to-suit agreement in India, which Jim will discuss in greater detail. We anticipate spending 15 million in capital to complete approximately 200 towers during 2008 in India.</p>
          <p>Separately, we acquired 244 new towers in the quarter. The average unlevered day one return of the 265 new sites that we acquired and built in the quarter was over 13%, with strong prospects for additional tenants, further increasing our future returns on invested capital.</p>
          <p>We also had higher than historic levels of redevelopment capital expenditures during the quarter due to the incremental investment related to one of our customers as well as the expansion of several of our casino properties to accommodate additional tenants. As a result of our growth initiatives, we are increasing our anticipated capital spending by 15 million to 200 to 230 million to reflect our India build-to-suit projects.</p>
          <p>Our strong operating performance produced approximately 138 million of free cash flow for the quarter. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operations, less all capital expenditures. Please note that the free cash flow calculations include approximately 37 million of discretionary capital spending on new site construction and land acquisitions, as well as redevelopment of existing sites.</p>
          <p>As indicated in our press release, we are increasing our 2008 outlook. At the midpoint of 2008, outlook, we anticipate tower revenues of 1.5375 billion, tower gross margins of 1.193 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of 1.082 billion. We continue to anticipate 2008 levels of commenced new business to be above our 2007 levels based on our current pipeline of commenced and signed leases, as well as our applications received and dialogue with our customers.</p>
          <p>Our financial position remains solid due to the strength of our operations and the continuing solid fundamentals of the wireless industry. In March we substantially increased our liquidity with a new 325 million term loan facility, which we used to pay down our existing revolving line of credit, providing us with total undrawn capacity of close to $600 million. We entered into interest rate swaps, locking in our interest rates on the significant majority of the new term loan below 4%, providing very reasonably priced capital. Over the past six months despite the uneven credit market conditions, we have successfully raised over 800 million of reasonably priced debt, demonstrating the success of the diversification of our financing sources and the strength and durability of our financial position.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares for 171 million and approximately 1 million shares subsequent to the end of the quarter. Our repurchase activity was lower than we had anticipated. Under the purchase plan we put in place, we expected to benefit from current market volatility by repurchasing a greater quantity of shares as the price declined and lower the purchase activity at the price of our shares rose. The strength of our share price performance subsequent to the end of the first quarter reduced the number of shares we have purchased today. We review our repurchase activity subsequent to our earnings release each quarter as we set our new 10b5 purchase program. We remain confident in our financial performance and seek to utilize our financial position to appropriately maximize shareholder returns through our investment and repurchase activities.</p>
          <p>With five weeks into the baseball season, the Red Sox are well positioned to return to their championship form, sharing first place despite being swept by the Rays last weekend.</p>
          <p>I will now turn things over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Taiclet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, Brad. Good morning to everybody. Our company once again delivered excellent growth in the first quarter, a 10% increase in cash tower revenue and a 14% increase in cash-adjusted EBITDA.</p>
          <p>These results are a credit to our employees, who are striving every day to get the many tasks accomplished that enable new cell sites and augmentations to be added to our towers and in-building systems. We experienced strong commenced new revenue in Q1, of which 70% was new installations and 30% was augmentations to existing cell sites. Demand for tower space remains robust, as being confirmed by our application pipeline, which remains at high levels, by direct interactions with our customers, and industry development.</p>
          <p>Since the beginning of the year I've met with each of our most critical domestic and many international customers, and from these meetings and the carriers' public statements have derived the following conclusions: First, the largest U.S. wireless carriers continue to aggressively invest in network quality for current 2 and 3G technologies, while laying the groundwork for 4G data services which include securing spectrums and defining technology roadmaps. Second, Auction 66 deployments continue, and spectrum clearing is progressing well. T-Mobile, Leap and MetroPCS are all active with us. And third, we're securing meaningful lease-up from a range of regional and emerging technology customers, such as iPCS, MediaFLO, and Aircel.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, Mexican carriers continue to invest in their networks, as quality plays an increasingly important role in that competitive market. While in Brazil, two market entrants in Sao Paulo state, coupled with regional developments and deployments related to recent spectrum auctions, are resulting in a significant increase in demand for our sites in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Our strong first quarter financial results also demonstrate that our fundamental corporate strategies continue to pay off. Our management team first implemented these strategies in 2001, and we have been driving them forward ever since, with appropriate course adjustments based on market conditions. Our first strategy has been to focus exclusively on the tower leasing business model and achieve meaningful scale with high-quality assets. By maintaining this focus, we've avoided the cost and management distraction of non-leasing businesses and have been able to add very high-quality assets to the company and leverage those assets to attain consistent tower revenue growth.</p>
          <p>The U.S. wireless tower business is the core of our company. With the acquisition of SpectraSite back in 2005, we were able to accomplish the first and only tower company merger that brought together substantial former cellular or 800-megahertz tower portfolios. With this critical transaction, towers purchased from SBC, AirTouch, now Verizon, Alltel, Nextel and AT&amp;T Corporation, as well as towers built solely for collocation by ATC and SpectraSite, were all brought together.</p>
          <p>The characteristics of these towers were and still are critical, because strong lease-up growth over time depends on three factors: location, tower capacity and ground space and what we call readiness. At American Tower, we feel we have the best tower asset in the U.S. and here's why. We have a healthy 63% of our U.S. wireless towers in the top 100 markets. With an additional 28% in second tiered cities and high traffic corridors, which also experienced high demand. It's our view that <mark type="inaudible" /> 800-megahertz carrier towers generally have favorable structural capacity and tower space and ground space characteristics. These characteristics may support greater lease-up potential and lower redevelopment CapEx over time. Available capacity and ground space enhanced the readiness of the site to accept new leases and equipment. With speed of execution increasingly important to our carrier customers, the quality of our tower portfolio provides for fast lease application cycle times.</p>
          <p>We believe our company is an industry leader in this area of speed, resulting in greater customer satisfaction based on our latest third-party customer surveys, which in turn helps us further maximize our share of new lease opportunities.</p>
          <p>Our assets outside the U.S., which provide about 14% of our revenue currently, have similar characteristics to our U.S. towers. Revenue per tower in both Mexico and Brazil are at or above the U.S. average and both markets have delivered superior returns on investment while providing diversification to our customer base. And we continue to explore additional markets in Latin America and elsewhere for opportunities to replicate those successes in Mexico and Brazil.</p>
          <p>After an in-depth assessment of the Indian market, for example, we have chosen for the time being to establish a presence via build-to-suit agreements with key customers and are pleased to announce the first of these today. This approach enabled us to enter the market on a construction cost basis versus the currently higher entry cost routes of large acquisition or joint venture alternatives available today in that country.</p>
          <p>We believe we can achieve viable scale in India over a period of time with this build-to-suit approach while gaining experience on the ground that will help us evaluate potential future opportunities there and regionally. Our immediate goal in India is to build a set of high-quality towers in the country and demonstrate our ability to drive industry-leading collocations rates in that market.</p>
          <p>The commitment to achieve industry-leading collocation rates in India is completely in line with the second of our major strategies over the last six, seven years. And that's to use operational execution to maximize returns on our assets. Our operating teams have combined dedication to customer service and revenue growth with a commitment to cost control. And as a result, in the first quarter American Tower delivered 69% adjusted EBITDA margins, significantly higher than our industry peers.</p>
          <p>Our operations in the U.S. and in Latin America use three fundamental operational processes to drive results and accountability and we'll take these processes to other markets as we enter them. These are our integrated operational goal-setting and measurement process, our quarterly operational and financial reviews, and our account management process. We complement this blocking and tackling of these basic management processes with our in-house continuous improvement team and with investments in data quality, site documentation and IT systems.</p>
          <p>The overarching goal of all of these operational programs is to rapidly provide our customers with the information they need to make a purchase decision and then to sign a lease on our tower as quickly and accurately as possible. Speed is what we're all about and it's where we place our operational investment.</p>
          <p>Our third major strategy is to maintain financial strength and flexibility. Simply said, we never want to be painted into a corner. We never want an overstretched balance sheet to prevent us from being able to do the right thing for the business since we are shareholders, be it an investment in assets at the right price or returning capital through an appropriate share repurchase program. We also never want our investors to question our ability to refinance our debt at reasonable terms and costs.</p>
          <p>As I've said, we're designing this Company for long-term success. We're gifted with a great foundation for future growth in the expanding wireless industry that we serve. Our balance sheet and capital structure position our company to weather a range of economic and financial market scenarios and still take full advantage of the opportunities that I'm confident will be available to American Tower.</p>
          <p>As I hope you can tell, we're very energized about our current position and performance and even more so about the future. So thanks for joining us on the call today, and at this point Brad and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Ric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guess it's appropriate to be first since the Rays are in first place by a few percentage points over you guys in Boston. That's the last time I'll be able to say that, probably.</p>
          <p>Couple questions for you guys. First, on the change of the life of the tower asset, obviously a non-cash item, does reduce depreciation, does increase book taxes. Can you update us on where your NOL balance is and what this change might do as far as kind of the lifetime of burning through that NOL? And are you paying any cash taxes yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ric. It's Brad. It does not have any impact on our tax position. It's a GAAP adjustment in terms of the estimated useful life, so our NOL is around 1.6 billion. And so it would not change the burning through of that. We don't pay U.S. income taxes, we do pay certain franchise taxes that are not large in size, but we are a taxpayer in Mexico and Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question is, the Indian, as I call it the toe-touch there. Think it is a much smarter way to get in it. What it looks like &#x2013; should we assume the 15 million is the full cost to build those 200 towers, which would imply $75,000 per tower? And some extra questions associated with that is, how tall are the towers you're looking to build in India? What's the capacity that the towers could hold? What's the barriers to entry as far as zoning protection, the anchor rent? Can you help us kind of understand how the business model works in India from a standpoint of the height of the towers, the cost of the towers, the capacity of the towers, the anchor rent, and how long it might take to get that second carrier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ric, do you want us to send you over our business model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That would always help and '09 guidance now would help also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ric, we actually had our Latin American teams design a special tower for the India market that would be easy to replicate the construction of low cost and be able to hold sort of three carriers out of the box. And so that's our capacity goal, is three to four carriers, initial construction costs of about 75,000 as you said. 40-meter towers plus or minus 5 meters depending on the utilization. So it's basically a low-cost way to get into a very fast-growing market and we're going to build our way into it rather than go through the higher-cost and probably higher-risk routes of big acquisitions and big joint ventures, for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would assume the Indian carriers would not be paying the similar kind of rent that we would see in the U.S. But in Latin America you do get some extra payments back for, I think land, don't you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we pass through our ground rents in Latin America. That's not the case in India. But there are some other pass-through costs, like security and things so in some contracts. So what we've basically done, Ric, is align our business model to meet our return criteria. And with the rates being set by the market, as you suggested, in India being a bit lower than say Latin America, we needed to make sure our cost basis was also lower going into the country and that's really the reason we established our beachhead in this way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And I think it's a smart way to go. I guess the other way to ask the question maybe is, you mentioned 13% kind of day one returns on the stuff that you did within the quarter as far as acquisitions and builds. What would kind of day one India IRRs be then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In India it will be mid-single digits with one build-to-suit customer, which we expect to grow into mid-double digits, mid-teens, as you bring on the second carrier. And since it is the fastest growing wireless market in the world, we think we're going to have a lot of confidence in getting the second and ultimately third carrier on these towers someday.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. And we'll see how you do against the Rays this week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Take care, Ric.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks. Just following on from that question, where does the IRR ultimately go as you get to three and then maybe four carriers? And then if I could also ask just on the guidance. It looks like the increase in revenue, increase in EBITDA, doesn't completely conform to your &#x2013; to the expected incremental margins. I'm wondering what the offsets are there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Jonathan, it's Brad. With regard to where the IRRs ultimately go, I mean the business scales similar to U.S. in terms of the incremental tenant in India doesn't come with a significant amount of incremental cost. It would not be passed through. So you should assume if we're getting kind of off a second tenant up to like a mid-teens <mark type="inaudible" /> or slightly better return, the third tenant would also flow right above and so you'd be well in excess of that 20% or higher kind of return.</p>
          <p>With regard to our incremental margins, they're still running I'd say the high 80s to 90% as you look at our outlook between revenue to the gross margin line item in the tower business and that's what you should anticipate as we move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you look at the slight disconnect between the increase in guidance for revenue and EBITDA, is there an offset to your typical gross margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we had about a million more of corporate expense this quarter that had to be incorporated so that's why you're dealing with fairly small numbers. So when you have the midpoint of revenue go up 7.5 million and EBITDA goes up 5.5 million or so. That extra million counts toward that percentage. There's not meant to be &#x2013; there's no change in the actual business model, just that we're incorporating what actually happened in the first quarter into that outlook for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks, Brad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just to follow up on the India question a little bit. It's obviously a very fragmented market, a lot of wireless carriers, especially beyond the top four carriers there. You don't have to give me a name, but you said you're targeting some strategic customers. Is it those top four big carriers, or are you looking at the smaller carriers?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The way our guidance, the increase is based on both U.S. and the Latin America operating performance. Both of them were a little bit ahead of expectations internally. We did not incorporate the Indian assets that we've put in place, and that would probably be third and fourth quarter. You may have a million or two of revenue that may come in those quarters, but it'll be pretty far out, and so I don't think they'll change the guidance in any significant way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just wanted to ask about the existing towers, a few things. Can you just share with us the percentage of towers that are at full capacity now? And also the percent of new leases that require augmentation capital? And then talking about the change in estimated life, can you talk about what you see with your oldest towers, what happens to maintenance CapEx if anything? How old those oldest towers are? And then you raised the estimated life to 20 years, but what do you truly think the life is? When do you think you need to replace a tower? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of questions, Clay. Let me go through each one. On the capacity side we don't give a specific statistic, but there's a small percentage of our tower that we say are at capacity. Even those that are at structural capacity, we typically can put money into a site and into redevelopment costs to add additional tenants. So you can create capacity by what we call redevelopment capital. So I think there's very few times where we can't put a customer on a site, and I think that's the best way to think of it. In terms of how often we have to do something to the tower, probably one in five times -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One in four times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One in four, one in five times, when a new customer comes on &#x2013; not when they're adding more equipment, but a new installation &#x2013; is where we would have to put redevelopment money into it. The customer typically pays half of that cost when we do have to improve the tower when they come along.</p>
          <p>In terms of our maintenance capital, it has not dramatically gone up or down over the last several years. And the maintenance area is what we disclose as improvement capital. For the most part the largest driver of maintenance capital, believe it or not, are lighting systems. And I think that's one of the bigger segments, and so it's not actually the structure itself. The structures based on the studies we've used from third parties and our own operating experience, last well beyond 20 years and well beyond 30 years, even in the studies, and some are 50 or 60 years. And even when you keep putting improvements into them can last even beyond that. So the structures are very long-lived. We went to 20 years based on an incremental approach to how we're looking at the useful life, and I think it's also comparable to our largest peer in the industry also uses 20 years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have a couple of follow-ups on India. But first of all can you refresh us on what the average tenancy level is in Mexico and in Brazil versus the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The actual physical tenants 1.8, roughly 2 in Latin America. Prices are higher there per lease, as you might remember, Jonathan. And so the revenue per towers are at or above the U.S.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the build-to-suit approach in India, is there a deep demand for that type of service by third parties such as yourself? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much you could ramp this effort if you decide after the initial 200 to go full-bore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's estimates as high as the need for 300,000 more structures over the next five or so years in India, Jonathan, so there's plenty of open field to play in, frankly. And we're more interested in the performance of a set of towers, not necessarily the absolute number. And so we feel there's plenty of room for us. And what we really want to do in the India market is change it by driving collocation versus pure construction as the method of getting cell sites on air. And that's where we'll hopefully really make our mark.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're considering them and using the same sort of due diligence that we have so far in India. And if you think of Latin America, you might just view the kind of countries where we have common customers, Jonathan. And that would be kind of a good clue as to what's interesting. We don't have anything specific to announce yet, but that's one way to kind of gauge where our interest level might lie in Latin America.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Just one quick housekeeping item and then I'm going to beat this India thing to death again. Can you give us a sense for the towers that you acquired in the quarter, how many were U.S. and how many were in Latin America? And then just following up on the comment you just made about changing the business model in India, what gives you the confidence that right now they're not just still in land grab mode and everybody is just looking to put up a tower as quickly as possible, but that you can convince operators to go this sort of collo route and get more tenants that way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me just touch the acquisition piece first. It was sort of an 80/20 Latin America-U.S. for us in the first quarter. So most of those sites were in Mexico and Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then secondly on India, yes, there is a number of dynamics I'll say going on in that market right now. Some of those dynamics depending on who you are would drive you to build maybe more towers than to really actively drive collocation on existing towers. But that's not going to be our motivation. And so what we're going to try to do there is what we've done in the U.S. and Latin America, which is to prove to the carriers that if there's an existing tower, and hopefully it'll be ours, that we can get them on air at a much faster cycle time than they could get by building their own tower doing some other alternative. And that's what I think is our goal in India, is to prove that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect to the competition that you're seeing there today, is it largely that decision where there aren't a lot of tower operators and it's more just the carriers themselves, or do you see a lot of third parties coming in now and trying to take advantage of some of the growth dynamics that they see there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In India there are a few existing third-party companies. I would not say there's a sort of an Oklahoma land rush of companies coming in there. And the market will settle out, and I think the best-performing third-party companies will do well, and some may drop off. And some will get acquired. We're very focused on &#x2013; we're very cognizant of the surroundings, but we're also focused on how we are successful. And we are successful by &#x2013; just as we did in Brazil, 6, 700 towers at this point &#x2013; perform really well in a much larger market because we've got low entry costs and good collocation rates. And that's what we're going to strive to do in India. And then if something larger opens up at the right entry cost, we'll look at it also.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Well, let me just answer that real quickly. There are no foreign ownership caps on infrastructure in India where there are wireless service providers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So we don't have that restriction. And frankly one of the reasons we're going in the way we're going is so that we can control the whole entity, at this point at least.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then second question, just on the share repurchase. I know you said there were some structural limitations around the 10b5 in the quarter just given the way the share price had moved. As you reset the parameters post the earnings release, can we think about a rate similar to what we saw in '07 in terms of the pace of the buyback?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Jason, that we're still trying to take advantage somewhat of volatility, even though volatility has been an upward bias of late. But we want to maintain certain leverage parameters, and so to maintain our leverage and not de-lever you should anticipate that we would increase the pace of buybacks from where it has been.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Couple if I could. Just following up a little bit on the buyback side. Brad, obviously with LIBOR down, you guys locking in some very low rates, does that increase the ability of the company do you think from a relative yield perspective to go after stock, so to speak?</p>
          <p>The second question related to that is, if you guys are going to be taking much more incremental steps in terms of a build-to-suit approach in India rather than maybe holding out for one of these big acquisitions, does that maybe release again some incremental capacity on the balance sheet from a leverage standpoint to go after stock if the credit markets can support it, I guess?</p>
          <p>And then my last question is, there's been a growing number of questions, if you've been listening to the calls over the last couple quarters, about the ability of the tower industry to support the growth in wireless from a capacity standpoint. To your point, you guys are having to put money to work one in every four, one in every five new deals. Does this kind of maybe unravel a little bit the whole idea of recurring cash flow being the relevant benchmark here since almost one in every four deals requires new capital to be put to work to grow? Love your comments on that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's take your last question first. We put, in total &#x2013; let's make sure we bracket this &#x2013; that one in every four, and one in every five totals $30 million a year. So this is not a significant capital expenditure. Usually they're fairly modest, and as I said, that is gross, it's not even net of what the customer gives us. So we record it gross from a book perspective. So you think if our improvements cost us around 25 million a year across our portfolio, and then the amount that we put into redevelopment is 30 million across the portfolio. That's really the aggregate amount you're putting into your existing portfolio in terms of what our historic experience. This year is a little higher in redevelopment, but that's due to one specific customer in the international. It has nothing to do with the structural limitations that we've talked about.</p>
          <p>So I think whether you want to call it recurring cash flow after improvements or recurring cash flow after the redevelopment, both of those I think are realistic expectations. But we haven't seen an uptick in redevelopment, just that's been about where it has been running, and you usually just need to put a little bit of money, whether it's reinforcing the tower through brackets or touching the foundation when you're adding customers. So I just want to be careful that you understand that fully, as you're thinking about valuation. And that is based on our specific capital spending history.</p>
          <p>With regard to LIBOR and our share repurchase book, it makes the math better, but long-term we do always think about ultimate value and how we create it best for our shareholders. And that's how we base where our financial position is as well as the incremental opportunities to deploy that capital. Having said that India is starting off with an initial 200-tower build, we are still look at several other areas to export internationally, and we do also want to be able to take advantage, if asset prices don't remain as tight throughout the world or there's an opportunities that comes up for us to put money to work. So I think you'll still anticipate us to have financial flexibility. We think it's very important, that's how we create a lot of value. And we should still be within that 4 to 6 times leverage. Nothing has changed our bias to do that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, great. Just maybe since you raised the issue, Brad, how does that contribution from customers who are participating in that capital enhancement of a tower come back to you from an accounting standpoint?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just had a couple questions on the land purchasing side. Can you give us an update in terms of where we are with the percent of revenue that's tied to land, or if you want to include 99-year leases that you own? And then the second part of the question is how should we think about land repurchases over the next couple years in terms of your valuation expectations for what you're bringing them in at? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, with regard to land repurchases, we look to protect the asset that's on that land. So we either extend leases or we ultimately buy the land. We're agnostic about which way we pursue that. So this year we budgeted 40 to 60 million. We'll probably be somewhere in the mid-point of that, maybe closer to 40 to 50 rather than 60. That's really based on the cost to extend the land. Right now we own about 16.5% of our sites.</p>
          <p>But also just as important, we've extended many more sites over the last call it 18 months. So we have very few sites that over the next 15 years will ultimately &#x2013; that we have to work through. There's roughly about 1,000 sites over the next 15 years, with the vast majority being years 10 through 15, that we need to work through. And so we do that by making payments to landlords or redoing the ground leases themselves. One of the things that comes through at the prepaid rent is that we have about 4 or 5 million bucks we've spent over the last six months on paying landlords to extend leases. And capturing another 20, 30 years.</p>
          <p>And so we really take it &#x2013; we do the most economic way to take care of all of our leases and we have been very successful in protecting those assets. And just give you some numbers. Over 1,400 leases have been extended or purchased in 2007. That was over that 12-month period. So we've been very, very successful in doing that. We've got probably about 1,000 to go to make sure the next 15 years are completely taken care of. That should probably be done by the end of the year, but no later than probably six months after that for the vast majority of them. And we just try to do it in a common sense, economic approach.</p>

          <p>Anthony, the first part of your question was either on mute or something. Can you repeat it please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. It was just about anything that you might be doing to manage FX exposure in the Indian market going forward, particularly as you start making that a more significant presence in the international segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the key things about FX exposure or how we think about the currency is making sure if you're getting paid in a currency &#x2013; in the sovereign currency of that country, is you get the appropriate return. So we risk-adjust all capital expenditures based on ultimately how we're getting paid. So you take the sovereign rates, you adjust it for their equity market premiums and determine for us what the return on that asset is. The absolute fluctuations in those currencies we have not hedged out in the past and we probably will not hedge out in the past, unless we felt that there was a situation that was unique.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's safe to say that as you compare day one returns in the U.S. versus India, you are currency-adjusting those day one return estimates to &#x2013; for <mark type="inaudible" /> purposes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly right. We do it in Mexico, Brazil and we do that in India. In every country we look at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Plus Anthony, there's local currency-denominated costs that we incur so that's part of a sort of self-hedge in a way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The business in and of itself is hedged because you're incurring costs in the local currency. I guess I'm just wondering about how it translates into when you report U.S. revenue and EBITDA and things like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In the past, the only currency that's benefited us really has been the reais down in Brazil, and that's produced &#x2013; last year produced about 4 to 5 million bucks of revenue on 1.4 billion plus what the tower revenues were.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I look at your balance sheet today and you had roughly call it 4.4 billion of debt at the end of the quarter. And if I back out that 3.25% convert, that's pretty well in the money by a wide margin. And I look at the midpoint of your guidance, you could actually be below your low end of your leverage range. And I think even if you assume some pace of share repurchases with debt reduction, I think at worst you'll probably be at the very low end. And I guess it would seem like you guys are pretty well set up in this market in the sense that you're at the low end of the leverage range for the entire sector and the low end of your own leverage range and the credit markets are more challenging. And so I'm wondering if there are opportunities that you're looking at to perhaps be more aggressive, either I think some earlier questions were about maybe accelerating the share repurchase, but maybe about accelerating some of the purchase opportunities, maybe even in the U.S. as people aren't able to raise capital at the same types of rates that you've been able to and have the same type of leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anthony, most of the opportunities that you highlight are not on the small scale, they're on the larger scale. So when assets go above a certain price level in terms of the aggregation of that price, we do have we believe an advantage because we have access to capital and are fairly flexible from that perspective. And so we have looked at certain situations. On the smaller side, it is not apparent that we would have any advantage because buying 50, 100, even 200, 300 towers I think the access to capital is fairly readily available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, what are you seeing in terms of &#x2013; has there been a material change in terms of what sellers are looking to get paid given what has happened in the credit markets, or has there really not? Is there still a pretty wide bid-offer spread?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anthony, we haven't seen a big change in what sellers are willing to accept for tower assets that they think are valuable. And again, as Brad said, for those portfolios, they can be financed by numerous parties from different sources. And that hasn't changed our view of how we value these things. And basically it's the entry costs, what's the current cash flow and what's the potential growth of that cash flow. And when we make that equation work, we'll be able to finance it, we know we can, but it's not going to change the equation for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Final question. You've got a couple of bonds that are refinanceable this year and I think they're the last remaining securities that you have that have any limitations in terms of high yield covenants because I think that 7% note you did was more in the investment grade format. Just wondering about now as you sort of have another chance to redo your capital structure if you thought that that was something that made sense this year, if you could get the returns to work in terms of refinancing those remaining high-yield notes and going to an all-investment grade structure on the unsecured credit facility and then the investment grade covenant package.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anthony, it's something we look at. We basically just run it as economically it makes sense to do that. We have plenty of room under the restrictive payment baskets, which would really be the only gating item on those two bonds the 7&#x215B;s and the 71/2s. Since we have plenty of room and we're well below the 7.5 times leverage and that's without the carve-out for bank facilities. We think we'd have &#x2013; there at this point doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to call them in, but we do evaluate it quarter-to-quarter periodically.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" /> from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. If I could just follow up on the land purchases, I think historically you guys purchased land at about 10 or 11 times. Have you seen a change at all in prices there? And also a second question, sounds like demand is strong across all your markets. Can you maybe talk a little bit about pricing that you're seeing in the U.S. and Latin America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take land, and I'll turn it over to Jim for pricing. Our purchases this quarter are probably more in the 11 to 12 rather than the 10 to 11 range. So it's modestly slightly higher. We're still fairly judicious in terms of what we think's appropriate the pay for land. And in some cases if the historical rate was really low that would distort the multiples at which you pay. And that's the best way to think about it. But there are many people and many entities out there trying to buy land under towers. Some may not do it in the most economically appropriate way, but we try to be fairly thoughtful about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the demand side, <mark type="inaudible" />, it's not much affecting lease pricing, and historically we've talked about this over the years. Because the carriers' next best alternative is to build their own tower, and those factors of production don't change much. And therefore, the lease price sort of band doesn't change much. So the short answer to strong demand affecting initial lease pricing up or down is not much because of that alternative that carriers theoretically have, which is to build.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your final question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut from Jefferies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Actually two questions. The first is back on the land ownership. Is there another way that we can kind of quantify your protection on the downside of the land? Is there a weighted average linked on the leases? And second question is we've been hearing a lot about incremental demand from wireless backhaul. Are you seeing any applications, any installations on the wireless backhaul side? If you are, is that coming from carriers directly or is that coming from third-party backhaul providers? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jim. On the wireless backhaul &#x2013; I'll just take that first and turn it over to Brad on the land question. There is some incremental additional demand for microwave dishes for backhaul from a couple of carriers, I'd say in the U.S. That could be a combination of &#x2013; for redundancy purposes and/or adding capacity, and not &#x2013;  that's why we're paying for T-1s to do so. It's been modest, it's helpful and of course, FiberTower and a couple other smaller companies are out there doing it on a third-party basis. And we've supported them for the last few years as far as tower space. So we get lease revenue from both those sources. It's helpful. But it's not necessarily the driver of our revenue growth right now, although it is helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to give you &#x2013; be very specific about our land leases, and we do put it in the back of our investor presentations. But in the U.S., less than 1% of our cash flow is at risk before 2011, and less than 4% is at risk between 2011 and 2021. So in aggregate if you went all the way to 2021, it's under 5%. Does that frame it for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yea. And Jon, that team that Brad talked about earlier, which is out there renegotiating or purchasing that property, is focused exactly on that 5%. And working it down.</p>
