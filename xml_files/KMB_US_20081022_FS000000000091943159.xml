          <p>Excuse me everyone, we now have your speakers in conference. Please be aware each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of the presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Masseth. Mr. Masseth, you may begin sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David and good morning everyone. We appreciate your interest in Kimberly-Clark. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO, Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO and Randy Vest, Vice President and Controller. Here is the agenda for today's call; Mark will start with a review of our third quarter results and Tom will provide his perspective. That will leave us plenty of time for Q&amp;A. And for those wishing to follow along, we have a presentation of today's materials as usual in the Investors section of our website, which is www.kimberlyclark.com.</p>
          <p>First let me remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the call today. There can be no assurance that future events will occur as anticipated or that the Company's results will be as estimated. Please refer to the risk factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a description of factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted operating margin. Management believes that reporting in this manner enables investors to understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. For additional information on why we make these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, see today's news release and additional information on our website.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Mark.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike, good morning. I'm going to briefly review the quarter and I'll start with the top line. Overall sales increased about 8% to $5 billion including favorable currency effects of less than 3%. Organic growth was solid at almost 6%. It was driven by our focus on improving net realized revenue which led to a four point gain in net selling prices and two points of improved product mix.</p>
          <p>Total sales volumes were down about 1% and were impacted more than we anticipated by higher pricing. We're also seeing some effects of economic weakness and slower category growth or consumer trade down.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the top line for each of our segments.  In Personal Care, sales climbed almost 12%. Strong organic growth of about 9% was driven by increased sales volumes and higher net selling prices, each up about 4%. Improved product mix contributed an additional point of growth. In North America, sales increased nearly 7%. Net selling prices rose four points, while volume and mix each advanced more than 1%. The gain in selling prices included good progress from our mid-July increases on diapers and training pants. The volume growth was mostly due to our market leading Huggies baby wipes. Volumes for Huggies diapers and our child care brands were similar to year ago levels, and generally in line with plan, although we did experience short-term impact from increasing prices ahead of our major competitor.</p>
          <p>Moving to Europe, Personal Care sales volumes were off 8%. Huggies volumes in core markets were down the same percent as the promotional environment in Europe continues to be very competitive. In developing and emerging markets, Personal Care sales jumped nearly 20%. That's the 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.  Organic sales rose 15% as volumes increased 9% and improved price and mix contributed a total of six points of growth. Volume highlights included low 20s growth in the fast growing BRICIT countries, double-digit growth in Latin America overall and good performance in South Korea and Vietnam.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Consumer Tissues, sales rose 5% including three points of benefit from currency. Net selling prices were up 7%, with solid increases around the world and improved mix also benefited sales by 2%. Volumes fell about 7%.  Given the cost environment, we're trading off some volume in order to improve revenue realization. In North America net sales decreased 2%. Higher net selling prices of 6% and improved product mix were more than offset by a 9% decline in volumes. On the pricing front, benefits came primarily from the roll products increases we implemented in the first quarter and again in early August. Kleenex facial issue prices went up toward the end of the third quarter. We've made some progress so far with execution of our third quarter price increases but it's still early days and we continue to watch promoted price points carefully.  Regarding volumes, there are plenty of details in the news release, but in short, branded volumes were down across all categories. In addition, the volume declines continue to reflect our decision to exit some low margin private label business at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>Now switching to Europe, Consumer Tissue organic sales were up modestly, net selling prices rose 4% due to increases in several markets. Volumes fell about the same percent in response to the price increases and category weakness, particularly in the UK. In the developing emerging markets, Consumer Tissue organic sales rose 13% driven by a 12 point gain in net selling prices and four points of improved mix.</p>
          <p>Now moving to K-C Professional and Other, sales increased 8% including three points from currency. Organic sales rose 5% driven by higher net selling prices of 4% and improved mix of 2%.</p>
          <p>Overall sales volumes were down one point in the quarter. KCP continues to make progress with its targeted growth initiatives with double-digit global sales growth for high margin wipers and safety products in the quarter. In North America, KCP organic sales rose about 2% as price and mix each advanced 3%.  Compared to a strong year ago, volumes were down 4% and were impacted somewhat by our focus on increasing prices and the current economic environment.</p>
          <p>In Europe, KCP had a great quarter with double-digit volume growth and two points of higher prices. And in the developing and emerging markets KCP organic sales continued to increase at double-digit rates.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Health Care segment sales increased 4%. Top line growth was driven by higher volumes of 5% and currency benefits of 1%. Those gains were partially offset by lower net selling prices of 2%, reflecting continued competitive conditions in the surgical supplies market. Health Care sales volumes were up 4% in surgical supplies led by double-digit growth in exam gloves. Our higher margin medical device business had a solid quarter as well with 6% volume growth.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to operating profit and cost savings; and for this discussion I'll refer to adjusted operating profit and margin, which excludes certain charges and gains detailed in this morning's news release. Third quarter operating profit fell 9% to $626 million with an operating margin of 12.5%. Profitability was impacted by cost inflation of about $250 million in the quarter, that's the highest quarterly amount we've ever faced. Costs continued to increase during the quarter for many of our oil based inputs reflecting the effects of the spike in oil prices earlier in the year. Despite the inflation, we continue to reinvest in our brands. Strategic marketing investments increased by $25 million, rising faster than sales. Margins were also impacted by 60 to 70 basis points from planned production downtime we took in order to improve our inventory position.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to cost savings, total savings were $47 million in the third quarter. Our ongoing force program generated savings of $19 million in the quarter, that's despite higher spending at some of our facilities and below average productivity overall. In terms of the strategic cost reduction plan, we realized $28 million of year on year benefit in the quarter and we're tracking to exceed our original target for the year. Our teams remain very focused on cost savings in this environment, and we will deliver significant savings for the year. However, given the year to date results of $137, we may fall short of our full year objective of 200 to $250 million in savings for the year.</p>
          <p>Now let's look briefly at third quarter segment operating margins. As expected, margins were down in all segments due to the inflationary pressures we're facing. That said, Personal Care profitability remained healthy at nearly 19%. Moreover K-C Professional and other margins improved nicely from the second quarter. Besides the input cost inflation all segments were impacted by the production downtime I just mentioned, that's particularly true in Consumer Tissue and Health Care.</p>
          <p>Now switching briefly to taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 28.2% toward the low end of our previous guidance for a rate in the 28 to 30% range. Based on what we know now, the fourth quarter 2008 adjusted rate should be in the 27 to 29% range.</p>
          <p>Turning to equity income; equity income advanced 35% primarily due to increased earnings at K-C de Mexico. KCM's results reflect a double-digit sales growth and a favorable income tax settlement partially offset by cost inflation and currency losses incurred on about $300 million of US dollar denominated debt. The benefit to K-C from KCM's tax settlement was equivalent to about $0.03 per share, while the negative impact of the currency losses was about $0.01 per share.</p>
          <p>Now moving to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash provided by operations was $641 million. That's up 13% from the year ago period, mainly because of improved working capital performance. While our working capital metrics have improved over the last two quarters, we still have opportunities to improve our performance even further. Looking at capital spending, we invested $219 million in the quarter, that brings year-to-date spending to $652 million and we're on track with our full year investment target of 850 to $950 million.</p>
          <p>Regarding share repurchases, we bought 2.2 million shares of KMB stock at a cost of about $130 million during the quarter bringing year to date repurchases to $550 million.  Our solid balance sheet and capital structure has served us well in these uncertain times. In this environment we're being somewhat more conservative with our balance sheet and with capital deployment. As a result, we now expect to repurchase 600 to $650 million worth of our stock for the year. We also anticipate making a contribution to our US defined benefit pension plan in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So that wraps up the financial review. To recap the quarter, we achieved solid top line growth, our margins were way down by significant cost inflation, bottom line results were in line with plan, and we delivered improved cash flow.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. I'll comment briefly on the third quarter and then I'll review the outlook for the balance of the year and then we'll get to your questions. My headline this morning is that we're managing through a very challenging environment and our near-term focus is on revenue realization and cash flow. At the same time, we're doing what is right for the long-term health of the business.</p>
          <p>My perspective on our third quarter results would be to highlight several key points. First I'm proud of our Kimberly-Clark teams and how they have responded in the face of unprecedented cost inflation. Thanks to their efforts we have delivered solid organic sales growth of almost 6%.</p>
          <p>Our businesses in developing and emerging markets are also very healthy and made a big contribution to our growth in the quarter. Our D&amp;E teams are capitalizing on the opportunities that these rapidly growing markets offer us with a blend of great marketing, good product innovation and strong customer relationships. And then second, our focus on improving realized revenue is beginning to pay off and that's the key to offsetting the cost inflation we have experience and restoring our margins.</p>
          <p>We have been particularly focused on revenue realization in our Consumer Tissue and K-C Professional businesses. So I'm encouraged that net selling prices were up about 4% in the quarter and that our product mix was 2% favorable as well. Although as Mark mentioned our pricing leadership has held our volumes back more than we had expected, in this environment staying focused on revenue realization is the right focal point for us. And then third I'm pleased by the continued strength of our cash flow on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Our financial strength has served us well over the years. So despite the recent turbulence in financial markets we have had ready access to credit and the demand for Kimberly-Clark's commercial paper program has continued to be strong. Our financial strength also enables us to pay a healthy dividend and that provides an attractive yield to our shareholders and demonstrates our confidence in the future.</p>
          <p>So now let me turn to the outlook. The unprecedented volatility in global commodity currency and financial markets has resulted in as high a level of uncertainty in the current business environment that I have ever seen. So looking at our businesses today, there are a lot of moving parts and many of these are experiencing significant fluctuations even on a daily basis. And while this makes it more challenging to predict our results in the near term, the plan we are following is pretty clear.</p>
          <p>We're making sure we effectively manage the factors we can control so we're building our brands, we're improving our key capabilities, we're reducing our costs and then we're deploying our cash in ways that are friendly to our shareholders. And these are the right things for us to do to ensure the long-term health of our business. At the same time, we're taking the appropriate steps to improve our near-term results. We're driving price and mix, we're working on increasing our efficiency, and continuing to reduce our working capital.</p>
          <p>So our plan for the fourth quarter targets solid organic sales growth in the mid single digits and that's going to be driven primarily by higher net selling prices and improved product mix. Sales volume growth in the fourth quarter will likely be relatively weak due to our focus on revenue realization in areas of the economy that are also experiencing weakness. Nonetheless, we still expect to maintain higher levels of investment in strategic marketing in our customer development activities.</p>
          <p>Given the significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates over the last month, we would now expect that currency will be a drag on our fourth quarter sales comparisons instead of the benefit we have been experiencing over the past several years. And meanwhile the price increases that we have implemented during the third quarter along with some benefit from recent commodity cost reductions should help drive a sequential improvement in adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And that assumes consumer demand holds up and that there are no material changes in input costs and key foreign currencies from the current levels we're experiencing today. And the currencies that we're obviously watching most closely are listed in the presentation slides to this presentation today.</p>
          <p>I'm encouraged that commodity costs have recently started to decline, however it could take a while, it could take up to six months before those lower costs are fully realized in our results while the currency hit from the recent strengthening of the US dollar is reflected almost immediately. In fact, we now estimate that the recent changes in the currency exchange rates that have happened in the last month will have an adverse impact on our fourth quarter results by about 0.10 to $0.15 per share versus our previous plan and this includes sizable currency translation and transaction losses at Kimberly-Clark de Mexico.  Again, we're assuming current rates here and the peso has dropped about 15% over the last three weeks and I believe it's off again this morning.</p>
          <p>So, all in all based on what we know today, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter will be in the range of $1.02 to $1.07 and that compares with $1.11 per share in 2007. Given the anticipated fourth quarter performance, we now expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year of 2008 will be in the range of $4.15 to $4.20, again that's versus $4.25 per share in 2007. And this new guidance compares with our previous guidance of adjusted earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.30.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, our top line growth strategies continue to deliver good organic growth as we execute our targeted growth initiatives, increasing net selling prices, and continuing improve product mix. And although unprecedented levels of inflation have interrupted our bottom line growth, we have taken aggressive steps to offset the cost pressures. As a result, today we are in a good position to improve our margin sequentially in the fourth quarter and that will set the stage for further progress in 2009.</p>
          <p>Our teams are committed to improving our performance, and I'm also hopeful that we'll realize more benefits from recent commodity cost reductions once the currency and commodity markets settle down. But given the volatility that we're experiencing in the current environment, this could take some time. So regardless of the environment that we're in, you can count on us to stay true to our global business plan strategies and these are designed to build strong, enduring branded franchises and we're confident this route will create long-term sustainable growth for Kimberly-Clark and long-term value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, thank you for your interest today, and we'd now be happy to start to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj from Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Ali.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A few questions. One is first on price realization and obviously the elasticities were a little bit worse than you had suspected and it looks like though we think Consumer Tissue is kind of creeping more towards one in terms of the elasticity. What do you expect in terms of price &#x2013; I mean, I guess relaxation going forward. How do you think you're going to have to take down your prices particularly as commodities maybe do start rolling over here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point we're still trying to focus on realizing price, and you're not seeing as much of the commodity cost that has flowed through at this stage. Pulp just started to crack a bit this last month, you saw a $60 decline in southern hardwood but if you look at a lot of the other cost inputs in things like super absorbents and other things, we're really not seeing much cost declines yet.</p>
          <p>So, at this point, we've been aggressively pushing price up. We have been taking our promoted price points up where we can, not everybody in the category has, so we know there's going to be some volume exposure while we go through that. The one we'll probably watch closely is things like facial tissue which the price increase just went in at the end of the quarter and so obviously we're heading into the cold and flu season and we'll see how that performs as we go through that environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you raise a couple of things in there. One is, certainly you may not have seen the decline in commodities just yet, but as that starts happening, hopefully would you then expect to have to push back on pricing? I say that in the context of you're already seeing &#x2013; you mentioned it a couple times in your remarks earlier and also in the press release &#x2013; a competitive dynamic that is clearly being aggressive on pricing whether it be private label, whether it be some of these other branded players.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's something that obviously we're going to watch closely. We're &#x2013; if you look at our shares for the quarter, they were basically pretty stable, a little bit of weakness in tissue, a little bit of private label improvement so that's something that we'll obviously continue to watch. And, in the end, we're going to want to be competitive, but I also think in this environment where there's been so much cost inflation our focus is also to improve our margins in this period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on margins, one of the levers you're pulling off is cost savings and it looked like it disappointed a little bit this quarter. Is there a possibility --  or how big is the possibility that you had pulled forward your cost savings projects in the face of higher commodities and now you have a little bit less left going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a couple of things. As you look at the &#x2013; as you look at the breakdown on the material specification changes we continue to do pretty well and showed strong cost savings on that front. Productivity was actually negative for the first time in a while, which we took more downtime in the quarter, which we try to track separately. But obviously when you're taking more downtime you don't run as well either so, that was a part of it. Negotiated material price savings, obviously in the kind of inflation we've had recently it's harder to get givebacks from vendors, and then the all other at the end, there's no one big thing in there. I think there's a little bit of inflation that's flowing into that number. I also think with more downtime we probably didn't control our maintenance spending as well as we could have.  So, I continue to believe that there is good opportunity for us to deliver for savings over the long-term consistent with the goals we've set, but we're probably going to fall short in 2008 of the goals we set for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question, just on Personal Care, that's one where we immediately saw margins this quarter come down significantly. Can you talk a little bit about that? Is it pack sizing shift, is it channel shift to the private label, is it marketing increases? Just to give us a sense of that, please. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple things there. There was an increase in strategic marketing. Personal care probably had a disproportionate amount of that. They had &#x2013; they also got the brunt of the polymer cost increase kind of came in the quarter so polymer costs were higher in July than they were in June and higher August than July. And September they pretty well stayed up at that high level, so that flowed through in the quarter. There was a little bit of a mix shift as that second quarter is a pretty big little swimmers quarter for us, and so you saw relatively less little swimmers in the third quarter and more of the rest of the product mix flow through there, so probably our second quarter margins usually are a bit of a high point for us. So those are probably the three biggest factors I think that affected the comparison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good Morning, Gail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess going back to the volume trends, can you give maybe a little bit more color, I mean how much of &#x2013; if you think you'd get any of it back as other competitors follow with price increases? You mentioned you haven't lost much share, if you can maybe give a little bit more color particularly in the towel segment that you referenced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in the Consumer Tissue volume, there are several things going on this quarter. Some of it is we shed some private label volume earlier in the year which has been a comparison all year in that segment. There was also some desheeting that happened late last year in Cottonelle that we track as volume negative and price positive, so that's in there. And then you've seen some category weakness. Where actually the facial and towel categories have been &#x2013; were a little bit weaker in the third quarter than they have been historically.</p>
          <p>And then lastly we have probably lost a little bit of share, probably a point of share, in sequentially in bath and towels, so all of those factors combine to make it a pretty ugly volume quarter for Consumer Tissue. Now, you also saw in emerging markets particularly in Latin America we were very aggressive on price, took price up strong double-digits in many Latin-American markets, and took some volume risk there at the same time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And any of the weakness in third quarter, do you think any of that would be customer inventory destocking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say in some markets, we saw household inventory destocking more than customer inventory destocking. In the UK for example, the bath category was down pretty strongly, big shift to private label in the UK But you also saw less lift than normal from the large count pack promotions, where consumers were buying much smaller pack counts and not willing to inventory load as they may have in the past even though the promotional price points were similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just switching gears on the cost side, fully understand it's going to take some time to flow through, but can you give us a sense a little bit of a sense as moving into 2009, I mean pulp prices have started to move the last few months, waste paper is coming off dramatically. You probably don't have particular hedges or anything that would stop that from flowing through. I mean just when would you expect I guess to see the bulk of the release assuming things stay where they are today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I guess let me just talk about each of the commodity areas. Diesel fuel obviously is the one that we see first, because whatever the carriers pay flows through pretty quickly. So diesel, we've already started to see a little bit of benefit from. Pulp would probably be next, obviously you carry some inventory, and obviously you have your finished product in inventory, so you've probably got four to eight weeks of inventory in the system between raw materials and finished stock that will need to flow through before you start to see the benefits on both pulp and secondary fiber.</p>
          <p>Obviously southern hardwood dropped $60 a ton last month. I think northern softwood is up about $20 a ton. We've seen some very recent &#x2013; like in the last couple of weeks secondary fiber dropping 30 to $40 a ton as some of the Chinese exporters are not able to get letters of credit to be able to move some of that product overseas, so that's actually &#x2013; what we're not sure of is how temporary that is as more liquidity to comes into the financial system will that export market pick up again at some point? So that's one we're watching pretty carefully.</p>
          <p>Polymer takes a bit longer. Some of our polymer suppliers and super absorbent suppliers are still feeling some of the after effects of the hurricane season that went through the southern US, particularly Hurricane Ike. So we've had some of the base monomers that go into making super absorbent and making some of our other polymers have been in very short supply. We have even been on crisis management allocation programs to try to manage through that, and as that comes back into better balance, we would expect to see ultimately the benefit of lower oil prices flow through there. But it will probably &#x2013; that could take ultimately three to six months to show up in some cases.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, John.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I guess sort of just a quick follow-up on that, you guys have mentioned volatility in the raw materials a couple of times in your prepared remarks, and I guess we've got a little bit of color of that. I would guess to sort of interpret it what you're basically saying is the trend is in the right direction, but is it just the day-to-day volatility that makes you think that, look we're going to be &#x2013; we're going to hold off in terms of saying we have this, it's moving in our favor, or is it sort of there's still things on the horizon that make you think okay, we could see this thing whipsaw back to where it's a little less favorable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you're talking to a supplier today, I mean they've been &#x2013; they're using an oil-based feed stock, they've been whipsawed for the last three years. They've been behind on price realization, so they're sitting there looking at oil at $70 or just under $70, and is their center point $100 a barrel or $120 a barrel, or $80 a barrel. And so they're trying to think about and plan for what's that more likely to look like, and it's only been in the last month or so that it's really come off, and they're still remembering the $147 oil peak, and thinking we're a couple bad days in the market from running back up there.</p>
          <p>And so in the end it will start to correct, but in the near term I think everybody is trying to figure out what the zero point is. And in some cases you're seeing commodities still go up. I mean corrugate for us, which we use a lot of cardboard boxes to move our product, that was up high single, low double-digits again still in this quarter, so you're not seeing some of these costs come off as much as you might think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it sounds, and I hate to paraphrase for you, but it sounds like what it is &#x2013; it's less volatility than more caution, and the volatility really would be you can't predict that every single raw material is moving in one direction or the other? Are those two fair statements then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that's fair. You've seen some of the, I think some of the CEOs have been out taking multiple price increases in a quarter. You haven't seen the announcements of them rolling any of those back yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. And then one other question to follow-up again on the buyback just so I understand this. I mean you guys talked I think a little bit about caution in terms of reducing the buyback guidance. Is that caution in terms of being able to access the debt markets? Is that just look as numbers come down, you want to just hold on to a little bit more cash? Just give us a little bit of a sort of philosophical view in terms of why you're being a little more cautious on the buyback?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll let Mark talk about that and add a little more color. In the end we're going to put some money in the pension plan in the fourth quarter. May have to make a contribution in the first quarter. We've got to buy up the rest of our Andean affiliate, which I think we've announced, and that will happen in the first quarter.  So we've got a couple of calls on cash coming in the first quarter and we're probably going to just make sure we've got some dry powder here. But Mark I don't know if you want to add anything to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John, I think that's a fair characterization. It's not a big shift. We'll still buy back between two and 3% of our shares for the year which is our long-range target. We've had good call on our commercial paper access. We've got 850 some million dollars of CP in the market and we're usually plus or minus 200 million of that, and in this environment with the volatility of the financial markets maybe being on the low end of our typical range is &#x2013; we just feel is a smarter place to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But it sounds like it's more &#x2013; it's more about uses of cash than sources of cash right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's fair. We'd expect to see another solid cash flow quarter.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Connie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. When does the &#x2013; when do the falls in other currencies start to affect demand in those markets? Do you have a sense of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just on some forecast calls as Mark was with our emerging markets team and, early days, but we're not seeing it in demand, and they run the business in local currency every day, so the US exchange rate is kind of an externality to how they think about the business every day. I mean, obviously it affects their input costs to the extent that they were buying a lot of product or material that was imported from the US, they might see some translated increases. On the other hand, most of those commodities have gone down in cost on a relative basis.  So, I think they're all still trying to do the net calculus to see if they need any further price increase to recover the net swing there between commodity costs drop and exchange rate change. But, I think that overall, we're still pretty bullish on emerging markets. We saw another solid quarter of growth.  I would expect in local currency to see another solid quarter in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as you look at what's going on with currencies, do you &#x2013; does it seem to you that it is primarily a translation impact and that the memories of what happened between 1995 and 2001 when all the currencies -- emerging markets currencies dropped through the floor and really affected business on a local level -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I think it's sort of a chicken and the egg issue here, because I'm not sure it's the local currencies that are moving versus the US dollar that's moving, so it's all in your perspective, I guess. But certainly as the dollar was weakening, those local currencies really were a nice tail wind for us. Now the dollar has swung back the other way, and it will be a translation head wind for us.</p>
          <p>Probably the biggest transaction exposure we have is we talked about in the release was Mexico where they've got a couple hundred million dollars of US dollar denominated debt that we have to mark-to-market every month. And in individual markets they would have transaction exposures which we tend to hedge a portion of on a rolling 12-month basis, so as they're buying pulp or they're buying polymer and they know what those exposures are 12 months out, we've got that partially hedged going into 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then one final question on that, I think you said in your remarks that you expected mid single digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. I assumed you meant organic sales growth and that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...reported sales are likely to be down because of currency? Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, currency will definitely be a drag. We'll see. I think at this point the organic sales growth will be mid singles and then we'll see at this point given what exchange rates are trading every day, I'd say current rates we'll definitely have a head wind from currency in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning guys. Just to sort of take a step further in the currency thing, can you just talk about what the translation impact is relative to say a percentage change in the top line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, if you look at just in real gross ballpark numbers a rough basket of currencies have probably depreciated what 13 to 15% in the last month or so, and developing and emerging markets is about a third of sales prior to that, 32% of our sales. So you could see a 4 or 500 basis point drag on top line just from those. That doesn't include Europe, so I don't know if Mike if you've got any other perspective on that. Is that helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just trying to figure out what the transaction piece of it is. So if it's 4 to 600 basis points on the top line, what that translates to on the bottom line? Because I imagine &#x2013; I know you hedge a little bit but you have a fair bit of dollar denominated cost as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't hedge translation first of all, so we won't spend cash to hedge a noncash exposure. And we typically hedge about half of our transaction exposure on a rolling 12-month basis, so of the amount that we're going to hedge every month, we'll hedge about a 1/12 of that going forward, so we would have some of that protected again.</p>
          <p>Probably the biggest single transaction exposure is in Mexico, so if you look at how the peso performs, we've got a little over 200 million in US dollar debt and probably closer to 300 million in US dollar debt so you can do the math on what that will cost us. I mean probably if you look at just Mexico sequentially given where the peso is today and if you strip out the &#x2013; they had some tax benefits in the third quarter that won't repeat, I mean there's probably $0.05 a share sequential drag just from Mexico on the tax and transactional currency impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. And just on the P&amp;L pension cost, I mean should we look for a big uptick in the expense piece of your pension exposure both next quarter and then looking out to next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we only set pension expense, Bill, once a year based on your funded status at the beginning of the year, so you set out your pension assumptions and then that's your expense for the year, and then &#x2013; so going into '09 we'll obviously give you more guidance on it, but you can expect that our pension plan has performed pretty much like the market's performed, and so I would expect both higher funding on the pension plan in 2009 and significantly higher pension expense in 2009, and we'll give you more color on that in January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. And then just one last one if I could. There was no mention of China anywhere in the press release. I mean how is that business trending after the Olympics obviously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Continued to do well. I mean overall we've continued to see solid growth in our BRICIT markets and China has performed pretty consistently. We haven't seen a big falloff there. So -</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I have a follow-up question on currency and again this has to do with the impact on the bottom line. It sounds as if some of your costs offshore are denominated in dollars such that if the top line were reduced by 5% by currency, would the bottom line be cut by more than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess maybe the way to think about currency, there is a transaction exposure because we buy pulp everywhere in US dollars. We buy a lot of polymer or non-woven materials to be priced in US dollars. Obviously all the local labor content would be in local currency as well as a lot of the other materials that we would source locally where we can.</p>
          <p>If you look at the places where we make good profit and have strong margins were some of the markets that were highlighted in the attachment to the earnings call comments this morning, but I'd pay attention to the UK; I'd pay attention to the Korean Won; I'd pay attention to the Australian Dollar; I'd look at the Mexican Peso, probably the Brazilian Real. Those would be big markets for us where we generally make pretty good profit and so you'll get both translation exposure top and bottom line there, but you'll also have some transaction exposure on top of it where they're buying some commodities in local currencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And along those lines you told us that the currency hit versus your former guidance would be 0.10 to $0.15 in the fourth quarter. Could you tell us how much currency has boosted your earnings through the first nine months of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a couple cents in the third quarter, Alice, and for the year-to-date, it's about $0.15 cents.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>$0.15?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And now my other question is on the fourth quarter, the mid single-digit organic growth. I'm just trying to take the pieces apart.  Compared to the third quarter will pricing likely be stronger than the third quarter and volume weaker than in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the only new pricing that would be coming in the fourth quarter would be obviously the facial tissue increase we talked about that went into effect late in the third quarter. We've also got some K-C Professional price increases that are beginning to rollout into the fourth quarter, so that would be the biggest uptick sequentially in price realization. We usually have a stronger volume quarter on facial tissue because of cold and flu, so we would be looking for that to be a little bit better sequentially. Other than that, probably pretty similar trends to the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So sort of flat to down 1% volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, again, I wouldn't expect a big lift from volume. Most of that organic is going to be price and mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my last question is about North America Personal Care where the volume deceleration was pretty steep, and you cited child care being down. Is that category down? I guess you said you're not losing share, and I'm wondering if there is just pantry deloading or if consumers actually do cut back on that kind of product in tough times?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've seen a little bit of shift from training pants into diapers as you're seeing consumers are leaving children in diapers longer and maybe opting for the diaper is less expensive per piece than a training pant. We've also, in Personal Care, the other factor that you had in the quarter is that we both us and our primary competitor took price increases. Ours went into the market three weeks ahead of our primary competitor and so for three weeks in August we were out there at higher prices.</p>
          <p>And then there were some accounts &#x2013; some promotional price point differences for about another three weeks, so there were an about a six-week period on both diapers and pants in the quarter where we were at a price disadvantage in at least some key accounts, and so we elected to take that risk to drive the revenue realization, and so that was probably another factor for the softer volume a bit in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How long can deloading last? Pantry deloading?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean in terms of what you're seeing in consumer behavior varies by category, obviously in diapers and bathroom tissue they're going to go back to the store and restock because they need those products every day, but they may over the course of a month, they may buy the large count packs at the beginning of the month when they've got plenty of paycheck when they get to the end of the month and they're out of paycheck they may buy a smaller count pack or they may buy a smaller four count pack instead of a 20 count pack of bathroom tissue. So you're seeing that shift in consumer behavior during a pay period cycle more than we maybe have in the past. So that would be one factor to start to look at.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to ask about the timing on pulp prices coming down and how it flows through your inventory. I thought you had said last quarter that US inventories are fully on a LIFO basis so you kind of get that immediate effect flowing through. Is that not right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You should get some of it, but you've also got it in your finished product as well, so it takes longer than that to actually flow through your P&amp;L. All of our inventories outside the US are not on LIFO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So for the US side on the part that is LIFO it's just a matter of your finished goods inventory flowing through, so if we could just look at your finished inventory days that would be a good gauge of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's probably a better proxy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Great. And then on the planned downtime in your plants, and I know you're saying I think 60 to 80 basis points, something like that.  First of all, can you just translate that directly down to EBIT or is there another part of that that I'm not thinking of? And then also, is that downtime essentially over for the year and for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it obviously depends on volume, so if we have a weaker volume quarter we'll probably continue to take downtime to manage inventory.  So, we're trying to make sure we deliver on our working capital goals, and that we aren't running up a lot of inventory in this kind of an environment. So, I think that we will continue to have some downtime particularly in Consumer Tissue where the volumes were weaker in the fourth quarter and that could continue into 2009 depending on how things play out in the categories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. So in other words, don't think of that as maintenance downtime; think of it as just slowing your plants because volume is slower? I mean is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then just a real simple question, I guess. The 0.10 to $0.15 currency related impact that you guys saying will be hitting Q4 relative to your previous guidance, is it a fair statement that had the dollar not moved so aggressively and obviously you can't separate that completely from commodities but since you haven't seen much on a commodity side, would you guys have been raising numbers this quarter had the dollar not moved as it did?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm going to choose not to play with the hypothetical deck today, Chris, but what I would say is there have been so many big moving parts that it is more difficult to forecast the business probably than at any time I can remember. When you're seeing the kind of shifts in currency and the shits in oil, one of the things that we've done as a management team, is you used to be able to set forecast assumptions five or six weeks ahead of when the forecast was going to roll up and be pretty sure they weren't going to drift too much. And now we're looking at adjusting them before the day the forecast rolls up because everything can change in a short period of time. So it is a different environment to be able to run the business and predict what we're going to deliver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's no direct offset I should be thinking of? I mean, it's fair to take that gross currency impact number and just look at what your numbers would look like otherwise right? Unless there is some other big thing that you're not talking about that would have gone the other way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Again, probably the biggest transaction exposure is in Mexico but the translation should correlate pretty well to what has happened with commodities, if you track the dollar/euro exchange rate versus a barrel of oil over an extended period of time, you'd see a pretty tight fit. So I don't know which one is cause and which one is effect, but they certainly are correlated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Jason Gere with Wachovia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Most questions have been answered. Just a couple of quick questions. One, can you talk about KCP and some of the stronger trends in Europe relative to North America and maybe just on the North America side if you can talk more macro, office vacancies, hotel contracts, any of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good question. And KCP is one where we typically would see the signs of economic weakness earlier than other parts of our business. But that hasn't been the case so far this cycle overall. KCP in Europe had a great quarter, not as much in the UK which has been our strength, but strong results in Germany, some strong results in Central Europe, so continued good growth in that business. The team is doing a great job of delivering.</p>
          <p>In the US, probably a bit more focused on price realization. But even as we talk to our distributors in that business, I'd say they're cautious. They're seeing their customers much more selective on the need to have items in their bundle and less on the nice to haves, but we haven't seen a big shift in our business at this point this time. We're pretty heavily placed in manufacturing office building, health care, lodging and things like that which you'd think would start to feel it here. We're not as strong in food service, which I know has been particularly weak at some of the dining out restaurants, their numbers have shown lately. But so far our mix is holding up reasonably well. We're continuing trying to and drive our safety channel business and our workplace and wiper business, which is higher margin for us, and so that has also probably we've got a little bit healthier mix than maybe we've had before going into a downturn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess just on the other side, just thinking about Europe, obviously it looks like you're getting pricing on Consumer Tissue, not on Personal Care, and I guess in a normal economic cycle you would think that would be kind of the opposite with Personal Care being more value added. Can you just talk maybe a little more about the promotional environment out there and especially on the Personal Care side what you can do really to try and I guess stem the losses on the volume side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean Europe has probably been the toughest competitive market anywhere in the world right now, and really on all fronts. You're seeing pretty high commodity cost increases that have been flowing through, I mean very high energy rate increases, electricity rates in the UK are up by a huge amount as they've had actual electricity shortages as they've had a lot of their operating network shut down over there. So, some much bigger localized cost increases than you would have expected from the overall numbers, and despite that, it's been tough to get price.</p>
          <p>In Personal Care, our primary competitor has been running a lot of buy one get one free promotions. We haven't matched all of those, so we took a bigger volume hit this quarter. We are focused on launching improved tier five products and are putting promotional and brand building support behind that, but having said that, we have probably lost a point of share in Europe in diapers across the measured markets.</p>
          <p>On the tissue front, you're continuing to see pretty weak categories. In the UK just the whole bathroom tissue category was down, which is kind of unheard of, and retailers are trying to interrogate it, and it's been a big growth in private label. It's been some pantry destocking, and obviously with our Andrex brand, we felt the brunt of that as the brand leader. So Europe is feeling like a much weaker economic environment than even we're seeing in the US.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Andrew Sawyer with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, just first one quick housekeeping item. Can you just give some framework about what scale of pension contributions we're talking about? Are we looking 100 million, 200 million, those types of numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think for this year, it's probably 50 million for next year, it will probably be a much larger number than that, but we'll give you some perspective. It obviously depends on how we finish the year ultimately because your year-end valuation is what will determine that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that's 50 million over and above expense or 50 million absolute?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's 50 million absolute contribution to the US plan, so we've made other contributions to other plans in other markets over the years, so you'll see probably a different number in the footnotes at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just turning quickly to kind of '09 business planning you're talking a lot about challenges even forecasting tomorrow let alone a full-year '09. As you think about it, are you guys sticking with the idea that your commodity retreat won't flow through to your numbers, and you need to get the pricing? Or are you taking a more adaptive approach and saying, we don't necessarily need to stick to pricing, and maybe we'll get a little stronger volume? And how are you guys holding your down the line managers accountable for sales goals and margin goals in that kind of a fluid environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're still developing 2009 plans as you would imagine. One of the things we're doing is looking at multiple scenarios, looking at a high, medium and low oil price scenario, what implications does that have for other commodities and what do we expect the cost environment will look like. Obviously looking at multiple currency scenarios, and looking at what we can afford to invest in brand building, what are our innovation plans, because ultimately continuing to drive innovation and brand building is what will help you avoid becoming a commodity and help you to continue to build branded equity in your businesses. But then starting to think about how do you manage in an environment that is going to be much more volatile than we've had historically? And typically we can't change price quickly and easily in this environment, and so we still haven't completely figured out how to do that, but we're all going to learn how to be a little nimbler if we're going to have the kind of volatility that we're seeing in markets today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you start with a default view or do you start by running your business as though you're going to see the high oil scenario and then adapt the other way? That's basically which you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd say we're going to start with a conservative set of assumptions around commodity costs and then look at variability after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, thank you very much guys.</p>

          <p>It's the first time I've heard that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wasn't going to say anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was like wait, where am I? Okay. If you guys could talk a little bit about emerging markets. I know you touched a bit on it with regard to currency, but just kind of very fluid situation, any kind of signs of slowdown in category growth or your thoughts about middle class expansion continuing as we head into or in the midst of a building macroeconomic global slowdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I guess I would say this as I said it earlier, the emerging markets guys, they run the business in local currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I'm not worried about the local currency. I just meant that's all we really touched on before. I mean the business in the local market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the point is that they're continuing to see the kind of job growth and middle class development and so forth in local currency that will hopefully have more people be able to afford to enter our categories. Now things may slow down a bit, and if you look at our emerging markets growth rate was a little slower than it was earlier in the year, but it can still &#x2013; I think we're up, what 18% top line in emerging markets for the fourth quarter or for the third quarter, so I think we would probably expect it to slow down a little bit, but it will still be the fastest growing part of the business next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if you could touch on the planning assumption, the 900 million or as much as $900 million, I know you said you are expecting a little bit of help in Q4 from the moderation seen in input and energy costs, but what order of magnitude are we talking about, because you also talked about the natural lag effects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if we had said it was 900 last quarter, it's probably more like 750 to 800. And, pulp is probably going to be 40, 45 million better just from some of the recent decreases that we've seen. All of the oil related polymer and so forth will be a little better, probably 20 million. So I guess I'd say those are probably the two bigger factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the final question was just as you're thinking about manufacturing downtime, is the goal still to continue being able to reduce inventory, or is right now what's more important is not letting it build? I'm just trying to get the same order of magnitude for how much downtime is reasonable to think about if you're still going after the goal of really improving inventory levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean there is a couple of ways of thinking about it. We have targeted inventory levels for every business, every SKU basically, so it's how do we get better at running the target over time as opposed to running the time or, those kinds of things. So we're trying to build more flexibility to grade change more frequently, we're trying to build more flexibility to grade change more frequently or even take downtime out of the system as needed as opposed to saying we're going to run this code for a week and then we'll grade change for the next code.</p>
          <p>So those are a lot of capabilities we're building into the business teams, and it's trying to do it and not have it hurt your cost as much as it does, so how do you find a way to take the downtime and shed as many of the costs use can to have &#x2013; minimize your cost impact. Now, having said all of that, you want to &#x2013; you ultimately want to grow your volume so that you fill up your asset base and not get really good at managing downtime. So -</p>

          <p>Hi, Tom, good morning.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, first question is on the just a little nit-pick here on the debt that's tied to the timberland transactions in the past, it was like 611 million that was consolidated, I think starting last quarter. Was that about the same number this time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I don't think it changed. So -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second question is could you just talk a little bit about how you think about the dividend? I know that going back to the early '70s, you've raised it pretty much every year, and you would seem to have some cushion in these uncertain times if you things stay kind of tough with maybe foregoing buybacks. Is the dividend something you like to see rise next year, or is it just too early for you to make that commitment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we would say that we have a strong commitment to the dividend and that we have set our goals that we would increase the dividend consistently at a faster rate than earnings growth. Now, we're going to have a down year this year, but I would still expect there would be some level of dividend increase in 2009. We'll obviously be recommending that to the board and talking about it later this year, and they'll declare it early next year, but that would be how we're currently thinking about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the last question is on the &#x2013; you're coming to the end of the 3.5 year strategic cost reduction plan, and it looks like you're pretty much achieving what you thought. The world has changed a lot in that time. Are you contemplating something maybe on the smaller scale or similar scale for the future, or do you think you'll give it a rest on the strategic cost reductions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think as one strategic plan comes to an end, you start thinking about what are the next things you can do with the business, so obviously you can expect we've got an ongoing look at our strategic planning process, and if we ever find that there are actions we can take that will be shareholder value creating and strengthen our business, we won't be shy about bringing those forward. But at this point in time we're focusing on delivering and finishing the current plan, and then as we have more things to talk to you about at some point, we'll obviously bring those up then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. In terms of that, you mentioned downtime in the current call and also you de-emphasized some of the private label activities &#x2013; or I'm sorry, lower price point brands that you've had in the tissue area. Is it possible that you could see some of the capacity reductions in the next year or two in the tissue business at least in the US and maybe even in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think our footprint in the US is still pretty solid, so we've got a little bit of what we would call white space, but we're setting about filling it, and have got the right asset configuration here, so I don't see any capacity changes of any significance in the US at this point.</p>

          <p>Hi, Tom, I think you said in the past that maybe you thought that some of the management incentives regarding working capital and inventory kind of needed to be adjusted. Is that something that is changing now or is that something that will be put into place in 2009?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Every one of our business teams has a working capital goal in their annual incentive plan this year. And so as we do forecast reviews, we look at that every quarter along with the operating results of the business.</p>
