        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Maximilian Sch&#xF6;berl, Director of Corporate Affairs. I would like to welcome you all to our half year telephone conference of BMW AG in 2011.</p>
          <p>With me today are Dr. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management; and Dr. Friedrich Eichiner, our CFO.</p>
          <p>First, Dr. Reithofer will give you all an update on the company's business developments during the first half of the year as well as provide you with some highlights for the second half of the year. Dr. Eichiner will then take you through our financial results for the second quarter and the first half of the year as well. Afterwards, we will have time for our Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Mr. Reithofer, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Our cars and motorcycles are definitely trendsetters. Their design language and cutting-edge innovations are highly desired by our customers around the world. As a result, we raised our forecast for the business year 2011.</p>
          <p>So, what are our new targets? Record sales of over 1.6 million cars, record pre-tax result from the Group level which significantly exceeds last year's result, and EBIT margin in the Automobile segment of more than 10% and a considerable increase in the result before taxes of the Financial Services segment.</p>
          <p>Despite these positive figures, the economic environment is and we expect it will continue to be extremely volatile. Global risks continue to increase rather than decrease. There are concerns about the sizeable national debt of many countries and political unrest in certain regions is also having a negative effect on economic conditions worldwide. Concerted action of the international community is required to be able to maintain the economic and financial strength worldwide as well as the stability of global currencies.</p>
          <p>Markets in general and automotive markets in particular are showing heterogeneous development. And there's another aspect for the BMW growth in the second half of the year. Production changeover from the first generation of BMW 1 Series to the second generation will have an effect on our sales growth.</p>
          <p>Currently, we are benefiting from our attractive, young model portfolio. Our strong market position in many countries and from a variety of efficiency measures consistently implemented throughout our company. The first six months of 2011 was the best half year ever in our company's history. Never before have we sold more cars and more BMW motorcycles in the first two quarters of the year. Never before have we achieved a better result during this time period.</p>
          <p>Here are some key financials for the first half of 2011: a pre-tax result of &#x20AC;4.5 billion, a net profit at Group level of &#x20AC;3 billion, an EBIT margin in the Automobile segment of 13.3%. We managed to grow in almost all automotive markets during the first six months of 2011. This is the best proof of the quality of our cars as well as our innovative strength, trendsetting design and our highly efficient engines. Let me offer some examples of our market strength. Global Automotive Markets are plus 6%; BMW Group is plus 19.7%. U.S. Car Market, plus 13%; BMW Group, plus 18%. China, plus 20%; BMW Group, plus 61%. India, plus 21%; BMW Group, plus 107%. Brazil, plus 7%; BMW Group, plus 69%. UK, minus 7%; BMW Group, plus 14%. And Japan, minus 30%; BMW Group, plus 4%.</p>
          <p>All in all, the BMW Group delivered over 833,000 cars and over 64,000 motorcycles of the two brands, BMW and Husqvarna in the first half of 2011. This is due to our attractive product range. The new BMW 5 Series and the BMW X5 are market leaders in their respective segments. The BMW 7 Series, the BMW X3, and the BMW X1 also posted increases. The new BMW 6 Series convertible has been available since Spring and the new 6 Series Coup&#xE9; is coming this Fall.</p>
          <p>The convertible has already enjoyed a very positive reception from the international media. The BMW 1 Series M Coup&#xE9; was launched in May. And from Fall on, we will also offer the BMW M5. Another launch scheduled for the Fall is the new MINI Coup&#xE9;.</p>
          <p>In the Motorcycle Segment, we extended our BMW product range with the K1600 GT and GTL in March which are the first models with six-cylinder engines. Husqvarna has launched three new models this year so far with a fourth to follow.</p>
          <p>In July, we presented the BMW 1 Series in Berlin. The media response to the second generation of this BMW model series has been incredibly positive. Starting in the Fall, customers will be able to purchase the new BMW 1 Series. Please remember 70% of the first generation 1 Series customers previously owned a different brand of car.</p>
          <p>At our last conference call, I said it is our responsibility to ensure the BMW Group's future success. Last Friday, we set a new milestone. The first two concept cars of our BMW i range celebrated their world media premier in Frankfurt. We remained confident that in the future e-Mobility will be a choice for many customers. Our belief is strengthened by the experiences of our customers who are testing e-Mobility in everyday use today with the MINI E and soon with the BMW ActiveE.</p>
          <p>Our sub-brand, BMW i, stands for a new architecture designed from the ground up for e-Mobility for an electric, for visionary mobility services, for inspiring design and for a new approach to premium mobility that is defined among other things by a highly sustainable value chain.</p>
          <p>For us, BMW i is part of our long-term strategic alignment in keeping with our Strategy Number ONE. This also comprises a wide variety of innovative services. They will help attract young customers to our brands and grow the image of our brands by adding new benefits. These types of services are well received by customers. As right now, our joint venture with Sixt has shown. Only a few weeks after its introduction, over 4,500 customers in Munich have used our car sharing service. We are planning to add e-cars to the fleet in the future.</p>
          <p>Financial Services is expanding its service offering as well. The acquisition of ING Car Lease has strengthened Alphabet's fleet management at Financial Services.</p>
          <p>BMW i demonstrates our ability to develop and implement new technologies by virtue of our own strength. In our Leipzig plant, we will be hiring the first 100 employees for the production of the BMW i3 and BMW i8 over the course of the next few months. And from 2013, we will be gradually taking new mobility concepts to market. A major factor in these efforts will be our involvement in the Summer Olympic Games in London around this time next year. BMW is the official automobile partner for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, providing 4,000 vehicles.</p>
          <p>Our fleet for London will be as diverse as the competition at the Games itself. There will be a &#x2013; there will be 200 e-drive MINI E and BMW ActiveE cars as well as hybrid models and motorcycles. The lion's share of the fleet will consist of high-efficiency diesel cars. Our fleet will emit less than 120 grams CO2 per kilometer on average. We will also provide our Pedelecs and 400 BMW Streetcruiser bicycles.</p>
          <p>The BMW Group was selected for the London Games because of our comprehensibly and sustainable approach to mobility. After all, we are the only automaker among the members of the Sustainability Club for the London Games. This is all part of our premium claim. Another aspect is we listen, we want to understand what moves people, together with our partners, we develop viable solutions for our future.</p>
          <p>Today, we are opening the BMW Guggenheim Lab in New York City. This is our most comprehensive and most ambitious cultural cooperation to date. Together with the renowned Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, we have created a platform for multidisciplinary dialog. Experts from a variety of fields will come together to discuss creative, and most importantly, sustainable approaches for life in the world's largest cities. We want to learn from them and implement specific solutions. The BMW Guggenheim Lab will be in Berlin starting Spring 2012.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our business development in the first half of 2011 shows that there are both risks and many opportunities. The crucial point is we are taking advantage of these opportunities to shape the future of individual mobility in the premium segment. Thanks to our business model, we are well prepared to do so. We remain cautiously optimistic regarding the BMW Group's continued development.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Dr. Reithofer. And now, Mr. Eichiner will give you an update on the financials of the BMW Group. Mr. Eichiner, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon from my side as well. We've had an extremely successful first half of 2011, sales growth, our high-end vehicle mix and attractive net pricing have resulted in excellent margins. BMW Group reported total earnings before taxes of &#x20AC;2.7 billion in the second quarter. In fact, our year-on-year earnings more than doubled. Pre-tax earnings for the year to the end of June totaled &#x20AC;4.5 billion. This means that our half yearly earnings were almost as high as our earnings for the whole of 2010. I'm sure you agree that <mark type="ph" /> is impressive. (12:55) Our Strategy Number ONE has made us highly profitable.</p>
          <p>One-off effects had a positive impact on our quarterly results. The economic recovery improved the risk situation in our lending and leasing business. This contributed &#x20AC;464 million to Group earnings.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to talk about the most important point in the Automotive segment. In mid-July, we issued a revised business outlook for 2011. This was mainly due to strong sales and good business prospects for the rest of the year. BMW Group's sales for the year to the end of June were 20% higher than the previous year.</p>
          <p>In Germany, the U.S., the UK, and China, we sold considerably more vehicles than last year. China accounted for 14.5% of sales in the first half of the year; in comparison, North America made up almost a fifth and Germany more than 17%. We are maintaining a balanced global market distribution. We expect sales for the full year 2011 to climb to more than 1.6 million vehicles. This would be an increase of more than 10% over last year. We are now targeting an EBIT margin of more than 10% for 2011 in the Automotive segment. Also, on an adjusted basis, that means taking into account the one-off effect from improved residual values.</p>
          <p>We achieved new all-time highs for revenue and earnings. Revenue increased by 22% in the second quarter to about &#x20AC;16.7 billion. The segment profit before financial result rose to &#x20AC;2.4 billion, 83% more than in the previous year. The EBIT margin for the same period was 14.4%. The positive one-off effect I referred to contributed &#x20AC;85 million to the EBIT in the Automotive segment.</p>
          <p>In our key used car markets of the United States, Germany and the UK, we were able to obtain much better prices than anticipated for our off-lease vehicles. As a result, we were able to adjust our provisions for residual value risks. We also took current market trends into account in our provisions for residual value risk.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for this effect, the EBIT margin as a segment reached 13.9% in the second quarter, 2 percentage points higher than in the first quarter. Our healthy returns proved that our profitability measures are taking effect. Efficiency has further increased for our sales incentives have continued to decrease on the performance side.</p>
          <p>Our attractive product portfolio and regional distribution of sales also brought major benefits. We once again profited from lower manufacturing costs for our recently launched models in the second quarter. We expect to see a further decrease in manufacturing costs with the new 1 Series and other future models. Our upcoming vehicles were developed thoroughly on the basis of our modular strategy. This will also have a positive impact on quality. We are closely monitoring the high volatility in currencies and raw materials.</p>
          <p>Our forward-looking hedging strategy paid off in the first half of the year. Positive currency effect more than offset the negative impact of raw material prices. Prices for steel, aluminum, copper, plastics and precious metals in particular easily surpassed the previous highs in the first six months of 2011. In the second half of the year, the balance between currencies and raw material prices will shift resulting in a negative impact on earnings. However, for the full-year, we expect these opposing effects to offset each other.</p>
          <p>Capital efficiency will remain a priority. At the same time, we have also made extensive investments in new products and production equipment and are currently expanding our plant in Germany, U.S., and China. Nevertheless, our investment ratio will stay below 7% of revenue for the rest of the year on account of rising sales revenues.</p>
          <p>We have once again expanded our research and development activities from last year's level. We are developing tomorrow's innovations today. Our R&amp;D expenses for electro-mobility in our alternative drive concepts remain the focus of our activities. The startup costs for vehicle electrification and development of new materials and concepts has been factored into our earnings planning. We are taking advantage of more efficient development processes to make selective consistent investments.</p>
          <p>Our strong revenues in the first half year boosted free cash flow in the segment. For the year to the end of June, it totaled just under &#x20AC;2.6 billion. If we factor in the &#x20AC;625 million in equity we injected into our Leasing business, free cash flow would have reached around &#x20AC;3.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Financial Services segment continued to experience dynamic growth. We generated a pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;744 million in the second quarter. This reflects the extraordinary effect I mentioned at the beginning of my statement. The economic recovery in many markets has dramatically improved our credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>As a result, we have adjusted our provisions for credit losses and reevaluated our leasing portfolio. This contributed &#x20AC;379 million to segment earnings. Combined with lower credit risks, recovery in used car prices, quite substantial in some areas, had a positive impact on quarterly earnings. The credit-loss ratio fell from 0.55% in the first three months to 0.43% in the first half of the year. Our Financing and Leasing business continue to perform extremely well on account of our growing Automotive business and expanded by almost 11% worldwide.</p>
          <p>We concluded more than 314,000 new contracts. The business volume in balance sheet terms for the year to the end of June was nearly &#x20AC;65.8 billion. Inflation rate was lower than in the second quarter. For last year, Financial Services leased or financed 40.4% of new BMW Group vehicles.</p>
          <p>To strengthen our international fleet management and leasing business, we acquired ING Car Lease in July. We are still awaiting approval from the relevant European Anti-trust authorities. In ING Car Lease, we are acquiring a healthy, successful business. It has been highly profitable for many years and generates a return on equity of more than 18%. The European fleet management market is growing. We see this acquisition as a strategic investment that would deliver major benefits for Alphabet. It will provide us with access to new customers and allows us to optimize our market position and service offering.</p>
          <p>Together, the two companies will make the new organization the number five in Europe with around 540,000 leasing and fleet management contracts in 16 European countries. With that synergy effects, we will also take advantage of the additional size potential the acquisition will generate for our brand. The ING Car Lease fleet spans different vehicle segments and therefore complement that of Alphabet. We believe fleet business could also become an important platform for e-Mobility.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, in the Motorcycle Segment, the two brands sales performance varied a great deal. In the second quarter, BMW Motor has sold more than 37,000 bikes in a shrinking market, doing well to achieve a new sales high. As <mark type="ph" /> Husqvarna (21:33) sales declined, the segment as a whole continues to contract. However, the restructuring of the brand's globalization organization will have a positive impact on sales performance over the medium term.</p>
          <p>The segment generated revenue of &#x20AC;450 million, around 3% more than the previous year. The profit before financial result totals &#x20AC;47 million. We expect our Motorcycle business to increase sales and revenues in the current year, the repositioning of Husqvarna will burden full-year earnings.</p>
          <p>Our Group liquidity remained high at &#x20AC;9.1 billion as per June 30. This gives us greater freedom from possible volatility on a capital market. On account of our positive business development, the rating agency Moody's has upgraded our ratings. The BMW Group has regained the agency's top P1 short-term rating. The company's long-term rating was raised by one notch to A2. This puts us ahead of other European automobile manufacturers and among the top three worldwide.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we expect conditions in the second half of the year to remain favorable, allowing us to maintain our positive business performance. However, we do believe that the dynamic growth we have seen in many markets will slow towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We are able to confirm our forecast for 2011. We expect to sell more than 1.6 million vehicles and achieve an EBIT margin of over 10% in Automotive segment. At Group level, our pre-tax profit will be considerably higher than last year. However, from today's perspective, it seems unlikely that we will be able to maintain a high EBIT margin of the second quarter through the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>That is mainly due to Motorcycle effects. There will a negative impact on earnings as we phase out the current BMW 1 Series and other <mark type="ph" /> motorcycle (23:35) models. We expect ramp up and marketing expenses for the new models to generate additional costs of about &#x20AC;500 million in the second half of the year. The model changes would probably lead to higher sales incentives in the final month of the life cycle. It's important to us that our employees share in the success of our company and so our considerably higher earnings will also be reflected in higher bonuses.</p>
          <p>Reserves, we need for this would continue to be accrued pro rata in the second half of the year and therefore also impact earnings. The same applies to the currency and raw material issues I talked about earlier. Rising prices for raw materials in the second half of the year will not be completely offset by the currency tailwind. We predict that this effect would be in the low three-digit million euro range.</p>
          <p>Momentum from new businesses in our Financial Services division will also be somewhat weaker, rising <mark type="ph" /> pace (24:35) interest rates and resulting higher funding costs will affect our new business margins. On a whole, we are optimistic but also aware of certain risks and expect volatility to increase. The challenges post by the sizeable national debt of many countries, potentially lower consumer spending from rising taxes and higher inflation could all lead to more volatile developments.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, partly because of the risk, I couldn't &#x2013; I just mentioned, we aim to keep returns within an EBIT margin range of 8% to 10% in the Automotive segment beyond 2011. This is a decisive target for us over the long term. With the current momentum from our operating business, we are preparing our company of the challenges and opportunities of the future.</p>
          <p>For the BMW Group, profitability and growth will continue to go hand in hand as we move forward into the future. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">

          <p>And our first question comes from the line of Jos&#xE9; Asumendi from RBS, over to you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. And a couple of questions please. The first one on the &#x2013; on inventories, I saw &#x2013; we saw quite a lot of sharp increase in inventories in Q1. And I didn't see too much destocking in the second quarter. I'm just wondering, how should we think about destocking in the next two quarters? And also the &#x2013; just, if you could talk about around the production levels in Q3 versus Q2, and how many weeks do you plan to close, on average, your plants in Q3 and how does this compare against Q2? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This question will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, as we announced early in the beginning of the year, with a growing business, we had to grow our inventory levels as well. I mean, we are in a model change, for example, the new 1 Series has to be ramped up as well as our other new models like the X3, so that was planned, and is consequently leading to a higher inventory level.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the year, we think that this will be more or less on the level that we should maintain through the end of the year, with some smaller volatilities <mark type="ph" /> in. (28:11) So that's what I can say about inventory. And now, clearly, because of certain, well, shutdowns in some plants, the production in Quarter 3 will be below Quarter 2 production, so we are talking about 10,000, 20,000 units, something like that, right, in that order of magnitude.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of John Lawson from Citi. Over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Could I ask about net pricing, first of all, please? Because it's been an important part of the margin advance to date, and I just wondered if we now have to assume that this is somehow switched off for the next couple of quarters while you have the product run-out and raw material pressures. So what really are your expectations for balance of the year and 2012 on that?</p>
          <p>And then, if I may ask a bit about this ING Lease, I mean, your captive leasing business is obviously capped by your sales volume and penetrations, but I mean, there's no logical limit to where multi-brand leasing might go. So can you tell us whether you remain interested in expanding this area further? It seem that Alphabet had trundled along at 300,000 vehicles for quite a few years before you suddenly made this big step. And I suppose I'd be right in saying that you'd need some material financial adjustments when you do bring the ING portfolio into BMW. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, John. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first about the net pricing of the improvement in the first half of the year was around 200 basis points. We think that in the second half of the year, this will not be possible though maybe we feel some pressure on this side so that at the end for the whole of 2011 we then maybe talk about an effect of 100 basis points, that's what we see today.</p>
          <p>On the pricing, I mean, that's what we expect with respect to the run-out situation, but again, you never know how this will work out, as we said, it's our planning from today's perspective. And then you asked about what we expect in 2012. I mean, first, there are improvement on this side very clearly because now we are waiting for the new volume products to come, new 1 and new 3 Series and this should support our pricing position around the world. It's more than half of our volume and this something that will clearly have benefit on this side &#x2013; of our business.</p>
          <p>Now, ING &#x2013; and the question of the multi-brand business, in a fleet business, you need to have a multi-brand approach because if you want to service big companies you need costs out of all segments, so clearly this will strengthen our multi-brand approach as well, but the major purpose of this deal was to strengthen our position in the fleet market and to support BMW Group car sales. So that is very clearly &#x2013; it's clearly our strategic view and we think that especially with the development of the electro-mobility business, fleet business will be an issue because you need to have services in place to support the cars in the field and therefore a strong fleet management is necessary. And as the two companies really have a good fit because they really are operating in different countries, I think it was the right thing to do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, it's Michael Tyndall from Barclays. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, mainly around 2012. And at the risk of sounding greedy, I'm just curious to know about the 8% to 10% EBIT target. First question really relates to internal targets and I'm wondering to what degree, given that this is the culmination of a five-year plan, workers are actually incentivized towards the 8% to 10% target. So in essence, if you were to move it, now you would be moving the goal post for workers. And then the second question relates I guess to China. If we think about what you've just done in terms of a 13.9% margin, you've got the new cheaper-to-produce 1 and 3 Series coming next year, it seems, at least to me, that the scope for you to do greater than 8% to 10% is considerable. I'm wondering when you think back to 2007, when you started this strategy, to what degree China was a factor in that and if we I think about China being &#x20AC;1.5 billion, &#x20AC;1.8 billion of EBIT, whether or not that's in fact incremental to what the BMW ONE Strategy has delivered? Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean our answer is pretty clear, it has nothing to do with the internal margin. Our long-term goal that means from 2012 and the following years, it's to achieve an EBIT margin of 8% to 10% in the Automobile segment. As we said and for us it's important we said, we would like to be a company that is able to achieve on a long term view 8% to 10%. And I mean to achieve it, 2012, 2013, 2014, it is quite an ambitious target and it has nothing to do, as I said, with an internal margin. So to achieve it in one year, let me say, 12%, 13%,14%, that is one thing. But to be able to achieve it more than one year long term that is a different bargain, in my opinion, and I think that is quite an achievement.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Thank you very much. Mr. Eichiner?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly there are some positives you refer to like the China business is positive, and our pricing and the new models are positive. So if you would take only the positive side of those developments. I think then clearly, you could calculate higher margins. But I think that's not what we should do. I mean what we see there are also challenges outside when I look at raw material price development, when I look at the exchange rate development, when I look at the unstable situation in some markets, the debt situation around the world, and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>So I think it's wise to not just calculate any guidance on the positive effects only. We have to see that there are risks out there. And that is the reason why we think &#x2013; if we tell you that we are of the belief that we will be sustainably in a position to hold an 8% to 10% margin range over time. And then that's a great guidance I would say. Of course, everything comes on the positive side will be better, and everything comes on the negative side maybe, it's a bit worse. So that's how we look at it. And that is something what we bring forward to 2012 as well.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Two quick questions on the 3 Series changeover please, and then just a question on the recent U.S. announcement on fuel economy standards. Just on the 3 Series changeover, could you give us just a little bit more detail on how the production changeover works? I think there's four plants in Germany that build 3 and 1 Series platform. Could you just give us a feel for whether this is a sort of rolling changeover or all of the plants are going to be below normal utilization at the end of the year? And when everything's back to normal and everything's back to full potential?</p>
          <p>And then the second part of that question. I remember, I think back in 2002 or 2003, when we had the run-out of a model, I think it was the old E39 5 Series. So there was actually a profit uplift because for some accounting reason actually, the vehicle was very profitable in its last year. Is that something you recall and is that something that's longer relevant to BMW accounting, or rather some accounting benefits for a car in its last year? And just the last question, on the fuel economy regs, wondering if you could just give us your latest thoughts on what the 2025 targets mean to BMW, and why you're so positive versus your German peers? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you very much. Max, for your question, I think we start with Mr. Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, if I see it from our point of view, Max, from the BMW point of view, then my answer will be the recently announced targets are, of course, extremely challenging for us as for other manufacturers, of course. But in my opinion, we are in a very good position overall with our efficient dynamic strategy. That means it will pay off. We believe we are well-equipped to meet the challenge with our attractive product improvement in conventional drive trains, Max, as well in conventional drive trains, and of course with hybridization and electrification strategy. If you see our i3 coming in 2013 and our i8 coming in 2013, '14, so and if you'll see, for example, our i3, it will be a zero emission vehicle, that means zero CO2 per mile or per kilometer, whatever you would like to use. So that means from a fleet point of view, the i3 will be a real advantage for the BMW Group. But as I said, we are of course as well &#x2013; well-equipped if it comes to conventional drive trains because recent efficient dynamics is only then an advantage for the BMW Group if we roll it out.</p>
          <p>And one additional point, it is important for us as an innovation-driven company that the authorities have accommodated us on flexible solutions. What does it mean? We can only meet certain parts of our reduction obligations through so-called off-cycle technologies. That is important for us and I have to say the negotiations with the authorities have been &#x2013; and that I would like to highlight, have been highly constructive, that's from my point of view, Max.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Reithofer. And now 3 Series changeover, Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Now, clearly, it's right. We have to manage to change over in those plans in parallel and normally in a run-out phase you have to consider a certain &#x2013; a brush on pricing, your special packages in order to support the run-out. This is quite normal in our business. Overall, we calculated some headwind of around &#x20AC;500 million for the second half of this year. That's our actual calculation. Now, the phase out is running as planned. So we are not planning extra volumes or things like that. But we see quite a stable demand for the 3 Series at that point in the year. So we are not expecting some extra effect of a huge extra volumes because of the plants have to prepare for the &#x2013; very quickly for the new models, and as you know, we are expecting some benefits coming from the new models so that's why we are pushing that forward. So I don't think that on the accounting side, that we have to calculate now extra effect, that's at least not what we see today.</p>

          <p>Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Fraser Hill from Bank of America. Over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions on the balance sheet. I think you were quoted earlier today as saying that you saw the liquidity position at &#x20AC;12.6 billion of net cash as a necessary buffer in volatile financial markets. Can you just explain that statement and detail why you do feel you need so much headroom. I guess where I'm going with this is why should we not expect some of that liquidity to be returned to shareholders at some point.</p>
          <p>The second question on the balance sheet was about your dividends as well. I mean you've talked about moving to a <mark type="ph" /> tax (41:55) level over time. I think today you were talking about a 30% to 40% range. Can you give us a bit more thinking about what's really going to determine your ultimate decision between that range which is very broad. Between the lower and the upper end, what sort of metrics and performance you'll be looking for to determine where you come out there.</p>
          <p>And just a third question if I could, on MINI, very strong growth for MINI. Can you help us think about the margin contribution from that product &#x2013; that family of products and especially the Countryman perhaps relative to the overall Auto margin. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. The &#x2013; I think all parts will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean we have a concept for our liquidity position in the company because this is relevant for our rating as well. There is a measured key performance indicator, liquidity at risk indicator, that we have to fulfill so that the company is capable to run the business in a situation where liquidity from capital market is not available for at least one year. So that is driving our liquidity position, and we have to have a strong position in order to support our rating as well. And that has worked out; you can see that because Moody's upgraded us. So that is &#x2013; there's a lot of planning behind that so we know what exactly what we are doing, what we need. Actually, it's in a range of &#x20AC;8 to &#x20AC;9 billion that we need in order to support our business going forward and to support our rating at the same point in time.</p>
          <p>Now, how would we like to let the shareholders participate? Clearly, our view is &#x2013; would be the more successful the company is, the more we would like to let shareholders participate. I think you know what we did for 2010, and we already gave you the guidance that we would like to come up with dividend payments in a range of 30% to 40%. Now we've been below 30% for 2010 and you &#x2013; as it &#x2013; moving forward and if everything goes as we've planned it now, I think you could expect more for the year 2011. Now we are only at the half of the year, so let's wait &#x2013; how it really works out, and then our promise is to step in &#x2013; up into this range.</p>
          <p>How quickly we could do that? Well, that's a question of the economic environment. Is it positive, it will be fast. If it's negative, maybe it's a bit slower, but we definitely will go this route. So that's the second question, and the other one was MINI &#x2013; clearly we're not disclosing the MINI business case on margin. But, of course, the Countryman is positive for the MINI profitability because we get a higher margin on the Countryman. It's really successful. Pricing is not under pressure because car is on high demand so the Countryman really supports our MINI performance.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Three quick questions, if I may. First of all, just on your cost structure in the first half of this year. Mr. Eichiner, obviously, this year, you've still come in very low on the CapEx side. Could you just give us a feel for how long BMW is in the position to keep spending that low? Is this the function of that in the past, you possibly spent too much and you're now riding that effect for an extended period of time, or will it be the usual second half step-up in capital spending, and you're still on track to hit your full-year target number?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, the same level of SG&amp;A, obviously, BMW has come to a percentage of sales that we haven't seen. I wonder whether you could just give us a hint of how sustainable you think that is? Is this a pure function of product cycle and how much lower you think you could settle on a sustainable basis?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you stated today that you're very close to making a decision on the CKD facility in Brazil. Could you give us more feel for what that will be in terms of capacity as well as which models you're actually thinking about bringing to that market?</p>
          <p>And then finally, with your statement of 8% to 10%, and over- and underachieving, depending on the economic cycle, now I know this is a very broad topic, but when I look at BMW over the last three years, the volatility has been higher by a mile than when compared to the six years or decade before. Is that your general feeling about the business when you look into markets and uncertainties today, that the next three years will again prove to be far higher from a volatility standpoint, and if not, why would that be? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good, we understand. And I think we start with our possible CKD production in Brazil with Mr. Reithofer and then Mr. Eichiner. Mr. Reithofer, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Mr. Gehrke, as you know, our guiding principle has always been that production should follow the market. And for that reason, we need to observe the so called <mark type="ph" /> BRIKT (47:33) countries. As you know, we mean, Brazil, Russia, India, South Korea, and Turkey. In Russia, we have already a CKD facility; in India, we have a CKD facility. If we look into the future, of course, at the moment we have in our minds to expand our facility in Russia, to expand our facility in India accordingly to market growth, and of course coming to Brazil. Brazil is increasingly becoming an important automobile market for the BMW Group.</p>
          <p>As said that our growth rate in the first half of 2011 was very good in Brazil, and we think it will be increasingly important for the BMW Group, as I said. And we will make a decision over the course of the year 2011 whether to build a CKD production facility there or not. But I think it is a very good idea to have a CKD facility in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now a question about the cost structure. Clearly I think here we see the improvement of our Strategy Number ONE. We worked hard on the profitability side in the cost structure and some indicators you see in our reports. So for example, cost for administration are flat, I mean the head count is still flat so we, as you know, reduced heavily and we are carefully increasing. So, overall, the fixed cost should be increased under proportional in comparison to the contribution. So, that is our target and so far this works out quite well.</p>
          <p>Now looking at CapEx, we have a seasonal low now. And, of course, with the higher revenue, then the relative number is even lower. We expect more CapEx in the second half of the year. At the end of the day, it will be at a level of 2010, roughly around 5%. So we'll not be achieving the 7% this year, but we know that we have to, on our way forward, we are preparing investments into new technology. You know that it's lightweight, that it's electrification, there's more to come. And so I'm quite confident that our guidance of a bit less than 7% is the right one going forward.</p>
          <p>And your third point was about the volatility in the margin, 8% to 10%. I think we should not compare the situation before 2007 to the situation we are in today because the company is now clearly in better shape. We did a lot of restructuring, and this will make us more robust for volatility. But there is, of course, a lot of volatility outside &#x2013; out there. I mean, we discussed many possible scenarios already. The company is very well-prepared, I would say, and that makes us believe that the range of 8% to 10% should be achieved even if there is some pressure out there.</p>
          <p>But if everything comes, of course, on a negative side, if you look back to the finance crisis, for example, then this is something where 8% to 10% clearly would not be possible to be achieved. If the positive effects on the other side would hold on, you could maybe do some more. That's how we look at it, and I think it's too early to give a more precise guidance for 2012 any volatility we are in.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. First question is in the &#x2013; regarding hedging. In the Q1 conference call, you indicated that some 70% of your dollar-renminbi exposure is hedged for 2012 at a rate rather close to $1.30. Has it changed in the last three months? And second question is again on the Motorcycle burden for the second half. Firstly, the &#x20AC;500 million burden on the P&amp;L <mark type="ph" /> &#x2013; we see the (52:02) cash burn, is it close to that or should that be higher? And the next question is regarding your statement on more negative pricing into second half, I assume that's only reflection of the Motorcycle, not reflection of worsening markets. Is that a right assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the hedging, I think that your number is still valid. I think the 70% are quite on the point, and as you know, we are not disclosing the rate. So talking about the &#x20AC;500 million, that has to do with marketing expenses and with costs in the plants, launch costs in the plants, and it's clearly cash relevant. And the pricing, while we don't see now that the trend in the pricing is in any way reversed, so pricing is still stable and I think we could even improve it over time, especially in 2012. So this really has to do with the model change and those are our volume models, so this is an effect that is significant. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, I just had two areas of questions. Firstly, just on capacity, it looks like you're on track I guess to build close to the capacity you've talked about for this year, around 1.7 million units, if I remember correctly. Could you just maybe summarize the areas of expansion going into next year, and what you think you could build as a maximum in 2012? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second area is on the Financial Services business, I wonder if you could -just confirm if you're now happy with the equity ratio in Financial Services following the equity injection there during the quarter? Also, whether if you could just detail the Q2 credit loss. I know you did it for the first half &#x2013; whether you could give us the number for the second quarter will be very useful.</p>
          <p>And then just finally on residual values, obviously, you felt comfortable enough to release some risk provisions there or reduce the provisioning for credit losses and residual values, but if I look at in the UK at least, there are some signs of weakening on luxury residual values at least for the market, if not necessarily for BMW. So I just wonder if you can just reassure us on how conservative you're being on residual values, presumably after the experience of '08, the residual values on the books were a long way below the market value right now?</p>

          <p>Our current plant utilization is more than 102% to give you a rough figure compared, for example, with 86% in 2009. That means at the moment we have full capacity utilization. So, where do we see room for expansion of our production facilities? Let me start in the United States of America. Our new assembly hall for the BMW X3 included, it gives us a capacity of 240,000 units. We will be able, with additional measures, to move it up already in 2011 to roughly 270,000 units, and we made a decision to invest in certain areas to reduce bottlenecks, and then it will give us room up to 300,000 units. So that is the step in the United States of America. And then in Germany, at the moment we are looking into our German plants, where do we see bottlenecks, and we will invest money, as I said, as well to reduce the bottlenecks in our German plants.</p>
          <p>And then let me move to China. In China, as you know, we have at the moment one plant in Dadong; production capacity of roughly 100,000 units. We are in the build-up phase for the second plant in Tiexi, and of course that will at least double our production capacity in China. That means if you add together reduction of bottlenecks in Germany, reduction of bottlenecks in the United States, second plant in China, that will give us at least an additional production capacity up to 150,000 units.</p>

          <p>Your first point of the equity within financial services, well, our strategy is to build up a European bank, a strong European bank with a good asset base, and the next step is to integrate our leading portfolio, term leasing portfolio, into this bank, and then we have to fulfill the regulatory requirements on the equity side and that is the reason why we injected equity. So there's nothing to do with an increased risk profile or something like that. It's just because of regulatory requirements within the EU Bank.</p>
          <p>Your second point about the credit loss ratio, I mean it's actually at 0.43%. We are not calculating Q2 isolated so that is a number we are actually disclosing. Now, your question about the residual values, I think we are &#x2013; in comparison to the situation may be before 2007, we are very cautious with the residual value setting. So that means in the contract, the residual values are much lower as we have been setting them before the prior financial crisis, and of course, we are still cautious when it comes down to our reserves. So that means that we are not expecting, in the near future, that we would have to accrue provision on this side again, after we released provisions now, because we're still on a conservative side.</p>
