          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Paolo's conference call. The CEO, Mr. Corrado Passera report on Paolo's 2008 Half Yearly Results. In the presentation, we will be following session for analysts only.</p>
          <p>Now, I hand over to Mr. Corrado. Please.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and good morning to some of you. Thank you for joining us today. A few words before we go through the pages of the presentation. I'm very satisfied with the performance of our Group in the first half of 2008. These first six months of the year have been marked outside by a number of difficulties on the market and in a number of countries, by declining economic confidence.</p>
          <p>On the other side we believe that we have delivered in four key areas and the main ones are our operating performance, both in terms of revenues and cost control. We have reconfirmed the strength of our balance sheet. You will see that the ratio between net doubtful loans and loans keeps remaining very low, below 1%. At the same time the liquidity position is strong; it's even stronger than last time we presented our figures at the end of March.</p>
          <p>Another reason why I'm very satisfied with what we have done is the speed of the integration. We wanted to anticipate the complete integration of our IT system and we have done it by July; that's very important because the integration, the availability of the same IT system throughout the Group makes possible a number of activities. And this integration of the IT system is one of the engines of growth that we are in the process of creating and that will deliver growth in the future.</p>
          <p>A last point before we go through the presentation, the importance of capital and equity. You will see that we remain committed, both to our 6% target for quarter one and to the dividend payout we had announced in our business plan for 2007, 2008, and 2009. Our confidence comes from the fact that the operating performance is going reasonably in the direction we wanted. At the same time, as we announced on a number of occasions, we have identified more than &#x20AC;8 billion worth of non-core assets, the sale of which will have a very substantial effect on our ratios.</p>
          <p>Let's now go through the presentation. In the first pages you'll find all the notes that are needed to understand the way we consolidate and the way we compare figures quarter-after-quarter. The first real page is page number two, and here we have the main, the summary of the main achievements. We talk about adjusted figures because in both the first semester of this year and the first semester last year, we enjoyed a number of non-ordinary items; so a number of extraordinary results that, in our opinion, should be kept aside in order to understand, evaluate the operating performance of our company.</p>
          <p>At the same time, trading profits have been so different in the first six months of last year and this year that we intend to extract them and keep them aside too, in order to understand that the real underlying performance of our bank.</p>
          <p>Bottom line of the period was 3.1 billion, adjusted in the way I said before, that is, excluding profits on trading and the main non-recurrent items, is up 22%. In the comparison, you see that operating revenues are up 2% and operating margin up 8%. Cost control is very strict, and the decline by almost 3% is an achievement, much stronger than what we provided for in the business plan. Asset quality is confirmed, with cost of credit in line with our business plan target and, as I said before, the net doubtful loans ratio is stable at 0.9%.</p>
          <p>Liquidity profile, very strong; customer deposits keep exceeding loans to customers, and at the end of June we had even a positive net inter-bank position. We believe that liquidity will remain a very important issue, and might even become a more important issue between the end of this year and the beginning of next year, because of the number of bond issues on the market that will expire during those periods. Last point is the point I mentioned before about our integration process; that is certainly running ahead of schedule, and the completion of the IT system, six months in advance is a good evidence of it. 100,000 new customers, goes with the first items I mentioned before, and that is one of the reasons why our revenues keep growing.</p>
          <p>Page number three and page number four are pages that you can use to understand which items we extracted, both non-recurring items and the profits on trading; and you can reconcile the figures I mentioned before with the figures of our P&amp;L. Page number three is for the whole semester while page number two &#x2013; sorry, page number four is the comparison between the second quarter 2008 and the second quarter 2007.</p>
          <p>Page number five is again the liquidity position; loans to customers less than the customer deposits and, the inter-bank position at 8 billion positive. Page number six, P&amp;L of the whole group at the end of June. The black figures are the accounting ones, while in the yellow clouds you find the adjusted figures.</p>
          <p>We will go through all these lines in the following pages, but let me just focus your attention on the first line of the P&amp;L. We keep enjoying a growth in net interest income that is very sound, is certainly higher than what we forecasted in our business plan, and since interest income counts for more than 50% of our total revenues, that's an important &#x2013; that has an important effect.</p>
          <p>Operating costs look growing but, as I mentioned before, the real performance is close to 3% less than last year, and that's because, last year, we had a special effect &#x2013; a special fiscal effect because of a change in the provisions. So the real figure is -2.8. What else? No &#x2013; let's go to page number seven. Page number seven is the P&amp;L of the second quarter this year, versus the same period last year. You see that interest rates &#x2013; interest income keeps growing, more or less at the same speed. And we will now analyze the interest income.</p>
          <p>And page number eight, we have only the breakdown of our revenues. In order to make clear that more than 80% of our revenues come from retail activities, mainly in our Italian &#x2013; from our Italian network but to a growing extent, also through our International Subsidiary Banks Division.</p>
          <p>Page number nine is what I was mentioning before, net interest income. That accounts for almost 60% &#x2013; I said, more than 50% but, actually, it's 60% of our operating income. The main drivers of the 11% increase, on a year on year basis, were the 9% increase in average customer loans; so, volumes and, improvement in mark-down.</p>
          <p>Contribution to the growth comes from practically all business units, retail loans up 5.9%. SMEs, where we tend to be a little more prudent, is 5.2%. Corporate has increased its' volume at two-digit speed, 17.5% but they keep a very selective approach in order to keep the quality of our credit loans. 7.7% is the growth of public finance while the International Subsidiary Banks division has grown by almost 27%.</p>
          <p>If we look at the right-hand side of the page we see the positive trend in the quarterly figures and this quarter, like last quarter, was the best quarter ever. On a quarterly basis we have grown 2.8% from -between the first and the second quarter of this year. As I will say also afterwards, we have been very good at keeping a very selective lending policy and we have been good at withstanding the mark-down figures. I must tell you and my colleagues know that very well; we all agree that we can do better on the mark-up part of this trend. And, we have identified a significant portion of our customers that will be entertained in some discussions because there is room for re-pricing.</p>
          <p>Page number 10, with the analysis of the net interest income; most of it, 74% is related to the growth in customer volumes and 26% of the increase was due to improvements in operating spread &#x2013; no, sorry, yes, yes, yes, yes. So almost all of it comes from operation and a good part of that comes from volumes; but as you see, spreads are also contributing to the result.</p>
          <p>Page number 11, net fee and commission income; obviously we are not happy about the results. We have to look at the different elements more in depth because if we look at commercial banking activities, commissions are more or less stable and this stability is a good &#x2013; means a good performance, given the kind of effect that the merger created in terms of alignment to the lowest price products.</p>
          <p>While the rest, the commissions from management dealing in consultancy services; that means portfolio management, insurance products and placement of securities. That is the part of the commission portfolio that is going down, almost 10%. There is certainly a market reason and there is certainly a growing risk aversion by practically all segments of the customer base.</p>
          <p>People tend to keep their money in more &#x2013; in less risky kind of investment and, in fact, when we will look at the development of the total financial assets of our customers, we will see that the total amounts, the total volumes that they keep with us is even growing. But they are shifting their investment from assets under management to assets under administration. We are working on it. We are preparing a number of actions to balance this trend.</p>
          <p>We are investing a lot of money in training a number of people; so, a very large number of people that will be more capable to entertain our customers on these kinds of products and services. But I don't expect a real change in these trends until something happens on the market. And people keep very uncertain about financial markets.</p>
          <p>The day markets change or the day the confidence in the market changes, the amount of growth, the change in speed that we might then enjoy can be very significant because, as you might remember, we are talking about almost one trillion of financial assets of people, of customers, we deal with.</p>
          <p>At page number 12 you have the figures that prove the point I made before. If you look on the left-hand side you'll see that assets under management decreased by more than &#x20AC;14 billion. At the same time the amount of assets under administration grew by more than 13 billion.</p>
          <p>Customer deposits grew in a very significant way and the total effect of these three trends makes the total of the financial assets we manage, in a way or another, for our customers grew by almost &#x20AC;3 billion. On the right-hand side, you have the trend in new customer numbers that in the first quarter of 2008 grew by almost or around 100,000 new customers.</p>
          <p>Profit on trading, profit on trading we are going exactly the way we wanted to; given the market conditions we have been able &#x2013; despite the market conditions, we have been able to deliver a solid contribution to our overall revenues. You see &#x2013; you remember that in the last quarter of last year we had, for the first and only time, a negative figure.</p>
          <p>We committed to get back to a positive figure in first quarter 2008 and that was done. And, in the second quarter 2008, we are getting back to a reasonable figure. Let's not forget that last year we decided to squeeze the financial activities held for trading and the reduction was a massive one, almost &#x20AC;30 billion.</p>
          <p>At page 14, if we look at the breakdown of the trading profits you know that we subdivide them in four different components. The customer activities, you know that quarter after quarter these figures are getting back to a sound level.</p>
          <p>Capital markets and financial assets for sale; this line is very dependent on specific deals we make with the assets managed by our merchant banking division. But you know that we are more or less in &#x2013; on the right track.</p>
          <p>Proprietary trading and treasury, that's where we reduced the amount of assets held by the group; we had one quarter with a negative figure but I don't expect it to happen any more. And, we are back to a reasonable figure.</p>
          <p>The structured credit products; it's a portfolio managed separately and that's where we had, at the end of last year, an almost &#x20AC;400 million worth of devaluations. The kind of effect we are suffering from, the trends on the market is reducing quarter after quarter and we are more or less in the ground we expected.</p>
          <p>Structured credit products, you will find in the presentation all the details, all the components of each single kind of credit products we hold in the group. And those will be in the annexes of the presentation. We just added two pages in the main presentation to remind that 100% of our structured credit product is in the investment grade levels, most of it super senior and AAA; almost 75% of the structured credit products are in vintages 2005 or earlier than that. And, only 9% of the whole portfolio comes from US residential facilities.</p>
          <p>Page 16, the figure, the figure we have in US subprime, the same way we had in the previous quarter, the position is negative, 14 million negative; that means that our short positions are higher than our long positions, 47 and 33 respectively.</p>
          <p>Page 17, page 17 confirms, let me use the word, excellent cost control; at the same time we keep investing for growth and we have not reduced any development -- any investment or cost for developing the group. Adjusted operating costs are down, almost 3% year on year, and the cost income ratio is in the round of 50%.</p>
          <p>Adjusted personnel expenses decreased by 3.7%, actually, this was more than that because we are growing our costs in a number of countries outside of Italy. So in Italy we are doing even better than the 3.7%. The other administrative expenses are flat and the adjustments are in the round of minus 7.5%. Overall the operating costs in Italy have decreased 4.4%, while the operating cost in the international subsidiary banks division was up 12%, as provided in our budget. That's more or less it. I will go more in depth if any question will arise.</p>
          <p>Page number 18 compares the reduction in costs we are enjoying in this first part of the business plan, period, and the target we had in the business plan. You might remember that the business plan target was minus 0.4 and we always, both in 2007 and in the first part of 2008, exceeded this level. We had to anyhow because revenues are lower than what we expected but this means that our capability, the capability and the will of the Group to react to adverse market conditions on revenues with further actions on cost.</p>
          <p>These figures do not include any, yet, the further reduction of 2,500 people by 2009 that we have agreed upon with the trade unions. And, that will also lead to the hiring of some 100 new people but the further reduction we have already agreed with the trade unions is not yet embedded in any of our figures.</p>
          <p>Overall, cost -- overall operating cost synergies, the three years add -- page number 19, add clear targets to be achieved. We are on track because the cumulative synergies we have realized so far are in the round of 550 million, the rest that is still to be done in 2008 will be done; and then, we have a big step upward in 2009. That will be mostly connected with IT costs.</p>
          <p>Page number 20, provision for risk and charges; lower than last year, as planned. Net adjustment to loans reflect the high quality of our loan portfolio; that means 712 million and that implies an annual cost of credit in line with the business plan target.</p>
          <p>Page 21, we confirm, as I was saying before, the asset quality, that the asset quality is in line with our estimates and with our targets and with the European best practice. Because, if we look at the net doubtful loans and the other categories, net substandards and net due in June 2008. We see that the net doubtful loans on net loans is stable at 0.9%. Doubtful loans are -- have a coverage of 71% and on top of that, the group has accumulated a &#x20AC;2.4 billion of generic reserves on older performing loans.</p>
          <p>The flow -- yeah, that's an important point. The flow of new non-performing loans in Italy is stable, is more or less the same amount we had in the first quarter -- in the first half of 2007, and is concentrated in the Banca dei Territori Division, the retail private and SMEs division of the group. And it's a more or less equally distributed among the different customer segments. The increase in past due that here is the only component of non-performing loans, we will have to understand better; it's concentrated in the leasing and industrial credit sector, but they are certainly under control.</p>
          <p>Capital ratios, some comments are needed here. Core Tier 1 at 5.7%, Tier 1 at 6.6%, total capital ratio's 9.5%, total risk weighted asset in the round of 390 million -- billion, sorry. Basel 2 standard, we are applying Basel 2 standardized; if we apply Basel 2 foundation the increase might be in the round of 30, 40 basis points and, if we get to Basel 2 IRB that would mean probably 30 or 40 more basis points.</p>
          <p>We have included in the calculation of the ratios the dividends we expected and we expect to distribute on 2008 results in the spring of 2009. That means that we have already included dividends in the round of 1.800 -- &#x20AC;1.8 billion. In the figures we have not yet included, because they happened after the end of the semester, the disposal of Carifano that will have the six basis points. We are now close to closing a deal to sell our real estate company, the company we wanted to list it, and that would bring other several basis points.</p>
          <p>But, as I said before, in the pipeline we have a number of disposals of non-core assets. The total amount we announced in the previous conference meetings was in the round of 8 billion, and I confirm it, but are 8 billion with a very strong component of Core Tier 1 in the round of &#x20AC;4 billion.</p>
          <p>What I can tell you, as a summary on this page, is that we are committed to keep the 6% Core Tier 1. It's a policy we announced a number of months ago. We have decreased -- we have reduced, and at the end eliminated, the excess capital we had in the Group, as announced when we presented the business plan, but the 6% Core Tier 1 is confirmed. But also the dividends we had planned for the 2008 and 2009 years are confirmed.</p>
          <p>Let's go to page number 23, it's the breakdown of the Group results for the different divisions, very rapidly through each of them.</p>
          <p>Page 24 is the Banca dei Territori. Again, in the yellow clouds you have the real comparable figures between first semester last year and first semester this year; 2% growth in revenues, minus 2% in terms of cost, and overall result growing 10 point -- almost 11%. These are good figures because you have to remember that in this first part of 2008, we have gone through the hardest part of the integration process on the IT side. And, at the same time, we have not yet realized what we had planned for the year 2008. That was to increase significantly the number of people on the front part of the branches.</p>
          <p>So some of the engines that are due to be realized in this division have not yet been realized, and they will be realized in the next few months. At the same time, for sure, the impact of the IT integration has had some cost in terms of results.</p>
          <p>Page number 25 is only to remember the achievement in terms of IT integration. Six months in advance versus the plan, the merger plan.</p>
          <p>Page 26, Eurizon Capital, for sure, this company is suffering from the crisis of the asset management products on the market. At the same time, this company has been able to react in an effective way in terms of cost. So if we see some decrease in terms of revenue, we also see a very significant effort in terms of cost reduction. So, at the end, we have an effect, but we are talking about a bit less than -- a bit more than 10 million in terms of bottom line.</p>
          <p>Page 27, Corporate and Investment Banking, very strong performance if we keep for a moment aside the prop trading component of the Corporate and Investment Banking division. They have been charged with the management of our prop trading portfolio. But if we look at the real figure of their industrial operations, you see revenue growing by almost 9%, operating margin growing by almost 20%, and income before tax, that is the bottom line of the division, growing more than 30%.</p>
          <p>If we look at the following page, page 28, we see the different components of the Corporate and Investment Banking division revenues -- results. And you see that all the department of the division are growing and providing stronger results to the division. Corporate relations means large and mid-corporate customers, financial institutions, international network is self-explanatory.</p>
          <p>Capital market remain a low figure, but growing and at the level we want to have it. Investment banking is more or less in line with last year. That was a good year for investment banking. Merchant banking is very much dependent on when you make one deal, and so the volatility of the quarterly results of this department is obvious.</p>
          <p>Then, if you put together all these figures and you exclude for a second the proprietary trading, you have a growth of almost 9%. That is in excess of what their budget target provided for. Prop trading is down, but very difficult to avoid it.</p>
          <p>29, page 29, Public Finance, in line with the target, and growing in a very difficult but very important segment of the market.</p>
          <p>Page number 30, International Subsidiary Banks, growing steadily, steadily without forcing too much growth and without taking risk we are not available to take. Having said that, operating income, if we exclude the trading profit, is almost 20% up, operating margin, almost 30% up, and bottom line, 36% up. Cost to income in the round of 45%, that is perfectly in line with the target.</p>
          <p>Banca Fideuram is suffering like all its competitors from the trends in the market we mentioned before. People are -- have become and keep remaining very risk averse, and the different mix in asset under management and asset under administration has reduced a little bit their revenues, 5%. This company too is reacting reasonably well in terms of cost control. And despite they are a bit lower than what the budget provided, we expect that they could recover in the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>Conclusion, in our opinion, the overall picture of our Group is, I would say, solid performance despite the difficult economic environment. We believe we have taken all the necessary actions to ensure the risk and the liquidity profiles we want to keep. We have increased our attention on cost control, and in that area we're certainly running ahead of our business plan target. The capital adequacy position remains, in our opinion, very secure and the capital management options I mentioned before will strengthen the figures in the next month.</p>
          <p>What can I say about the rest of the year? The outlook remains challenging but we are very confident that we can ride out of the economic problems and difficulties. And that's why we have confirmed our dividend policy, and that's why we are accelerating in the drive in the construction of the drivers of growth that the business plan provided for, and that have to be ready by the end of this month to be at full speed next year.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the question and answers part of the conference call.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. First question comes from Mr. Marcello Zanardo from KBW. Mr. Zanardo, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, Mr. Passera. It's Marcello Zanardo from Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. And good numbers, so well done, congratulations. The first question is on capital. I just would like to have an idea, you mentioned you have 8 billion of potential asset for sale with a significant 4 billion. These things will be in ongoing negotiations, obviously, but just to have your feeling, how easy are you finding to deal with counterparties in a struggling market? I mean, is there a lot of interest for this kind of assets?</p>
          <p>The price is always &#x2013; is clearly getting more difficult to get, but just to have a feeling of the assets you have at the disposal, what you are finding. Obviously, I don't expect you to go into details, but just to give some more flavor on this.</p>
          <p>And the second question's on asset quality. Your Group is the merger of what Sanpaolo used to be, a very good bank with a solid credit risk, and if I remember correctly, the former Intesa sold more than 10 billion non-performing loans, a few years ago; you deleveraged the bank.</p>
          <p>And it's also good to see that you have 2.5 billion of reserves on performing loans, so that's a good cushion. But also, if I look at the figures which you showed before, with the net non-performing loans annualizing, so June to December times two, because I don't have the June and June numbers, up 13% and the net watch list up 20%.</p>
          <p>So given what I said, and given the solidity of your Group, can you give here a bit more flavor on what you think provisions are going to be, loan provisions are going to be in 2008, and most importantly in 2009? Because, like you said before, lower costs are compensating for lower revenues, especially on the fee income. We might see perhaps a bit higher provision, considering that the environment has changed. So that will be very useful if you could add something here.</p>
          <p>And the third and final question is on M&amp;A. You pointed out at the beginning of the call that liquidity will become very important. I think so. I agree. So I would like to know if, given the commitment of your dividend per shares and your Core Tier 1 target, is correct to assume that any potential deal which will come after potentially appealing conditions, i.e., price and governance, is in this market an add-on deal, i.e., a fairly small deal, or if something fairly big could become, and I have in mind something abroad. Maybe later on you would be ready to take that opportunity, maybe sacrifice the dividend commitment because you are saying, this is such a good opportunity that it is good for the strategic group in the near future to take it, and perhaps sacrifice dividend and capital for a short period of time, or you would stick to your guidance and say I'm not going to do this, but I'm ready to do any add-on deal which is complementary? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First question is about capital management actions; in other words, sale or participation of our shareholdings we have in the Group. Your question is how easy is today negotiating disposal of assets. It's a good question, and it's very different in the different segments. There are assets that today are certainly not accepted by the markets, or even by investors, and that's why we have, for example, postponed the listing of Fideuram.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we have a unique assets that might be very important for industrial investors. And for that kind of assets, the crisis around is really not very significant, and the interest they are showing in the discussion we are having is very high. So today, you have to be wise enough not to push the sale of assets that the market do not &#x2013; is not eager to buy, and concentrate your efforts on those unique situations that, despite the market, remain very interesting for industrial more than financial investors.</p>
          <p>On asset quality, we really don't see any reason for changing the guidance we gave for 2008, that is 40 basis points or something in the round of 40 basis points. We will have to see, during the remaining part of the year, how the market, if the market changes, what the addition of the net doubtful loans to the portfolio of non-performing loans in the first semester of the year is very much in line with what we had last year. So it's not in evidence for changing our forecast, at least for the time being.</p>
          <p>M&amp;A. I tend to agree with what you said, in the sense that we consider the 6% Core Tier 1 floor level as a constraint and we don't want to lose in any occasion and for no reason. The kind of disposal we might enjoy in the next, let's say, 12 months might be the way to finance a small, very focused acquisitions. But let me tell you that today we don't have anything on the table, and I don't expect anything for a number of months.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry about that. I was saying, the first question is on repricing activity. You tell us &#x2013; you told us that is still ongoing, so I was wondering if you could, please, add some more color on spreads, to what kind of trend do you expect in the near future, in terms of mark-up and markdown, respectively?</p>
          <p>Second question is on your book composition; if you could please give us the percentage of SMEs that is in your loan book? And the third question is the detail, if it's possible to have it, the exposure toward Mr. Zoleski. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The repricing strategy. It's an ongoing effort, I agree with you. We have provided our divisions, departments, branches, and account managers with figures and reports that enable them to identify those customers that have share of wallet opportunities, but especially EVA positive or negative, and a number of other elements for deciding. We already see that the effect of the provision of these reports in a number of commercial areas of the Group, and we are strongly encouraging both the Corporate Division and the Banca dei Territori division to extend their use of those reports to the overall portfolio. It's mainly on &#x2013; the real areas for improvement is in the area of mark-ups, because markdowns are being managed very, very, very effectively.</p>
          <p>For sure, what is happening is that the real cost of fund that has changed rapidly and suddenly in the last month is not yet moved to the customer in the proper way. So it will certainly engage our account management people for the next six to 12 months, and it will be a never-ending exercise. In terms of the weight of SMEs on our total loan portfolio, they represent 11% of the overall portfolio of the Group. And as far as Zoleski's is concerned, it's a customer, it's &#x2013; we don't provide figures for any of our customers.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. My first question is on commission income. Mr. Passera, you clearly said that you are not happy with the performance on this area. I was wondering if, within the tactical and strategical options which you're considering or still considering, an external solution, as it was for GAM a few months ago?</p>
          <p>Second, on costs, with 550 million of synergies achieved in the first half, my question is if you're expecting synergies to be higher than planned this year, so above the 730 millions planned, with an improvement in end timing. And on capital, if you can please give us the Core Tier ratio under Basel I to have a comparison with the previous quarters. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, commission, I mentioned some tactical and commercial initiatives we are taking, and we will certainly devote a lot of attention to the improvement of the performance of the factories, but very much also to the performance of the sales network. Because these are products that are becoming more and more difficult, even if they are simple investment funds, so the kind of efforts and the kind of focalization you have to assure on a part of the sales network is crucial in increasing and improving the results of this activity.</p>
          <p>As far as strategic options, we have already abandoned the idea of purchasing, of buying other asset management companies. We have not &#x2013; we cannot exclude, as of today, the combination of with other players in this area. Nothing on the table that theoretically speaking, that might be a way to improve the performance of the whole company or part of our company. We exclude the selling of this activity.</p>
          <p>So the only strategic external options we consider is in the area of combining some or all our activities with other players, but, again, nothing on the table. Cost synergies will be higher than the business plan provide for, both at the end of this year, and at the end of next year. Under Basel I, the core tier 1 would be more or less the same. You can make an estimate in round of 10 basis points less than what we have according to Basel II standardized.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Mr. Passera. You mentioned in your introduction 8.3 billion net positive interbank position. If I am not wrong, this is the first quarter where I can see such a positive position. Can you elaborate a bit more, and can we expect this to remain in place in the coming quarter?</p>
          <p>Secondly, 35% quarterly growth in bancassurance, although from an admittedly low level in Q1, is still quite remarkable. Again, if you can add a few words on this? 8 billion capital management action; any chance you can give us an idea of the earnings impact of this? Four, restructuring charges, is it over, or there is something left, especially on the Diferensa side? And finally, if possible, a guidance on the tax rate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I got all your questions, but we will go through them and then you will correct me if I have not understood them correctly. First point, the net positive interbank position, you're right, this is the first quarter with such a position. It comes from a very tight policy in terms of asset used throughout the group because liquidity is such an important and precious raw material that we have developed. And included in the management systems a number of mechanisms to save liquidity and to keep liquidity aside if possible.</p>
          <p>We expect, and that's the strategic reason for such a move, that liquidity will become even more important in the competitive lever in the next month, so we want to be ready for that. The performance of bancassurance in the market, well, I agree. And but the evidence of the fact that when we decide to focus the efforts of the retained network in one direction, and that was the decision we took at the end of the first quarter, the results are remarkable. Now I'm not sure about the third question. I thought &#x2013; I think that your question was about the P&amp;L impact of the non-core asset disposal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's not &#x2013; it is something that we are not disclosing, but for sure the kind of, let's say, evaluation in prices we are getting for some of those will certainly not jeopardize the P&amp;L position. But, again, we are not providing that figure. The restructuring charges, restructuring charges will &#x2013; at the end of the business plan, in the three years will be certainly higher than what we had in the business plan, mainly because of the acquisitions we have made and because of the much higher number of people that will escort out that will leave the company during the three years.</p>
          <p>Our best estimate, as of today, is that the 1.7 billion target we had in the business plan on restructuring integration charges will probably move up to 2.6 billion for paying for those several thousand people more, and the acquisitions we made. Tax rate, hard to do deregularized given the volatility of the finance law in &#x2013; of the fiscal laws in our country, but after embedding the effect of the finance law for 2008 our best estimate is in the round of 33%.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Mr. Passera. Four very quick questions. The first one is on risk-weighted assets. We've seen a decrease from 401 billion in the first quarter to 389 billion in the second quarter, I just wonder if you can give us a breakdown between the impact of Basel 2 and the actual risk-weighted assets increase? Looking at the loans, I can see a growth of 17%, so I would expect some sort of similar growth in risk-weighted assets if you can actually comment on this.</p>
          <p>The second question is on the corporate division where we've seen a strong increase in lending, 4 billion quarter-on-quarter, with a strong increase in net interest income. Now, most of the other banks have actually told us they are decreasing the exposure to corporate lending, I'm just wondering what's your strategy in this respect?</p>
          <p>The third question is on the telecom stake. I'm just wondering whether you will do any write-downs in the future, whether you will have to do any write-downs in the future. And finally, on statutory credit products, on the other item there's been a loss of volatility from 1.1 billion in the fourth quarter last year down to 6 million in the first quarter, this year and now is 742 million. I'm just wondering what this item is? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understood correctly your first question, you have asked me the change &#x2013; the shift from Basel 1 to Basel 2 has been the reason for the change in risk-weighted asset. If that was the question, that was not the reason of the changes because the figures after the first quarter were already under Basel 2. In the quarter &#x2013; in the last quarter the only effect that might have had was the expansion of the internal model to Banca IMI, but that's a minor effect.</p>
          <p>Interest income and increasing volumes by the Corporate Investment Banking division, as you know, the corporate division has a very important segment of customers in the area of mid-corporate. And those companies are the companies that are showing the highest vitality and that are performing best in terms of exports, and some of those companies are really the leading factors and the leading players in our economy. So let me tell you that the growth we are enjoying in normal lending, and structure &#x2013; and specialized lending with that segment is a structure of strengthening of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>As far as the stake we have in Telco, that is the company, the non-listed company that controls a very important stake of Telecom Italia, we believe that there is no reason, as of today, to change the evaluations we have on our books. And we'll have to be considered that at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>If you want to have the details of structured credit products others, you will find three pages, three boring pages &#x2013; at the end of the presentation; page 47, 48 and 49. I might try to explain what is written there, but you will certainly prefer to do it yourself.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to &#x2013; good morning to everybody. I have a couple of questions. The first one is on cost synergies. If I have understood correctly, you are saying &#x2013; you said that cost synergies will be higher this year and next year. I am just wondering whether the higher cost synergies just come from the larger amount of people that are leaving the group, the 2,500 people, or, eventually, if there is anything else on top of this.</p>
          <p>The second question is on the 4 billions. If I would &#x2013; I understand that probably that the 4 billions deducted from Core Tier 1 is mainly goodwill, if you can confirm this. And, if this is the case, if I remember correctly the original plan of Fideuram &#x2013; on Fideuram was to lease the &#x2013; something like a third. This is something that Mr. Yotto said in the presentation of the investment plan almost couple of years ago. And looking at your full year annual report you say that the goodwill allocated to Fideuram in the intangible section is actually is almost 1.55 billion. Am I right in saying that the goodwill located to Fideuram is just, let's say, small portion of the 4 billion that are deducted from Tier 1 &#x2013; Core Tier 1? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question, cost synergies. The higher number of people that will leave the group is certainly a component of the highest cost synergies, we expect. But another area that would certainly contribute is the IT cost, in the integration of the systems. And, after understanding better the synergies coming from the combination of the two systems, both in terms of hardware, and in terms of systems, in terms of communication, we realize that there is more than that. And I probably mentioned something like that on some occasion. And that we expect at least 100 more million in terms of savings there.</p>
          <p>Second question. You're right. A good part of that 4 billion that will impact on the Core Tier 1, if the non-core assets will be sold, comes from the goodwill. I think that the &#x2013; as far as Fideuram is concerned, that will be a small part, as you say, of the 4 billion. We said, more recently, that we are ready to list &#x2013; to float an higher percentage of Fideuram. Higher than what Mr. Yotto said, probably several years ago now.</p>
          <p>And then, what else can I tell you on goodwill?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of questions. The first one is on the Core Tier 1. You have a 6% target. And I wonder if the deals that have already been announced, like the Carifirenze branches in mid-Cariparma, if these deals are big enough, in your opinion, to bring the Core Tier 1 to the 6% level by year-end, by the end of 2008?</p>
          <p>And an update, if possible, on the Findomestic, if there is any news. And a final question on costs, given the synergies that are ahead of plan. If we look at 2009, is it fair to say that, overall, operating costs can grow between 0% and 1%? Just some color on that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 6% Core Tier 1 level will be reached with other kind of deals, not &#x2013; the ones that have been announced so far will not be enough to reach, structurally, that level. Findomestic, there is no news, unfortunately, but we had &#x2013; no, there is no news. So that's your answer.</p>
          <p>The last question of yours is not that clear to me, and maybe you can repeat it or --?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's, I mean a very trivial one. If &#x2013; I am assuming a growth in operating costs in 2009, between 0% and 1%, if it's a fair estimate? Or is it too optimistic?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. And quite simply, an explanation, if it's possible, on page 10 of your presentation. It seems there is a strong contribution to improvement of net interest income from finance and treasury, and this is an improvement also from first quarter '08. And so I wondered, if you can give some highlights on that?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on &#x2013; just to be sure that, when you talk of 2,500 possible future release, you talk of net figures and not gross figures. And lastly, I understand that this might be a difficult moment to talk about that, but if you think of any <mark type="inaudible" /> location to Alitalia, going forward? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The higher contribution of finance and treasury to net interest income comes from the better liquidity position we have at central level. And the higher deposits &#x2013; I mean, the higher deposits we have overall, brings them to the center and that's the result of it, mainly. As far as the further decrease in the number of employees, the 2,500 people I mentioned are the gross figure, because we will certainly have at least 700 recruitment, hiring of young people.</p>
          <p>Alitalia. Alitalia, if a number of conditions are met, and I have the impression they will be met because, today, the new merdanalo was approved. And, if everything goes according to plans, and if the conditions of the possible offer will be met, we might &#x2013; we will probably participate &#x2013; we will participate in the creation of the new Co, with something in the round of 100 million. And that will be our contribution to a project that has become a very solid one and, I strongly believe, a very successful one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. I come back to the Banca Seranca in fact, had a good result in the quarter. We all know that you are negotiating with Generale and Alianza, to understand the final structure of your Banca plant. Can you anticipate, more or less, if the perimeter, at least for you, and for them at the Banca plant, will change substantially?</p>
          <p>So we have to expect some changes in the contribution for you both? The second question. I hear your comments on the strategy in asset management and also that, for Fideuram, it's not the right timing for an IPO replacement. But you said that, also, some months ago. But, more in general, as far as the contribution of asset management and, let's say, private banking or financial advisors to your accounts. Do you expect some improvement in the second half of the year? Or you think that more actions have to be implemented in the Group to obtain a better return? So if we have to wait 'til 2009?</p>
          <p>Again, on taxation, I agree with you, it's very complicated to understand what will be the final structure of taxes for the financial sector. But can you just clarify if, in the first half numbers, you put some amount related to what, as far as today, you believe will be the impact of the &#x2013; what we call Robin Hood Tax? So if you have already anticipated part of this burden in the accounts.</p>
          <p>And, finally, you were mentioning that, in the 156 million of your trading income deriving from capital markets and merchant banking, there was something related to some specific deals. I don't want to know the names of these deals. But can you just give us an idea of how much you believe is sustainable in that part of the trading income? And what has been a one-off and we have not to expect in the third and in the fourth quarter? Thank you.</p>

          <p>The first question was about bank insurance. And I would prefer to postpone the answer to the end of the negotiation that is underway. For sure, the importance of holding control in the product sector is, in this industry, is not necessarily what it used to be in the past.</p>
          <p>Second question, asset management products and income in general. I don't expect anything in the second half, even if we are implementing a number of actions because the main driver of growth will be in market confidence and the trust of people in financial markets. And I would prefer to be prudent and wait for something real to happen on the market, so that people are keeping their risk aversion for the whole of 2008. Tax rate is &#x2013; has been calculated with the effect of the so called Robin Hood Taxes. And the net impact for us was in the round of 75 million.</p>
          <p>Trading income, as I said, is such a volatile component, and that's the reason why we have identified it separately. That is very hard to define, a structural, sustainable figure. What I can tell you is that, for that particular month, about half of it comes from specific yields. What is important in that &#x2013; one point that you should consider is the second note you have on page 13, on the left hand side. And that note says that first half 2008 profit include 78 million worth of dividends from financial assets available for sale.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I have just a few remaining questions. For a second, going back to your &#x2013; to a question that was asked earlier on risk-weighted assets and I'm not sure I grasped the answer. Your risk-weighted assets going &#x2013; are going down 3 billion quarter-on-quarter. If I look at your loan book, it's gone up in assets held for trading. Quarter-on-quarter, it's gone up on the asset side, on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Can you explain what is the reason for the reduction? Is this market risk decline? It's actually hedging or transactions on assets that you have, which you have increased and that's helped in the asset reduction? Or what else, actually? Because it's quite a change on the negative, versus the assets going up?</p>
          <p>My second question is on the leveraged finance book, which has gone up quite a bit, from 3.6 billion in Q1 to 5 billion in Q2. Can you give us a bit of color, in terms of what type of transactions, what kind of business, has generated the increase? And I can see the portion that, actually, you are planning to syndicate...</p>

          <p>I'm not sure &#x2013; I did not hear one of these questions, so we have some problem following. Can you repeat from the beginning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This question, just asking what is the reason for the increase in the leveraged finance book from 3.6 billion in Q1 to 5 billion in Q2? If you can give us some color. Also, just one clarification. Obviously, you are in the course of negotiation for Findomestic, with BNP. Should you decide to sell the consumer finance in Findomestic, and what else you have, would that come on top of the 8 billion that you are penciling as for sale, or is that, potentially, already increased &#x2013; included in that 8 billion? One last question.</p>
          <p>We look at the economic data. Italy is more or less already going into a small recession in the second quarter. We expect more deceleration in H2. What do you think is going to be the impact, besides loan deceleration, higher provisions? And what do you think could be your provision level, on a more recession-like scenario? Clearly, when you had to plan out a year, or two years ago, recession was not expected in your guidance, for sure. What do you think is the level that, if something really &#x2013; if the economy really decelerates, you can actually have to provide, on the bottom of the cycle? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The risk-weighted asset decrease comes from the introduction of internal module at Banca IMI, so, market risk, but, at the same time, from the credit risk litigation that we produced through the improvement of the warranties. Second, the question of leveraged yields. Let me check that figure, yes. So, the lever &#x2013; we should have explained that, in the first quarter '08, we analyzed the level of yields only belonging to the investment banking division, while, in the second quarter, we extended these analyses and this collection of figures to the whole group.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; should Findomestic become an asset for sale that, today, is not, the 8 billion would be increased, because they do not include the Findomestic. That's not what we had in mind when we figured out the 8 billion. Recession. The recession is something that we certainly, in no &#x2013; in most of the figures we read around, certainly not in a number of industries, in a number of districts in our company &#x2013; in our country. I would be very cautious before forecasting, in a strong way, a real strong recession in our country.</p>
          <p>And I expect, more, a situation like the one we had during several years in the first part of this decade, with very low growth. But, as you might remember, the banks have been growing steadily, also, in years where the GNP &#x2013; the official GNP was growing between zero and 1%, or in around of 1%. So it would not be serious, on my side, to make a forecast, in terms of costs of credit for a recession. That, I personally &#x2013; I don't yet feel, in our situation and &#x2013; again, it will depend on the kind of &#x2013; if recession comes, it will depend on how severe this recession would be. For sure, we had not forecasted such an event in the business plan scenario and &#x2013; but it's difficult for me to forecast this more than five or 10 basis points more than what we had in the business plan.</p>

          <p>Looking at the economic data, effectively, Italy's GDP, direct GDP, contracted 1% on an annualized basis in the second quarter...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I apologies. I'll &#x2013; I was saying, looking at the economic data that is available now, it looks as if Italian GDP contracted by 1% in the second quarter. Our economies, together with some others, expect a similar contraction in the second half of the year. Do you think that that could have a further decelerating impact on growth? And, perhaps, some input, again, on perhaps NPLs and asset quality. Without necessarily going to a deep recession, technically, that is a recession already. How do you see that panning out?</p>

          <p>Sorry, it's too a qualitative question. And, for sure, the more severe the recession, the stronger is the effect, in terms of credit growth and in terms of non-performing loan growth. But I must tell you that I do not expect any severe recession. Certainly, a period of very low growth, yes. But I'm sure that we will react to the situation and we will use some leverage to &#x2013; not some leverage in terms of indebtments...</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. All my question has been already answered, so I only have a couple of follow-ups. The first one is on the restructuring charges. And, if I understood properly, you said that they are going to be some 1.1 billion higher, compared to the figure you provide at the time of the business plan. So the question is, when is this amount going to be charged?</p>
          <p>Second question is a clarification on the Basel 2. I didn't understand if, when Basel 2 is going to be fully implemented, the overall impact on Core Tier 1 is going to be 30, 40 basis points or 60, 80 basis points? My last question is comments and color from you on the press articles saying that the Costodian business is ready to be disposed. So, for as much as you can, some color on this. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your first question was on the plan of when the restructuring charges are charging in the P&amp;L. We have immediately started changing the figures as soon as we realized that &#x2013; not realized, as soon as we decided to go more in depth, in terms of restructuring, and as soon as we decide to increase the number of people leaving the company.</p>
          <p>So, I cannot tell you that, from a certain date, we will have more charges. As of today, we have already charged them 412 million more than what we had in the original business plan. So &#x20AC;412 million have been already charged, in excess of what the original business plan provided for. What I said before is that the application of Basel 2 foundation might increase &#x2013; might improve our ratios by 30, 40 basis points, while the full application of Basel 3 might add 30, 40 basis points in addition to that. So for each of the two steps in the application of Basel 2, you might add something in the round of 30, 40 basis points. On the last point, I will not make any comment.</p>
