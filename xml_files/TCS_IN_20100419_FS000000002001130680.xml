          <p>Chandra and Maha will give us a brief overview of the company's performance followed by the Q&amp;A session. As you're aware, we do not provide specific revenue and earnings guidance. Anything said on this call which reflects our outlook for the future or which can be construed as a forward-looking statement must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. We have outlined these risks in the second slide of the results presentation e-mailed to all of you and also available on our website.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to turn the call over to Chandra to begin the proceedings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone. Thank you for joining the call. It has been another excellent quarter and satisfying quarter from our perspective, while we have delivered a volume growth of about 4%, revenue growth of about 4.1% in constant currency terms and we've taken a huge hit on currency. It's about 1.1% in terms of actual rupee terms. And the quarter saw excellent expansion margin. At the operating level, we delivered a 21 basis point improvement and more importantly at the gross margin level we delivered a 59 basis point improvement taking into account all the hit due to currency.</p>
          <p>At a net profit level, the improvement is 149 basis points and the net profit itself I think 23%. So, our margins are at an all time historic high. In terms of year-on-year basis, we delivered 277 basis points at OPM level and 429 basis points at the net margin level. Actually, if you take the number Q4 to Q4, it's even better. So, it's a very satisfying performance and also we declared dividends. Rs. 4 is the final dividend taking into 10 and then additional Rs. 10 as a special dividend. This has been recommended to the stock holders.</p>
          <p>Now, coming to the verticals perspective the overall environment is better, it's been improving every month as I have said before and BFSI, including insurance is getting the recovery. We used to see lot of growth in BFSI and insurance is lagging behind. And we see that insurance is also picking momentum now. And retail continues to do well, both in terms of their deal wins and also in terms of the pipeline and Life Sciences and Healthcare is again doing well. And in terms of the troubled verticals which we have said that are slow, Telecom is beginning to show upward trend with both deal signings and the opportunities we are pursuing both in Europe and in emerging markets. And Energy and Utilities is doing well, Manufacturing and Hi-Tech also are showing recovery.</p>
          <p>So, I think from our perspective we are seeing our clients talking to us with more opportunities although the long-term contracts or sizable contracts are coming in the running the business type of engagements and the transformation engagements are coming, but they are coming in phases in the sense that each engagement is split into multiple phases and then we are building chunks &#x2013; of those. And India has done well for the &#x2013; in Q4 on top of what it did in Q3. So, we are seeing momentum in India as well. In terms of services our, rather new services namely relatively new Infrastructure, BPO, Assurance and products business now contributed 25% of our revenues and our traction is extremely good both in infrastructure and all these verticals our traction is very good. We have signed a number of deals in the banks products this quarter and also in the infrastructure space we've been winning sizable deals.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of deals, we have signed a ten large deals this quarter, one over 500 million, a couple of those in the 125, $150 million range, and the rest above $50 millions range. In addition to that, we are also having a good healthy pipeline of deals, at least a ten of them we are pursuing, which are sizable in nature. These deals are distributed across world market and industries.</p>
          <p>In terms of employees, we have hired the highest net addition of employees with 10,775 employees net coming into the system this quarter alone. And we have also rewarded the employees with 125% of QVA this quarter and we have announced our annual increments to be 10% on an average, but including the cost of promotions it's about 13% on an average for India based employees, and for employees in the major markets 2 to 4%, and employees in the emerging markets 2 to 10%.</p>
          <p>So, overall it has been a very good year. We think that we have delivered volume and increasingly every quarter we have gotten better and our margins have continued to improve all the four quarters in a row against the currency headwinds and we have got the right cost structure. We continually invest where we have to invest. So the SG&amp;A even though has come down as a percentage of overall revenues, we have not cut down on investments and capability building and sales at the right places. We continue to be looking for efficiencies to improve the offshore leverage significantly during the year and we have shown excellent execution rigor this quarter in terms of productivity in delivering projects as opposed to only offshore movement during this quarter. With those comments I would like to pass it on to Maha and after that we will be happy to take questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Thanks. Chandra, he has already covered the business aspects of it as well as the HR, I'll talk about the margins. If you recall the approach that we had outlined at the start of the year, we said we would continue investing in our business while maintaining pricing discipline and improving internal efficiencies unless you will see the results now and this approach seems to have definitely paid out. The cost management initiatives that we had rolled out at the height of downturn delivered as margin improvements at every levels within the organization despite unprecedented currency volatility and now as growth returns to the industry, the cost discipline is giving us an operating leverage.</p>
          <p>We ended FY'10 with an industry leading revenue growth of 8% year-on-year in rupee terms and 5.4% year-on-year in USD terms and the breakup of the annual revenue growth volume growth 17.4%. Exchange gave us an increase of 2%, pricing was down by 3.3%, effort mix that's really the shift to offshore depressed the revenues to the extent of 8.1% and therefore overall it was 8% in terms of growth. Our fourth quarter revenues grew by 4.2% quarter-on-quarter in constant currency terms. The volume led growth aided by price discipline and some contract shift. However, due to rupees appreciation against all currencies in particular against the euro and GBP, the reported Q-on-Q growth rate was 1.1% in INR term and at slightly better 3.1% in USD terms. The breakup of our quarterly revenue growth is as follows. Volume growth was 4% plus exchange brought us down by 3.1% in terms of margin. Pricing was a marginal improvement of five basis points. Effort mix was a marginal improvement of 16 basis points, and therefore totally we came up with 1.1%. Obviously 1.1% was on the basis of a 4% volume growth and the negative 3.1% exchange.</p>
          <p>Despite the adverse currency impact of Rs. 2.37 billion on the top line of this quarter we've still held our employee cost steady as a percentage of revenue at the last quarter's level. In addition we are able to better leverage the various non-employee costs improving our gross margin by 39 basis points to 46.85%. Similarly we brought down the SG&amp;A expenses by 42 basis points quarter-on-quarter, but some additional provisioning we had to make towards bad debts negated those. Nevertheless operating margin expanded by 21 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 27.51%. The impact of different levers of the operating margin is as follows, currency 192 basis points negative, offshore shift 16 basis points negative, rate productivity improvement 247 basis points positive. In regards to SG&amp;A efficiencies, provisioning for bad debt 60 basis points negative &#x2013; 60 basis points negative and others 42 basis points positive and that gives us a total of 21 basis points.</p>
          <p>For the full year as a consequence of this benign currency environment, the various operational levers we exercise the efficiencies we build to our operations, our EBIT margin expanded by 277 basis points year-on-year to 26.5%, of which 169 basis points came from renewed cost of revenues and 108 basis points came from reduction in SG&amp;A expenses. The breakup of this margin improvement is as follows, currency, 115 basis points positive, offshore shift 151 basis points positive, rate productivity change 98 basis points negative, SG&amp;A efficiencies provisioning for bad and doubtful debt on a yearly basis, 29 basis points negative, others 137 basis points and therefore total increase in margin on an annual basis was 277 basis points.</p>
          <p>Our operating margin expansion of the hiring and other income in Q4 resulted in a net income margin expansion of 149 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 24.97%. For the whole year, our net income margin was 22.88%, a 429 basis point expansion over the previous year. The earnings per share for this year was 35.12 which is a 32.9% year-on-year growth. We brought down our DSO by an additional four basis this quarter to 71 for the whole year, our rigorous follow-up and streamlining process improved our DSO by a total of eight days.</p>
          <p>Cash and liquid funds at the end of the financial year stood at Rs. 86.7 billion. In keeping with our policy of rewarding shareholders, we have announced a final dividend of Rs. 4 and the special dividend of Rs. 10 bringing the total dividend for the year to Rs. 20. Last year the total dividend for the year was 14 and compared to Rs. 7 post bonus, this year's total dividend is Rs. 20. And therefore it has been an interesting year challenging and we have achieved what we set out to achieve.</p>
          <p>With this, we can open lines for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question is from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen Group. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Nice quarter and congratulations on their record margins. Just talking about margins maybe Maha, you can talk a bit about your ability to maintain those margins maybe talk about some of the traditional kind of metrics on where we can get some more levers and then how should we think about margins down the road given some of the recent trends on the currency and if the currency &#x2013; if the Rupee appreciates meaningfully against some of the others, how are we &#x2013; should we assume you are going to be willing to maintain your bottom line growth by cutting more expenses. I mean what's' your view on that?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know Moshe there's what we have done in terms of margin improvement was, the first we attacked the normal levers with regard to onsite, offshore, then we also looked at the SG&amp;A did that. And now we are on a journey where we are essentially looking at the efficiencies and so on at the project execution level. And we believe there are still some things that we can do in order to take care of it. But the problem is really in terms of additional cost in terms of employee cost. We have already announced it. So, like I had been saying earlier our intent is that over a year we should be in a position to hold on to somewhere around 27%, but then this will come in, but this will not be obviously in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We have got some prior issues with regard to wages I know in a period of time we'll have to improve our efficiencies and so on. The currency factor is also a big one. I had been seeing that around 46 or so. We should be able to maintain it. We did that because this quarter yeah it has been closer to about 46 in terms of average. So we have done that, but as the currency appreciates, then obviously there are headwinds. So what I would say is that the cost management or cost reduction program is not over. We will continue to drive efficiencies and so on, but we have got these headwinds and we'll have to watch on that. Beyond that it's difficult to say anything at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you mentioned also transformational deals that are coming back. Maybe we can get some details on that by vertical and maybe also talk about what we're seeing in some of the different regions, i.e., North America versus Europe?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See in terms of transformation deals, I think we are seeing financial services definitely. ERP consolidation kind of deal, SAP, Oracle and business analytics deals and also in the infrastructure side huge opportunities in terms of virtualization et cetera. So those are the type of deals that are coming in, but having said that, if you're &#x2013; while those deals are coming in verticals like banking, retail, manufacturing also, we still have to wait for scale of such deals. Still they're early days of those type of deals. Most of the deals today are in the, only in running the business area. So, that's what is happening on the deal side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Katri. Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. I was wondering if you could talk about the budgeting cycles, the budget is pretty much closed at this point and may be if you talk a little bit about how the decision process has changed coming out of the downturn, it sounds like contract cycles are little bit shorter, is that true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, but the contract cycles are getting shorter. I think they're, we are seeing deal closures definitely. As I said, for deals which are taking cost out or bringing efficiencies in we are seeing growth of such deals, closure of such deals across verticals, though I would say that manufacturing lags behind still but whereas if you take the transformation deals, the deal cycles are small, not because the funding is not being given for such projects but they want to do it in phases. There is lot more due diligence and I expect that, that is the way it will be for at least next two to three quarters. But having said that most of our clients have finalized their budgets and we have reasonably a good visibility for the year ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, what's the biggest concern over the next 12 months is it the currency movement and the sustainability of margins, is it recruiting on the attrition side, maybe you can talk about sort of where the focus just to know that demand has come back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent question, the issues are going to be &#x2013; Europe is still an issue, we have not still seeing full record in Europe. We've seen U.S doing well, on emerging markets definitely showing lot of signs of opportunities and UK is better but Europe is still a problem and UK and Europe especially the currency is a major headwind. The third is in terms of we don't know what's going to happen in terms of the DD fund and I don't know they're heading quite a bit in the last few days on Goldman where exactly we don't know. So we just need to be cautious only if something of this &#x2013; something of this nature triggers something else. But otherwise we feel that there is a good pick up in momentum.</p>
          <p>We are seen opportunities in across verticals and also in markets. In terms of the human resources side we've managed to still retain a good retention rate. We have kicked off a number of employee engagement programs, not only we are taking care by the right payouts and increases et cetera there is also a good number of initiatives on the soft side on the employee side, so we hope to retain the talent that's a key challenge is important and we have completed all appraisals for the last fiscal year for all the eligible employees which are more than 1,20,000 employees and finalize their payouts and is going to be paid out in this week or latest by next week. So that's the kind of initiative that we are taking, but again that's something that we were watchful for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You kept the percentage on cost on labor you know consistent with past quarters, are you including more heavily at the fresher level or are you doing at the middle-management maybe you can just talk quickly about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, the couple of things, last two quarters saw significant number of trainee addition because all the offers that we had given, significant majority of them we took them in Q3 and Q4, in fact Q4 was the record for us in terms of account addition, we added 10,775 people and 70% of the recruitment came in the last two quarters as far as the last the FY '10 fiscal year is concerned. Moving forward I think we'll be somewhere around 60% plus for fresher's and 30% plus for experienced professionals, I don't know whether it will be 69:31 or 65:35 depends on the type of engagements we were.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the last one, just a house keeping one Maha, that 27% is sustainable at a rupee above 46 but is the implications there that it goes, if it appreciates more than you have to revisit that 27% operating margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yes. We, even then it's going to be a challenge but certainly we'll have to revisit that if it appreciates above that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Foresi. Our next question is from the line of Srivathsan Ramachandran of Spark Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah hi, Maha just wanted to get an update on how the hedging book at this point of time, and what's the strategy going forward, going to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know hedging; we have not taken any additional hedges. Even last quarter, we have not done any at this point. We have an objective as far associate have concern and we will get into the market in order to protect that. While at this moment in time, we do not have any revenue hedges other than the old hedges that we have, because of the tune of about $200 million for the year as a whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>200 million for FY '11 as a whole?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is in terms of Europe, you're seeing its concern, is it the concern that's more specific in certain pockets or across verticals you're seeing some weakness in Europe as a whole?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, across verticals, I would say that deal closures are slow, though we're seeing growth in financial services and retail coming back but some telecom opportunities also are there, but still the deal closures take a long time and ramp ups are taking a long time. So Europe is slow as far as they concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My last question is on the bank growth, you had made an initial comment that there's been some decent amount of deal and is it something that we can quantify and what's driving this growth, is it more new core banking license sales in emerging markets or which geographies are driving this growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See our bank platform has a number of products, core banking product, then we have payment solution, we have brokerage solution, we have got the insurance solution and we have seen broad based deals including a very large multi-country implementation, core banking deal, more than 100 million for our very, very leading bank and then we won good deals for our key customers in the insurance sector. Then we've also seen some deals in other bank solutions. So overall, the banks deal closures have been satisfactory this quarter, is picking up momentum. Our platform is fully modernized now and that is helping us to close deals.</p>

          <p>Thank you Mr. Ramachandran. Our next question is from the line of Sandeep Muthangi of IIFL. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good evening, congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to get your thoughts on the pricing. Pricing has largely stabilized. I wanted to know how confident you are that the realizations could improve in FY '011 itself based on the discussions you are having with the clients and your pipelines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you are right, I think it's pricing has stabilized from our point of view. We have also been extremely careful and maintain a good discipline. I really hope that we're going to see some pricing are returning with the demand pickup, though it may not happen the immediate quarters that's something that should happen if the demand continues to increase that should dry some pricing power coming back in the latter part of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also a bit of the salary hikes, clearly some of your competitors have given one round of salary hikes and they are also contemplating another round of salary hikes, do you see a scope or a need for another round of salary hikes in FY '011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think you know, different companies have different situations. From our point of view if you look at our compensation it has got two parts really. One part is what we give now another part is linked to the company performance during the quarter and what we call is the quarterly variable. We did pay out last year also in Q2, Q3 and again in Q4, a good quarterly variable. Now going forward for this year we announced good pay hike across the board not only in India but also elsewhere and if we do better than what we expect to do then we will do pay outs in quarterly variables during the quarters all through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Chandra that was great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Muthangi. Our next question is from the line of Vihang Naik of MS Global. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good evening, a nice execution. I just had a question in terms of your drop in SG&amp;A employee cost what has really driven the drop in even absolute terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's primarily the improvement of utilization of experienced professionals from the bench to COR. There is also small reclassification that has been done with the R&amp;D expenses. So that's the small one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So actually my next question was I mean the increase in R&amp;D expense is mostly due to a reclassification or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Reclassification, it's to bring it in line with what we, in terms of various projects and so on but the &#x2013; and the cost that is calculated. So, we &#x2013; it is due to reclassification.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So the cost basically has been deducted from employee cost to research and development cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is largely employee but there are some other costs also which have come in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And, another question was, your consultancy has shown robust growth for the second consecutive quarter at around 23%, I mean does this really mean that we are really seeing good traction on the discretionary front as such?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as I said before I would like to see some more deals signings happening in the discretionary space before I confirm that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, your ADM revenues have been largely flattish this quarter, could we actually give the breakup between the development part of revenue growth and maintenance part for Q-o-Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have it handy, but we can definitely Kedar can follow through or we normally don't give that out, so Kedar anyway will &#x2013; get in touch with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay I'll take it offline. And lastly what kind of, tax rate expectations do we have for FY '12, in a situation with direct tax code and without direct tax code?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is of course even in direct tax code we need to understand all the provisions that are going to come especially with whether it seems that to what extent they are going to be allowable or so on. But if you really look at the trend that we have followed, we have done a lot of expansion on these feedbacks, mark the word expansion, it's really that the new projects, new contracts and so on which have really come in they have gone exclusive to see and this probably we have been doing for the last four years, most of our captives have taken up that time either on lease or build happy to see that. And with that kind of good tax planning we have been able to reduce &#x2013; those so in case we feel that continues to be available then I think we should be somewhere around the  21% mark or so. Otherwise, as you know, it will go to 25.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to add something. See, if you really wanted to look at the discretionary spend, I suggest that you look at the enterprise solutions which has grown about close to a percent in constant currency terms. We'd like to see higher growths before we can say that that discretionary spend is normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That was helpful. Thanks a lot.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. Chandra, you were saying or others, might have been others that Europe is still very difficult. UK I think you said was getting better. Is the European problem across the whole of Continental Europe or are there any bright spots?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, see definitely we are seeing deal closures in some verticals like retail and also the banking side. Coming back, in fact the core banking deal and also some insurance deals we're seeing in Europe. So, it is not that there are no deals happening. I would like to say that the closure time is taking time, the ramp up time is taking time, is still not at the same level as what you're seeing in the U.S., that's the point I make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but also I was trying to understand which of the country markets might be behaving differently to others. I mean which is, which of the major country markets do you see most hope of recovering first in Continental Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We see hope for all of them to recover in the next couple of quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah, okay. My final question is just on Diligenta just to make sure I understand what's happening here. Do I understand correctly that the transformation of the Diligenta platform is now complete?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'm sorry. Just one final question on the attrition, your competitor talked about seeing, poaching of top technical staff, are you experiencing any of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From an attrition point of view, if you look at our attrition has been pretty stable which is at just 11.8% and a slight increase to 0.3% but yes given the common attrition is happening and it is to a certain extent true that there are cases where key resources and the niche still are the one which is in demand and that is where this is happening.</p>

          <p>Good evening and thanks for taking my question. Chandra, what are you really hearing from clients in the manufacturing side, are you &#x2013; do you expect this deal momentum, I mean the quarterly growth momentum to increase going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's going to be slow in manufacturing that's the most troubled vertical.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but how soon, I mean how many quarters ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I expect that it will grow from here, but the growth is going to be on a slow slope it's not going to be steep. I think it will get better quarter after quarter, hopefully in all the four quarters, but it's not going to be steep.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello. Congratulations on a strong quarter. I just wanted to get some comments on how much of the growth that you are getting, is that from market rebound and how much do you think is from share gain and also some trends in terms of maybe who you are gaining share from is it more just internal work being offshore or more from consolidation of Tier 2 vendors perhaps or traditional incumbent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I would say that in the infrastructure space it is share gain and in the application space it is market rebound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, right. And just clarification on the gross hiring target just mentioned is it 30,000 just a campus offer, so is that a total number you are looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the total, we're hiring for this FY '11. For campus what we've done is, we've already offered 20,000 so far from 371 institutes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one housekeeping question for Maha, what is kind of capital expenditure you're looking at this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Capital expenditure next year will be much higher than what we did this year, it will &#x2013; it is going to be around somewhere around 2,200 crores.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ms. Ghosh, our next question is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan of Indiabulls Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my questions, I had two questions, one is this quarter with regard to the deal wins that we've had, would it be by far the largest in terms of TCS over the past four quarters and if you could quantify that in some way or in terms of &#x2013; if not the total contract value at least how many above 100 or how many above 50?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nitin, we don't shares TCS, so but in terms of the number of deals it's quite healthy is about 10 deals and we have been announcing in the range of six to 10 deals over the last few quarters and the deals is spread out one contract is more than 500 million and couple of contracts above 100 million, 125 to 150 million range then the remaining are all above 50 million and four from the U.S., four from the U.K., one from Europe and one from Asia Pacific. And in terms of verticals, two from insurance, and two from Energy and Utilities, and one each from a number of verticals retail, healthcare and government et cetera. So I think it's been good but I wouldn't say that it is a highest or anything like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with regards to discretionary spends, overall if you look at the pipeline that's out there today obviously what you would have seen may be a quarter back, in terms of discretionary spend is it, is there some sense that you have in terms of how larger it has become compared to what it was earlier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See it has improved every quarter. Even this, currently the current deal pipeline that we have, if you see the mix between discretionary versus committed spend, discretionary have gotten better now compared to last quarter and so on and some of the product deals that we have signed now are coming from the discretionary spend. But still it is not only safe that I can say that market has completely come back on discretionary spending and everything is hunky-dory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay and just a clarification on the other income, if you could just split that up for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Other income we made 42 crores profit in this one in foreign exchange, and we had closed to about 130 crores in the interest and dividends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you Mr. Padmanabhan. Our next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah of ICICI Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes in, on the CNBC you have said that the wage inflation impact would be close to around $193 million, so if my calculations are correct it will impact the margins in the coming year by around 250, 300 basis point. And we have also indicated a 50 basis point margin outlook in terms of improvement on Y-o-Y basis at average rupee of roughly around 46 versus the average rupee of 47.4 in this year. So what would be the levers you are counting in terms of 50 basis point improvement in the coming year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Essentially what we've said was we've gone through a journey &#x2013; we've gone through a journey with regard to onsite, offshore which is at a reasonably high level we've also talked about SG&amp;A reduction and we've now talked about improvement in execution and so on. I think what you will see is increasingly going forward is on the executing capability as well as in terms of the SG&amp;A delivering a higher &#x2013; the cost delivering a higher growth, that's what. So we have certain plans for that and therefore you would have to see a reduction both in cost of revenue percentage as well as SG&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Say I want to just add to &#x2013; just very relevant add here, I think Maha what he said is the intent only. He says we're intent to keep it at 27%, don't take it as a guidance. Second point is we definitely see a big headwind in the wage as you yourself correctly articulated it's a 250 to 300 basis points and then the currency is the big problem. So we have huge headwinds. So we should expect margins to dip in the immediate quarter and after that apart from onsite, offshore we will look at business mix. There are different markets in which we are operating and each of those markets are operating at different margin levels. So we are going to see what opportunity is there. So it's something that we have considered. Yes but that's a, that's already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question the gross addition of 30,000, but if you look at the attrition as well as the joining ratio, on a net basis the employee addition in the FY '11 will be a single digit kind of a thing. So are we looking to improve the utilization here on or our growth scenario for FY '11 right now is not optimistic versus any other competitor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's not true if you look at I think one other thing that you have to factor in. Is the fact that we have about 20, have about 12,000 to 13,000 trainees who are undergoing training at this point in time and they would be available for deployment from Q1 onwards. So that's the additional bandwidth that I have, so that is the reason why you see the utilization including trainees have dipped to 74% so that's capacity that we will utilize. And going forward we always have the option of going for our additional recruitment, both for trainees as well as laterals, to meet our demand requirements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And Maha, just on the tax rate for FY '11, I think what you commented or FY '12 which was 21% with SEZ and 25% without SEZ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as far as tax rate for FY '11 we have been maintaining that it will be somewhere around 18 to 19%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Shah. Our next question is from the line of Pankaj Kapoor of RBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi sir. Just wanted to get a sense on the BFSI vertical, where the growth rate this quarter was a bit slower than what we've seen in the earlier few quarters. I was wondering if we have seen most of them and their spend being now out and growth going forward will be more normal. Can you throw some light on this please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's not true Pankaj. I think the BFSI still the ramp ups are good, immediately their spending is going on. The problem is that we also have a huge BFSI exposure than other verticals in UK and Europe where the current hit has been just very severe. And see there are two points, I always remind you to consider. One is that whenever you see the onsite offshore mix, don't assume that it is same for the company.</p>
          <p>Internally, some verticals or some units we will do significant offshoring and some other vertical we will be doing onsite. That is the nature of the business, because we will be doing transition somewhere and new contract will be picking up etcetera. So, BFSI per se, showed offshore improvement this quarter, whereas the overall we didn't have an improvement in offshore. Second one is we have a higher exposure to BFSI in Continental Europe and UK. So those things we have to keep in mind always.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is it possible to get a sense on the constant currency growth then in the BFSI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have it here, normally we don't publish that. But, anyway Kedar will get in touch with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sure. And sir, second question was on the global subsidiaries, I was wondering what kind of a EBITDA margin level, are they currently operating at and how do you see their margins on a consolidated basis moving on over the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, just to say that some of the subsidiaries and some of the newer markets, who are young and small operate little lower EBITDA margin compared to the company average. I don't want to give a specific number, and they are consistently improving. As they gain scale they will improve to the company policy, that's the lever we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Maha also mentioned that there are some costs efficiencies are still available. Will it be possible for you to elaborate on them, I mean I understand one would be for subsidiaries, but any other levers and if you can elaborate on them please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see one of the things that we had said, when we decided to move to 19% this is what we have talked about in SG&amp;A is that the base itself is supporting, will support a higher revenue and certainly that is one area that we would look at. The second one is in terms of this execution capability that we have shown in spite of a 3.11% negative impact on currency we have still improved that gross margin by 39 basis points. So, that's another one. So, ultimately what we have to get right is on employee cost. That's the, because that is the biggest element of cost about 56% or so, and therefore more effective utilization all those, the pyramid many of those kinds of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one clarification when we are looking at this constant margin outlook or margin being in a narrow band at a currency level of 46. We are not factoring in any kind of realization improvement in this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you so much.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Kapoor. Our next question is from the line of Diviya Nagarajan of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I'm sorry, this question has been answered earlier, but just first looking at your segmental revenue and ADM and some of the higher end segments such as ERP, consulting seem to be continuously sluggish. ADM in particular seems to have flat-lined after a couple of strong quarters. What happened here would we, should we look at this as a one quarter aberration or is this is a sign of continued softness in discretionary spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think discretionary spending you should look at the enterprise solutions more and we have had two good quarters in ADM and overall volume with this for &#x2013; only it's about 4% this quarter. And so there will be quarterly variations. You should look at the year as a whole and I don't see any specific message there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right. You also commented that you're looking at a slower slope not a steep recovery, would that also be in context to the discretionary services pick up or was that something else that you're referring to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was referring to verticals like manufacturing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right, and just Maha again I think enough has been asked about the margins, but I'm just trying to reconcile when you say margins gains will come through it might be the pyramid or the fact that the base is high and therefore SG&amp;A expenditure might not have to go up. If you had to single out the two top levers that you could have against wage hikes and currency in FY '11, what would you say they were?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I don't think I'm making any statement which I have not made earlier because we did talk in terms of 8, 10% in terms of wage increase and what we have to do with regards to protecting against that and currency again we have talked about. See the approach that you follow is you look at the quality of revenue in each quarter and you know what is going to happen and thereafter you essentially plan on all the other expenses and so on. I think we've got it, we've got many of these things largely right during the last year and we've shown improvement, beyond that it becomes difficult to say. The normal lever of realization we're not taking into account, we are not taking into account the onsite absorption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, could you talk about your initiatives in the government vertical in the U.S. and UK?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've been present in the UK government sector for quite some time. Again we announced a large deal of over 500 million this quarter and we continue to win deals in counties, in the government across departments whereas in the U.S., we have a few deals which we have won during the last four to six quarters, but we have a separate team working in building solutions to specific niche areas in the U.S. market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay sir. And could you talk about our domestic opportunities in the Latin American and Chinese market and what is the competitive scenario in those markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, we have done well in Latin America as you know and we continue to see opportunities especially in Mexico, Columbia, Argentina and also in Brazil. So, these are markets in which we are focused and we will continue to expect good growth in this market on a yearly basis probably ahead of the company average. China has been slow for us overall from a revenue perspective but we have done well in terms of ensuring that all our projects are going well. We have done four core banking solutions live and then last quarter we have won two more we have signed and then we got one insurance client where we have gone live and the largest trading system for the Chinese foreign exchange market which is a subsidiary of the People's Bank of China, that has gone live as well. So overall we are having the execution engine, the delivery engine in place but in terms of growth I think it's slow.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my questions. All my questions have been answered. Just one point on the provision that we make for bad debt, has seen a significant rise in FY '10. So, almost like 65 basis point of revenues is in provision. Any particular reason for that or is just the macroeconomic layout?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is not the macroeconomic, there were some impacts of it, but there were also &#x2013; they were also credited because some of these troubled accounts we managed to collect essential part of them, but at the same time, it is also a matter of the contracts that we have where in some of the cases we might have a long drawn out milestone I mean payment term and so on and our policy provides for starting to provide after nine months and that's the reason why we have done that. We, especially on these large contracts and so on we have got to be watchful but other than that we don't find anything unusual happening now and we hope to be back to the old days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, probably in FY '11 it should come back to the trend?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is &#x2013; we will keep the pressure on the same scene.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you all for joining the conference call and listening in. I just would like to summarize by saying that we've had a very good year. We finished off the year with a good quarter, delivered a 17% volume growth and our margins have gone up at the operating level and the net margin level significantly all through the year and we think we've managed the costs very well and have got an optimal structure in terms of the future the growth opportunities are definitely there across the markets and across industries albeit some verticals are showing better sense of growth than the others. Definitely, there is a headwind in terms of both currency and wage hike and that will definitely affect our near term margins. How much we're not able to say, but wage has got a significant impact almost 2.5 to 3%. And then the currency is also posing a big challenge, but we're on our journey of improvement programs and we hope to do better during the course of the year. Thank you all once again. Bye.</p>
