          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ING First Quarter 2008 Result Conference Call on 14th May, 2008. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Thomas Weerheim. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. This is Thomas Weerheim, welcoming you to ING's first quarter 2008 conference call. Before handing this conference call over to Michel Tilmant, Chief Executive Officer of ING Group, John Hele, Chief Financial Officer, Koos Timmermans, Chief Risk Officer and Tom McInerney, Head of American Operations let me first say that any forward-looking statements in today's comment are subject to a number of variables including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates, movements in securities markets including equity markets and underlying economic conditions and changes. The realization of forward-looking statements could materially altered by unexpected movements in any or all of these and other variables.</p>
          <p>Good Michel, John, Koos and Tom. Michel over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I will start by giving you an overview of the first quarter, after which John Hele will take over with a more detailed discussion of the financial highlights and Koos Timmermans will follow to comment the risk management section and I will finish and wrap up with a few closing remarks. And of course there will be plenty of time for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So what I suggest is that you take the presentation to page three, where you can see the key points that we want to make for the first quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>First of all, that you have seen our earnings are affected essentially by the downturn in financial market as underlying net profit declines 15.2% to 1.6 billion. Second, you &#x2013; we have recorded limited direct impact from the credit and liquidity crisis. Third, we are happy to say that we have experienced strong commercial growth and despite the competitive and turbulent market and that during the quarter, we have continued to focus on managing organic growth, cost and add-on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Page four, you see the evolution of our quarterly numbers in a two year perspective and you can see of course the significant drop in capital gains during the first quarter 2008 and I remind you also that in that context, '07 was an exceptional year.</p>
          <p>I have also to say that 2006 and 2007 have seen a very buoyant performance of our investment income in real estate, in traffic liquidity and this has basically recessed a little bit in the first quarter '08 as everybody could expect.</p>
          <p>But on page five, you can see that we had limited direct impact from the credit and limited crisis. On the pressurized assets, we experienced a loss of 55 million after tax in the first quarter and you can see here the detailed subdivision of those losses. At the same time, market prices were impacted by the lack of market liquidity with a revaluation of 2.3 billion after-tax on the same pressurized assets through shareholders' equity and you can see a detail of that on page five.</p>
          <p>Now this has to be understood in the background of the stock market evolution, the credit spread evolution, the yield curve evolution and the real estate evolution. And I believe that the graph that we present you on page six are self-explanatory in that regard and certainly are a good representation of the market. And as you know the situation was particularly difficult in the last two weeks of March at the time at which we had to make the revaluations of our assets.</p>
          <p>I think it is clear, page seven, that the earnings were essentially affected by the downturn in financial market and investment returns. And you can see that if we exclude those market affected items and the fluctuation of thereof, our profits went indeed up 20% over the quarter, which is pretty good performance given the environment. And you can see here the detail of the swing.</p>
          <p>And what I think the most critical thing to realize is that we had very, very strong markets in the last two years. We benefited, and I mentioned that in every single of our presentations about the good capital gains in equities, the good revaluation in real estate, the good revaluation in private equity, and when those revaluations basically slow down significantly and/or go back to the average that we can expect over long period of time than you have the big swing in investment returns. And that's what you have seen and that explain most of the difference between the first quarter '08 and first quarter first of '07.</p>
          <p>And this is reflected also towards all our businesses. If you look at Insurance Europe, for instance, page eight, you can see the results are less 23% and profit are down due to lower investment income, especially in the Dutch life business. But at the same time, life profits from Central Europe went up 17.1%.</p>
          <p>Insurance America, earnings are down 40%. Earnings declined 35%, excluding foreign exchange as the markets trigger DAC unlocking in the US and credit and liquidity crisis led to 30 million in impairments in the US.</p>
          <p>Canada non-life also had mitigated performance. It was minus 36%, excluding currencies, but Latin America profits went up 37.5%.</p>
          <p>In the Insurance Asia Pacific, profits are up 14.5% on essentially the benefits of hedge result for SPVA in Japan. That's a positive swing compared to the previous quarters.</p>
          <p>In South Korea, profit declined due in part to a negative revaluation on CDO and higher claims, and investments continue in greenfield.</p>
          <p>On the banking side, on the Wholesale Banking, we experienced a drop in earnings of 14%, but the credit crisis had limited impact of 33 million, lower real estate valuations have negative impact of 116 million. But profits are up 11% from the fourth quarter of 2007, that's a very good sign. Expenses are under control and risk costs remain low.</p>
          <p>In Retail Banking, profits were up 22% from the fourth quarter 2007, 5% roughly compared to the first quarter of last year. We are pleased that report that operating expense declined in mature markets. But also we have experienced that the margins were under pressure, as customers shift to lower margin term deposits from savings. Oyak Bank adds up 18 million after capital charge and John Hele will explain those capital charges later on in his presentation.</p>
          <p>ING Direct is less 6.1% quarter-to-quarter, but at the same time is kind of a significant rebound compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Interest margin recovered to 86 basis points and the losses in the UK have narrowed when earnings have significantly rebounded in the US as the yield curve has improved.</p>
          <p>On page ten, you can see that there was strong commercial growth using the metrics that we have introduced in the last IR meeting. That the net inflows have significantly increased. You can see the client balance growth is 34 billion; acquisition 20 billion but this was offset partly by market performance and partly by foreign exchange so the client balance from &#x2013; since the 31st of December remains stable. But you can see that the net inflows has been significant in Retail Banking but also in ING Direct and Insurance Asia/Pacific. So I think generally speaking, a pretty good quarter in terms of net customer inflows offset by market circumstances.</p>
          <p>We have also seen the strong growth in insurance sales and value of new business, you can see on page eleven the new life sales were up 11.6% and 23% if we exclude currencies. We continue to experience the shift from traditional to investment linked products and I remind you that Romanian pension fund activities that we have started in September last year have added another 27 million to APE.</p>
          <p>Value of [new] business is that &#x2013; has reached 320 million which is significant number. It's very much higher than last &#x2013; the similar quarter last year and still benefited from the Romanian pension fund value of new business for the first quarter as &#x2013; and also in Latin America we have benefited from the acquisition of our pension business across the continent.</p>
          <p>And this also resulted in solid top-line growth page 12, where you can see the life gross premium income insurance were up significantly compared to last year first quarter and with life premium up 22% and total gross payments were up 10%, 18.5% excluding currency effects which reflected solid commercial performance.</p>
          <p>Remarkably interest result in banks in banking increase 17.2% which is quite significant and kind of a very striking difference with the previous periods due to increased volumes and improvement of interest margin to 1.02% up 8 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>And total underlying income was up 4.3% in the bank. I am also happy to report that the expenses were remain under control, page 13. we &#x2013; recurring operating expenses were up 2.9% for ING Group but down 3.2 in mature businesses while we were able to invest further in growth business where expense go up by 17%.</p>
          <p>Page 14 you can see that our spare leverage has maintained very well despite the market turbulence. And that we now have a spare average of 6.2 billion at the end of the period. And this is remarkable given the circumstances.</p>
          <p>Page 15, you &#x2013; here is a list of the &#x2013; our efforts in the last three months to keep our strategic priorities alive. In the commercial and organic growth category the combination of Postbank and ING bank in the Netherlands is on track. Management is in place. The IT platform is developing. New branches are opened and we are on our way to get that done.</p>
          <p>In Turkey, we are preparing to open more than 50 new retail branches in 2008 and in India we are preparing to rollout 56 new retail branches during the same period.</p>
          <p>Finally, in Japan ING Life Japan was selected by Japan Post as one of the principal product provider both for SPVA and COLI products and that's a good news that we are happy to report.</p>
          <p>In the business portfolio category, we have acquired CitiStreet in the Unites Sates and this is certainly a good acquisition. It's a good strategic fit with our retirement services and this will provide also not only a business on its own that is very attractive but also lot of synergies with retirement services and this providing us very good IT platform to develop our business further. We have divest, as you know P&amp;C in Mexico with some capital gains. And we continue to focus on efficiency, on risk management and on capital management.</p>
          <p>I think jumping into page 17, Looking Forward, you know as we saw in the first quarter, earnings and shareholder's equity are affected by movement in fixed-income securities, equity and real estate markets. And although we have perceived some improvement in equity markets and credit spreads, as I mentioned to you, since the close of the first quarter, investment returns and asset values will likely remain under pressure with the correlated impact on earnings.</p>
          <p>However, with ING's broad client access and product range, strong capital base and solid liquidity position we are remain confident that ING is well positioned to help our customers manage their financial future while generating long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>John, it's yours.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I am going to cover four basic topics this morning, both I'll give you more insight into the profit and the developments and the trends in that and our commercial momentum across the group. I will give you some more insight into how the market downturn affected our returns from equity, real estate and private equity which had a major impact in our insurance operations in particular quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>I'll walk you through how we &#x2013; some examples to give insight on to how we manage our capital, and some of the benefits we have under Basel II as well as our capital charging system we use in the bank. And lastly as we announced at our IR day we are introducing some margin analysis for life insurance so you can see some components of that.</p>
          <p>On slide 20, you can see the new KPIs that we introduced at our Investor Day which takes data that we have throughout all of our information and cuts it down to one page. You can see our client balances as Michel mentioned remained flat. We saw net inflow of 34 billion, which is a very solid number but currency as well as market performance brought that down. You can see the operating expenses though remain under control as you can see in the lower left hand corner, in the round circles is the basis points related to average client balances, so its 96 basis points.</p>
          <p>It's important to note in the footnote that when we do basis points, we are showing the trailing four quarters, so it smoothes this out a bit over time. As we can see this can be up and down each quarter. So we think the trend is important to look at over a trailing four quarter basis. So 96 basis points is still a very solid number relatively to the last few quarters and each of these numbers, by the way, is a trailing four quarter number on these pages.</p>
          <p>Our underlying profit before tax is 67 basis points and that generates a 26% return on economic capital. That's the message for the entire group.</p>
          <p>I'll walk you through each of the units. Insurance Europe, KPIs, with lower profit due to less investment income but expenses to our overall client balances improved further. We're down to 87 basis points in terms of our operating expenses to client balances. The underlying profit before tax is still a very solid 98 basis points, generating a very acceptable 25% return on economic capital.</p>
          <p>Insurance Americas, which saw some of the largest changes due to currency and market performance, the costs are still very solid, 88 basis points relative to the overall point. The trailing fourth quarter number in underlying profit before tax drops to 69 basis points. In the quarter it's about 40 basis points and this relates again only the life insurance earnings to the client balances. We show you the non-life so you can add it to your total, but we don't include that in the ratios and the economic capital is still a 20% return on a trailing basis, so still some volatility in that which I'll cover a bit in a few future slides.</p>
          <p>In terms of Insurance Asia/Pacific, we have net inflow of client balances of 4.7 billion this was offset by negative market performance and negative currency impact. Operating expenses remain roughly level with 58 basis points underlying profit before tax. This generates a 6% return on economic capital. However, we have Taiwan in there that does not currently record earnings, so if you exclude Taiwan, the return on economic capital for Insurance Asia/Pacific is 17.7%.</p>
          <p>Turning to Wholesale Banking on page 24, the client balances had a net inflow of 3.5 billion, which is offset by a currency impact of minus 5.5. Operating expenses of 111 are less than they were a year ago. And 76 basis points is the underlying profit before tax with a 21% return on economic capital.</p>
          <p>Retail Banking had a strong inflow of 15.9 billion net inflow from a growth on the lending portfolio. This is partially offset by some pressure on savings volumes in the Benelux, but Oyak Bank contributed 9.3 billion to these totals and reduced by currency of 3.</p>
          <p>Costs remained, as Michel mentioned, very much under control even though we have a solid growth in here with 54 basis points. Underlying profit before tax, a very healthy 35% return on economic capital. So, Retail Banking did, we think, quite well in this quarter.</p>
          <p>ING Direct had strong net inflows of 7.9 billion in both mortgages and funds entrusted. This is offset by almost a 10 billion negative currency impact. Costs remain very much under control on ING Direct, in spite of still continuing to invest over 80 million this quarter again, in growth initiatives from mortgages, payment accounts and other growth areas. The underlying profit before tax is returned to the unit as the US came stronger and the narrowing loss in the UK, with the return economic capital even after these investments above our hurdle rate.</p>
          <p>On slide 27, you can see a very strong increase in value of new business and it was up across the board. We did have of course the Romanian business that contributed strongly to it. There was also 20 million of expense methodology changes that had an impact of the first quarter VNB in this quarter, that's how we allocate the costs of our greenfield operations. That was 7 million and restructuring expenses and strategic expenses for the group we allocate now to embedded value versus VNB. We think it's more consistent with peers. That is 13.</p>
          <p>The other one-off items, or really opportunity sales really, were some higher sales of ING financial products and in Japan, the COLI business had really a fire sale before the tax law changed at the end of the month. So we had very strong VNB there. Nevertheless VNB is still almost 30% even after these components are taken out so we think a very good performance in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide 28, we have seen now a slight up-tick in our interest margin which came to 102 basis points. This is driven by both Oyak Bank and an improvement in the margin at ING Direct.</p>
          <p>Turning to the impact in the market on our equity real estate funds; first on slide 30, on the left hand side for your reference is our accounting policy under IFRS into have we impair or how we change through fair value through equities so we put this for your reference. You can see we break down for you on the right between impairments, fair value changes and trading losses in the core, what we call, pressurized assets are all listed here is 80 million pre-tax.</p>
          <p>We also list for your reference the other impairments outside of these asset classes for a total of 169. We also give you the price in terms of fair value of the subprime, the Alt-A, and the CDO/CLOs that the current changes in fair value and how these were reflected to equity pre-tax although the net impact on equity is always on after-tax basis.</p>
          <p>The equity capital gains on slide 31, this gives you a bit of a historical perspective. We can see our public equity portfolio the gross return by going back to 2004. We show you the returns, both the pre-tax dividends we received and the capital gains. As Michel mentioned, 2007 was really quite an exceptional year and you can see in the first quarter we took far less equity capital gains than we have historically. The revaluation reserve &#x2013; and this was a major move in the first quarter: went from 5.9 billion down to 3.6 and this flows directly through equity. So that was one of the big changes in equity in the quarter, but we really have much less of a buffer now in our overall equity portfolio to take capital gains and we take that into account as we think about managing this year.</p>
          <p>On Slide 32, which is perhaps a slightly compact slide but &#x2013; complex slide but I thought it would be important to demonstrate this for you. This shows the net DAC unlocking impact. So this is the change in our DAC amortization depending upon the impact of equity markets in our US business, in particular the US VA and retirement services businesses, but we do net this impact against fair value changes in hedges and derivatives on that business. So sometimes there is not an impact even though say in the first quarter a year ago because of these changes in fair values of hedges and derivatives.</p>
          <p>But back in the second quarter of 2007, we have 31 positive because the return was well above in the quarter the basic 225 quarterly return that we assume will be the long term equity market return, but in the first quarter of '08 we had a 100 million pre-tax net impact down in our US business because of this. Now we believe this will average out overt time but when you have a major market move down or a major market move up this will make the earnings a bit volatile.</p>
          <p>We also have on slide 33 as I mentioned earlier, the capital gains and this is really for your reference. You can see how we take capital gains net of impairments here across the board, but we allocate a 3% notional return on those equities is transferred to the business units. Primarily, this is allocated to Insurance Europe. So they have more steady income and less volatility you'll see in the corporate line on an ongoing basis and we have that detailed for you not only in the financial report but in the statistical supplement.</p>
          <p>We also saw quite a movement in property values in real estate. As of the end of March we had 6.8 billion of real estate is revalued through the P&amp;L in insurance is our investment in real estate funds and the accounting for that is recorded each quarter at fair value through the P&amp;L. We also seed money in ING real estate in these funds of 5.9 billion and that is also revalued through the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>You can see the operational results as well as the movement in fair value going back to 2004. You can see we had very dramatic positive revaluations going back to that point in time to only 1.8 billion and this quarter we saw a negative 69, this was primarily in two areas. It was in Australia and Canada that drove &#x2013; in the funds and the investment in those areas so it was a positive 56 of operational results.</p>
          <p>Now, we hold these for the long-term, these are very solid investments. We are one of the top real estate managers in the world, but as we all know, this always goes through cycles and we have seen here in the first quarter part of the cycle down.</p>
          <p>In private equity on slide 35, another key asset class that has had quite above average returns of 13, 24, 16, 15% over the last four years and really has had a dramatic return, we saw that turn down in the first quarter as well for minus 38. And we have these in two major areas: in the Netherlands insurance portfolio almost 1 billion and in the US insurance portfolio of 1.6 billion. Again we hold these for the long-term. We believe this is an outstanding asset class. We've got great returns on these over the past few years. But again, the first quarter saw some negative move in terms of the fair values.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital management, this is really more given for your for your information but just to be clear on this, in the banking side, because we run many of our businesses as a branch and we have subsidiaries, we try to equal all this out so each business can be looked on the same basis, so all banking business pay a capital charge to the Group. The charge is equal to the risk free rate on the adjusted equity in the business unit.</p>
          <p>We take all the capital they earn out of the business, so this corrects for over- or under-capitalization in the reported P&amp;L of the business units and pays a consistent euro swap rate on EC. So we detail this now in the statistical supplement. You will find this for each business. To give you an example, Oyak Bank, the earnings of that separate legal entity, that unit made 52 million in the quarter. We charged out 40 million of what they earned. We gave them back 6 million for a total of 18.</p>
          <p>This is always times the average economic capital in the business, so it's the true risk capital in how we run the business, much more in line now with Basel II versus the capital that may be actually sitting in that legal entity in that entity. But in this way, we can see clearly, across all of our business. We can compare things on an equal footing. You have to be careful when you compare say our Oyak Bank Turkey earnings as we report versus say what other people might report in their Turkish businesses, because they would tend to probably report the earnings including all the capital sitting in that business unit.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital management we do have approval, formal approval now from the DNB [Dutch National Bank] to move to Basel II. This gives the details of moving from 403 to 293, our opening balance on a Basel II methodology. We grew 16 billon in weighted assets under Basel II methodology to end the quarter at 309.</p>
          <p>Historically, we've given numbers and expected risk cost over the cycle of 25 to 30 basis points of average Basel I risk weighted assets. The euro amount is not fundamentally changing in how we think of this because the assets &#x2013; these risk weighted assets are now less under Basel II, the equivalent number is now 40 to 45 basis points of Basel II and this is how we will move forward.</p>
          <p>We show you our trend of loan loss provisions going back to 2002 in fact, in the slide on page 39. You can see that really the 32 basis points gross additions in Basel II is not fundamentally different from the trend we have been seeing throughout all of 2007 and for that matter 2006. The releases were a little less: 17 basis points in Q4, but overall we have not seen an upturn yet in fundamental, issues in terms of the loan loss provisions in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I'll briefly introduce our life insurance margin analysis. We give you the total for the insurance here and in the appendix we give it to you by line of business. I'll walk you through how this is laid out and then give you some commentary on the next page.</p>
          <p>So on page 41, we break it down into investment margin, fees and premium based revenues and the technical margin, subtract expenses to get at the underlying profit before tax from modeled business. We then show you the corporate line and we do have some business we have not yet modeled across the board which will then foot to the 722 underlying profit before tax in total for our business.</p>
          <p>So that's how it foots in total, but in looking at the trend of this on page 42. You can see how the interest margin moves quarter-to-quarter and we give you some comments here on how the investment income moves and the seasonality. Dividends you can see in Q2 which is driven by the Netherlands. The fee and premium based revenues depend upon our asset balances clearly. So if asset balances were down this reduces but offsetting that of course was our strong addition to our assets as well the acquisitions we made.</p>
          <p>The technical margin at 186 is roughly about, we think, about the normal current run rate but that will move up and down quarter-by-quarter depending upon morbidity and mortality and surrender experience.</p>
          <p>Lastly, expenses are impacted by DAC amortization, DAC unlocking as well, so that went up a little bit and also our expansion in Latin America so, we give this to you now in the back for each major insurance business and we think this &#x2013; hope that it will be helpful to you as you dissect our earnings on the insurance business.</p>
          <p>With that I will turn it over to Koos who will run through the Risk Management side.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. On the risk management side page 45, key points just to remind I mean we are accumulating liabilities on our balance sheet and are then investing this so we are more an end investor and what we invest in is relatively high quality securities and most of our investments are of the buy/hold nature, so predominately buy/hold rather than the trading side.</p>
          <p>What've seen now for the first quarter is wider credit spreads and illiquidity. So we have seen a considerable value decline in the Alt-A portfolio, nevertheless we don't see a lot of P&amp;L effects and that is a result of our cash flow testing what we do.</p>
          <p>If you look at the amount of the impairment in detail, it's limited and I'll come back on the credit enhancement and cash flow testing there in this presentation.</p>
          <p>If we move to the subprime portfolio, what we have seen in the markets has especially hit in the lower rated tranches of RMBS which were wrapped in CDOs, but not so much a real hit in the pure RMBSs. If we look at our portfolio we had a P&amp;L loss in total of 33 million with 7 million of which was in the trading books and 26 million was in the investment books in predominately in the Insurance US. If you look at the portfolio we did see credit migration for 475 million has been downgraded so from AAA to AA section predominately.</p>
          <p>In that sense we are not alone there because if I compare ourselves in the graph with the ABX tranche, so that is the index, what you see in the ABX home equity AAA index that only 10% of AAA are left in there. Our portfolio is still 75% AAA. So in general it's a good portfolio but it also explains a bit why our price performance is a bit better than what we see with the ABX.</p>
          <p>What we like to look at bit further is more the credit enhancement and compare that with the pipeline losses in our portfolio, and then if I look at our portfolio what you see is the current amount of pipeline losses is 8.7%. And what we mean by that is, if we take the 60 day delinquencies in our portfolio and if we assume that on all of these they are going to default and on all of them we're going to lose basically 50%, then you end up with an 8.7% current pipeline loss.</p>
          <p>If we compare that with our credit enhancement, which are buffers and those are 30.3%, then you still see a reasonable buffer in there. Why did this credit spread, this buffer move up? One of the biggest explanatory factors there is the fact that some of the underlying mortgages in the pool are prepaying, so that means that the principle amount is lower, so the absolute amount of credit enhancement goes up.</p>
          <p>If I compare this portfolio with what the anticipation from S&amp;P and Moody's is in terms of losses, there we are still looking at 18, 19% final loss of our 12 to 24, then this credit enhancement still looks reasonable and intact.</p>
          <p>Let me see, let's move over to the Alt-A portfolio. If you look Alt-A on page 48, we see that we have a portfolio of in the US Insurance approximately 3 billion and the main portfolio is in ING Direct that is 19.3 billion. Just to give you a quick update on the ratings of Alt-A, our Alt-A portfolio is predominantly AAA and we have seen over the first quarter, we've seen some credit migration for 282 million so nevertheless it's still predominantly a AAA portfolio. If we zoom in the Alt-A portfolio a bit further, what you see is on the right hand side the distribution of the valuation of the portfolio. So you see the big bulk is in the 90 to 100% bracket and there is another part, the other half of it is more in the lower valuation section.</p>
          <p>What explains these valuations? There is a few factors which explain valuations. One is the vintage of the portfolio and the second one is the product and to be honest I find the product probably the biggest explanatory factor. So it is the negative amortization mortgages which in general have a bit lower value than the fixed long-dated hybrids or the ARMs and that is what you see back in the values there.</p>
          <p>If you look by the way at credit enhancement so in the table on page 48 you see on the right hand side that the credit enhancement for the fixed and long-dated hybrids is 8.9%, for the Neg. Ams. it is 26% and for the ARMs it is 14.8.</p>
          <p>Also here you see that the credit enhancement is up as compared to the last quarter but this one has a different reason. The reason here is that we use a data supplier who is able to make the distinction between super senior AAA and normal AAA. Please note that if you look at loss absorption, that loss absorption goes first to the AAAs and only then to the super seniors and we found a data supplier index who delivers us better data. So we are a bit more granular on that side and that has a positive effect on this credit enhancement.</p>
          <p>Then moving from credit enhancement to pipeline losses, we make the same type of comparison of course. And what you see for our total portfolio, you see the delinquencies in our pipeline, left hand graph at the bottom are at 5.7%. With a 35% loss given default, we have an estimated pipeline loss of 2% and we compare that with our buffer of 14.8%.</p>
          <p>If we zoom in on the 2006 vintage, in the 2006 vintage and that's why I think years are important in this as well. Since this portfolio seasoned a bit more, you see that you have more delinquencies in your pipeline therefore more estimated pipeline losses, I use the same 35% and therefore if you compare that with the buffer for the 2006 vintage credit enhancement 15% you see that we are still on average covered by 5.5%.</p>
          <p>If we look at the views of final losses have because your estimated pipeline doesn't tell everything, you also look at loss projections from, for instance, rating agencies, and in general we have not have a lot of updates so I still have the S&amp;P who look at fixed final losses 2% hybrids 4% and again 6% and for the rest I don't have a lot of other outlooks which I can use for this comparison.</p>
          <p>If we move to page 50, then let's zoom in on the negative amortization, because these ones, they have a lower value in the portfolio than if I look at the other types of ALT-A mortgages. Just quickly to remind, the negative amortizations, what are they? Those are the mortgages where monthly payments of less than the interest are possible so that means like the outstanding principle can increase. Can that be done endlessly? The answer is no. there is a maximum principle gap and that is either &#x2013; well, depending on the mortgages 115 or 125% and there is also a maximum period at which you can repeat this procedure and that is maximum five years or if you reach that 115, 125 ceiling, that is the time when you go into recost so then the mortgage has to be renegotiated</p>
          <p>That is the product. We have 4.8 billion of these. What is it that we like about it? It's the short duration and it's the high average credit enhancement. And that is the predominant reason why we have these mortgages in the portfolio and if we look at the right hand side at the bottom then you see that the delinquency in this portfolio is 11.2%. If I still use the 35% but I'll come back on that the 35% loss given default, then you still have a 6.7 times buffer as compared to the credit enhancement in this portfolio.</p>
          <p>But what is the case, page 51, if you look at the loan-to-value analysis of the negative amortization? There is two developments which play a role there. The one is of course the principle amount can go up because that is what I explained with the &#x2013; on the previous page. On the other hand, you see house prices going down and the both of them have the effect that your loan-to-value can go up and that is what you see presented on page 51. So, if you look at adjusted loan-to-value and the move from the 2007 and 2006 loan tranches, loan to value moved from 80 and 78 to 91 and 89.</p>
          <p>What does that mean? It means that you could potentially think about higher loss given defaults but if I would quickly for you to make the analysis there; with a loss given default of 50, we would still be covered 4.5 times with the credit enhancement buffer.</p>
          <p>If we move from the Alt-A, just a last issue on that. We have seen a considerable amount of market illiquidity. It's a bit theoretical issue to precisely decompose how much of the price movement due to illiquidity and how much is due to credit. Nevertheless, I'd like to take you through one example there and that is if we take an Alt-A RMBS with the lowest market value in our portfolio, there is one which has a price of 40 and that one that has a credit enhancement of 25%.</p>
          <p>Now, if we draw up a virtual balance sheet and that is what done under, or on the bottom of the page. There we have mortgage pool of 100. We have 75 of AAA RMBSs and we have 25 of lower rated tranches. If we think that the value of this AAA RMBS of 75 is 40, then it basically means that we only think that 30% of the underlying mortgages will be recovered. Because 40% times 75 is 30% of mortgages will be recovered. So that means out of the total 100 of mortgages underlying and a loss given default of 70 that brings us to the amount. Personally, I think that is a very pessimistic scenario.</p>
          <p>Moving further to the CDOs and CLOs, some development on that side as well. On the one hand, we have an increase in our synthetic CDO portfolio and that has a little bit of an opportunistic nature that is in the investment management side in the US. What we have done there is we have written protection on 1.1 billion super senior tranches for corporate credits. 95% of it is investment-grade, 5% high yield. There is no difference between CDOs on corporate credit is that that underlying names are relatively diversified so that's not the same as subprime where you know the underlying is very much exposed to a single type of credit or a single type of housing prices.</p>
          <p>At the same time we reduced our net exposure on CDOs in the Wholesale Banking side and again this is because we where intermediating between a monoliner and a CDO position in the past and last quarter I mentioned to you that this monoliner that doesn't exist anymore or their credit protection is worthless so we had an open loan position in the CDO and that's the one we managed down out of the trading portfolio. So that's why on balance you see an increase in the US investment management business, and you see a decrease in the Wholesale Banking portfolio. Small value declines actually there, but for the rest, only very limited CDOs backed by subprime mortgages.</p>
          <p>If we move to page 54 and we go to the real estate exposure, real estate we have 12.6 billion which is revalued through P&amp;L and we have the other 4.8 billion which is not valued through P&amp;L. So what is done by P&amp;L, you see that in the matrix over there, that is a good split &#x2013; a good diversification between both countries as well as type of real estate. Just to remand you 4.7 billion of this portfolio, is part of real estate investment management so that is seed capital in funds which is part of the Wholesale Bank. 1.1 billion is investments which are part of real estate development also part of the Wholesale Bank and 6.8 billion is part of the US Insurance investment management side.</p>
          <p>So 12.6 billion there, relatively unchanged, 4.8 billion is not done via P&amp;L and again that is a real estate development portfolio of 1.9. It is the insurance company who has 0.8 billion in minority share interest and partly it is property in our own use.</p>
          <p>Moving to the commercial mortgage backed security side, commercial mortgage backed security, 10.1 billion is the total amount and I'd like to zoom in a bit on the &#x2013; especially the US portfolio, the 7.8 billion. What you see in the US is &#x2013; fair values of 93, so it has decline, still 90% AAA rated. I think we had only 6 million we have on the watch list right now, no downgrades. It is a portfolio with a 26% credit enhancement and a loan to value of 68 and it's well diversified US portfolio. So we have no exposure in any MSA larger than 15% and if you look &#x2013; divide it over the different types of exposure: residential, offices, retail; there is no more than 35% in one type of portfolio.</p>
          <p>If we then move to the next section the liquidity part, as you all know we are collecting customer deposits and customer deposits retail and corporate, that's a big part of our funding portfolio. And that helps us a lot through this current crisis where everybody is looking at longer term funding and we have the availability of a robust customer base. Nevertheless, we do some issuance so what you see is over the last quarter we issued a corporate bond and we issued an extendable senior bond. So from time to time we are in the market but not overly relying on very ambitious long term funding programs. So that's in the nutshell, the key risk points. So relatively big valuation move, relatively limited P&amp;L stroke and our liquidity is quite doing fine.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you Koos. Well let me close after this relatively long presentation with basically what are the highlights? First of all the earnings, yes, are affected by the downturn in financial markets with underlying net profit down 15.2%. Glad to report that we have limited direct impact from credit and liquidity crisis. We're pleased to report that we have strong commercial growth despite competitive and turbulent market and that we can continue to focus on what is important which is customers, organic growth, costs and add-on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, you have read the looking-forward statement in the press release. I think that, yes, we saw in the first quarter earnings and shareholders' equity that are affected by movements in fixed-income securities, equity and real estate markets. We have perceived some improvements in equity markets and credit spreads since the close of the first quarter, because investment returns and asset values will likely remain under pressure in the future with correlated impact on earnings.</p>
          <p>However, we are -- with ING's broad client access and product range, strong capital base and solid liquidity position we remain confident that ING is well positioned to help our customers, manage their financial future while generating long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Well, after this presentation, which I hope was detailed enough, we will take your questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Thank you. Our first question comes from Marc Thiele from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions if I may. Firstly, on the life insurance volume growth, it seems to be extremely strong growth coming through and I was wondering if you could talk about the pricing in particular. According to the &#x2013; your supplement there has been a decline of the internal rate of return in the variable annuity business to 12.8 from 14.2 and I was just wondering if you could talk us through how do you want to manage the business going forward, how aggressive you want to be in the market and if we can assume such a development going forward?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is, related to the investment portfolio, I was wondering if you could provide us with a bit of sensitivity regarding potential write-ups that we may get in the first &#x2013; sorry in the second quarter as some of the credit indices have recovered at the end of first quarter? I appreciate it's very volatile, but maybe you could provide us with a bit of background here?</p>
          <p>And also in terms of potential impairment charges on the equity portfolio, there is always a time lag for these things to show up in the IFRS earnings, but maybe you could make a comment on that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. The first question will be for John Hele for the first part and Tom McInerney for the second part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, well, you have seen we have had very strong volume growth, sales up 23% excluding currencies with really a corresponding increase in total value of new business if you sort of neutralize some of the big one-off changes. So you will see, in certain areas around the world slightly lower IRRs. As interest rates come down, that increases the cost of embedded options and guarantees so that doesn't impact the internal rates of return in some of the product lines. Tom can add some more on that, but we are in particular always focused very much in terms of overall pricing. If we look year-on-year, another big difference is in the US life business, where a year ago we had a quite some negative impact from the reinsurance and cost overruns and that's in much better shape relatively forward across the board. So, I think that's the IRR.</p>
          <p>Tom, do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think John, you did a good job explaining that. We are very pleased overall with the volume increases in the US. We have seen that for a number of quarters in the second half of the last year into this year. The VA business, very strong sales led by the life paid plus. That's all lighter benefits as well as very strong sales in our individual life business particularly our term life products and some of the universal products and they had a very strong growth in our core retirement services which is a small 401K in K-12. I think the drop off in the IRR was primarily related as John suggested to the lower interest rates and just how that has the net present value effect on the derivatives and products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you assuming an increase in terms of the hedging costs, in terms of the rogue annuities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, with volatility going up, the cost of hedges does go up. We clearly look at that. One of the things we may do if that continues would be to raise the pricing on the benefit riders to put those in line with the overall costs of the hedging. We basically charge for those riders the costs of hedging. So, over time if volatility continues to be up, we'd have to look at the pricing on those riders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On investment side, you have maybe what I can if I zoom in on the investment side and anticipated impairments maybe I need to explain the mechanics of the cash flow testing before making a judgment on that, because if you look at the cash flow testing we basically mix and match three components. One is the delinquencies, the second part is the house prices and the loss given default and the third part is the pre-payments which we have.</p>
          <p>It is difficult at this moment to make a forward looking statement on impairments because I don't know house prices movement precisely and I don't know the &#x2013; the only thing what we do know is if I look at the development of the delinquency then I can look at my 30 day plus and 60 day plus and part of it will come in the 90 day bucket which we use for the test. Now that part, you see a modest increase there, but the other factors both prepayments and house prices so which has an impact on my LTVs, I don't have that yet, so it is difficult for me to make a statement on future impairment there in the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was actually more interested in the equity market portfolio, because we are down with equity markets 10% year to-date and there is this IFRS rule with the 20% below market value for six months period and was just wondering if this will have any impact on your equity portfolio in terms of impairments second or third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we actually, you know we went from 5.9 to 3.6 billion in market value above book value in our equity portfolio. We only took 85 million of capital gains net of impairments in the first quarter. Because obviously if we trade an equity, record the gain and then buy it at book value and then the markets deteriorate right after for a period of time, then we have to impair it. So, we're conscious of that and we have seen a bit of a rally in the indices &#x2013; sort of 5% in the US markets in the AEX, about 6% since the end of the quarter. But, we think it's quite volatile so we are going to be cautious on this but this is something we do look at. We don't want to be surprised with a major impairment but it does depend clearly on the equity market. But we do still have this buffer of 3.6 at the end of the quarter, so that we still some buffer above where we are at.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Next question comes from Farquhar Murray of FPK. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Farquhar at Fox Pitt Kelton here, just two questions if I may. Firstly, just on capital. I mean at the full year presentation you obviously said that you had thought about continuing the buyback beyond May, and that given the uncertainty you had chosen against it. We are now in May and effectively you're flagging an increase in potential debt to accrued leverage from 10 to 15%. I'm just wondering if you could firstly just outline the rationale for the change in emphasis there and then secondly, just remind us what your M&amp;A criteria are?</p>
          <p>And then also on credit, thanks for the adjusted LTVs, they're exceptionally useful, actually. With regard to that could you just give us sense of how much of that portfolio is over 100%? And could you also just confirm whether those are year-end '07 figures I presume? And also could you also &#x2013; would we be right in thinking that over 50% of that portfolio is over 90 in terms of secureds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all I would like to just to mention that I don't remember having said that we'll envisage continue the buyback after May as a matter of fact I said exactly the contrary in all my speech by saying that there were no buyback programs which were envisaged and I say that at the first &#x2013; the yearly results because I said two reasons. One, we think that at this period we want to &#x2013; of turbulence in the market, we wanted to keep the capital we have. And second that we might have some opportunities in the market that we want to use. So for those two reasons, we didn't think it was appropriate to extend the buyback after we have finished this program. So I think, just for the record, that's what I think I said repetitively in the last few months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was more the point that you debated it rather than saying...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that I receive other questions asking me if I was doing that but I think that we should not transform questions into what I said or vision to what I said, so I think that is to be very clear.</p>
          <p>Second, I think that in that context you know that we can also access the quasi-capital markets and to some extent that's why we have made a number &#x2013; two issues in quasi-capital. And I think that you could &#x2013; we believe very much this is cheap capital rather than expensive debt and I think we have to look at that from a cheap capital standpoint and it was a good opportunity for us to basically raise capital.</p>
          <p>When it concerns M&amp;A and the M&amp;A criteria, we have not changed at all our criteria. Number one, any acquisition must go through a certain filter. A filter &#x2013; first of all a filter of strategy, does that fit the strategy? And particularly within the context of what we have announced recently. Second, do we feel that we can execute? That means, can we either -- can we make sure that we can maintain and improve income and can we -- what about cost and therefore what is the overall financials of that transaction and that's a clear a second and third filter and finally there is also a filter which is governance. Can we manage this thing and can we find a management structure that can fit within ING structure and culture. So those are the criteria we use. They have not changed and we will continue to use them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to answer the question on the 10 to 15% we have been spending some time looking at our diversification across the Group and I think we even previewed last May at our Investor Day, or April talking about that we believe we've got 15% overall diversification benefit across the Group. So but we don't really want to run all the time in all cycles to be at a full 15%. We think 10 is an appropriate conservative target. But at times when opportunities present itself or if we hit really tough times in volatile markets, we are willing to go to 15. We have reviewed this with the rating agencies. They are comfortable with our running the company this way. So we think of it as a range between 10 to 15 depending upon the cycles and where we are and opportunities that may present themselves to us.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. With regard to the loan to values, the question was whether I have a distribution underlying in the Negative Am. showing the &#x2013; whether it was some of it above 100 or some of it under it. I will have to update you on that later because I only have for you on that 4.8 billion portfolio the averages split out over '06 and '07 which is 91 and 89%. But the breakdown I don't have it at this moment in the different loan to value classes.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Just a quick one then. Could you give us an indication of where you think ING is taking market share and where the other banks may be pulling out or pulling back? Where do you think ING is taking advantage of this? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well what we see certainly in Dutch, Benelux market is that for instance in Postbank we are seeing a clear inflow of business and clients and that's good. I think that we see that both on the retail side, but also partly on the wholesale side, we &#x2013; our ability to get more primary relationship in the corporate client side is clear. We are by the way hiring a number of people from our friendly competitors to reinforce our troops. So, I think we take advantage of that in the Benelux.</p>
          <p>I think in the US we see that ING Direct is doing very well both in savings and mortgage. And ING Direct in Germany in mortgage, so I think that we are taking market share in most location. I think that the big challenge in taking market share is &#x2013; today taking market share in assets is pretty easy, okay, because a number of our competitors have expressed the fact or in reality reduced their appetite for credit. This is very clear in the wholesale side and this is very clear in leveraged finance and in other activities but it's also clear in more traditional mainstream retail business and mortgage. So I think that and we have not reduced our appetite. We are interested as in the past.</p>
          <p>So that clearly over the rest of the year will certainly make a difference. So we are relatively confident from that standpoint. I think that also what I feel is very important is that we have kept to the market a very consistent view about our appetite for business and assets. For instance we have throughout the cycle when things were doing very well, we have kept discipline in our credit distribution and we have been very careful not to be too lenient at the time. So we don't need to change our policy today. Same thing in mortgage, we keep our policy, our credit policy or our approach consistent over the cycles.</p>
          <p>I have seen so many competitors being very aggressive for six months and then stop and go and stop and go. I don't think you can manage a large institution like this by doing stop and go. So you need to be consistent and that is more important than anything else.</p>
          <p>At the same time, that not too much assets would come to us, we have to be careful to exercise the same discipline and not all of sudden to be overtaking bad assets from someone else.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Small reporting question. I see that risk weighted assets are not disclosed anymore by division. Will that come back I can understand that there is no difficulty with Basel II but it's a useful number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we will be a little bit more than happy to provide an additional line in this report I think</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>WE give you risk weighted assets by business line so Retail Banking, Wholesale Banking and ING Direct. We give you economic capital by business unit. Basel II runs off of economic capital and you solve backwards for it across the board and it's a great deal of work to run these models to calculate everything out so you can solve backwards from risk weighed assets and tie it all back together again so, we're giving you it as a reference point in total basis, but really we're making the shift internally and we hope you will too to look at &#x2013; focus on the economic capital by business units across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But the risk weighted assets were disclosed in the past and it's let's say an objective number while economic capital is a more subjective number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but under &#x2013; well, I wouldn't call it subjective because we've had D&amp;B review these models left, right and center and approve us for Basel II compliancy. Risk-weighted assets under Basel I is a formula-based system. It's simple to calculate tied into your balance sheet. Risk-weighted assets in Basel II is developed from the economic capital from the models that we calculate, so it's a different way of coming about getting these. And it is driven off of the economic capitals and those are detailed, reviewed and solid numbers as my good friend Mr. Timmermans will tell you in terms of the amount of work he has done to get all this reviewed and approved and working with our central bankers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions. Talking &#x2013; going back to the questions that you were sort of talking about with capital, how worried are you about your 8.3% Tier I ratio at the bank? It's obviously come down a lot and how much will this restrict your asset growth? What will you do to alleviate this maybe through hybrid debt issuance?</p>
          <p>Second question is the economic capital in the Insurance Europe business fell quite a lot. I think you alluded to it at the beginning. Is this because you've actually sold out in Insurance Europe of private equity and reduced your exposure to some of these risky assets or is it just because of the decline in market value of them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me &#x2013; just me first of all, make a comments and before I pass it to my colleague here. You know in the bank the Tier 1 ratio declined because we made &#x2013; we upstreamed about 2 billion &#x2013; 2.5 billion of capital from the bank to the group into &#x2013; for available at the group level, so I think this was managed that way. So that ratio did not decline because of any other factor but this. John, do you have any other comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, also the equity securities reduced in that ratio about 800 million in the bank equity investments. The debt securities does not impact the Tier 1 ratio. But when we manage capital as a group we want to maintain good ratios in insurance and banking but we don't want excess capital in those legal entities. We want it up and available for the group for various general purposes. So we are not worried at all on our ratio and you know we think our core Tier 1 and our Tier 1 are very appropriate in terms of our overall capital structure. The second question, I'm sorry...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's economic capital in Insurance Europe, you both mentioned already the root causes. One is we removed some of the equity from insurance to the corporate line and second is equities went down in value and that has a reducing effect on the economic capital as well. So those are the two biggest explanatory factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's clear, thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question from Christopher Hitchings of KBW. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much indeed. Couple of issues. Can you take us a little bit behind the very good trading profits you have in the Wholesale Bank in the quarter? How they were achieved and give some ideas of what they're likely to be going forward?</p>
          <p>Can I also &#x2013; again, on net assets clearly I know you don't like giving figures that are more recent than the end of March but &#x2013; and given the significant reduction in credit spreads, rise in equities and yet fallen interest rates we have had since the end of March, some sort of feel of where you think net assets today are relative to end of March would be jolly useful.</p>
          <p>And sort of &#x2013; ING Direct, Japan can you give us an update on where you are on that development?</p>
          <p>And Oyak Bank were somewhat forward in the press recently about losing business from the Army; could you give us an update on what impact that is likely to have? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's Michel here. I think in the Wholesale Bank indeed we have relatively good results especially if you exclude the real estate activities and the mark-to-market or revaluation of the portfolio. I think I would make a first global remark. I mean it should not be a surprise that Wholesale Bank at ING is not as affected than any other bank because we structure Wholesale Bank not to be an investment bank, okay and to be an asset generator and to have a solid base ongoing base and so I think we are less &#x2013; we're less exposed in terms of revenue streams to all sorts of capital market transactions like most other wholesale investment banks. So I think that's the first comment; it's probably less exciting when things are doing very fast, but it's probably better when things are slowing down like it is today and it's also more fitting with our strategy. So that's the first comment I would do.</p>
          <p>The second comment I would say is that the market circumstances have given up a very good environment for financial market in the first three months. So you had probably a little bit more than usual results in the financial markets. And this volatility might stay for a while so that's also good looking for the future. So that's the first comment I would make on that. And I'll let &#x2013; John do you want to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, Chris we have a very large balance sheet and a lot of investments around the world in many different currencies and at various interest rates and I am always cautious to give off proper quarter end valuation numbers because Credit spreads have narrowed which will have a very solid impact on our portfolios, interest rates at some durations have actually risen a little bit in the US, on the short durations it has gone down. We have also seen currency movements up and down, rallying up and down so it &#x2013; I just don't like to give off-quarter information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe Chris what I can add in financial markets first quarter things which went well for sales, increasingly people see there as a good counterparty so that helps. Second is if I look at emerging markets, I mean markets have not been doing bad there. Third thing is if I look at interest rate derivatives we are in general we are long out of the money puts and calls. So in a market where you have some volatility we do make some money, so those are the biggest factors not on the credit side in trading that's where we in general don't make a lot of money. But it's interest rate derivatives, it is sales and it's emerging markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Comment on Oyak Bank, Chris, when we negotiated the Oyak acquisitions, we knew that there was a portfolio of basically the way it works is that Oyak in the past was basically tendering of course the ability to have either branch or ATM machine close to the military bases in Turkey which are primarily across the country and we knew that very much, we knew that the tender would come from time to time and we basically also knew that first of all this business leave us with not that profitable business and relatively small in terms of profit it looks big in numbers but in reality the profits are pretty small. In our models we basically assumed that we will lose that business as we were buying Oyak Bank and as a matter of fact there have been some tenders in the recent weeks. We have lost some, and by the way we have win some also. But overall our acquisition model assumed that we would lose all of those. So for us it was not at all a surprise, I think that if it was in the press in Turkey it's because I think that in the context of the politics there, it's &#x2013; it was probably a useful thing for them to highlight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Chris there was a &#x2013; I think there was a press report that talked about a very large number but the amount that is the truth is 2.5% of our total deposits are armed forces personal accounts and most are pretty small, so it's really not an issue at all in terms of our pricing and our growth across the board and the number that is in the Turkish press is false and not correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a side on that, there have been some changes in interest rates on credit cards in Turkey as well, do those impact Oyak Bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As a matter of fact I think I should look into the details of that question to make sure, but I think we are now in the process of as a matter of fact looking at our card business and what kind of basically supply area we are going to take so in relative terms we are not that big in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's a core thing and we partnered with others who are larger in this, so it's not an issue at all for us and there are several vendors that we are discussing with.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Dick Harryvan here, on ING Direct Japan, we have gone back on a very I would say Japanese rigorous testing program of all systems and procedures which is progressing well now, in close cooperation also with the regulator there so, we don't expect any surprises really going forward. It's going to take &#x2013; it will be after the summer before we actually launch so it's a very rigorous program as I mentioned not only negative reporting of deficiencies but also positive evidence &#x2013; that's the Japanese way of testing which takes a bit more time than we are accustomed to.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Nick Holmes [Lehman Brothers].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I had three questions, please. The first one is on your loan losses. You said there was a fall in releases but that the credit environment isn't deteriorating, just wondered do you expect these releases to stabilize at this lower level or could they fall further? And could give us an update as to your overall assessment of where you expect the net provision to &#x2013; when you expect the net provision to rise back up to this average level of 40 to 45 BPs which still seems a very big difference from your current experience? Perhaps it would be good to start with that first question and then I'll move on to others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Nick, it's Koos here. If you look at the releases one of the things what you do see is a lower amount of releases but that clearly has to do with the total stock of provisions and that stock -- total stock of provisions also partially due to the IFRS methodology has gone down so in generally, yeah we do expect lower releases for the next quarters as well and its only once you start increasing your provisions again that a period later, you start to get bigger releases. But for the movement, the expectation is lower releases going forward and that's how it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the cycle I think history had shown it's correlated or somewhat correlated to the economy. Most of our major exposures are in the Benelux economies in the Wholesale Banking side, which is the most sensitive of the ones; the Retail and ING Direct are much more steady through the various cycles. But at the Wholesale side, they can have the bigger swings. We haven't seen a deterioration yet in the economies here in the Benelux. I think most people are calling for a bit of a slowdown in the economic growth within Europe as we look to the next year, but it appears to be quite gradual so I would think that this will slowly trend up over time, but until Europe hits major slowdown and in particular the Benelux, we won't see it reaching the higher point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michel here. I think also I urge you commenting about 40, 45 basis points, I would like to turn to Koos because it looks like you have a very high number in mind there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, but maybe we were the biggest &#x2013; one of the biggest beneficiaries in the terms of risk weighted assets following Basel II. I think, John, we went from 400 billion risk weighted assets to 300 billion in basically the matter of the start of '08. So it's more a matter of where we divided through than that it's the amount of loan losses.</p>
          <p>I don't know if you want to add John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so it's the old 30 to 25, 30 that we had before on Basel I. It's now at a different level particularly the numbers are 800 basis points higher for ING Direct and for Retail Banking because their balances went down but I think in terms of modeling this forward, Nick, I am not sure exactly how the economies going to happen but I think we think barring a major downturn in the European economy, we see a much slower rise in terms of this provisions. And sharply going up to the 40-45 level in the short-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, does that mean that you could possibly revise downwards this average level? I mean if you really don't see a loss of credit deterioration at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this is a complex question because never &#x2013; what I normally do is we have our credit risk models and with that modeling we calculate a loan loss provision and that's a sort of fixed basis on how we do it and there we calculate a more long-term average where we move to, whether that is 40 &#x2013; 45. Technically, speaking I know that you know the end of the cigar box calculations still so far, have been proven right at lower levels. I find it difficult to see to what extent at what speed will we grow in to this 40-45. I mean I can't give a clear answer on that. For me it's only the very long-term basis. It is more 40-45.</p>
          <p>But Nick, for the sake of clarity I just want to make sure that we understand each other here. We have always said 20-25 basis points of 400 billion risk-weighted assets. Which correspond if I understand &#x2013; if we have now 300 billion of risk-weighted assets with Basel II which corresponds, nothing changed, to about 40 basis points. I think that we all understand that. So there is no change in the economic reality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Make sure we understand each other and that is the understanding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's completely understood. I was just sort of trying to get a feel for what your real expectations are. I mean it's over the cycle, this average level and therefore, we're looking at &#x2013; I don't know, around about 5 years or something like that. I mean, the lending book isn't that long-dated is it? So I was just interested in your thoughts about when it could be possibly revised?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would like just to say though I think that you have to make a big clear difference of what was ING portfolio five years ago, six years ago and what is ING portfolio today. I think in the last five years we have done a lot in terms of risk management particularly on the credit side and we've revised our policy, we have revised concentration, we have revised our processes, we have revised our policies, the culture has changed so, we have moved out of a number of developing markets, concentrating more on Benelux getting less in all sorts of &#x2013; getting far less, it not any more stopped lending to projects brought by the investment bank. So I think we have changed dramatically the overall way we were lending money. So I think that it would be dangerous for you to compare what historically ING has done five or seven years ago and what is it doing today. That would be a complete &#x2013; it might be a long cycle but also the fundamentals of our company are completely different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Very good. Next two questions. Just one on the interest margin. You said the seven BP change was three from ING Direct and two from Oyak; I wondered what the other two was?</p>
          <p>And then last question was just on DAC unlocking. Just out of curiosity wanted to ask again why do you have this mark-to-market basis to your DAC in the States versus the mean reversion which I know other companies practice because it gives you this volatility and that doesn't seem desirable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll &#x2013; It's a good question I'll turn to Tom for that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think, Nick, on the DAC unlocking we decided in 2002 to go to a full DAC unlocking based on the difference between our long-term assumption which is about 2.2% per quarter versus what the reality is. Other companies do use mean reversion or a quarter approach. We think our methodology, as long as you understand the volatility, over the long run will be fine, but you do have the quarter-to-quarter variations. We do look at that and continue to evaluate it but at this point our view is that, the way we do it is consistent with what's going on at that point in the marketplace and that over time it will average out.</p>

          <p>Nick on your question which are the two basis points it's primarily in Wholesale Banking where sometimes the products we sell are classified as other income and sometimes there in the interest margin. This time the way the trades worked it was in the interest margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And then just as a follow-up question to that. Could you give us an update on your thoughts about where the interest margin is going overall, the pressures that could exist on it this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We are &#x2013; that's a very good point. We have seen some pressure in Retail Banking side, particularly among savings deposits, but we have various products that are being very competitive against that. We have seen a widening of the margin of course in ING Direct USA so I would say we hope it will be in and around this level. I don't expect a major increase in it with the flat yield curve still in Europe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Beno&#xEE;t P&#xE9;trarque, Landsbanki Kepler please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Beno&#xEE;t P&#xE9;trarque from Amsterdam. I've got a few questions. First one on the risk-weighted assets, I would like to know whether in the future you might be able to give distinction between the increase in risk weighted assets due to organic asset creation and increase due to changes in Basel II model output. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second one is on the credit loss, especially on the retail side, are you taking macroeconomic development into account in your estimates because I &#x2013; I think that you're basing yourself on Basel II compliant models and is that especially historical PDs and LGDs and I am curious to know why are you able to take macroeconomic development into account?</p>
          <p>Last question is on the negative amortization; I would like to know what is the duration of the negative amortization portfolio and also whether &#x2013; I was wondering, if you are able to take into account in your valuation whether homeowners in the US are getting closer from the recost percentage? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Koos Timmermans will take those questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If we look at the negative amortization to start with the last question, this one has very short-term duration. This is actually the very much the reason why we are interested in this portfolio, it is the credit enhancement and the short duration, that because remember that this is for ING Direct and in ING Direct we are collecting savings money and we want assets to reprice a little bit with the yield curve. So that is the reason why we bought the Neg. Am. portfolio, so very short term duration in short.</p>
          <p>If I look at your first question that is like can we give a breakdown indeed because of either production growth of model changes or parameter deterioration, this is indeed one of the things we are working on right now. And that is something which we'd like to disclose because indeed otherwise it's difficult to see like why do numbers go up. If you at the macro numbers, yeah on an annual basis we are updating our PDs, LGDs, and ERDs and partially it is credit migration but we do take macro numbers there into consideration and I don't know Peter Stahl I mean on the credit side if you would like to add something in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Basel models are obviously based on historical seven year past data. We do take credit migration into account and obviously we look at changes in values. In itself, macro economic data like gross national product or interest rate are both taken into account into the actual credit growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so you did take macro economic developments in Q1 in your PDs, and LGDs...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you take your credit migration into account when you rate your customers so the actual situation, economic situation of your borrower, of your house price but the models itself are based on historical data as per the Basel directions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody, I just had one question. I was wondering have you been having conversations with the rating agencies or your regulators, about your ratio of Tier 1 bank equity to bank assets. I think that's about 2%, which is I think fairly low by the standard of most of the European banking or European banks. I just wondered what your thoughts on that were.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you look at it just from the outside, we've had this question come up from time-to-time, but I think we've been validated with the economic capital calculations under Basel II, which are well below our Tier 1 capital and we've been doing economic capital for long-time. We've now had all of our models looked at and reviewed. We've had them audited for SOX. So we are very comfortable with our numbers and that's a good measure of risk. Again it's a model, so we have buffer even above that to make sure we have a very prudent equity Tier 1 capital. But much on our balance sheet many of our assets are repos that are matched across the board. We have very high quality portfolios in all of our investment sides. And we don't have a lot of the higher risk weighted assets or the higher economic capital driven assets that perhaps many other banks have. So that's really a fundamental different between us as really a retail savings bank across the world and other bank structures.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I was wondering if you could give us any indication of what the growth in US life sales has done in the VA market has one to your market share and ranking in that market?</p>
          <p>And second question would be, I found slide 33 is very helpful on the movement between the corporate line and the insurance segment for equity gains and I was wondering if you would consider supplying similar for the private equity and real estate which has also obviously heavily impacted the results, if you can?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the US life particularly I think you asked for the ranking for variable annuity. In the full year 2007, if you take the rating for the full year we moved up from number 12 to number 8, but in the fourth quarter of 2007, we were number two. And my sense is that we will be somewhere in that range in the first quarter. The Limerus statistics are not out yet. But I would think that we would be in the range of where we ranked in the second quarter. So, we clearly have picked up market share in the VA market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is John. In terms of the private equity and real estate we actually, it's not at the corporate line, it's actually in the exact of our business. But in the statistical supplement, under the investment income side we break down for you the components of that in the breakdown of investment and other income for each line of business, we break it down between realized gains and losses on debt equity, private equity, real estate and non-trading derivatives. So you will find that for every line of business in detail in our statistical, the group statistical supplement. What's on &#x2013; every section has that section, it's typically the last page of a section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That wouldn't show the notional long-term estimate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is only the public equity portfolio where we do the notional income on and average it out in the corporate line, private equity income, real estate income is directly in the business line that holds those assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is no usage of a notional income for those two investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough, it just maybe useful if you did expand the treatment so that we could see an underlying trend if that means anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that &#x2013; I think although in equities, public equities you have a long track record to be able to judge that, I think that for the others it's more of a judgment call but I think that we will think above that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our last question from Jaap Meijer of Dresdner. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Jaap Meijer from Dresdner Kleinwort. Question on your hybrid Tier 1, it's now 20% of your Tier 1. Would you see room to actually increase this, because one of your peers is maybe pushing that to 33% or even 50%? So what is your understanding of the allowable hybrid's proportion by the central bank the Dutch National Bank? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well our target is 25% and we view that as an appropriate target taking into account the rating agencies and our regulator, but I won't speak to how other people view their structures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Sometimes, flexibility comes from necessity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a nice view Morrik, your understanding the hard limit is up to 50% and if you go over 25% you will have actually to have the approval of the central bank right? Am I right in that? To go 25% you need approval and 50% is the hard and the maximum level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have never discussed it that way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well I would like just to as closing remarks I just would like to repeat what I said before is, yes, our earnings are affected by the downturn in financial markets and investment returns, but we have a limited direct impact from credit and liquidity crises, strong commercial growth as evidenced by value of new business and client balances and we continue to focus on our clients and on making sure that we contain cost and also that we go after good add on acquisitions that make strategic and financial sense. I am sure that we will have other opportunities to talk.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for joining us this morning and I'll see you next. Bye-bye.</p>
