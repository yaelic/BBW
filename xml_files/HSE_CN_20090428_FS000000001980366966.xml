          <p>Thank you, Patrick. Good afternoon to everyone. The global economic turmoil has continued into the first quarter of 2009. Despite the weak economic conditions, Husky continued to achieve positive results in earnings and cash flow.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter, sales and operating revenues were 3.7 billion, compared with 5.1 billion in the first quarter of 2008. Earnings were 328 million or $0.39 per share, down from 888 million or $1.05 per share in Q1 of 2008.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations of 565 million or $0.67 per share, was down from 1.5 billion or $1.81 per share in the same quarter of 2008. Cash flow in the first quarter of 2009 was negatively impacted by 131 million due to the cash tax installments related to 2008 earnings.</p>
          <p>Earnings in the first quarter of 2009 were approximately 100 million higher than in the prior quarter. Upstream financial performance continues to be affected by lower realized prices whereas the Downstream performance rebounded from the prior quarter as crude oil prices stabilized, generating 53 million in net earnings.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, Husky's production averaged 342,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with 2008 first quarter production of 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Total crude and natural gas liquids production was 250,000 barrels of oil per day in the quarter compared to 252,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2008. Natural gas production averaged 551 million cubic feet per day.</p>
          <p>Total debt at the end of the quarter was 2.26 billion compared with 1.96 billion at the end of 2008. Currently Husky has available unused committed facilities of $1.4 billion. Husky's average long-term debt to maturity is 12.2 years with the next maturity payment of U.S. 400 million due in year 2012.</p>
          <p>Debt to cash flow was 0.5 times compared with 0.6 times at March 31, 2008. Debt to capital was 14% compared to 20% at the end of the first quarter in 2008.</p>
          <p>Husky's capital program continues to be focused on those projects with the highest potential returns and future growth. In the first quarter, capital expenditure was 720 million, down from 868 million in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to advise that Husky's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share for the quarter. In the first quarter Husky made significant progress on some of its major projects. Work continues on the development of the Sunrise Oil Sands Project. Sunrise has entered into an optimization stage to simplify the project's scope and to take advantage of the recent downturn in the demand for goods and services.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, approval of the project's application amendments was received from the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board and Alberta Environment. Husky's proposed use of carbon dioxide, CO2, for enhanced recovery of heavy oil received support from the Government of Canada. The project involves the capture and processing of carbon dioxide and injection into heavy oil reservoirs.</p>
          <p>The goal of the project is to increase recovery of heavy oil while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from Husky's Lloydminster complex. To date Husky has recovered about 7% of the 9.3 billion barrels of discovered petroleum initially in place, PIIP, on its heavy oil leases.</p>
          <p>Offshore Eastern Canada, development of the North Amethyst satellite tie-back continues. The satellite tie-back development remains on schedule for a late 2009 or early 2010 start up.</p>
          <p>Husky and its partners have made a hydrocarbon discovery at the Mizzen field and further analysis is being conducted on the results to determine its commercial potential.</p>
          <p>Offshore China, the West Hercules deepwater drilling rig, drilled and tested the first appraisal well, Liwan 3-1-2, on the Liwan discovery. The well tested at an equipment restricted rate of 53 million cubic feet per day with indications that future well deliverability could exceed 150 million cubic feet per day. The rig is currently preparing to test the second appraisal well, Liwan 3-1-2 and 3-1-3 and, once complete, the rigs will move on to drill further exploration wells.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, Husky has contracted the Transocean Adriatic XI shallow water rig to drill two exploration wells on the East Bawean II block in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Terrance will now talk to you for Midstream and Downstream divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Performance in the Midstream and Downstream divisions improved over the fourth quarter of 2008. Midstream infrastructure and marketing earnings totaled 56 million, compared to 72 million in the first quarter of 2008 when commodity prices were much higher, but were up 28 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Upgrader earnings in the quarter were 36 million, down from the same period in 2008 due to a 41% drop in the upgrading differential resulting from the relative strength of heavy oil prices in the quarter. Upgrading throughput improved in the quarter to 76,200 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>The U.S. Refining segment generated 23 million in earnings in the first quarter compared to 8 million in the first quarter of 2008. The Refining margin for the segment increased to $12.86 per barrel from $6.91 per barrel in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our Canadian Refined Products division contributed 30 million of net earnings in the first quarter, in line with the same period in 2008. Asphalt sales were particularly strong at 36 million, almost double those in the first quarter of 2008. The Lloydminster Asphalt refinery throughput was 28,800 barrels per day for the quarter, an all time high.</p>
          <p>I will now pass the call back to John for his concluding remarks.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Terrance. Despite the continued weakness in commodity prices, Husky is pleased with the first quarter performance. Our balance sheet and financial position remain strong. The company is well positioned for the challenges environmental ahead.</p>
          <p>For the remainder of the year, Husky will continue to focus on safe and reliable operations and the development of its strategic capital projects.</p>
          <p>Back to you Patrick.</p>

          <p>Thank you, John. That concludes the formal part of the call. We would be pleased to answer any questions that you might have now. I will now turn it back to the conference operator.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question today comes from Stefanie Leshaw of Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I was wondering with the cash on hand during &#x2013; what was the variance in the cash on hand during the quarter and why cash dropped so low and if you guys are comfortable continuing to function with cash at these new low levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stefanie, John here. And your question is about the cash flow. Because Husky made a huge record profit in 2008, we actually achieved $3.7 billion in cash &#x2013; in earnings. So the cash position, we have to pay the cash tax in 2009. The first quarter, if you see the detail, we actually paid close to $700 million to the government that's why that affect our position. The actual calculation is shown in our announcement. We actually paid more than 130 million additional.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also to &#x2013; have you guys looked at potentially coming to market to shore up liquidity? I mean, you guys do have a very strong balance sheet, but I was curious if you guys thought about coming to market at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Stefanie, it's Alister here. Yes, Stefanie, we are looking at that and we would expect that just to maintain a financial flexibility, we do have a strong position in balance sheet as you've noted, but to maintain a financial flexibility going forward with any opportunities that may come up, we'd probably be accessing the market to get some additional liquidity.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Andrew Fairbanks of Banc of America-Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good afternoon, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. John, I just wanted to give you an opportunity to enlighten us a little bit on some of the reports around the notion of spinning off some of the Asian assets into separate vehicle. How do you weigh the sort of pros and cons of that and any more specifics that you might have around the timing or catalysts in the market that would trigger that event?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew that is what we announced in the annual general meeting. The South East Asia is a core area for us. So far the Liwan discovery has four to six trillion reserve backup. And with all the development in coming these few years that will be quite a capital program close to above $4 billion to $5 billion development. So we look at the value of Husky Energy is a potential resource has not been properly reflected. We look at the best way to create shareholder value. We look at some of the non-financial analysts indicate, maybe around three to $5 impact. So, we want to &#x2013; firstly, we want to get the best position for development. Secondly, we don't want to track down on Husky's capital or cash flow commitment. Thirdly, in the Southeast Asia, Stock Exchange do have one or two lots higher in compared with this area.</p>
          <p>Fourthly, it is very close to the consumer market. We can command very comfortable higher price, because the gas is supplied to the southern part of China, especially to Hong Kong, Kwangchow, and other <mark type="inaudible" /> area. So we looked that as a hub for the future and more important to grow the company, this is one of the best ways to focus on how to spin off the Southeast Asia position. All the shareholders across would be <mark type="inaudible" /> benefited from this spin-off. We don't really focus on the track down of Husky's performance, because even with an IPO that would be for capital finance and all these things will be in place.</p>
          <p>And regarding the timing, due to this economic crisis, everybody look at a down cycle, but for Husky, we are looking ahead of the curve. We have positioned ourselves. We put all the reserve count quantification, operational, financial, cash, everything in place. Hopefully, we should be in the position by the end of the year when we receive order regulatory and joint partner agreement and especially some of the box assumption as soon as the economic condition improve or in the position to be normal or whatever you call that normal lease, we should be the first one to take advantage on market position. I look at that would be some time in 2010. Would that give you the answer, Andrew?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think so as you would look at kind of the strengths of the Asian equity markets and normalization of credit spreads before you would feel comfortable going ahead and doing that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
