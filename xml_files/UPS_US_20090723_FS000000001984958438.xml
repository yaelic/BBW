          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  My name is Steven, and I'll be your conference facilitator today.  At this time, I would like to welcome everybody to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period.  Please note we will take one question and one follow-up from each participant.  Thank you.</p>
          <p>It's now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Sir, the floor is all yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today.  Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, are ready to provide insight into the Company's second quarter results and our expectations going forward.  Before I turn the program over to them however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language.</p>
          <p>Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the Company.  These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2008 Form 10-K and first quarter 2009 10-Q reports.  These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This conference call is being webcast and will be available on our Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>In our earnings announcement today, you'll notice that there was an after-tax charge of $48 million.  This non-cash charge was for the remeasurement of certain foreign currency obligations, which did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  It had no impact on operating income or cash flow.  However, it did reduce diluted earnings per share by $0.05.  Excluding this charge, EPS for the second quarter was $0.49.</p>
          <p>Reconciliation of this adjustment to comparable GAAP measures is explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release this morning.  The schedules are also available on the UPS IR website in the financial section.  When Scott and Kurt discuss second quarter performance, they will refer to results excluding this charge.</p>
          <p>During the question-and-answer session, I remind you that you will be limited to one question and a follow-up.  This will ensure that all will have an opportunity to participate.</p>
          <p>I'll turn the program now over to Scott.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Andy, and good morning, everyone.  On our last call we told you economic conditions for the second quarter would be slightly worse than the first.  And UPS's performance would reflect those conditions and that's what happened.</p>
          <p>The results we announced today are a clear indication of the tough economic environment.  As you're aware, the rates of decline of some key economic indicators like GDP and industrial production have slowed.  Other indicators like manufacturing and service sector indices are exhibiting signs of improvement.  Most forecasters are saying that we may be at the bottom.  Whether or not we're at the bottom is not the main issue.  What is important is how long we remain here and what type of recovery we well have.  Remember, all these indicators are still well into negative territory, illustrating the challenges that lie ahead.  We will continue to manage the Company under the assumption that the economy will stay at this level until definitive signs of improvement materialize.</p>
          <p>Looking at UPS's results for the quarter, everything played out pretty much as we had thought, with the exception of international volume, which declined more than we had anticipated.  Our cost initiatives are exceeding target levels.  However, these savings were not enough to fully offset the impact of global economic weakness.  Nonetheless, UPS is continuing to be alert and investing in growth opportunities to assure we're ready when economic activity revives.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we expanded our global footprint in Eastern Europe and the Middle East with acquisitions in Slovenia and Turkey.  We also formed a joint venture headquartered in Dubai as a springboard to grow Package, Freight and Contract Logistics services in 21 countries across the Middle East, Turkey and Central Asia.  Turkey has become a vital link in global commerce.  We see it as the transportation bridge between Asia and Europe.</p>
          <p>In the Logistics arena, we established a field stocking location network in India to address critical parts service in that country.  We opened two healthcare logistics facilities, one in the Netherlands and one in Puerto Rico, expanding our global presence in this sector with state-of-the-art certified capabilities to serve pharmaceutical, medical device and biotech customers.</p>
          <p>Prudent investment even in challenging economic times not only helps our customers but it also helps UPS remain positioned to capitalize when trends improve.  We are a company that will weather this recession and emerge even stronger.</p>
          <p>Just after the quarter ended, we released our 2008 Corporate Sustainability Report.  This is the most data rich and global report we have ever produced and it's been well received.  We disclosed both our direct and indirect emissions, a level of reporting that is unusual for our industry.  Because of our integrated network, most modern aircraft fleet and extensive use of the rails, UPS is the environmental leader in the U.S. package delivery industry.  Nonetheless, we have committed to reduce our airlines carbon emissions by an additional 20% by 2020 for a cumulative reduction of 42% since 1990. To us, sustainability isn't just corporate jargon.  It's a commitment to our customers, employees, shareholders, and the communities we serve to remain transparent and follow responsible business practices.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the program over to Kurt, I want to thank UPSers around the world for their efforts and dedication in managing through these tough economic times.  We will not only create better leverage in our operations, but UPS will be a stronger organization when the economy recovers.</p>
          <p>Now, Kurt will provide detail on our second quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone.  Stagnant economic activity around the world negatively affected all of our business units.  Although we exceeded our targeted cost savings, they were not enough to offset revenue declines in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating expense declined almost 10% excluding fuel, and diluted earnings per share were $0.49, in the middle of the range we provided.  UPS is ahead of plan on our cost reduction initiatives and we expect to come in 20 to 25% higher than our initial target.  Therefore, we anticipate realizing between 1.2 to $1.3 billion from our cost control efforts for the year.</p>
          <p>Our compensation and staffing initiatives coupled with our continued productivity improvements allowed us to reduce direct payroll by almost 5%.  This was partially offset by healthcare inflation and increased pension expenses.</p>
          <p>Total block hours in our Airline were down 11%, enabling us to reduce fuel consumption by 14 million gallons.  Our consolidated quarterly margin was 8.3%, which is low for UPS, but is still the best in the industry.</p>
          <p>Now, let's start our review with the U.S. Package operations.  For the quarter, Package volume declined 4.6%, a little more than in the first quarter.  Ground volume was down 5.4% while Air volume was essentially flat with last year and slightly better than in the first quarter.  Let me remind you that the apparent strength in Air volumes is attributable to DHL's exit from the U.S. Domestic market.</p>
          <p>Revenue per piece was down about 8%.  The decline was driven by the reduction in fuel surcharges on Air and Ground products of 24% and 5% respectively.  Lighter average weight per package and changes in product mix also contributed to the decline.  These trends along with the decrease in volume eroded margins.  As we've said in the past, margins in this segment will remain under pressure until economic conditions improve.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we launched the UPS Advantage sales program.  It aims to build awareness among customers of our comprehensive value proposition based on reliability, speed, technology and service.  The current pricing environment continues to be very challenging, driven by the economy and our customers' urgent need for help in reducing their transportation spend, but the pricing environment remains rational.  While we're working with our customers to address their needs, we believe in the value offered in our superior service and reliability and do not compete on price alone.  In fact, our solutions can often reduce overall supply chain cost without necessarily leading to direct price reductions.  As the economy improves, we expect pricing to improve as well.</p>
          <p>UPSers are managing operations well in the face of reduced volume.  For example, labor hours were down almost 7% with productivity improvements across the board.  In addition, miles driven were down 5% and Domestic block hours decreased almost 6%.  The full benefit from these improved operating metrics is being reduced however by a higher direct average hourly wage rate, healthcare inflation and increased pension expense.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding today's weak economy, we have continued with our $1 billion expansion of the Worldport air hub in Louisville.  In early July we announced the completion of Phase I of that expansion, which increased sorting capacity 15% to 350,000 packages per hour.  The final phase of this expansion will be completed next year, bringing our sort capacity to 416,000 pieces per hour.  Maximizing the volume that flows through Worldport allows us to optimize our network, flying fewer but larger and more efficient aircraft.  This is a great example of UPS's long-term strategy.  We're keeping one eye on the economic challenges of today and the other on the opportunities of tomorrow.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to the International segment.  Weakness was apparent in all regions of the world.  Volume declined 5.5% with export volumes down 7.3% and Domestic down 4.3%.  Excluding the impact of the timing of Easter, export volume would have been down about 5%.  Reduced revenue and volume reflect our customers' lower levels of business activity.  In spite of this reduced volume, UPS continues to gain market share in contrast to double-digit volume declines in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Excluding the effects of currency, revenue per piece declined 11.4% as a result of reduced fuel surcharges, changes in product mix, lower weight packages, and volume shifts across global trade lanes.  Despite the reduction in both volume and revenue, operating margin for the segment was 13%.  This is essentially flat with last quarter and only 80 basis points below last year, and it's still the best in the industry.</p>
          <p>Aggressive cost control contributed to maintaining our strong margin.  For example, international block hours dropped almost 16% in the quarter without impacting our service footprint.  And indirect operating expenses declined almost 8%.  As Scott indicated, UPS is committed to controlling our costs while still making the strategic investments that will enable growth when economic conditions improve.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the Supply Chain and Freight segment.  Revenue was down over 23% with all business units experiencing declines.  However, the 7% operating margin reflected successful cost management in each business.  Logistics posted a solid performance with improved revenue management and targeted growth, particularly in the healthcare and high-tech sectors.  Forwarding margins improved as cost initiatives successfully took hold.</p>
          <p>Despite very weak market condition, UPS Freight posted increased revenue, LTL shipments and tonnage over first quarter results.  Effective cost control and productivity gains enabled UPS Freight to break even for the quarter.  This business continues to take market share while remaining disciplined on yields.  Its 1.9% decline in shipments year-over-year was in sharp contrast to severe market declines.  Our no-fee guarantee for both regional and long haul shipments continues to be a competitive advantage and we are also benefiting from leveraging our Small Package sales force and further penetrating the key middle market customer sector.</p>
          <p>This quarter we did mark down certain preferred shares and auction rate securities to their market value.  The write-down was $17 million and is reflected as an offset to our investment income.  In spite of the earnings decline, free cash flow for the first six months of 2009 increased by $195 million over last year excluding the impact of the tax refund in 2008.</p>
          <p>An intense focus on capital expenditures and working capital enabled UPS to generate a total of $2.7 billion in free cash flow.  For the first six months, UPS also invested $671 million in capital expenditures, spent 248 million to repurchase 5.1 million shares, paid dividends of $876 million, maintaining our $0.45 dividend, and ended the first half of the year with 3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities.  Clearly, strong cash flow remains a hallmark of the UPS business model.</p>
          <p>Now for our outlook, we expect business conditions in the third quarter will be similar to those in the second.  In our U.S. Domestic operations, average daily volume should decline at a pace similar to the second quarter.  Operating margin will remain weak due to seasonal trends and the continued challenge of lighter average weight, mix shift and lower volumes.</p>
          <p>In the International segment, export volume is anticipated to decline about 4 to 6% with operating margins similar to the second quarter.  The Supply Chain and Freight segment should see trends similar to the second quarter with operating margins slightly less than last year.  Our ongoing cost control initiatives will continue to provide benefits across all business units.</p>
          <p>Considering all of this, earnings per share should be within a range of 0.45 to $0.55 for the quarter, the same range we provided for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session of our conference.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Our first question will come from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.  Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Gary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Gary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two quick ones here.  On the outlook, Kurt as you talked about business conditions remaining the same, could you talk about what you're seeing and what you expect in terms of weight per package and how that's been trending?  Do you expect that's going to continue to decelerate or just kind of bounce along at these lows, what's kind of embedded there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Gary I think the real theme that we're seeing right now is that the negative trends have stabilized.  So year-over-year weight and product mix are down, but if you look sequentially really over the last three or four months, we're seeing the trend stabilizing.  So, it's &#x2013; we're in a flat period right now, certainly very negative to last year both in trends and statistics but, we don't see any increase in negative momentum.  So weight trends should be very similar to Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gary, I think you just got to look at industrial production too and when it turns and it will at some point in time here in the future, you'll start seeing the manufacturing sector kick in more and that will certainly help weights.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then, secondly on &#x2013; supply chain was surprisingly good for the quarter, you wouldn't have expected that kind of performance after the first or at least I wouldn't have.  Was the variance there that Freight broke even or was it more on the Logistics side and should we be considering this a sustainable level or was there something unique about the second quarter for you there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  It was really improved performance across all three of the primary sectors.  Certainly UPS Freight has done a good job of continuing to have relative momentum.  We've successfully gained share across all sectors, but most notably in the middle market.  And even though pricing is challenging, our revenue per 100 weight after you take out fuel is pretty stable.  So, Freight did show substantial benefits over the last three quarters and the earnings, bringing it back to break-even was important.</p>
          <p>Logistics though has been very successful in the last couple quarters, of tightening its focus.  We think we've created some very unique solutions for high-tech and of course healthcare, which we've talked a lot of about.  And we've been very disciplined in adding capacity just where we know there is good sustainable business that will generate good margins.  So we have seen good results.  We've trimmed down some locations, and really streamlined that business, so you're seeing the benefits of a couple of years of hard work.</p>
          <p>And then in the Forwarding, clearly the growth is challenged, but we were very successful really managing cost in all fronts.  The purchase transportation opportunities are pretty good right now and you've seen other forwarders talk about improving margins in that sector.  But we've also done a pretty comprehensive review of our operating expenses, the number of facilities we need, and our indirect expenses.  So, good cost management on all fronts there helped us to create pretty good profits even in a tough environment.  Having said that, we're not necessarily going to be at 7% margins all quarters, Q3 will be a little more challenging.  We do expect that some of the great yields in Forwarding may tighten up a little bit as rates begin to reverse, but we feel very positive on all three fronts.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of William Greene of Morgan Stanley.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am wondering if we can talk a little bit about your &#x2013; when you talk about your outlook sort of saying, we've stabilized but we don't really see much in the way of improvement.  If this is sort of the new normal, a level off of which we'll have gradual growth, is the network right sized, or is it over-resourced, or how do you think about where you are if this is kind of the level-off which will be for a while?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've still got work to do, Bill.  Clearly, we are not thrilled with the results we had in Q2.  We've been chasing the market down.  We've been making we think some pretty dramatic changes in our network.  Taking block hours down 16% in the quarter for International is a great example.  But, no, if things stabilize at this level, we've still got work to do.  Our network changes and some cases lag.  We are &#x2013; we've still got plenty of opportunities to leverage this expanded Worldport capacity, taking a large number of aircraft out of the air.  So, on all fronts, if it stabilizes at this level, we are going to continue to work real hard because we are not happy with where we are at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Bill I wouldn't call this the new normal.  I think that if you still go back and look at the second quarter, and we've had industrial production drop 13.2% year-over-year, which is a staggering number.  And I guess the issue going into the third quarter is we think that the big drops are over with.  But, we are still going to have tough year-over-year comparisons, but it will come back.  Industrial production will grow again.  And so, this isn't necessarily the new normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's helpful.  And just two quick data questions.  Can you give us B2C growth, what it was in the quarter, and also can you tell us or remind us what the fuel headwind is for the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, B2C was close to breakeven, maybe very slightly positive, which is quite a difference from the double-digit trends we've seen.  And fuel was a bit of headwind in the second quarter.  And, clearly, the third quarter we don't know how it's going to end up, but our guess is it won't be a big factor either way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, you had a tailwind last year from it, you made money on fuel, is that right, just because of timing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had about 90 million in Domestic last year.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Edward Wolfe of Wolfe Research.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Just again on the outlook, when you gave the guidance a quarter ago, you talked about second quarter, which is normally a seasonally better quarter than first, being impacted by the timing of Easter and the year-over-year Easter.  Now, you are giving third quarter guidance and saying it's the same as second which was the same as first.  But, we don't have those Easter issues.  You have more cost savings under your belt, and things seem to be stabilized.  It feels kind of conservative.  What am I missing here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're missing the fact that as you said initially, Q3 is typically one of the weakest quarters of the year, Ed.  And so, certainly, there's challenges.  Europe tends to take a lot of the month off for vacation.  Our trends so far in July show no material uptick in growth.  So, we are cautious, frankly.  We don't think things are getting dramatically worse, but we don't have any confidence that either demand or activity is going to pick up substantially.  And, for that to happen in Q3 which is typically one of our weakest quarters, leads to the guidance that basically those things will offset the Easter impact in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk about the Domestic volumes and export volumes, how they trended from April through July so far directionally in the quarter, if not, if you couldn't give exact numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's that same kind of flat trend we are talking about, that really April was a little distorted because of the Easter impact.  So, April was worse than the following months.  But, if you filter that out, basically we've seen trends across Domestic transactions very negative but steady I guess all the way through the current time.  And, also, internationally, no huge changes in trends, although clearly the overall total International did weaken sequentially from Q1 to Q2.  But, within that, we still see that relatively stable also.  So, we are sitting here at this bottom, and that's why as Scott said, the real question is how do we and when do we work out.</p>

I wanted to ask you a bit more about the revenue per piece, and if you could give us a sense of perhaps on the Domestic Air and Ground side, what the breakout looks like, in terms of how much is fuel, how much is price, how much is weight per piece.  And if you don't want to be specific, at least directionally, and talk maybe a little bit about the pricing environment, if that's gotten any better or if it's still pretty challenging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tom, I'd be glad to.  Clearly, this is a challenging time for all businesses to show substantial yield increases.  And our industry sector is no exception, although I would say that the Small Package environment remains much more rational than certainly the LTL environment where it is very challenging.  The big pressure as I mentioned in my prepared comments is that customers are urgently looking for ways to reduce their expenses.  And so, we do see tremendous requests from our customers to find a way to take costs down.  Certainly, our first approach is let's look at your supply chain, let's see how we can help you optimize.  In some cases, we are driving trade down to help customers trade-off speed for cost.  And that's keeping us very busy.  All of our sales people and solutions people are actively engaged.</p>
          <p>The overall competitive environment though remains rational, but challenging.  So, we see the primary pressure coming directly from customers rather than any specific competitors.  The net, if you factor out fuel and some of the characteristics changes like weight, basically, we show slight increases in base rates for the Ground business, and basically flat base rates for the Air.  So those are not great numbers.  Clearly, historically, we've seen better trends, but it is stable.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just to follow up on that.  Is there a time -- you have contracts that re-price through the year, but is -- when might be the timing when you think you've lapped the re-pricing pressure and when you maybe get beyond that kind of resetting the tougher contracts down a bit?  Is there any timing when you think you'll get to that or are we close to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you'd have to see some -- a little bit of a boost in the economy really to change that balance.  So, it's -- there is some lapping, but I think it's more driven by economic conditions.  As long as the trends are flat or year-over-year comps are dramatically negative, customers are going to be very cautious about speeding up their supply chain.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, good morning.  Kurt, you talked a bit about the 16% reduction on the International block hour side as a way of really controlling costs on the International side.  Can you talk about maybe what opportunities there are on the Domestic side to really look at some additional cost cutting and getting those margins back up, or is it just simply the volumes turning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the work continues.  I guess, Ken, we have been thrilled, if you remember a couple quarters ago, I mentioned that one of our biggest challenges was creating a very intense cost control focus in our International business because really for the last decade we've seen great growth trends, and I do want to commend our International network and operations people for very quickly reassessing the network and making changes that keep our customers happy, but also have trimmed down expenses dramatically.  So, we've been very pleased.  I know Scott's been pleased also with our progress on the International.</p>
          <p>Domestically, we've had no less intense of a focus, and we have taken block hours down 6%, but you were starting from a much more well tuned and refined base.  So, the low hanging fruit perhaps is a little harder to get to.  But, we have made dramatic changes in our Domestic environment.  We're going to continue to leverage the expansion of capabilities of Worldport.  As you know, we shut down two major air hubs, and we are significantly reducing the number of aircraft.  So, it's a little harder work there, but we have made substantial benefits.</p>
          <p>I also mentioned that our direct labor hours are down 7% against less than 5% volume declines.  So, we are working very hard there.  Much of that though is being offset by some of the indirect expenses of our pension increases and healthcare increases, and the adverse wage mix impacts that -- we have a more senior workforce since much of our growth has disappeared, and we don't have as many junior drivers in the mix.  So, there's great productivity trends going on.  We will towards the end of the year begin to lap some of that wage pressure.  So, that will moderate.  And then as we get growth, we should see some real benefits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that we know the volume will come back and we're positioned extremely well, Ken.  The network inefficiencies that Kirk talked about will certainly improve dramatically with the volume.  Increased densities will reduce our costs, and obviously, as we talked about, the effective wage rate for our drivers will drop.  So, a lot of leverage there, when we get some volume back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great response.  Just to follow up on the DHL side, on Domestic Air, can you still quantify how much you believe of that gain is &#x2013; or change in volumes is still coming from DHL, and then just to wrap up, Kurt, there is no legacy way the union can pull in any kind of cost, is there, on that multi-employer pension plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I'll squeeze both those in, Ken.  No, we do think certainly the conditions have stabilized and the flat growth in the Air sector is certainly helped by the DHL exit.  I guess one data point we do see, if you factor out DHL wins in our Ground business and our Next Day Air business, actually you're growing about the same, which we see as a good data point.  It shows, as we mentioned earlier, that some of the trade down has probably stabilized.  And I will ask Scott maybe to talk a little bit on the -- any legacy issues on the multi-employer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in general Ken we talked a little bit last quarter, that we are very active working with the Teamsters and the competition committee to look for flexibilities and ways to help manage our costs through this tough economy.  So, I'd say both parties are working aggressively together to figure out flexibilities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Operator.  Hi, gentlemen.  Thank you for taking my questions.  As you look through this economic downturn, Scott, and you look ahead to where you want to UPS to be positioned internationally, can you just kind of address, you talked a little bit about the acquisitions you are thinking about in the Middle East, in Dubai and so on.  But, can you just talk about how your expansion in that -- those areas either expands your footprint, lowers your costs, does -- helps you worldwide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, first of all, Helane, we're really proud of our track record internationally, because we've really grown market share pretty much every quarter over the last several years in all regions of the world.  So, we're pleased.  That doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement.  And, as we said before, we're clearly focused on Central and Eastern Europe and Asia where there's more room for us to take advantage of opportunistic investments, and continue to fill out our network, which again I think is still the most complete global network in the world.  So, I think there's opportunities that we have talked before about.  Down the road, one of the challenges will be Domestic China, and we're going to keep looking for opportunities there.  It's going to be a market with a lot of consumers over the next twenty years.  We need to be positioned there.  But, I think what we've done recently in Eastern Europe and Turkey, for example, our most successful contractor was out of Turkey.  We made that acquisition and we're going to use his expertise to help develop the Middle East.  So, I think again overall, we're positioned extremely well internationally, but we're certainly not complacent because there's areas we can still invest in.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize if you already addressed this, but looking at the quarter-to-quarter changes in yield, Domestic yields across the board were down in Q2 relative to Q1, and I assume a lot of that is fuel and some of the other issues you talked about.  But internationally, they were up.  Can you talk a little bit about why the difference in the trend in the two areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>International has the additional moving part of the currency impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, we're also seeing some continued changes in the lane mix.  Our worldwide traffic, the Asia to Europe, Asia to U.S., continues to show more pressure.  And so, there is some shifting there with more regional trade patterns than global.  We had been talking about how strong the Asia to Europe lane was.  That's changed over the last couple of quarters.  So, you do get a lower weighted average revenue per piece, although frankly we've been able to offset that with substantial block hour reductions.  So, it's our job to try to match those changing trade patterns with our network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Art, the Domestic side, we averaged only 0.33% fuel surcharge on Air and 2.5% on Ground, so pretty dramatically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  And this is a follow-up into another area.  Can you talk a little bit about what you're doing in the LTL business to see some, how you're &#x2013; what you're doing to perform better than what we've seen from some of the other carriers so far this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've been working hard for the last couple years to build a sustainable differentiatable service in the LTL industry.  We've spent a lot of money and done a lot of work on creating technology integration that's fairly unique in the LTL service.  Our &#x2013; half a million WorldShip customers now have the ability to do transactions in an automated fashion and have visibility with our inbound visibility, outbound visibility tools.  So the technology and ease-of-use is a big differentiator.  We have spent a lot of time training the sales forces on both side to help customers do real-time optimization between what should be in Small Package, what should be in LTL.  We've sped up our network and improved time in transit.  We've made substantial enhancements in service.  And so you bring all that together and we think we offer a very compelling value proposition that allows customers to get better service, better control, and also lower cost with optimizing what should happen on a day-to-day basis.  It's kind of a mouthful but this has been a work-in-progress and we did have to take a big impairment a couple quarters ago, but we were very confident and are very confident in the momentum of the business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen.  Question on the International side, can you talk a little bit about what percentage of your International volume today is generated over in Europe and then also talk about the competitive environment over in Europe since it's a more mature market, has more competitors actually than the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  In general, Europe represents about half of our international revenues.  The vast majority, 80% plus, of export shipments that originate in Europe stay within the European continent and that's really been our big focus, building an integrated pan-European capability.  So we continue to see good results, although frankly this quarter we didn't see growth in any region of the world.  But as customers look to save money and have more streamlined operations in Europe, our value proposition is pretty strong.  So we think we've still got great opportunity to help European companies operate more effectively.  And even though it's a mature market for us, it's been one heck of a great platform, really for a decade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the pricing environment much different over there in this downturn than it is in the U.S. or is it fairly rational in Europe as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more fragmented.  Clearly, there is different competitive groups in every country, and so it's hard to characterize.  But, in general, it's a challenging pricing environment, maybe a little less rational than in the U.S., but we feel pretty confident that we can differentiate ourselves, and as the market matures we'll continue to make progress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the economic pressures aren't a lot different in Asia and Europe than they are in the U.S. right now, so there is &#x2013; you have the same pressures with the customers there as you do in the U.S.  I do believe the Asia and the U.S. are going to come out of this a little quicker than Europe, but also probably haven't dropped as much in Europe as we have in the other two continents.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess one other point on Europe, one of the reasons we are so focused on Eastern Europe or Middle &#x2013; Eastern Europe anyway is the linkage of low cost sourcing in the region, so that's why you've heard acquisitions in Slovenia, Romania, this Turkey joint venture and acquisition have all been a part of linking that part of the East back into Western Europe.  So, we think continuing to execute that way is a good value proposition.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>I think we're hopeful that we're going to see &#x2013; we're going to have a back-to-school session, but it's really too early to tell.  We have not seen a lot of signs yet based on the air freight market and ocean freight market, but I think that &#x2013; we're hopeful that things will go back.  I saw, I think yesterday, that Wal-Mart is going to, I think, increase its computer inventories by 40%, that's a good sign. So there are some signs out there that maybe the back-to-school season will be better.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  You've mentioned several times your growth in International Packages is better than market, that is the decrease is less than the market.  And I just &#x2013; I'm curious that some of this might be due to the fact that DHL is less competitive without their Domestic ability to bundle services.  Do you have any indications that that's part of the reason for your better than market share over in &#x2013; particularly in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, absolutely, although clearly our market share gains have been a story over the last decade, not just the last couple quarters.  But, no, DHL's decision to withdraw the vast majority of its people and assets from the U.S. has left them with a much smaller network for their import/export coverage and that really gives us a significant point of differentiation for European and Asian customers that are doing business in the U.S.  So, that is one of our highest priorities for our International sales people, and frankly in many markets they are the market leader.  So, our ability to differentiate ourselves as being the only player that really has a strong presence in all major theaters is a great boost for our sales people and we think will continue to pay dividends.</p>

And one &#x2013; second question is, I'm not sure the data is correct, but there is published reports out there that you and FedEx are spending records amount of money trying to convince Congressmen and Administration people about various issues.  And I don't know if the data is correct, but given the focus on cost savings, wouldn't it make more sense to cut back substantially talking to these guys who don't understand probably anything you're talking about?</p>

          <p>David, I appreciate your comments.  I don't think our lobbying efforts are any higher than they have been in the past.  We have a PAC that spends money through the employees' contributions and that's where most of the -- that's where the spending is.  So it's not coming out of the Company's coffers.  I think in general that it's an important issue for us, it's a matter of basic fairness that workers performing the same job should be covered by the same law.  So, it's something we're very interested in and not just us, but I think the entire transportation industry, we all should be governed under the same laws.  But I think as far as spending money and -- it's not a distraction &#x2013; I think it's frankly more of a distraction for our competitor than it is us.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, I just wanted to kind of go back a little bit to talking about the International network a little bit and talking about how there has been some low hanging fruit in terms of flexing that network and taking the block hours out.  What have you learned from the initial phases of that because we knew that was going to be a challenge because you had never done it before and how much, like more low hanging fruit is there to go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, Nate, we've learned that even though we've been primarily on a growth run for the last decade, we still have those muscles of cost control that are inherent in the Company that relate across the globe.  So, it's just shifting gears a little bit and the top priority isn't keeping up with rapid increases, it's with optimizing the network to the current level.  So, it's looking at the balance of Air and Ground movements, we've got this unique integrated portfolio, we're now starting to really look at how do we keep aircraft out of the air, keep stuff on the ground but still have guaranteed services.  It is streamlining our freight forwarding operations, there's been a lot of changes in that in the last three or four years, we're now integrating and finding how do you manage the benefits of being both a freight forwarder and an airline and an express company.</p>
          <p>So tremendous synergies across those that allows us to better utilize our assets and also offer customers better choice.  So a lot of hard work on that front, I think there is more to come.  Hopefully, this won't be the top priority for too many quarters to come in the future, because we'd love to get back on a growth curve but it has been I think reassuring to see us be able to hang on to margins even with some of the worst economic conditions any of us have seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for that.  And then inter-China, I've been reading a lot of reports in terms of the China stimulus kind of working a little bit over there to reenergize a little bit of growth and we see some internal GDP forecasts going up.  Kind of what are you seeing in that market and kind of what's the near-term opportunity there in terms of maybe inter-China and also in and out of China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly our focus has been on the import and export out of China over the last few years.  We do have a Domestic Express offering but we're still working on that, it's an area we're looking to invest in as time goes on because we do think over the next 10, 20 years that's a big market.  We are seeing good signs of increased imports into China and that's something that we have not seen a lot of over the last few quarters, we're seeing a better, higher amount of imports into China.  Exports out of China are still a little weak and a lot of that is because the U.S. imports are so weak.  And a lot of China exports go to the U.S. so until the U.S. starts importing again, that's going to have -- cause some pressure to China.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to follow up on that, where are you seeing the imports into China coming from, is that from the U.S. or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well there's some from the U.S., but Japan is big.  I think Japan is big.  But, we're also seeing -- we're seeing some from the U.S., some from Europe, but Japan right now probably has got the best results there.</p>

          <p>Hey gentlemen.  How are you doing?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to follow up on that, I mean just bigger picture I guess one of my questions was, where you think the leadership will come bringing us out of this global economic downturn, do you think -- there is a school of thought that thinks we may see domestic emerging market demand actually pull us out first rather than the U.S., but are you guys of the opinion that we need to see U.S. consumer demand pick up before we start to feel that improvement in the overall environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we need to see some U.S. consumer demand pick up.  Chairman Bernanke yesterday said though, a lot is going to rely on the rest of the world, the rest of the world has got to start spending money, it can't be done all by the U.S..  So, I think it's both, to answer the question, Justin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you seeing any seeds of that domestic emerging market improvement, I mean outside of the imports that you noted into China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're seeing some.  I think you're seeing some of the countries in Asia starting to turn around.  Countries that were really negative like Singapore are starting to put up better numbers.  Korea, a little bit better.  So, we're starting to see some turnaround there, not as fast as we would like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess another bigger picture question, just thinking about domestic demand with auto production scheduled to improve in the back half of this year, what are your thoughts on what that does to GDP and freight demand and how that affects your different business lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it affects the LTL business probably the most because I think the LTL business in general has been hurt more by the weak auto production.  So certainly it helps Small Package, but I think you'll see the most dramatic change in the trucking industry, the LTL industry.</p>

          <p>And our last question will come from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, good morning.  I think at the -- during the call in the first quarter you indicated that your debt levels were a little bit elevated because you had taken on some nicely priced fixed debt and -- but you still had -- you had yet to pay down the commercial paper program, yet it looked like the debt levels were still kind of elevated from there, is there something I'm missing there, did I misread that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we did -- we did create $2 billion of new debt last quarter, we've paid down about 1 billion of commercial paper, John.  And so net-to-net you'd see that 1 billion net and then we do show a substantial increase in cash and marketable securities.  So, not a big deal either way on that.  We are in the process of swapping some of our fixed debt to floating, which over time hopefully will show some benefits on reducing our interest expense although that wasn't a material impact in the quarter.</p>
          <p>But cash flow continues to be a great story.  I mean, clearly we are very disappointed with the substantial earning declines we're seeing, but we are determined to adjust the business to reflect that and we've cut CapEx by almost half so far year-to-date, we've been very diligent with our customer receivables and bad debts so cash flow actually has improved and that's a, for us, silver lining to an otherwise grey economy for us that we've been able to sustain cash flow and keep that in very good shape.  So that does help us on the cash and marketable securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  On that, Kurt, I don't think it's emphasized enough.  There are not many companies that can show a 40% reduction in net income and yet grow free cash flow.  So again, hats off to our people for managing the working capital and the CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bottom line, the debt is just a transitional issue where we've got a little extra marketable securities and cash, but we did take half of that debt down in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right.  And then just two clean up points; one, could you give us your CapEx guidance for the full year 2009 and then working days for the third and fourth quarter, could you just give us clarification on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  The CapEx we did say last quarter that we have pulled CapEx down and we'll be -- and are confident it will be below $2 billion, which would put us at the lowest percent of revenue really that we've seen since going public.  So we are being very aggressive on that front and we review that at least once a month and more frequently as we review capital projects.  Having said that though, as Scott mentioned, we're being opportunistic and whether it's buying hard assets, whether it's buying facilities or whether it's buying companies to increase our global footprint we are spending money where we see opportunity, so....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Working days, I think, John, there is one more working day in the third quarter, I think 65 working days, one more than a year ago and 61 in the fourth, I think is the same, is it one more than last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So both third and fourth probably have one more day than last year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That does conclude our Q&amp;A section.  I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dolny and Mr. Davis for any closing remarks they may have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Now let me just wrap up by I guess reminding the audience of a point I made earlier that UPS really is poised to realize better leverage in our organization.  As volumes increase and I mentioned before that they will, network inefficiencies will improve, increased densities will reduce costs, and new drivers will come on, moderating average wage increases.  Longer term, we're extremely confident that we will see margin improvement.  With that, I thank all of you for joining us today.</p>
