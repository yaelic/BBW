        <plist>
          <p>Welcome, everyone, to this Danone First Half 2011 Results Meeting and Conference Call. Thank you for joining. I am Emmanuel Faber, Co-Chief Operating Officer for Danone, and I will introduce this session. And then Pierre-Andr&#xE9; Terisse, our CFO, will go through the detailed review of these numbers.</p>
          <p>Let me start by saying that we believe this is a very strong set up of results which show how much relevant the changes that we've conducted through 2007 to 2010 in our business model are, to navigate into what is overall a pretty challenging macroeconomic environment, as you know.</p>
          <p>And I will immediately turn to Page 4. The growth of like-for-like of our business is one of our key indicators. We have the ambition to continue to be the fastest-growing food and beverage company, and I think what our teams have delivered in the first half of this year is a solid restoration of our ability to do so.</p>
          <p>There has been a constant ramp-up since 2009 of our like-for-like sales growth year after year, quarter after quarter. And this will be the sixth quarter in a row where we are well in the band of our six to eight annual guidance which we have given to the market last year and reiterated for this year.</p>
          <p>This has been achieved, if you turn to next page, in the context where we have managed our margin well in line with our expectations. Margin excluding our joint venture with Unimilk has been stable, as you can see on the left part of this chart, 15.3%. This is despite huge price &#x2013; input price inflation, which has been beyond 10%. Some of our materials have been growing like 30%. PET has been growing more than 3% in price in the first half of this year. And despite a few extraordinary situations, including Japan, for example.</p>
          <p>Including Unimilk, as we report our numbers, you can see that the margin has been down about 23 basis points from the first half of last year. That is well into our guidance of about 30 basis points decrease on the first half of the year on a like-for-like basis. And that's entirely due to the comparison basis of Unimilk which, in terms of operating margin, was around mid single digits in the first half of 2010, before going down steeply in the second half of last year due to the increase in the raw material prices in Russia. And we are dealing with that, as we will see &#x2013; as we speak, going into the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Third very important item for us, our free cash flow has been growing about 8% compared to last &#x2013; the same half year last year. This is on the back of a very solid increase already in 2010. The first half of 2010 had an increase of 35% over the first half of 2009, and this is also after a very solid step up in CapEx, as we have increased our CapEx this first half compared to last year's first half by about 20%.</p>
          <p>So we believe this cash flow number is very solid, a good example of the unique cash conversion cycle that Danone has put in place already 10 years ago and improving year after year, and puts us very much well on track to reach our landmark number of &#x20AC;2 billion free cash flow by next year.</p>
          <p>Let me spend some time reiterating essentially the recipes for this success by going through a few pages about how we manage our model currently. First of all, our priorities for this year is to continue to strengthen our business model.</p>
          <p>If you turn to next page, you will see that we are playing &#x2013; and this is not random, this is a strategic decision over the last 10 years &#x2013; in what continued to be the fastest-growing food categories around the world. These are <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:06) numbers for last year. I can tell you our estimates are the same for this year. So Baby Nutrition, Medical Nutrition, Dairy and Water has continued to be the fastest-growing categories. And, as you can see on this chart, we have leading market positions both from a global and from a local standpoint in this category. So we believe that we are better placed than anybody else to seize the growth opportunities in the food and beverage space going forward.</p>
          <p>We are also growing our categories by expanding our ability to reach consumers, opportunities in the categories themselves. Here is a good example on the next page of how we have been able to grow the Baby Food business. Essentially, Baby Food business was and continues to be focused on the zero to 12 months age for babies. We have been able, a long time ago already in some of our geographies, to grow beyond that to 36 months of age through weaning food opportunities, and now we are moving backwards to lactating women and pregnant women with innovations that we launched in the course of this first half with Nutrini supporting pregnant and lactating women with dedicated supplements.</p>
          <p>Another element of, or example of, how we are growing our own categories is in the Aqua Drink segment. We are leveraging the equity and the functionality of our water brands and our key brands, introducing flavored and functional waters on that base. We believe by the way that part of the way we navigate, we have been able and we will continue to be able to navigate our business successfully in the current pretty lukewarm consumption patterns in the OECD countries is to introduce or to improve the Indulgence product range. And one way of doing that for water is definitely flavored and the Aqua Drink segment.</p>
          <p>The result of that, as you can see on the left top part of this chart, is that the growth of our Aqua Drink has been stepping up regularly and spectacularly over the last three years. The first half of this year is way beyond the 18% growth that we had in 2010 for Aqua Drinks. And therefore, you are likely to see this year and probably going forward the pie chart on the right that will make even more space for Aqua Drink as a total part of our Water portfolio.</p>
          <p>Turning to next page. Another example of growing our categories has been the launch of Fortifit, starting in Germany with our Medical Nutrition business, which is introducing a product that goes against faltering risks for elderly people that we've launched in very creative manner in Medical Nutrition. And that's a big success, even though obviously very &#x2013; still very early stage.</p>
          <p>Another example that you see here and you are familiar with is the compact versions of some of our key SKUs for Medical Nutrition that we've introduced. We have also showed the example of Complan, which is a UK-based medical nutrition business we acquired this year, which will allow us to play in the pharmaceutical and chemist channels. We are also introducing powder solutions for our customers here in this country.</p>
          <p>The result of this is that we are basically strengthening our key platform. We are not developing new brands; we are really focusing on how can we grow our platforms, and that's essentially the message on the next page, where you can see that obviously among the big brand platforms of Danone, Activia continues to be the big one. But you can see that beyond 1 billion sales now, we have Actimel and the immunity platform for Baby Food; the Superior Nutrition platform for Baby Food; our Kid and Twins, with Danonino and the likes in the Dairy business; Actimel, which is round 1 billion as well; and a couple of big other ones.</p>
          <p>Talking about Activia, I'd like to tell you that we have introduced a significant innovation for Activia in the first half of this year with a launch of a new cup; a new cup which needs a revolutionary process for us, a complete change of the process in terms of form, fill and seal of the pack, which brings a new consumer experience. It has brought tremendously better visibility and uniqueness on the shelf. This cup is actually is tinted. As you can see for Activia, it comes with green, but for Danonino, it would come in blue, for example. So it brings additional differentiation for the brand itself.</p>
          <p>The consumer experience is different. The fact that it's rounded brings consumer to have a much better feel of how they go for their consumption of the product itself. And the facts are there. That has driven nearly a 20-point preference between the previous and that cup. Where we launched it in Spain, and actually has increased significantly the base line of Activia, which was positive already in Spain, in the Q2 this year to a much better level.</p>
          <p>So you are likely to see Danone rolling out this new cup for Activia into a number of countries. We have a specific CapEx program to do that, given the early learnings of the consumer preference for this unique cup.</p>
          <p>Another way of strengthening our brand equity is also to go for re-synchronizing the food chain. Re-synchronizing the food chain means it's not only the food product that you have, but you are interested as a consumer to understand what's in there, how was it manufactured, where does it come from, who has been involved in that process. And the understanding, growing consumer appetite for understanding where the food is coming from and how is it been made of, has led us to an interesting experiment, and we've shared that with those of you who were with us during the Investor Day in France, and that we are replicating in other countries, which essentially highlights the fact that we are collecting our milk in most countries where we operate.</p>
          <p>And that campaign is basically telling our consumer, the Danone product that you are eating has been made with milk that's been collected about 40 kilometers away from the factory in farms that are human-sized farms with about 60 or 50 cows each of them, and highlighting the milk farmers as being the heroes of the story. That has had a tremendous buzz impact in the French community with, as you can see here, a number of &#x2013; or a majority of the media contact that we obtained, the consumer contacts were actually buzz media, as opposed to the advertising itself which we bought, which was only 34% of it. So this new way of connecting with the consumer is also part of how we strengthen the equity of our brands.</p>
          <p>Another and last example is in the Water business where we are not being complacent with our market position. Here is Poland, where we have about a 33% market share. We are leader in Poland already. Yet, we have introduced a new mix with a copy of the Bonafont mix elimination platform which has started and is showing very good results, early results in Poland under the Dobrowianka brand with exactly the Mexican mix.</p>
          <p>The next element of our priorities for this year and going forward is to continue to grow our key emerging platforms. And we are talking geographies here. As you know, we have selected six geographies, as we call them MICRUBs, and those MICRUBs again have shown double-digit growth for the first half of this year. You can see them on the right part of this chart. Mexico has been growing in the 15% range; Indonesia, close to 20%; China, beyond 20%, Russia, about 10%; U.S.A, close to 10% as well; Brazil, close to 20%. So all these geographies have actually been contributing positively to the growth of our business.</p>
          <p>And no doubt if you turn to the left part of this chart that with emerging countries now accounting for 50% of our total sales in the first half of this year, there will be a continued positive impact on the growth due to these very important countries for us.</p>
          <p>One specific point, and Pierre-Andr&#xE9; will come back in detail on this, is Unimilk. Unimilk is giving us a great platform to grow our franchise in Russia. In the course of this first half, we've been accelerating the integration process of Unimilk. We've come from a cooperation phase to a real integration phase that started essentially in the early part of the Q2. That's currently focusing on building the platform for Unimilk to deliver the growth that we expect from our joint Danone and Unimilk business in Russia next year. So the focus for us in Unimilk this year is not growth; it's building the platform.</p>
          <p>If you turn to next page, you will see that we continue to support the key brands of Unimilk. The first time I think we spoke about Unimilk, we told you about Prostokvashino, which is the largest brand within the Unimilk portfolio. It's a &#x20AC;400 million brand last year. And you can see that it has continued to grow significantly in the first half of the year; 14% growth.</p>
          <p>Tema, which is another very interesting brand for Unimilk, has been growing 20% on the first half of the year, and that means that we have been heavily rationalizing the rest of the portfolio, eliminating a number of low value-added SKUs to make sure that we are creating headroom and capacity to expand our own brands and the stronger brands of Unimilk in the future.</p>
          <p>The gross margin management and the integration bringing synergies earlier than what we expected has allowed us, as you can see on the bottom right part of this chart, to drive the margin of Unimilk back to where we want it to be in a pretty quick way, from the very low base that we found at the end of last year when we acquired the business. So already in the Q2, we have a trading operating margin for Unimilk of about 4%.</p>
          <p>Just a few example of portfolio simplifications where you can see low value-added milk, liquid milk products being rationalized on the left, and Prostokvashino brands, including Indulgence Prostokvashino products, being pushed as part of our mix management effort at Unimilk.</p>
          <p>My final comments about how we leverage Danone business model in the first half of the year is about our efficiency and productivity. We are living in a world of high volatility, and for the time being, inflationary for most of our input costs. We said, and we &#x2013; I can repeat this morning, we expect that to continue, both volatility very high, and probably an upward trend going forward next three, five, 10 years for basic agricultural products.</p>
          <p>The result of that is that we believe productivity has to be absolutely built in the business model itself. On the left part of this chart, you can see that in 2008, we had about &#x20AC;300 million of productivity. That was roughly what had been the case for a number of years, and that was sort of our annual program.</p>
          <p>We stepped up that to reach &#x20AC;500 million last year as a significant change in the way we achieve and we process productivities within Danone. And we already said, and I can repeat, that this year we have a target of &#x20AC;500 million again. With the first half of the year, we deliver about half of that. So we are well in our &#x2013; in line with our target of &#x20AC;500 million for the year. It's likely that we are actually going to have probably even bit of headroom, given the very early stages and speed at which we have implemented these programs.</p>
          <p>The important aspect for me is what's on the right part of this chart, which basically says it's not only about stretching the model that we have been doing for years, but it's also changing the business model itself by making sure that productivity is not only going to decrease our cost base, but also improve the top line and the innovation and the breakthrough that Danone products can bring to our consumers and our customers.</p>
          <p>And here are the few examples of what we have been doing on the first half of this year on the productivity side. For example, the packaging of the new Evian bottle. We have been able to make it even lighter, reducing the level of plastic we use by about 12%. Using more recycled PET than before. We have been able to increase to 50% instead of 25% recycled PET. And we made that bottle even easier to compact for our consumers, and therefore being more consumer-friendly. The result is both the top and the bottom green lines of this chart, which is 52% reduction of the carbon footprint for that bottle, and a significant cost reduction in the same time.</p>
          <p>Another example is cold distribution. Cold chain is an expensive and energetically important supply chain for our products. We have decided that practically we would go for cold distribution and cold logistics supply chains. That's an example in Romania, basically, where we have a tripartite agreement with a logistic firm and other suppliers that allow us basically to consolidate our market share in the proximity markets and channels in Romania, but also to bring better service, because we're able to rotate our trucks, food trucks, with a significantly increased drop size, which allows us to serve our customer better. And obviously because of that drop size, to have a lower distribution cost overall.</p>
          <p>Another example of a breakthrough model for us is the milk-cracking technology that we have been talking &#x2013; or discussing with you for a while already. That's an example in Saudi Arabia with Danette, our Indulgence dessert product, where basically by using the technology of milk-cracking, we've been able to improve the recipe in terms of consumer preference. We have a cheaper recipe, as we are making a better usage of the milk protein. We bring less CO2. That's &#x2013; we are talking about 17% decrease in CO2. And 20% water saving in the process overall. And we are bringing better nutrition, because overall, we are lowering the level of fat and energy of the product itself. So this is a very good example of how productivity can actually drive a 360-degree improvement of our business value to our consumer and our environment.</p>
          <p>All of this is made very well conscious of the fact that we need to continue to drive our price mix and volume growth. You remember the days of the reset where we were very focused on volume and we said for about 12 months, "Do not even look at sales and value. That's not the focus. We are now back in two territories for again about six quarters, where gradually you see the volume and mix price equation of Danone back to normal trends despite, again, the macroeconomic difficult environment.</p>
          <p>Consistent with what we announced, we've been conducting in the course of the first half this year a selective number of price increases, given the 10% inflation I mentioned earlier in our input costs, and that has driven the overall volume price mix to a level where we believe it is more sustainable than the transformational years that we've been going through.</p>
          <p>Finally, I started with the environment. I think this set of numbers is a good illustration of how relevant those transformations, both strategic and operational that were brought to our portfolio between 2007 and 2010, in terms of choice of categories in which we play, countries in which we decide to allocate our capital, the way we create value for our consumers and we manage the value price equation for our consumers, is relevant to allow us in this environment to navigate our business model in a way where we are well in line our guidance for a top line this year of 6% to 8%.</p>
          <p>We believe these first half numbers obviously have had a few exceptionals that Pierre-Andr&#xE9; is going to show in more details positive that we won't have for the second half. Anyway, we believe therefore we are well in the pace of the 6% to 8% that we want to achieve for &#x2013; on a full year basis.</p>
          <p>Second point, which is the bottom one here, the way the margin is going through on the first half of the year for us is a very good base to reach the full year guidance that we've given of about 20 basis points improvement on a like-for-like basis, which will come on the basis of easier comps from input price standpoint last year, the full year impact of our pricing initiatives that we've taken in the early part of this year, and obviously, as far as Unimilk is concerned, a much easier comp in the next few months compared to the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>And finally, in terms of free cash flow, what I said earlier, we believe that we are well in line with what continues to be our landmark number for next year of &#x20AC;2 billion. I think the &#x2013; and I hope and I trust the consistency of what we are sharing today is showing the fact that our business model is well placed to deliver both in the short term, mid term, long term, superior growth in the food and beverage space.</p>
          <p>So hopefully, stay with us. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Emmanuel. I'll try to give you a bit of insights on the financial elements now. And I am moving toward the rest of the presentation. So key figures to start with. The only thing I would like to outline here is that we are basically either in line or above all targets on all KPIs. So once again in line with our commitments on the top line. Emmanuel said that we are clearly above that 8.7% like-for-like sales. This is for the first half, but obviously, this has been strong in both quarters, Q1 and Q2.</p>
          <p>On the margin sides, minus 23 basis points like-for-like, which stands against the fairly negative 30 basis points which we had said previously we expected. And I will come back on it. EPS at 1.44 and free cash flow &#x20AC;925 million, which means that we keep growing on the basis, which as you all know, are becoming higher and higher. But basically the growth of the free cash flow is still in place.</p>
          <p>So overall, we are pretty proud about this result and view this as very positive, and we are viewing very well the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>If you look at the top line, basically we continue with the strong trends. You'll see that despite Q1, which was a bit of an exception &#x2013; exceptional at 8.5%, we even do better in Q2, 8.8%. I think we flagged, and I will conduct in detail the fact that there are some exceptional elements in there, in particular in Waters, but beyond that, to me the most important thing is that if we strip out these exceptional elements, the base of growth of the Group is extremely solid. And I think that's the most important element, even more than the absolute figures themselves.</p>
          <p>If you look at the different components, as you know, these bridges scope 8.4%. This is mainly Unimilk. On the first half, the currency impact has been overall nil, minus 0.8%. And then you have 8.7% like-for-like growth of sales, which is pretty well balanced between volume and value; 4% value, 4.7% value for total growth reported at 16.3%. And sales which on the first half will have been very close to &#x20AC;10 billion.</p>
          <p>If you look at the sale analysis for Q2, there are common points and points of differences. The common points are obviously the scope effect, which is very much the same; 8.3%. The second common point is the total top line on a like-for-like basis; 8.8%. The points of differences are currency, which are negative for the quarter at minus 3.8%, and this is basically reflecting the strength of the euro versus other currency, in particular the U.S. dollar. And secondly, the balancing of your question is moving with lower volumes and higher value, and again, I'll come back on that.</p>
          <p>You remember that during the full year, we showed different sets of numbers, trying to explain you what was Danone doing ex-Unimilk. So we will continue that for part two of the year. I mean, this particular presentation. So every time you see the growing balance at the top of the slide, which says Danone standalone before Unimilk, this is ex-Unimilk. When it's not present, it means that this is total numbers.</p>
          <p>So here, you have the evolution of sales ex-Unimilk for the Group. I think the first element is what you see in the title, i.e. the standard on top line growth is the best quarter since the first quarter of 2008. I think it says as well that this is obviously a very strong performance, again helped by favorable one-times in Waters, but on the basis of a very solid underlying performance which, as Emmanuel said, is very much on track with the guidance we've given for the full year.</p>
          <p>The MICRUBs have continued to grow double digits, so they continued to be the driving force of the expansion of sales. But what is interesting as well is that Western Europe is sustaining in positive territory, and is in fact improving, and that's been, among other reasons, because Spain, which had started to improve in the first quarter of this year, has continued to improve in the second quarter of this year. This is particularly the case in Dairy, so a good performance in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>When you look at the volume-value equation ex-Unimilk, you see that obviously the pricing in mix is expanding. This is a reflection of the price increase which we've been progressively putting in place in our different businesses in Q1 and in Q2. That's been the case in Dairy, Waters, but also in Baby.</p>
          <p>The second very interesting lesson to me is that the volumes are basically standing. So, as opposed to what happened back in 2008, we are &#x2013; and because we are doing it in a very focused, precise and differentiated way, we are pursuing price increase, but at the same time, the volumes are absolutely staying in line with expectation and remain very steady. And I think that's one of the key elements of the quarter.</p>
          <p>I'll now move to the various divisions. So Fresh Dairy, again ex-Unimilk <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:05) we'll have to look at their total. Ex-Unimilk, Fresh Dairy is extremely constant. It's been four quarters that we deliver top-line growth like-for-like, which is between 5.4 and 5.5. I think this reflects the strength of the model. Energy markets have kept growing double-digit, while Western Europe has stabilized and even improved. Japan, you remember had a production interruption at the beginning of the second quarter. This is now over, and Japan is back to full speed operation since the month of June, therefore we expect a second half which will be back to normal as well, which means back to double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>In terms of brands, pretty balanced contribution between the Proactive Health brands; Activia, of course, but also Danacol and Densia, while on the other hand, in Belgian brands, which is Danette and the Greek, and the Kids and tweens, have been contributing to the growth as well. So the growth which is coming from the different segments of the portfolio of Dairy and which is therefore very solid.</p>
          <p>Again, very much the same picture as the one you can see on the Group on the value equation, i.e. volume which stands well at 2.6% growth, and a value element which is expanding, reflecting the pricing improvement at 2.8%. What is true in Dairy is true for the Group as well, i.e. given where we stand today in terms of raw material, we think we have been passing in the first half the vast majority of the price increase we needed to pass. So we will obviously readjust the position depending on actual operations, but most of the things we have decided to pass have been passed.</p>
          <p>You'll remember this chart which we designed to try and explain the sequence between price increase in 2008 and the resets in 2009. We have chosen to continue showing it this time, because I think it illustrates very much the strength of the trend we have in the Dairy division and progressivity and the balance of the growth. We keep growing in volume; we keep growing in value. We do that on a very regular basis, and this is again another sign of strength of this business.</p>
          <p>In terms of innovation, we obviously continue to innovate on all fronts. Emmanuel mentioned about the new Activia cup. We also innovate on product content on Activia, with Activia Porridge in Russia and Activia Breakfast in Italy. But, as we have been telling you for several quarters now, we don't limit innovation to Activia; we also innovate on other products. You can see Danette, which is a typical Indulgence product with a very Flemish name, but this is a Spanish product. Danette <mark type="ph" /> project (35:38) in Spain. And <mark type="ph" /> grains range for the cold range (35:34) in Poland.</p>
          <p>So that's Dairy ex-Unimilk. Now, a look at Unimilk. Again, as Emmanuel mentioned, the objectives of Unimilk in this year of transition are obviously very different from the one we have for the rest of the Group, simply because we have &#x2013; towards the end of 2010, we have had a company showing extremely strong, too strong perhaps, volume growth, but at the same time a level of profitability which has been collapsing. And therefore, our priority since the beginning of the year has been, on the one hand, to manage the integration; then on the other one as well, to first restore the profitability and start investing behind brands in order to do what we want to do, which is to develop value-added products in the portfolio of Unimilk.</p>
          <p>So these are the priorities. And if I look at the way we've managed the priority, basically things are doing well to very well. In terms of evolution of sale, you can see this table at the top which shows that the evolution of sales and volume has been pretty different, depending on the range. You see it's been doing very well on the quite value-added baby and kids' brands. It's been doing good on modern brands, given the context. But, on the other hand, we have stopped supporting a certain number of traditional local brands which are clearly not the priority, and this in volume terms means minus 15% in that case.</p>
          <p>What's interesting and important to keep in mind is the chart below, which shows that, in terms of volume evolution, we are progressively, as we go into the year obviously, comparing to a base of volumes which is very high. I say obviously because the volumes have been pushed very much last year.</p>
          <p>When you look at the volumes from a sequential point of view, in reality, we are since the beginning of the year very much at the same level. So we're working on the stable sequential volume base and working with a priority to segment the portfolio and start growing the value-added brands.</p>
          <p>Working second on the profitability, and here you have further elements on the profitability side which show you that the start of the year has been pretty difficult with, in reality, negative profitability. The price of milk kept increasing in January and February, and since February started, it started going down. And the big achievement of the quarter, of the first half, sorry, has been to restore the profitability and to bring it back in June to the level which was its level, in fact above its level, of one year ago. So that was the first priority; it's done.</p>
          <p>In the second half of course, the situation will be completely different in terms of basis of comparison, because we are going to compare in the second half this year to a level of 1% of margin for Unimilk last year, and therefore, just maintaining the level of margin we have now will give already a significant margin expansion. This margin expansion has been driven by several factors. It's been driven by an improvement on the cost of milk side. We keep running a cost of milk which are higher than the one we had at the same period of last year. That's been consistent throughout the second half, but which are clearly going down. And that's obviously the most important point. We have started implementing synergies, and they are significant amount of synergies in the first half which will become bigger in the second half.</p>
          <p>The last point is the integration. The integration is going well. You all know that we made some adjustments, some change of management, at the beginning of the year; Filip Kegels remaining in charge of the JV, and Yves Legros looking more specifically at Unimilk. These two people and Danone people and Unimilk people have been working together to design a new organization for the JV. That's going to be completely implemented by year-end. It's in the process of being implemented. The teams are going to be moved to one single location together in the month of October, so things are really going absolutely on track. And on the Board side, we'll make some change as well. <mark type="ph" /> Andre Beshaminski (40:35), who was the chairman of his company, will, as he has already done on the management side, take some way off from this involvement operationally in the JV. And the chairmanship will be taken by a Danone person. In this particular case, I've been asked to do it.</p>
          <p>So integration doing well. Margins was operating well. The big game now is going to be implementing the synergies, or keeping implementing the synergies, and starting to see some numbers in the P&amp;L. So that's one topic for the second half. And investing behind the modern dairy and the baby brands, and starting lifting up these brands, which we have already seen to some extent in the first half, but which we'll continue to push.</p>
          <p>So very much on track, but again, with a totally different equation than the one we have to manage for the rest of the Dairy. It's normal. And yes, and that's it.</p>
          <p>I move to Water. So it's been two or three years, I think, that I've been telling you that Q2 and Q3 are always very difficult to read, and that Q1 is a better indicator. There is no exception this time. The weather conditions have played a role. To help you understand that, I think there are three elements to keep in mind. The first, and that's obviously the most important, is that Water is really &#x2013; has really stepped up versus last year in terms of underlying base performance for two reasons. Number one, because the improvement in Western Europe have confirmed, and they have confirmed in the second quarter as well. The second reason is that Aqua Drinks are adding some element of performance in emerging geographies, and this is particularly the case in Asia and Latin America.</p>
          <p>So when we were running at about five points of growth a year ago on Water, we are clearly today running as underlying trends two points above that. So 7% to 8% is the underlying performance of water. To this, you have to add pricing, because the sharp increase of PET has led us to pass a price increase, essentially in emerging countries. Pricing is two to three points, and therefore in 2011, the underlying performance is even higher than the one we mentioned before.</p>
          <p>This means that you have around nine points of one-offs or exceptional items, which are basically relating to two topics. The first is the weather condition. May and April have been just exceptional in Europe. It's been the case in Latin America as well. The weather condition has been good. And this has obviously contributed to higher sales. The second one is the stock filling in Japan following the earthquake. The earthquake and the damage to Fukushima has led to an increase of &#x2013; an immediate increase of buying water, which has therefore emptied the stock, and the stock has <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:56).</p>
          <p>We are quite careful about whether or not this is going to translate into real sustainable medium-term consumer &#x2013; increased consumption, sorry. We don't believe we have enough evidence to think this is going to be the case. So for the moment, in our analysis, we consider that this has been as well a one-off and there will be no long-lasting effects of that. So eight to nine points, which add, and you get to 19%.</p>
          <p>Obviously, when you think about Q3 and Q4, you have to eliminate these nine points. And not only when you look at the weather condition outside as well as inside, it's a bit freezing, to be frank. It's not &#x2013; it's clear that we'll have Q3 probably, if it continues like this, probably below the normal trends of &#x2013; the normalized trends of Waters.</p>
          <p>So I hope I've been clear enough and given you sufficient elements. When you look at the price mix, you can find some of the reflection of the elements I have been describing. Volume growth has been higher 10%, higher than the normal trends for the second quarter in a row. This is due to Western Europe and Aqua Drinks. And of course, the pricing mix elements has being significantly higher because of pricing, but also because of the weather condition in Western Europe, and therefore, the real performance of Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Innovation, just to remind you, that we have a 360-degree strategy in this division now. We keep focusing on Water. That's obviously the core of the division. And focusing on Water, ranging from the jugs, this is the case in Mexico with the launch of a new six-liters, which is providing accessible luxury to the consumer; and at the same time trying to work the on-premise market with new bottles, one in Indonesia and another one in Spain. And obviously, the Aqua Drinks is a second priority with some pretty good new innovations in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Baby Nutrition; strong performance I think for the third quarter, above 9%, 9.6%. Very much the same dynamics, i.e. the milk, are driving the growth, and while the weaning food has been stable. In the milk, the growth has been led throughout the geographies, but that's been the case in Europe, with &#x2013; in particular this quarter, UK, Netherlands and Turkey, and obviously by Asia, with Indonesia and China, which have kept growing very strongly. It's a balanced growth; volume, mix and pricing, and we keep growing our market shares in the Danone presence universe.</p>
          <p>In terms of innovation, we keep being very focused. That's been the strategy of the division for the past two to three years, and we stick to it, trying to strengthen our two brand platforms which are Bebelac and the Complete Nutrition platform, and Aptamil on the other hand, which is the Immunity platform, with either specialties or addition in terms of pack, and a very nice expansion for these two brands.</p>
          <p>Last division. This is Medical. It continued solid growth, 8.7%. Not much to say. It's been a sustained volume-driven growth fueled by all geographies. All of the growth is volume-driven. All the categories have been growing with a specific mention on Pediatrics. And in terms of countries, again, a balanced growth with a good performance of Europe and a good performance in emerging, and in Europe, specifically good performance of the UK this quarter, where &#x2013; and I mentioned we have made the acquisition, a small acquisition, of a company called Complan, which is to help us building the sales pay channel, and adding powder and a stronger access to pharmaceutical channel in this country, which is the most important country for Medical.</p>
          <p>And innovation keep being very much about the same product. The interesting thing is that we keep bringing to Medical the Danone consumer knowledge. So trying to mix the medical and scientific expertise of the nutritional teams, and combining that with the knowledge of consumer and improvement in the recipes, in the taste, and in the brand attraction to consumer. You see that with various new chocolates on the left side of the chart.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:26) with the top line, we look at the geographies. So Europe is strong again, 4.2%. Within that, Western Europe is performing very well at 3%. So this is obviously impacted by the weather conditions in Water, but also reflecting trends which remain very solid. Asia keeps improving at over 20% growth. This is the addition of the good performance in Baby and the good performance of the Aqua Drinks and Waters. And the rest of the world has been at about the same level as previously, with LATAM performing well and the U.S. performing mid to high single-digit, the big stake in the case of the U.S. being our ability to progress in the Greek segment in the second half and in 2012. And you know that we have re-launched &#x2013; we are in the process now of re-launching, expanding the range of Greek with the re-launch of Oikos, which is not going to be anymore only an organic brand, but also a mainstream brand. And this is happening now. So we'll see the results again in the second half and next year as we move forward.</p>
          <p>I'll move to the margins. So trading operating income of &#x20AC;1,396 million; very small over operating items, &#x20AC;4 million, which are expenses relating to Unimilk integration. And therefore, an operating income of &#x20AC;1,492 million, which gives you a margin of 14.35%. I think the interesting chart to understand that is the one which Emmanuel has already shown without Unimilk. So without Unimilk, we have been essentially stable, with the exception of the impact of Japan, which has been, as we expected, 10 basis points. And therefore, ex-Japan, we are stable in margin terms, ex-Japan and ex-Unimilk.</p>
          <p>With Unimilk, there is obviously the impact of the re-balancing of the margin, which were close to mid single digit last year and have been ramping up first as an average 1% in the first half of this year, and then forward, this figure becomes minus 23 basis points, which is well inside of the minus 30 bps, which we gave you as an indication in the first part of the year. So we are well in tracking with the performance we had in mind, which means indeed that we have been able to deal with the sharp increase of the costs of the commodities, which has been strong. I'll come back to that.</p>
          <p>If you look at the margin bridge, you see on the net basis, the effect of the input costs. Net of productivity, this has been a total impact negative of 220 basis points. That's been offset by leverage on one hand, and on the other hand, by the pricing. And pricing has been, of course, managed through either price increase or managing the level of commission. And this is what you see on the pricing and mix on one hand, and AMP on the other. I'll come back on that in a minute.</p>
          <p>When you look at the increase of commodities, it's been sharp. In fact, we are today at levels which are in most cases either at the same level or both the levels &#x2013; the peaks we had in 2008. So it gives you an idea of the magnitude of the increase of costs. Most of the growth of the costs has been taking place in the first quarter and at the beginning of the second quarter. Since the second part of the second quarter, we've seen &#x2013; and this is particularly visible in the case of PET &#x2013; we've seen this <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:38) stabilizing or slightly decreasing. You can see that as well on the chart of the skim milk powder which, as you all know, is an early indicator. Imperfect, but an early indicator of the trends we have on the liquid milk, and therefore we expect the liquid milk to be following exactly the same route as we move forward.</p>
          <p>This means that the input cost pressure has been stronger in the first half on a lower base last year than it will be in the second half, even if we don't expect them to materially come back versus the level we have today. So in front of that of course, down productivity is key. We have performed as planned. In fact, we've performed slightly above plans. We have a target for this year, which is around &#x20AC;500 million. We have on the first half slightly exceeded the target which we had for the first half, and therefore we have good chance to be at least reaching &#x20AC;500 million for the year and probably a touch above that. And we keep focusing very much on that because this is the key and this is giving us more flexibility to manage the pricing without hurting the volumes.</p>
          <p>On the sales side, so AMP, as you've seen, has contributed to the expansion of &#x2013; sorry, to the outset of the evolution of the cost of raw material, and this has clearly been the P, which we have activated as one of the levels of passing prices to the market. Advertising has been up; within advertising, digital media expense doubling versus its level of 2010. At the same time, we kept investing on the other levels, in particular on sales force, which is very important items and which we have grown double-digit; same thing for research and development. So altogether, our objective obviously remains to keep fueling the top line, which is excellent and remains the main driver of profitable growth expansion of the Group. And therefore, our objective is to drive the means in accordance with the top line we target for the year.</p>
          <p>If we look by business, Waters has been expanding margin, despite the increase of the cost of PET, but that's been possible because of the strong dynamics of the business. Dairy has been strongly up; Medical has been strongly up as well. You should expect that this is going to reverse for a significant part in the second half. And on the contrary obviously, Dairy, which has been down on the back of Japan, Unimilk and price increase, not fully offsetting the increase of raw mat, you should expect it to revert in the second half to provide altogether margin growth for the year.</p>
          <p>Quickly about moving from operating income to net income. So you know the table, I just remind you the way it's been built. You have the reported 2010, the reported 2011 and then we have in 2011 between the non-current and the current. A word about non-current items; it's been pretty limited, as you see, minus &#x20AC;4 million on the operating side. It is because of the integration of Unimilk. And there are some small items below on the financial expenses and income tax. So most of it is clearly underlying. I have commented operating income. Financial expenses are up on the cost of the debt in Russia, which we finance in ruble.</p>
          <p>Income tax is up. I will come back on it in a minute. And net incomes of affiliates has been down on the disposal of Huiyuan last year, plus the earthquake in Japan. You know that we have a minority stake in Yakult and the events in North Africa, which as well have impacted the earnings of our associates in these countries. So total net income, &#x20AC;960 million; &#x20AC;870 million attributable to the parents.</p>
          <p>One word about income tax. So we're at 26 exactly percent in underlying rate versus 6.3% in reported rate, comparing to the 24% in the first half of last year. We expect to remain at the same level in the second half of this year, but that's going to compare to a 26% in the second half of last year, and therefore, with no effect of the basis of comparison.</p>
          <p>EPS-wise, it gives you 1.44 on the back of the improvement of the net income, but as well on the reduction of the fully diluted number of shares. We have, as we had told you, done Shanghai Bank for a total amount close to &#x20AC;600 million on the first half, and this has reduced the number of shares.</p>
          <p>When I look therefore at the EPS, I get to a growth of altogether 4.3% with a very small currency effect, small scope effect, and most of it being like-for-like growth, 5.1%. Obviously, this is going to be higher in the second half on the back of margins, on the back of income tax, on the back of associates, and altogether for the year, we keep expecting like-for-like growth of the EPS around 10%.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, and last, 7.8% with the level of CapEx which has been pretty similar to the one of last year, so 3.5%. To be noticed, because I didn't mentioned one of the element of progress that's unique as well as being the improvement of the free cash flow, so that's one of the direction we're targeting; the free cash flow, which was negative so far, has turned slightly positive. So we keep progressing on that, on the working capital side, and rationalizing the CapEx. But it's definitely going in the right direction. And a total cash flow of &#x20AC;925 billion.</p>
          <p>When we look at the way this has been spent, it's been used to pay the dividends, &#x20AC;959 million, to purchase treasury stock. On the net basis, &#x20AC;553 million, and I would say we've completed more or less most of the things we wanted to do for this initial part of the year. So we'll have to reflect again on that in the very late part of 2011. And all that has driven the debt to increase by &#x20AC;452 million at therefore a level of &#x20AC;7.5 billion on the balance sheet, which for the other items remains very much in line with what we had at the end of the year; some small negative effects which have contracted it, but nothing else.</p>
          <p>So on the outlook and outside that, we are definitely benefiting from very solid underlying trends, very good engines, and despite the current shape of the environment, which remains difficult, we confirm our guidance 6% to 8% on the top line towards &#x20AC;2 billion on the free cash flow. And trailing operating margin which will progress like-for-like on 20 basis points, which means that the second half will be strong in terms of margin improvement.</p>
          <p>I will stop here and I propose you to through &#x2013; to try and answer your questions. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Michael Steib from Morgan Stanley. Can I ask a couple of follow-up questions on Unimilk, please, specifically on Slide 41? The first relates to just the acceleration of the volume decline between Q1 and Q2. I think it's minus 3%, minus 4% in Q1 and minus 11% in Q2. Is the entire decline of volumes there due to the discontinued SKUs, or is there also &#x2013; within what you describe, there's more than brands, just some brands that are weak and are just underperforming the general market? And then secondly, where are you now with the discontinuation of SKUs? Is this likely to be of a similar effect in Q3 and in Q4, or have you accelerated that restructuring of the portfolio to an extent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've discontinued some SKUs, and I think that's part of the explanation for the volume evolution. Don't expect further significant discontinuation of SKUs. We keep rationalizing the portfolio, but you should not expect further discontinuation of SKUs, I think. And maybe I come back to this slide because that's a pretty important one, Page 41. Here we are; the acceleration of the volume decline is basically the reflection of the acceleration of the volume expansion of last year. In other words, when you look at volumes from a sequential point of view, we are since February pretty much at the same level. There's no expansion, but no decrease either. And this reflects what you mentioned, i.e. the discontinuation of certain SKUs, but it also reflects the fact that while the focus of the previous management a year ago was very much drive the volume up, this is clearly not the topic we are looking at today. Today, we don't care about volume expansion; today, we care about restoring the profitability and building the brands.</p>
          <p>So volumes have been sequentially stable. You should basically expect them to keep being stable for the rest of the year, but obviously, it means that we will be comparing to a basis which will be, in particular in the third quarter, higher.</p>
          <p>But that's to me a very important element. We get that from a sequential point of view, because it reflects the fact that our aim, our goal this year, is not to improve the volumes; it's really to fix something else and to do what you see on the top part of the slide, which is on top of improving the profitability, start growing the Baby and Kids and the modern brands. And if it comes with traditional and local brands and no value-added activities, not growing or even decreasing slightly, that's for me not an issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I just may add one point, and I am speaking under the control of Pierre-Andr&#xE9;, because that relates to elements of guidance for the second half, but my best guess, if I had to give a number for the second half on Unimilk growth, if you look at this Page 41, there is a sales growth number for H1, which is plus 10%. And I wouldn't be surprised that it would be actually zero for the second half.</p>
          <p>We are just not interested in trying to catch up with the volume growth that was created on the back end of last year by the previous management team. What we are interested with Unimilk today is to create this platform from a strategic and operational standpoint, therefore the integration is going on very quickly and quicker than what we had anticipated.</p>
          <p>We are focusing on the best brands, and you have a few of them. If you look at the price index on the right here, you can see that there is a huge gap between these three sections of brands, and even between Biobalance and Prostokvashino, and within the Prostokvashino brands, which are both modern brands in the middle here, you have price gaps as well.</p>
          <p>So what we are building this year with Unimilk is the platform for next year. We are &#x2013; frankly, we are just not focusing as a management team on sales growth or volume growth of Unimilk as a key performance indicator for this time being. Next year, it will be a very important one; this year we just do not look at it. That's not the way we are looking at it. What we are driving is the margin, because growing the gross margin and making the efficiencies below the gross margin is essential for the profitability of the platform next year. And that's why we have been sharing with you how that margin has been evolving over time.</p>
          <p>Chris?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I was just looking out to H2, because at the moment I think it's clear from the comments you are making about sales in the second half of the year and about margins, about tax comparisons, and then on financing costs, that you should be converting organic sales growth into EPS growth much more efficiently in the second half. And I think most people's expectations are that you will have a significant acceleration in EPS growth in the second half. I was wondering if perhaps you could just give us a sort of rough sketch of the waterfall or the bridge on EPS expansion in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll do that. I'll do that by memory. If you have a look at the various contributor, top line we said we have some exceptional elements in H1 which you won't find in H2, and that's not going to be contributed to a stronger EPS growth. But all the rest of it is basically &#x2013; well, the rest of the elements is the margin first. We have a negative like-for-like margin evolution of 23 bps this first half, reaching 20 bps positive for the year means approximately 60 bps for the second half. Secondly &#x2013; and that's going to be a strong difference.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have 26% tax rate in the first half. We expect roughly the same in the second half, but we'll be comparing to something completely different because we had last year 24% in the first half and 26% in the second half.</p>
          <p>Associates, I mentioned that we had some impacts from the events in the Japan and in North Africa. While I can't predict politically, but I don't expect this is going to reproduce in the second half. So altogether, that's going to give indeed an EPS profile which will be completely different and obviously much stronger in the second half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Alan Erskine from UBS. Just on the base Dairy business, the revenue growth of 5.4%, I think it was, in Q2, do you think that reflected a share gain? And maybe if you have the data, if you could give us the share price development in your top four or five markets, that would be interesting.</p>
          <p>And secondly, obviously you took sequential pricing in Dairy in the second quarter, and I think you've been saying that that's going to be done on a very judicious way, and not wanting to give the competition oxygen. Maybe could you talk through which specific markets you've taken pricing in and what quantity that's been? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alan, I am afraid I forgot the first part of your question about the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just do you think in the markets that you operate in, that they too grew around 5.5%? In other words, did you think an aggregate across your 30 markets or so that you grew share, and maybe more specifically around the top four or five biggest markets are share-developed in the quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll start with the second one which is one pricing. We have been passing price increases this year, which are of the order of magnitude which I would say was consistent with the way the industry has been behaving before the huge 2007/2008 changes in milk prices. That means that other than in a few countries like Argentina where we had country inflation that required all industry players to pass on very steep price increases, we have been passing on price increases anywhere between 1% and 3%, 4%.</p>
          <p>In one or several sequences, depending on how the trade works and how competitive behavior has been across our key markets, when we went through the presentation, Pierre-Andr&#xE9; showed you this chart with the volume expansion of Dairy and the price index against market. That's a key chart, and this price index is an indicator that we're following closely. And what I think we can say is that at the end of &#x2013; you'll remember that we had lowered that price index back to 120 to the market on the Danone universe &#x2013; country universe. And that 120 is basically unchanged after the price increases that occurred in the course of the first half of the year. And again for us, that's a very strong indicator of how competitive our portfolio is in a context where we recognize the fact that consumers are very price-sensitive these days.</p>
          <p>So I think we can say that we have been very consistent in our approach of competitive, selective price increases across the range. In terms of market shares, they have been bit of up and down. The good news for us has been France. The numbers I have here show about a one-point market share increase in the course of the second quarter in France.</p>
          <p>Spain has been very resilient as well. That's the other good news for us that confirms the fact that we shared with you, which was after the first quarter this year, that Spain was not doing as bad as we expected it to do, despite the macro environment there and despite the fact that the situation with private label continued to be difficult. But basically, market share in Spain and Canaries have been about stable.</p>
          <p>We have lost a bit of market share in Germany and a couple of other countries in Continental Europe. The UK, which is a big market, we had a slight increase of market share on the back of good positive sales as well for the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Other than that, big contributors would be Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Latin America. All of them had continued increase in market share. Market share in Argentina has increased by 0.8 points, reaching 77%; Mexico has been increasing by more than 1.5 point, reaching 45.6%. So pretty solid. Probably an area for us to focus on in the future will be Eastern Europe, Eastern and Central Europe. We see the macro environment changing there, not to the good &#x2013; not in the right direction.</p>
          <p>We've been more selective in our price increases there other than Poland, for a number of reasons. But certainly, we haven't &#x2013; some of our countries have seen some decrease in market shares in Central and Eastern Europe. That is &#x2013; that perspective is obviously built in the guidance description overall we've been giving for what we expect from there.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>U.S. has been stable. And in the U.S., as you know, the changing factor this year in terms of category growth has been the Greek. As Pierre-Andr&#xE9; just said, we only introduced the Greek &#x2013; our own Greek version a couple of weeks ago. So it's too early to say what the impact will be for us in terms of market share gains in the course of the next couple of quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Sara Welford from Citi. Just two questions. Firstly, in terms of the Aqua Drinks, you are talking about them in emerging markets. Can you give us just some more color on what you think is different this time compared to I guess three, four years ago when you were launching the flavored waters? And secondly, in terms of the share buyback, you did just over 500 million in the first half. Are there any plans to continue that in the second half at all? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on Aqua Drinks, there &#x2013; I think there are a few different points. One is that we are much clearer and probably much more consistent and stringent with ourselves on the way we use the brand equity itself and the brand positioning of our water brand to expand it into Aqua Drinks than we did before.</p>
          <p>Second, there is now a growing trend for Indulgence, and that's true in both Dairy and Water for us. Obviously, Medical and Baby are different. But this is very true in the Dairy business as well. Indulgence products have been significant growth contributors in Dairy this first half of the year, and we recognized that trend already a few quarters ago, as we went through this consumer overall spend change since the late part of 2008, that probably in that period of crisis, there would be an accelerated demand for Indulgence products. And this is not only true for Danone; this is &#x2013; I think it's an overall food trend that we have to recognize.</p>
          <p>So we have adjusted the portfolio of Danone launching Creamy Activia, launching Activia, and reinforcing the indulgence aspect of our products has really been a key point. And if you look at Aqua Drink, they &#x2013; in their own space, they are answering that need.</p>
          <p>The third aspect is that there is now a clear view that the share of business for Aqua Drink is actually coming even more from soft drink than from water. So we are eating in somebody's other space. And that's on the back of the recognition by most consumers that yes, indulgence is good, but there are significant health concerns by over-consuming products that are too sweet, too energetic in their composition. And this is riding a wave that wasn't as clear as it was five years ago. So I think these would be the key elements.</p>
          <p>The rest, I think, is &#x2013; if you look at emerging countries, it was simply that they were smaller five years ago than what they have developed today as part of the global portfolio. If you look at Mizone in China, it's growing close to 50% this year. And it's a very significant proportion of our beverage in China. So the reason why it is impacted is simply also because we've let those brands go over the last three, four years in Indonesia, China, Mexico, Argentina to a level that now they have a strong impact on the overall business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the share buyback, we have been pretty active in the first half. We have done what we wanted to do. We may do more, but I would wait a little bit more into the year and going through the year before making this decision. So basically refining what we have done so far, and we will readjust that in the second part of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeremy Fialko at Redburn. A couple of questions. The first one is just on your top line guidance for the full year. And sort of taking into account your Unimilk being flatter, the fact that you've got this reversal, or a weaker top line in the Water business, possibly a bit of a positive in Japan in Dairy. Do you still think you will be &#x2013; do you think you will get to the upper end of your 6% to 8% top line range, or is that not something you are sort of necessarily happy to commit or comment on?</p>
          <p>And the second point is coming back to this issue on Unimilk volumes. Are the volume numbers you are seeing absolutely in line with what you had expected? And how are you making sure that you are not seeing perhaps a greater-than-hoped-for falling-off in the volumes of some of these products that you have de-prioritized? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think if we had been willing to comment further on where we feel we are in the guidance, we would have done that, Jeremy. So I think you can take it that we certainly had a very good first half. Pierre-Andr&#xE9; said that there were some exceptionals. We won't have them, and we explained about Unimilk for the second half as well. So our position today is that we stand very well in our 6% to 8% range, and we will see how that unfolds as we go further into the next quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on volume side, Unimilk, well, basically &#x2013; again, the most important to me is that sequentially this is stable. We could have expected for them to grow, but in the market which is today and talking of the Russian market not growing volume-wise, but growing essentially value-wise, because we're in a market which has been passing a significant price increase altogether. And with no specific focus from the teams to push the volumes, then it's not logical to expect them to improve. If you want to increase them, you need to develop them, you need to take some actions. We've chosen to do other things, and therefore, no, it's in line with &#x2013; it's logical to &#x2013; sorry, the result is logical. This is what we are doing.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I have a follow-up question concerning Unimilk. Could you share with us what's your plan concerning the future sales of traditional brands? Are you targeting 0% sales from traditional versus 40% now? Or are you less aggressive for the medium term? So I mean, for the next two years, what would the plan be on that?</p>
          <p>And the second question is concerning the mix effect we had on Unimilk during the 2Q. We have some elements who have an idea of the mix effect behind Unimilk, excluding the traditional brands, but could you give us an idea of &#x2013; excluding these 40% volumes on traditional, what's the mix effect and the total volume effect?</p>
          <p>And the last question is concerning the Dairy in U.S. I was understanding that you have long-term targets of more than doubling sales in the long run. Could you elaborate a little bit more on that, and what the term; is it a long-term guidance for the next two years, or for three years, or for four years? And are you still on track with that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Pierre-Andre; I'll take the questions on Unimilk. On the trajectory of traditional products and brands, we are basically looking at them as, on the one hand, not the priority in terms of development, so we don't expect to grow them double-digits. It is clear. But on the other, this is providing us a sound base to cover the whole territory. So the objective we have medium term for these brands and these products is to grow them low single digits in terms of sales. We don't need more, and this is not on more, but we will that build the business case. The business case and value expansion will come from the rest. But we regard these brands as I think a value, and they're all in the portfolio. And other time, they will grow at a lower pace than Unimilk and Danone Unimilk, but they will keep growing slightly at low single digit.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the right question is the following one, which is a question of the mix. The mix is positive this quarter again, as it was in the previous quarter. That's part of the pricing and mix element which is embedded in the performance of the company. And it's basically reflecting what you see on the table here.</p>
          <p>On the U.S., Emmanuel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take it. On the U.S., look the ambition that we've shared with our investors community with the U.S. is very much still the same; doubling sales indeed. We believe there is potential for that both from a market standpoint and from the competitive standpoint. The plans that have been shared with you, our plans that, as you remember, unfold over the number of years. We're talking about, whatever, four, five years. This is &#x2013; what I am sharing here is an indication, not a commitment, but just to give you the perspective of the timing that we have in mind.</p>
          <p>The way to achieve that will depend on how consumer spend will evolve in the next three years in the U.S. There is clearly in the U.S. a situation where, for the time being, economic recovery is not a job recovery. And we are quite clear that the job situation in the U.S. is having impact on the way people consume. That doesn't mean they do not consume; that means that they consume differently. The run for Indulgence product that I described previously is also true in the U.S. Our Indulgence range is growing and is a contributor to our total growth in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Our Kids' brand, same: they are growing, and they are contributors to the U.S. We will have to adjust Activia, which continues to grow for us in the U.S. and which we expect to be a very significant contributor to this long-term plan to the consumer approach in the next few years, playing on our ability to design Activia flavors and type of products from all over the world to what the U.S. consumer will be requesting from us.</p>
          <p>From a product standpoint, the last factor will obviously be the Greek. We think the Greek is not one of these fashions in the U.S. that come and go after a couple of quarters; we believe it's here to stay. And for us it's a good news, because it means that the consumer in the U.S. is prepared to accept much more international flavors and tastes and textures than in the past. So this will drive our ability to introduce other products into the U.S. market. The key to do all of this will be to drive the per-capita consumption, which is still very low in the U.S., and that we would expect to be growing at least 50% from where it is, and gradually with our customers pushing space in hyper and supermarkets to make sure that we have more space for the chilled cabinets, basically, because that's where the limiting factor is today. So working with customers quarter after quarter to bring that space for us and for our competitors to grow the category is an essential part of the plan and will bring the additional numbers to get to the developed sales that we are contemplating in the mid to long term, as I explained.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Alain Oberhuber from MainFirst. I have a question on Medical Nutrition. Obviously there was no inflation environment for Medical Nutrition. Would you expect that also for the second half of no price increases? And secondly, what is the reason for these no price increases? Did the input costs not increase? Maybe if you could give us a little bit of an explanation of that model, please?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is &#x2013; good morning. This is very much embedded in the model of Medical Nutrition which, as you know, is a model which is for most of it the re-investment, and therefore where the ability to pass price increases is extremely limited. In fact, when you look at the track record of Medical Nutrition, the number of times when there's been positive pricing has been pretty limited. On the contrary, usually we have either flat or negative pricing, so we are basically in line with what we have been delivering for the past probably 12 quarters or so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, all. I've got two questions. The first is could you update us on the performance in the second quarter of Actimel and Activia in a bit more granularity? And the second question is on Unimilk's debt. It was a little bit of a surprise that the interest charges were slightly higher in the first half because of that. Does this mean actually for the full year that we have to, let's say, see the same roll-over effect there, or spillover effect, into the second half on the interest charge? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the first one. It's Emmanuel here. In Q2, basically, I think we can say there is no significant change in the dynamics for Actimel and Activia, relative dynamics. Activia has grown high single digit on the Q2, on a broad area of countries, including some historically difficult countries, and that's the case of Spain. I discussed the innovation that we brought to the Activia range in Spain that's creating significant uplift on the baseline and that we intend to gradually expand in a number of other key countries for Activia. So that's for Activia.</p>
          <p>In terms of Actimel, no big change in the sense that there is not a single large country in which we are satisfied with the performance of Actimel. Actimel continues to decline single-digit, but to decline; that's not what we want for that brand. We are not alarmed by those trends in the sense that we do not see consumers walking away massively from the brand, but we have to recognize the fact that it continues to be our most expensive consumer proposition. We understand how sensitive consumers are to price. As you know, we have reset the price of Actimel in a number of countries. At this point in time, that is not enough in terms of the overall mix of Actimel to bring the brand back to growth. So that's one of the points that we will need to address.</p>
          <p>I don't think there is going to be a short-term fix, nor, I would say, do we think we need a short-term fix. It doesn't mean that we're not working on it. We are working on it very hard. But we think that we need to work on the fundamentals of Actimel and just not short-term fixes, while growing the rest of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>So while Actimel has been providing &#x2013; or has been one of the big engines for growth for Danone in the past decade, I think we have to pose on Actimel, or we are posing on Actimel's ability to deliver growth for us. And we will probably need a few more quarters before we see any turnaround in big markets for Actimel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Marco. I will take the second one about the cost of the debt. I am sorry if I have been oversimplifying when making the presentation. Actually, the evolution of financial costs has two origins. The first of them is indeed Unimilk, for two reasons. Number one, because we have been embarking additional debt; and second reason, because significant portion of this debt, actually almost all of the debt which is interest-bearing, is located in Russia and is denominated in ruble. And as you know, the level of interest rate in Russia is higher than the one we have in Europe. It's, roughly speaking, two-folds. So that's one.</p>
          <p>The second one is that we have been seeing some increase on the interest rate. I am sure you have seen that as well. So if I have to think about the second half, I would tend to say that the two things I have mentioned are likely to continue having the same effect on this item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And quite some benefit from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:38:01).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:38:01) from Merrill Lynch here. Just to come back on Unimilk, sorry for that, just a point of clarification in terms of the second half here; we've got expectations for flat volumes in terms of price mix. Can we expect that to be positive? And then two, can you put that in the context of the medium-term expectations for growth for Unimilk?</p>
          <p>And then in terms of the market dynamics, you mentioned the market volumes are largely flat as well. Can you comment specifically about the competition at Wimbledon and what Pepsi is doing? And then on the margin front, margins have come back nicely in second quarter. Is that in line with expectations? Can you comment about the trajectory in second half and into next year? Are we ahead of plan or in line? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take these. So on the Unimilk equation, you are saying we're expecting flat volumes. This is true, sequentially again, but then of course, we'll be comparing to higher pace of volume last year. So it means that will keep being negative and we'll keep being negative even to slightly larger excess in Q3 and to a smaller excess in Q4 when you look at the shape of the volumes of Unimilk.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, on the pricing side, we are going to lapse in Q4 some of the price increase which has been &#x2013; which have been taken. So we'll stay with some elemental price increase. We'll stay obviously with positive mix. But this is basically what led Emmanuel to say that we basically expect sales overall to be stable in the case of Unimilk in the second half.</p>
          <p>This is obviously not what we are trying to build medium term, the priority medium term, or setting the target medium term is clear double digits for the growth of sales of what will be, by the way, Danone-Unimilk, not only in Unimilk, but some of the two and each of the two. We don't have again any negative reading in what's happening this year for what we are trying to build, because we have decided that in order to be able to build profitable growth, we first need to make the growth profitable on the existing product and the existing portfolio profitable. And then we can push on it. That's a fundamental belief we have. We first need to fix the portfolio and to have the <mark type="ph" /> interest in question (1:40:59) before we can push on that. This is a choice we have made and it's very, again, logical.</p>
          <p>Reigning in of competition will be done. What I think you should ask Pepsi, I have not seen much about that in their recent release. On our side, we are not seeing any meaningfully different behavior, which is obviously &#x2013; which is obvious, because they've just taken the management of this company. So I don't think &#x2013; I don't expect that they need to change everything. So no real comment to add to that.</p>
          <p>In terms of margin, I think the first half has basically been very interesting, because it brings us to a level of margin which is approximately where we want to be in the second half. So we don't need to, from the point where we stand in June, we don't need significant improvement sequentially in the second half. What we need to do is to develop the synergies in front of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:42:13), which again sequentially is going to re-increase because of seasonality, although it's in good dynamics versus what we could have expected. It's going to re-increase sequentially, and therefore, the game, the important part is going to be keeping accelerating on the delivery of synergies in the second part of the year. And this is important for the second part of this year, but this is important as well for the following year, i.e. for 2011 and 2012.</p>
          <p>One point I want to add, this is what I told you, is that the improvement you have seen on the margin has been obviously very much driven by gross margin. And when I look at the business from the inside, I tend to focus a bit more on the gross margin than on the net margin because expanding the gross margin is also the condition for us to be able to progressively put more fuel behind these brands and development.</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:43:19). One question and one clarification. The question is on market shares in Baby Food. Can you review a little bit the situation on the big markets; China, the usual suspects? And that's the question. As far as clarification is concerned, it's not Unimilk; it's Russia. What's the market share of Danone Russia doing? You said that Eastern Europe was a little bit dodgy. Does that apply to Danone Russia?</p>
          <p>The second point on clarification, you said that except Argentina the pricing has been within the range of 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%. Does that apply to Danone Russia as well? And I have been squaring the guidance a little bit. In terms of volumes for H2 of the baby, kids and modern brands, is assuming that it's going to be a volume decline in H2 somewhere between 3% and 5% broadly right? Or am I squaring my numbers wrongly? Thank you.</p>

          <p>I will take the market share question. So in Baby Food, we had a very healthy competitive development in the course of the first half. In China we &#x2013; our market has been stable. So we are collating the market around the 15% market share. The growth of the market has been overall slowing down regularly. Super premium has been growing. The premium segment is slowing down, and the standard segment is going down.</p>
          <p>We believe these trends to be short term, and we continue to think that we need to address the three of these segments with our product offering. Compared to a few competitors that only focus on super premium, it's obviously a negative in our short-term approach, and therefore we believe that this maintained market share is a very good sign of how healthy our business model is in China. In Indonesia, we had strong increase of our market share. Indonesian business in Baby has been growing more than 20%. Market share has been growing 3 points in total. We are already significant leaders and we have increased that leadership. Another significant growth contributor has been the UK. We have a 49% market share with current date here. Again, significant market share gains in the UK for us.</p>
          <p>France, we have a 49% market share. Market is about stable. Situation in France is that we have gained market share in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:46:13) formula and gums, and we have lost a bit of market share in the <mark type="ph" /> winning food (1:46:15) Jars category. For the rest, I think overall we have market share gains, slight market share gains, all over the place. I don't know if I missed a country that &#x2013; which one? Germany's flat in market share. So that's for Baby Food.</p>
          <p>You had a question about the Russia share. It's been increasing. So Danone Russia is doing very well. It's growing faster than the market these days. And basically, the Danone brand is expanding its market share. I made comments on inflation, and you are right to say that Russia was another exception, of course, and that's true for all competitors in the market, including Danone Russia.</p>
          <p>You want to take the other ones?</p>

          <p>Well, on pricing Russia, I'm interested to complete what Emmanuel said. Danone Russia has been doing well. It's been doing well on the back of volumes slightly up low single digit and double-digit pricing. So altogether, it's been growing double-digit with market shares up, as Emmanuel said.</p>
          <p>And I guess your last question about guidance on the Slide 10, which is on the screen. And currently, we're not willing to enter that much into details, okay?</p>

          <p>Well, I'm totally &#x2013; we have to stop now. Thank you very much for your interest in Danone. And I hope, as I said, that you stay with us. Thanks, bye. Thank you.</p>
