          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode; later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Operating Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being hosted from Rio de Janeiro where the Schlumberger Limited board meeting is being held in our Brazil Research and Geoengineering Center.</p>
          <p>Prior to Andrew's comments, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results, and then Paal will provide an overview of the operational results and technical highlights. Before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements.</p>
          <p>And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter EPS excluding charges was $0.71 per share. This is a decrease of $0.14 sequentially and an increase of $0.09 compared to the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we recorded $0.02 of charges relating to the continuing integration of Smith and Geoservices. As we previously announced, the quarter's results, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 were adversely impacted by a number of events. The events included severe weather in North America and Australia, political disturbances in the Middle East and North Africa and the absence of the Q4 early payout of the IPM gain share project in North America, as well as a traditional surge in year end multiclient software and other product sales. These items more than accounted for the sequential decreases in the EPS.</p>
          <p>This is the first quarter that we are reporting under our new group structure. As a reminder, our primary reporting is based on our three groups: Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Reservoir Production. These three groups comprise what we will now refer to as Oilfield Services. In addition, we will report our distribution business as a separate and distinct subject.</p>
          <p>From now on, when we refer to the results of our geographic areas, it reflects the results of all three of the groups, including the legacy Smith oilfield and M-I SWACO businesses. Furthermore, the results of WesternGeco are also now included in both the group and geographic results and are no longer reported separately. This is a significant change from our prior quarter that I wanted to highlight. It is also worth pointing out that the distribution business, which predominantly North American centric, is not included in the geographic results. All prior period amounts that I will mention have been restated to conform to our new structure.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax operating income for Oilfield Services was at $1.5 billion; this represents $240 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. Oilfield Services pre-tax operating margin fell 206 basis points to 17.9%. International pre-tax operating margins were 16.5% for the quarter. Again the previously mentioned events were the primary drivers underlying this performance. From a group perspective, there's a Reservoir Characterization margin fell 606 basis points to 21% as the severe weather and political disturbances significantly hampered wireline activity, while the absence of the year end WesternGeco multiclient and SIS software sales negatively impacted margins on a sequential basis.</p>
          <p>Margin for the Drilling group improved slightly to 14.6% on the strong performances from IPM well construction activity and the number of the acquired Smith businesses in spite of the weather and geopolitical issues.</p>
          <p>Reservoir Production margin decreased 145 basis points to 19.4%, due to the absence of the year end product sales and Artificial Lift and Completion and the Q4 early payout of the IPM gain share project as well as the impact of the weather in North America land. Distribution contributed pre-tax operating income of $22 million.</p>
          <p>On a geographic perspective, North America had a very strong quarter driven by well services activity and pricing. As a result margin increased by 32 basis points despite the absence of the Q4 IPM gain share payout, which accounted for approximately 1.4 percentage points of margin last quarter and the lower multiclient sales.</p>
          <p>Latin America margin increased 78 basis points to 15.7% as the revenue mix strengthened. Europe/CIS/Africa margin decreased by six percentage points to 12.5%. This decrease largely reflects the impact of the political disturbances in Libya and Tunisia, combined with a less favorable revenue mix in Russia and the seasonality effects in the North Sea. The Middle East and Asia margins dipped slightly by 145 basis points to 21.9%. This decrease is almost entirely due to the political events in the area and the weather effects in Australia. The impact of the year end product and software sales also contributed to the decline.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges was 23.6% as compared to 23.1% in the fourth quarter. We still expect the ETR for the full year to be in the mid 20s reflecting the planned mix of activity between North America and the rest of the world. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of cash and investment and short-term debt of $2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Net debt was $4 billion at the end of the quarter as compared to $2.6 billion at the end of last quarter. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $844 million of stock repurchases and $769 million of CapEx. During the quarter, we repurchased 9.68 million shares at an average price of $87.18 per share. Additionally, we have now completed the refinancing of all of the long term fixed rate debt we assumed in the Smith transaction. In this regard, we repurchased $1.3 billion of notes during the quarter. This refinancing will serve to reduce our interest expense going forward. CapEx for only Schlumberger is still expected to approach $4 billion in 2011.</p>
          <p>And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon. Schlumberger first quarter revenue of $8.12 billion decreased 4% sequentially, but increased 45% year on year. The impact of the geopolitical events in North Africa and the Middle East, as well as severe weather in the U.S. and Australia impacted all three product groups and represented around half of the sequential decrease in total Oilfield Services revenue.</p>
          <p>Looking at the product groups, Reservoir Characterization sequential revenue was severely impacted by the geopolitical events that hit WesternGeco lands, testing services and our wireline activity the most. In addition to this, WesternGeco revenue decreased following the fourth quarter surge in multiclient sales in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico even though revenue increased in marine due to a more favorable activity mix.</p>
          <p>SIS revenues fell sharply in all areas from seasonally lower software sales. Testing revenue also fell due to less product sales, lower activity in Latin America and East Asia and due to the winter slowdown in Russia. Wireline revenue was flat sequentially as strong winter activity in Canada offset the impact of the geopolitical and weather events.</p>
          <p>For the Drilling group, the sequential drop in revenue was primarily caused by the geopolitical events, and excluding this impact revenue actually increased for the group. IPM well construction activity increased on strong growth in Iraq, Mexico and Russia. Drilling and Measurement revenue decreased from lower activity and pricing in Europe, CIS and Africa and the completion of offshore exploration projects in Australia/Papua New Guinea, but this was partly offset by the return of some deepwater work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and by an increase in activity in Latin America and Russia.</p>
          <p>M-I SWACO still continued strong activity in North America, but overall revenue decreased due to seasonally lower product sales, the weather in Australia and delayed projects in Europe, CIS and Africa.</p>
          <p>In Reservoir Production, revenues fell sequentially largely due to the impact of the geopolitical events in North Africa and the Middle East, and due to severe weather in the U.S. and in Australia. Excluding these impacts, the Production group revenue increased as higher pricing and strong demand for well services technologies in North America more than offset the IPM gain share payout in North America from the prior quarter and the seasonally lower product sales in Artificial Lift and Completion Systems.</p>
          <p>From a geographical perspective, the Europe CIS and Africa revenues decreased sequentially as a result of the political unrest in North Africa, a less favorable revenue mix, lower software sales in the North Sea geomarket and seasonally lower activity in Russia.</p>
          <p>Middle East and Asia revenue was lower as increasing IPM activity in Iraq and shale gas activity in India were insufficient to offset the impact of geopolitical effects in Middle East, seasonally lower software and product sales and weather-related slowdowns in Australia.</p>
          <p>In North America, excellent growth in pricing, utilization and activity in our Well Services product line resulted in double digit sequential revenue growth, which fully offset lower WesternGeco multiclient sales, the nonreturns of IPM gain share payout and the impact of weather-related slowdowns on land in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, strong growth in WesternGeco and M-I SWACO activity in the Brazil geomarket balanced lower offshore activity and lower software sales in the Mexico and Central America geomarkets.</p>
          <p>Looking at some of the highlights of the quarter, I would like to start off with the WesternGeco, where a number of contract awards in marine emphasized the success of new technology both in acquisition and in processing. Market take-up of Coil Shooting acquisition with successful completion of the survey offshore Brazil and the award of a new coil survey in Angola were particularly notable. The opening of the Brazil Research and Geoengineering Center in Brazil will be key to the processing of the Brazil data, while other centers such as the WesternGeco geosolution center in Jakarta will underline other contracts that have recently been awarded. For the growth in exploration activity to come, WesternGeco is well placed through technology and footprint to make further progress in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>In the Drilling group, we continued to make significant progress in terms of integration and synergies between Smith and Schlumberger products and services to the point that we now see the transaction being neutral on an earnings per share basis in Q2 2011, moving up from our previous estimate of H2 2011.</p>
          <p>In addition to revenue synergies related to our global footprint as well as our IPM and D&amp;M [Drilling &amp; Measurements] businesses, we are also starting to see the first examples of revenue synergies related to new product development. As a result, Smith Bits continues to perform very well, keeping its leadership position in the roller cone markets while at the same time dramatically improving its PDC market share, both in international and North American markets.</p>
          <p>This position is further strengthened by the introduction of the new Spear bit that brings superior performance to our customers operating in unconventional shale basins. We have also recently introduced another new bit based on our unique stinger cutter technology developed by our NovaDrill division in Utah, which has shown up to 80% improvement in drilling rates as well as significant reductions in shock and vibrations.</p>
          <p>At our investor conference in February, we discussed a new HiWAY fracture stimulation technology, and this service continues to see very rapid growth. Total job count is now approaching 1,000, with 528 stages completed in the first quarter of 2011, compared to 102 in the fourth quarter of 2010. The first horizontal openhole well in the Bakken Shale with a total of 19 stages has been successfully completed using HiWAY, and the first job has also been conducted in the Middle East. A significant number of opportunities for future jobs are now under evaluation for HiWAY, and new fields for HiWAY technology deployment are under discussion in the U.S. and in Canada, Argentina, India, Amman, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria, Congo and Angola.</p>
          <p>In the investor conference we also told you about the leading position Schlumberger has established in well intervention and production enhancement to our market leading wireline, slickline and coiled tubing offering. We are currently seeing particularly strong growth in our new coiled tubing service ACTive, which offers real time fiber optic-enabled measurements, and this new service has already been deployed to 20 geomarkets around the world.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to highlight IPM's outstanding drilling performance on the well construction projects in Iraq. All the projects have been mobilized and started on schedule in a very challenging environment, and we are now drilling both for BP and ExxonMobil. On the BP projects, we have already managed to half the drilling time from the first well they drilled through the use of both technology and process optimization. And our ability to consistently redefine the benchmark for this performance is being recognized by our customers.</p>
          <p>With that, I will pass the call over to Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paal. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Despite the difficult working environment, I'm very pleased with the performance of both our North American and international operations during the quarter, where a number of underlying trends were positive. Wireline growth was encouraging, particularly for high technology services. Despite the seasonal drop in Russia and at M-I SWACO, the Drilling group revenue increased through excellent performance at IPM Well Construction, particularly in Iraq.</p>
          <p>In addition, growth in revenue synergies with Smith and Geoservices products was very strong. Reservoir Production continued to make gains in North America in both activity and pricing, which in our total North American results, more than compensated for the absence of the gain share project that was recognized in the fourth quarter and a 42% drop in seismic revenues between the fourth and first quarters. These positive effects limited a decrease in margins to 206 basis points led by strong performance in a number of geomarkets, including Iraq, where we achieved double digit margins that we expect to improve continuously through the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, the recent completion or announcement of various licensing rounds around the world will ensure sustained marine seismic activities. The anticipated increases in exploration budget and the advent of additional development activity, particularly in the Middle East and North America, will rapidly improve business conditions for Wireline and Testing Services.</p>
          <p>The continued success of new Petrel releases, particularly for exploration, will ensure further strong performance from SIS. For Drilling and Measurements, however, despite strong increases in demand, service pricing remains extremely competitive internationally, but excellent service quality and advanced technology allows this effect to be offset to some degree. In addition, call out services on non-contracted rigs have boosted this effect, and further activity increases later in the year should lead to considerable tightening of capacity with a consequence effect on pricing power.</p>
          <p>The absence of oil production from Libya combined with continued recovery and demand has reduced the world's spare capacity of oil production significantly. The call on both fuel oil and natural gas will increase as Japan recovers. The exploration and production industry has begun to respond, and absent a further leg to the recession, and will have to substantially increase investment to maintain a comfortable supply cushion in an era of political uncertainty.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that high oil prices will continue to support additional drilling in the liquid rich plays in North America. The upturn in deepwater activity more generally is becoming increasingly visible, and the rate of permitting in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is accelerating. Middle East activity is increasing substantially led by Saudi Arabia and Iraq.</p>
          <p>These activities will progressively mobilize over the next six months, and the projected increases will reach levels where some resources will become constrained. Schlumberger is ready for this scenario with new technology, equipment and people. Our Excellence in Execution Initiative, which we introduced in 2007, is already paying dividends and will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. I will now hand the call to Stacy for the question-and-answer session. Stacy?</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question will go to the line of Dan Boyd with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, I'd like to just follow up with you on what's going on in North America, and you alluded to this somewhat in your comments with seismic being down, IPM gain not being there this quarter. But what are you seeing especially on land as underlying sort of revenue and margin trends. Just as we look at what one of your competitors put up so far, the numbers look like they may be growing a little bit faster. So maybe can you talk about what you're seeing there and just update us on your strategy of closing the gap in terms of, I think, size and margin within North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Dan. So can we make abstraction that the gain for the IPM project that was sold in Q4, an abstraction for a sequential drop of 42% in seismic revenues, and then I'm going to ask Paal to talk about the rest of our strategy in North America. Is that okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Paal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you look at what we set out to do about five months ago, we set out a goal to basically close the margin gap in North America because at that stage we were severely underperforming in our eyes. So if you look at where we stand at this stage, we have more or less closed this gap. So I'm very pleased with the margin momentum that we have managed to create. And I'm also quite confident that &#x2013; positive in my outlook of our future now margin momentum.</p>
          <p>If you look at land, we are at this stage seeing very strong pricing momentum in both Drilling and Wireline, and I think this will continue in the coming quarters. I also think that our HiWAY introduction, the new technology, is going to help extend our pressure pumping modeling momentum. We're actually seeing some customers switching to our pressure pumping services at this stage at the back of HiWAY.</p>
          <p>We also continue to drive utilization in all segments as part of the restructuring that we have initiated, and we had record utilization again in pressure pumping in March. And also see some impact still to come from the recent restructuring in terms of supply chain services as well general support.</p>
          <p>Now, in addition to that, we are also relatively optimistic on the onset of the Gulf of Mexico coming back, and we have a very strong position in the high end services, so Wireline and Drilling and Measurements, in these new rigs and permits that have been granted. And this, of course, is going to be highly accretive to our <mark type="ph" /> non performance (23:25) going forward. So that's on the margin side.</p>
          <p>On the growth, we are very much committed to investing capacity as we go forward. The quarter to quarter growth for Well Services, as I indicated in my comments, were in double digits, but they were offset by the significant reduction in multiclient sales as well as the nonrecurring gain share we had in IPM. So we are very much, I would say, positive on the outlook of North America at this stage. We have secured manufacturing capacity on pressure pumping in a multiyear build program that we started last year, and we have a lot of flexibility in our program to continue to take significant capacity additions, which is what we are going to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. There's a lot I could probably follow up on with that, but let me just go back to the HiWAY, and it's something you talked about at your analyst day, but how quickly can you build that up? And is that something where we could expect you to start pulling through a lot more services and using that to lead with as a differentiator? But in terms of just scale and how many pressure pumping jobs or how many fleets you could roll that out to, how should we think about the progress that has been made and how quickly that could continue to ramp up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we are ramping this up very quickly as you see. There's some modifications needed to be done on the pressure pumping equipment that we have on the well cut, but this is not significant. So the main thing is just to have the product available to pump, and we have obviously a significant supply line set up to do this, right. So just in terms of the ramp, we did about 100 stages as I said in Q4, and we did over 500 in Q1, and this is now multiplying almost by the day, right. So we have not only in North America, but we are now engaged in looking at Canada, some projects pretty much all over the world. So this is a significant, I would say, growth vehicle for us on pressure pumping, and as I said, even in North America we've had cases where customers have switched to our pressure pumping services in the back end of HiWAY.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And if I could just have one more follow up on just the Gulf of Mexico coming back because that's something that Andrew highlighted at the analyst day as something that could &#x2013; the one upside surprise to really tighten even international market. Sounds like you're optimistic there. But is that something that you think contributes to a much higher incremental margins in the back half of the year? Just broadly in the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I would say so. If you would look at our margins in North America historically, the Gulf of Mexico has always been highly accretive to our business. Over the past year, it has been highly dilutive. So I think it's going to have a significant relative impact to our margin as we go forward.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Andrew and Paal. Andrew, in your comments you mentioned that you believe some resources will be constrained as activity increases. Which product lines would you expect would be constrained first? And I would assume we would likely be in some international markets over others. Could you give us a little color?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that if the Gulf of Mexico plays out, Saudi plays out, the new deepwater rigs seem to be coming on pretty much as we planned them, then the first place that equipment shortages will show up will be Drilling and Measurements. In fact, in some places they're showing up already, which makes complete nonsense with the industry's pricing policy at this point in time. Angie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on international margins, for the third quarter of 2007, we were at 18.7%. Obviously increased in the Q4 to 19.3 on seasonality and as expected declined here in Q1 to 16.5 for international margins. When you think about the second quarter, could we go back to the third quarter level for international margins of 18.7 or do you see that as a second half of 2011 event?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Then finally, there's been some commentary about performance-based contracts for Schlumberger, and it's been an area that you're focusing on globally. Could you give us a little color, what percentage it is of total revenues today, what could it rise to, what customers you're working for, and is there any risk that this could change the dynamics for peak international margins for the cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to let Paal answer the question on the strategy with performance contracting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so we have actively been moving our contract base, in particular, within Drilling and Measurements, towards performance contracts over the past couple of years, and at this stage we have around one third of our contracts for Drilling and Measurements based on performance in various forms. And this is obviously something that we would continue to push going forward.</p>
          <p>Exactly how high it will come, I can't give you an exact number on, but, again, we are setting quite aggressive goals in terms of moving our contracts towards this type of setup. And the key for that is that obviously when you take on a performance-based contract you need to have confidence in your ability to perform, and at this stage we are very confident in our ability. And the reason for that is the excellence in execution program that we embarked on four years ago where we have basically invested heavily both on the product development side to get better performing products but also on the operational processes, and all these elements are now paying off very nicely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and if I can provide a little color to that, Angie. In Q1, the first quarter of 2011, we replaced our competition in Drilling and Measurements on 40 jobs. They replaced us on seven. Almost all 40 we replaced them on were for service quality reasons. We were replaced once for service quality and six times because we didn't have the right tool available. So it's just a very nice point that in this international market, as drilling ramps up, quality is really going to count.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Question for Simon Ayat there. You didn't highlight any sort of magnitude of the negative headwinds in the first quarter that were somewhat unusual. Australia, North Africa &#x2013; I mean we all know, this was a very unusual quarter. Could you give us, not in respect to North America, but with respect to international, can you help us with some kind of magnitude of the negative effect versus kind of a normalized type of core environment? I mean we all know that there's no such thing as normalized. But nevertheless could you help us a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Ole, as we announced before, these impact of geopolitical and weather overall impacted us between $0.08 to $0.10; we're probably more on the lower end of that, which is what happened in the first quarter. Some of it is North America. The weather impact of it is North America, but the rest is international. So we are in that range that we announced, partly is North America, but the large part of this is international, because of the geopolitical and the Australia weather, the severe weather we experienced in Q1. Does this answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So if you look at the margin impact from that, say for international, so would this be &#x2013; so in percentage terms, on international margins, what does that translate into?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to give you a percentage, Ole, but the decremental was very high because weather you can't cut costs, and when you're evacuating a place like Libya you have very high decremental costs. So you can assume it was a very high percentage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was trying to get a feel for sort of as things normalize without pricing where your margins would be, but I think I can back into it from what you've said. Second question, Andrew, I mean talking about this nonsense pricing that the industry has engaged on, I mean how much of your capacity is tied up on nonsense pricing at the moment, and when do you think it will roll off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not a great deal as yet. There are probably one or two fairly large contracts where to retain them we've gone to nonsense pricing, but as long as those contracts are long term we know very well that in a year's time we won't be selling the technology we bid on. So the possibility to recover margin is very much there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's not &#x2013; what I'm worried about is &#x2013; what I'm concerned about is that we're going into a market where the demand for this service is picking up very, very rapidly, and we still see a lot of nonsense pricing out there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They will realize it when &#x2013; and it's happened in one or two places already, when they win contracts that they can't service because then the customers will become upset. And once the customers become upset, if you want to provide a decent service, you have to pay for it, right, so the emphasis will shift.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see a scenario where international margins could catch up with North American margins, and if so when would that be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's going to depend an awful lot on two things in North America. The first is the speed with which the Gulf comes back after this initial flush of permits, right, so what is the total rig count in the Gulf going to look like in 2012? And the second is will, even if activity doesn't roll over, pricing roll over on land in North America because of the surge in capacity. So those two effects on North American margins are a little bit unknown at the moment. But I think that absent a second leg to the recession or a severe drop in demand due to high oil prices that the trend in international margins will, in the back half of this year, should accelerate. I mean we are, as I said in my comments, more and more confident that the activity is there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Andrew. Finally this one, could you quantify what you mean when you say spare capacity in the global oil markets have tightened up significantly as a result of Libya, could you share a little bit more of your thoughts on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you've lost &#x2013; well, I mean, very rough numbers, you've lost 800,000 to 1 million barrels a day out of Libya, which is having to be made up by other people, which means that from the global spare capacity which you could calculate as really being around five million, 4.5, five million barrels a day, you've lost a million. And I actually think that the political uncertainty will add to the need to add spare capacity or to have more spare capacity available in the world.</p>

          <p>No, I still think it's early days, Ole.

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could we spend a little time on your seismic outlook, please, very nicely optimistic. I guess maybe one way of asking the question is how much of your optimism is based on the broad demand for seismic services, for marine contract services, specifically versus kind of nice illustrations of Coil Shooting technology and uptake there or continued up tick, but how much is sort of technology driven and specifically Schlumberger technology? Just trying to parse between those two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the main basis for our optimism at this stage is the fact that we have a very, very strong technology position, both on the acquisition side and on the processing side, all right. So the examples we showed on Coil Shooting is obviously at the absolute high end of it, but there's also a lot of other technologies within the offering which is unique to us. So we are quite, I would say, upbeat and optimistic on the basis of this strong technology position.</p>
          <p>I think what's going to be the key element that's going to determine the up tick on the marine pricing is going to be what's happening &#x2013; what is going to happen in the Gulf, right, and whether the lease sale round is going to go forward at the end of this year or early 2012. If that is the case, then I think there will be significantly more multiclient acquisition activity in the Gulf, which again is going to tie up vessels that are currently on third party, and this again will then hopefully create the pricing traction that we are looking for. But the counter to that is whether some of the players, more specifically my Norwegian friends, keep adding vessels to the global seacraft. But overall the technology position is at this stage what makes us quite optimistic and upbeat on seismic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understand. Just a couple, maybe just quick follow-ups on that. So I understand the Gulf position, but I guess you have new horizons in Brazil that you're securing some work to shoot as well as I'm sure there's more to come. Obviously you have a number of emerging basins. I guess the suggestion is that can all soak up what capacity is today, and is it a tighter outlook on that basis than perhaps you've been suggesting the last six months, or is it pretty similar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think overseas it is pretty similar, right. We've had these surveys planned, and they're all going ahead, and that's good, and some of them are actually going more high tech than what we initially thought. But I think the main delta here is how many vessels are going to be attracted into the Gulf of Mexico as we get ready for these lease sale rounds.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add, if I may, Paal, that the awards of blocks in the Kwanza Basin in Angola, where all the people who have been awarded have a time limit in which they have to shoot 2,500 square kilometers of seismic, is a fairly significant event in demand over the next 18 months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning, guys. I've got a couple of quick follow ups. First on North America, if I think about just the changing complexion of the market with liquids and foreign capital, IOCs coming back, does the liquids and just the call it the toolkit required to get at that resource and the operator mix shift at all? Does Schlumberger benefit disproportionately from those two factors, you think, in terms of your opportunities for market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say not at this stage. I still think, as you know, I've said on many occasions, that for both these liquid rich plays as well as the gas plays, that longer term &#x2013; the current technology is extremely wasteful. And longer term that's going to shift, and it's going to shift to a point where the completed zones will be pinpointed rather than being almost statistically fracked. But the technology is still two or three years away from that, probably.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the resource that we're after doesn't really change that underlying trend that you've been talking about for a while, then?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Quickly a follow up on the seismic side. Paal, your comment that sort of the technology uptake early on, if I could sort of think about exploration cycles from leasing rounds to seismic acquisition, I think the uptake rate historically was pretty slow in the sense that you had lease and then some maybe 2D, and as you got more comfortable you went to 3D. But the technology penetration seems to be occurring a lot faster in the cycle. So is it correct to say that there's in effect a double lever this time around in that exploration activity is growing very rapidly and that you're seeing that technology penetration much sooner in the cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I'm just going to answer that because it's a subject I really enjoy. The advent of our technology is almost redefining the way in which people will do their initial delineation after 3D. So, for example, a lot of the work we're doing in Brazil is, they've made the discovery. They've identified the reservoir, but before they go into development, they want to have a really, really high resolution map of the actual reservoir from seismic. So the technology is redefining to a certain extent the way that they're applying it, applying seismic as a tool.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I can add, I think also in the past you may have had options of whether you went with 2D or conventional 3D, and you could still get a reasonable view of the reservoir. Some of the reservoirs that we are chasing now are below salt. There is only one option in some cases, and that is Coil Shooting, right. So in fact the need to move to high-end technology even to get some type of answer, it's a lot more significant at this stage. And that's why I think the technology uptake again is going to be quicker and higher.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The question I have is when you look at the numbers you had very impressive international margin performance, something around 900 basis points better than your closest competitor. What dynamics are in place that can provide Schlumberger with the opportunity to increase this spread, and do these dynamics provide a unique opportunity for Schlumberger relative to your competitors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you look at &#x2013; look at the margins overseas, again similar to North America, we are also &#x2013; I'm also very confident in our ability to basically continue to widen the margin gap that we have versus the competition. Some of the reason for that is that we still see significant margin upside from the Smith integration as we continue to get both the revenue synergies and the cost synergies.</p>
          <p>As we switch into the exploration phase, the value mix of our services is, I would say, still significantly higher or more favorable than that of our competitors. And also given our size at this stage and the focus that we have put over the past year on internal efficiencies, there's significant cost and margin potential from our size. So I would say that generally the margin momentum we have overseas is significant, and we will continue to pursue it and maintain a very meaningful margin gap towards our competition.</p>

          <p>Andrew, I had a question about the Middle East specifically. Obviously see the ramp up that's occurring in Iraq, and we have improving trends in Saudi here. For your other customers in the region, are they starting to consider or starting to accelerate programs in response to this perhaps to secure service capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we've seen that yet, but I don't think it's very far away, James.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, absolutely not. No. And also the Gulf.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Right.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And then one question actually on the Gulf of Mexico, it has been a negative drag on earnings. If we assume your cost structure as it is today and your current market share, historical market share there, how many rigs do you need running in deepwater to turn break-even or positive from an earnings perspective in the Gulf?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've never been negative in the Gulf. So we've kept most of the infrastructure in place. We did not export a bunch of equipment, so there's not a huge amount of investment. And we will bring people &#x2013; the very skilled people who we've been using overseas from the Gulf back into the Gulf. So the actual cost structure is not going to be significantly different from what it was before. So we will &#x2013; the margins as Paal pointed out a few minutes ago are going to accelerate pretty rapidly.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, Andrew, you probably have as good an insight on the mentality of the NOCs as anyone out there. Just kind of a related question on what James was asking, but specifically about Manifa. Would Manifa have happened at this time if it wasn't for Libya? In other words, was Manifa planning to go at this stage all along, or have we seen a change in kind of the way Aramco is operating, and they're kind of accelerating things? And I guess you're saying you think it's out there, has anything kind of shifted in terms of your views of the international cycle as it kind of all fits in together?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm absolutely not going to make any comments on the specific policy of Saudi Aramco. They always had the option of accelerating Manifa, and at various times in the last few years, they've slowed it down, and they've accelerated it now. Why they're doing it at this point in time, it's not for me to speculate.</p>
          <p>But, yes, I think that the absence of Libyan production worries the oil producers generally because while they like a high oil price, they do not like too high an oil price because of the potential it has to destroy demand. So will we see greater activity from other NOCs? I think we probably will. And also don't forget that this activity that's being added, we do not see that coming at the expense of the expansion of gas activity, which is already taking place in the Middle East.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it fair to say you're incrementally more positive on terms of the timing of the international spend than you were 90 days ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a great deal more comfort than &#x2013; well, firstly I have more comfort that it's happening because we can see what's being bid, what's being mobilized and all the rest of it. And given the geopolitical circumstances, the condition of Libya and Japan and everything else, yes, I think that I'm much more confident that the international spend is going to come back faster.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also, Andrew, in your release you were talking about exploration spending picking up, and we're certainly seeing it pretty well distributed globally. I was wondering if you could just kind of provide some context as you see how exploration versus development spending evolves over the next couple of years compared to last cycle. In other words, if you look out the next kind of 12 months, how does that kind of spending mix of exploration &#x2013; where does that compare? Should we be looking at kind of like '05, '06, and how that ramped up? How are you thinking about that as you look out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the biggest &#x2013; there are two significant changes in the way that exploration might occur in this cycle. The first is obviously the availability of deepwater rigs and their relative increase in our knowledge of how to prospect in deepwater compared to five or six years ago. That's one. And the second is that the national oil companies are themselves coming back to exploration, which is not something that they did on any scale in the previous cycle. So generally &#x2013; and if you look at the &#x2013; a basket of oil companies, private ones, the reserves to production ratios are not great. So where they have accretion, it's going to be prospective at these oil prices. I think they will substantially increase their exploration spend, and you've seen one or two of them announce that.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Sticking with the Middle East/Asia Pacific region here quickly, Andrew, back in '05, '06, '07, we had sort of annualized revenue growth of 20% to 30%, almost hard to believe that now. I mean, clearly you were coming from a smaller base. You were in the midst of Saudi tripling its rig count. But based upon the broad and building swell that you're seeing right now in the Middle East, do we get back to those kind of annualized revenue growth rates, do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, firstly you have to remember that the biggest change between now and then is we have Smith.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have the opportunity to expand both Smith and M-I SWACO in those regions that we did not have in the previous cycle. Activity wise, I don't think that it will &#x2013; I still don't think it's going to ramp as fast as it did in '05, '06, because the tripling of the rig count in Saudi was a sort of once-in-a-100 year event almost overseas because overseas never normally goes that fast. But over time, can we double Schlumberger in Asia again? Yes, I think we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, with regard to Drilling and Measurement sort of performance-based contracts, I'm curious as to how your appetite for performance-based contracts, Paal, will shift in the event that we get the supply and demand framework for D&amp;M tightening and pricing improving demonstrably relative to the super competitive environment today. Does that lessen your appetite for performance-based pricing in an improving overall pricing environment, or is it still sort of a strategy of yours irrespective of pricing where you want more performance-based contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I don't think a tightening of capacity necessarily is going to change our strategy on that. I think the benefit of this model is that we have the ability to set ourselves apart from the competition due to the stronger performance that we have. And obviously if there's a tightening of capacity and the base prices continue to go up, there will have to be a higher value for the performance that we put up, right. But the contractual framework very much holds water in a tighter capacity situation as well. So we will continue to push that and make sure that we get our fair share of the value that we create with our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now I'm sure it varies by contract and by customer, but remind us basically the framework of how performance-based pricing works? What's the base pricing, if you will? Is it at a discount to what you would otherwise charge in a standard contract? And clearly you're going to get something above and beyond what you would get on a standardized basis in the event that you deliver on the performance. But remind us the framework, if you will, as to how the performance-based pricing works?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what you said is pretty much the case. These things vary significantly in terms of how you formulate it in the various contracts with the various customers. But the principle is that there is a basic fee that we get for being there and doing the work, and that could typically be lower than what normal pricing would be. But then there is a similar upside for us to harvest in the event that we outperform what is currently perceived to be the benchmark. And the benchmark would be the average performance of, I would say, us and the various competitors. So exactly how you formulate that in a contract varies somewhat, but that's the basic principle, and by having that basic principle it's just a matter of how much you put on the basic fee and how much you put on the performance upside, and at the at the end of the day, for us to deploy equipment into these type of contracts for customers in a tightening market, it would have to be attractive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go to the line of Mike Urban with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Andrew or Paal, you talked about the tightening you see in pricing, I guess initially in Drilling and Measurements. Is that, given the increased visibility that you've seen, was that something you felt was going to be happening any way as we progressed here, or has that been more of a function of Saudi coming back into the market in terms of your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One more time, I always thought &#x2013; I may have been wrong, but D&amp;M would be the segment that tightens first partly because they lose a lot of equipment. So if you have an increase in activity, the normal rates of equipment losses, things tend to tighten very fast, unless the industry is completely overbuilt. Now the Gulf of Mexico and Saudi Arabia are both very heavy users of D&amp;M equipment. So those events have probably given us confidence that pricing is going to come back sooner. Is that okay with you, Paal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree. We said year end earlier on, and I think it will definitely be by year end, if not the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then after D&amp;M, where would we progress in terms of the tightening cycle in pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think the next segment that we would see that in would be most likely Openhole Wireline. That's the next in line for that. So probably similar type of timeframe, maybe slightly after Drilling and Measurements, but very quickly Wireline as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then where do you have &#x2013; conversely where do you have the most excess capacity in the industry? What would be last to tighten?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What will be last? Where should we see &#x2013; expect to see pricing lagging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult to say. That will depend an awful lot on how capacity evolves in North America.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, you've mentioned a couple of times now that either you've replaced one of your competitors on several contracts or that &#x2013; I guess you anticipate perhaps doing it in the future given their inability to deliver on contracts. I'm just curious, when you're replacing someone on these contracts, are you doing it &#x2013; so not only getting the volume pick up, but are you doing it typically at a higher price than what the competitor was doing that work for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not an insurance policy for our competitors. In other words, if we replace them, we do not agree to the contractual terms that they accepted to get the job. If we accept to replace them at their contract value, we're just an insurance policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sure, sure. So there is some embedded pricing improvement, I guess, in that. And then just one follow up -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Paal wants to say something, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we decide to take on someone else's contract, whether that's for one well or two wells or whatever it is, we will obviously look at the value of that contract and whether it's something that we do want to take on. So it would have to be attractive again for us to do it, and increasingly so when our competition keeps bidding low and our customers want us to come and bail them out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. Just as we look forward a quarter or two here, can y'all give some just sense in terms of you had almost a 10% drop in eastern hemisphere revenues in first quarter from fourth quarter. Just &#x2013; I know we had seasonal issues clearly that were addressed, but can we just talk a little bit about topline recovery here as we look out the next couple of quarters, and maybe how you guys think about eastern hemisphere as a whole year-over-year growth, perhaps 2011 versus 2010, given what's going on in North Africa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the bulk of the revenue drop outside North America was either seasonal or geopolitical. So obviously Libya is not coming back, right. The rest of it probably will, and the mobilization of projects towards the end of the quarter offshore was quite high. So second quarter, can we recover what we lost compared to Q4, for example? I don't think we're going to be very far away.</p>
