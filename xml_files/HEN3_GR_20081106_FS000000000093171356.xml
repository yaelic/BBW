          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome at our fall Analyst and Investor Conference taking place this time here in London. The agenda that we want to propose to you for today is the following. We will start with an overview of our Q3 results that will be done by our CFO, Lothar Steinebach. That will take about 25 minutes and then we will &#x2013; for the final reason why we are here &#x2013; start with Kasper Rorsted, our CEO, who will present you then Henkel's strategy, mid-term targets for 2010 and '12.</p>
          <p>This is a short introduction from my side, and we pass over now to Lothar Steinebach for the Q3 results of Henkel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome again, on behalf of the Henkel management team. I'll start with financials for Q3, since I have only 25 minutes I'll skip the disclaimer, and start with the highlights of Q3 2008 key financials.</p>
          <p>You've seen that already in our communication, strong sales growth of 12% with even stronger sales growth in the growth regions, plus 24.1%. Organically growth in the total company, 3.5%, adjusted operating profit up 6.3, adjusted earnings per preferred share up 3.5%. That in our view is a solid performance in a challenging environment, as you know obviously know that this challenging environment is not going to go away anytime soon.</p>
          <p>Some key facts. Double-digit sales growth in emerging markets, 13.5% organic sales growth that is slightly lower than what we have experienced over the past, but it's still at a very high level. Growth regions increasing share of sales, total Henkel sales to 39%. So we continue on the pace to accelerate the share of sales in the growth regions in our total portfolio.</p>
          <p>We're seeing slowing markets in North America, even some decline in Western Europe. We have had yet another successful quarter of strong performance in reducing our net working capital in percent of sales by 110 basis points to 12.8%. We have also generated free cash flow, permitting us to reduce our net debt by &#x20AC;108 million versus prior quarter. And we have instituted additional cost chase measures &#x2013; initiated additional cost chase measures to take effect in the fourth quarter in order to be able to satisfy expectations that we've seen in the market and also finish with a strong performance full year 2008.</p>
          <p>Sales and EBIT performance. Some detail on our divisions, Laundry &amp; Homecare, Personal Care, Adhesive Technologies. First Laundry &amp; Homecare, 3.4% organic growth, which is composed of even stronger growth in terms of price impact, 4.5%, and a negative volume, minus 1.1. Total growth of Henkel, 3.5% organic growth, which again is almost exclusively price driven. And we've seen pricing component in our growth over the quarters from one through two and three now to increase in importance in our total portfolio. So we are now at 3.5% organic sales growth, which is almost entirely or is entirely from pricing activities over the total Company.</p>
          <p>With respect to Laundry &amp; Homecare, we have implemented successfully price increases, in major part obviously in the emerging countries and the growth regions, which has permitted us to realize strong growth in terms of pricing impact on our total growth. We've also started price increases in Western Europe and we have announced and initiated price increases in North America. Some parts in Europe have already been implemented and have taken effect, but not all. So therefore, pricing impact, particularly from Western Europe and North America should increase in the fourth quarter, once again, over the third quarter.</p>
          <p>And we have continued to have strong organic growth in the emerging markets in our Laundry &amp; Homecare division. Again, double-digit growth in emerging markets, which is a very strong performance even for the strong growth that we see in the markets there.</p>
          <p>Personal Care's organic growth 3.4%; of which 0.7 is price and 2.7, volume. So here again, there is less of pressure on the input side on the Personal Care business and therefore we have been able to increase our volume without having the need for particular pricing activities in order to improve our margin. So major part of our growth in Personal Care is from volume growth, market share gains which we have realized, particularly in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>In terms of business units, strategic business units which have been performing particularly well in our Personal Care portfolio, the Hair and Body, that being the growth drivers, and we've had continuing strong growth in the emerging markets, which is not a surprise, but perhaps another surprise is our strong growth in North America organic growth, which we have experienced already in the second quarter. You may remember that I've pointed that out after the second quarter and we've continued with our organic growth in North America against the weak market.</p>
          <p>Adhesive Technology, 3.6, again, big impact from price, 4.7%, negative impact from volume. We have seen the industrial business weakening in the third quarter already. Building has continued on a robust growth path, which is a major part in Eastern Europe continues to grow strongly. We have again experienced good growth in emerging markets, with weaker industrial sales in North America and Western Europe.</p>
          <p>We've also taken some actions to get rid of underperforming parts of our business there, so therefore that accounts for part of the volume decrease, it's not entirely the market. We've deliberately priced some of our products such that we get either higher margins or else get out of this business. So therefore that has contributed to the negative volume growth that we have experienced.</p>
          <p>Sales growth by region; again differentiated by foreign exchange adjusted and organic growth. Europe, Africa, Middle East, it's a little bit difficult to interpret because it is obviously composed of Eastern Europe and Western Europe. And I mentioned earlier that Western Europe has been weak and Eastern Europe continues to be strong. So therefore the mix 3.7 is good growth given the portfolio, the stronger part &#x2013; bigger part still in Western Europe of total sales.</p>
          <p>North America, slight organic growth, slightly ahead of last year which means that parts of our business, particularly the industrial sector have been below last year and parts, and I mentioned, particularly cosmetics, have been ahead of last year in terms of organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>Another strong quarter for Latin America, our businesses in Latin America, 12.4% organic growth; that is a very strong performance and continues to be one of our highlights.</p>
          <p>Asia Pacific, weaker organic growth, we've seen third quarter impacted by some of the weakness already in the industrial sector. You know that some of the steel companies in China have not resumed, for a period of time, production and therefore some of that has had an impact on our businesses as well.</p>
          <p>Taking emerging countries, growth regions together, double-digit growth, 13.5%, I mentioned that at the very beginning, in our highlights, 13.5% organic growth. So that's the composition of all the emerging markets in which we're in with a strong performance in Latin America and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>EBIT growth by business sector, with an impact on the margin, Laundry &amp; Homecare with a negative EBIT growth compared to last year &#x2013; last year's quarter, minus 90 basis points change but still on a high level, 11.0%. That's still a very satisfactory performance given the challenging environment.</p>
          <p>We have experienced, particularly in the first six months, significant raw material cost increases, which we have not yet been able to fully offset. And I mentioned that some of the raw material price increases which have hit us in the first six months will continue to have an impact in the second six months, particularly the third quarter.</p>
          <p>It is an improvement of 160 basis points over the second quarter. So therefore that already shows that our pricing actions should have an impact, have improved our situation in terms of margin and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter, where we see a leveling off of the impact of raw material price increases, while our price increases will take then full effect, particularly in Western Europe, some of those countries in Western Europe and in North America.</p>
          <p>Adhesive Technologies was minus 200 basis points compared to last year's Q3. First of all, we've had significant raw material price increases. Here again, we're trailing in terms of offsetting raw material price increases by our own price increases but we're on a very good track.</p>
          <p>And I mention that some of the actions that we've taken in order to eliminate low margin businesses have had an impact on volume but have had a positive impact on margin.</p>
          <p>Without the impact of the integration costs of 19 million, the downturn would have been only 100 basis points. So there again, we're on a good path forward.</p>
          <p>Let us try to explain the difference between the way we've been reporting our central R&amp;D expenses last year versus this year. We had a portion of our R&amp;D as a central R&amp;D unit, reported under corporate. We have reassigned all the units that have been part of the central R&amp;D unit into the business divisions. We've communicated about this extensively. This is just showing the impact on the margin as a result of reassigning resources to the Laundry &amp; Homecare division. We've had a negative of 30 basis points, or put differently, without this action, margin in Laundry &amp; Homecare would have been 11.3%. Under the same scenario, margin in Personal Care would have been 12.7% and Adhesives Technologies 9.2%.</p>
          <p>There's obviously no impact on total Group because that's a reassignment from corporate into the business divisions, but obviously it's important to understand the special changes that we've been implementing.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings, how do we get to adjusted earnings and the 6.3% growth over last year? Reported operating earnings, reported EBIT 191, one-time charges 19 million, normal restructuring 4 million, pretty low level, extraordinary restructuring 177. I'll show in a second what that is composed of.</p>
          <p>That therefore results in adjusted EBIT of 391 or 6.3% growth over last year. Margin minus 60 basis points compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Global Excellence accounts for 168 million of the 177 and National Starch 9 million.</p>
          <p>Income statement, this is providing some more detail on the development of our GP1 margin, gross profit margin. As you can see, as reported we have a decrease of 470 basis points to 41.8. How has that come about? This is providing the detail. We have had an increase in GP1 margin by price volume impact of two percentage points, we've had a negative impact of cost of sales, raw material price increases of 2.4% and others &#x2013; various others 0.4% positive.</p>
          <p>Therefore, without special impacts, which I will explain in a second, we would have had the same margin that we had last year. So we're stable in terms of the operating GP1 margin on a normalized level.</p>
          <p>Further, negative impact from the restructuring expenses that we've taken 2.9% and National Starch, which is composed basically of two things. The one is the margin, GP1 margin of National Starch is lower than the Henkel average. So therefore initially National Starch on a GP1 level is dilutive. Plus there's an impact from raw material price increases. Again, the negative impact on the National Starch business.</p>
          <p>Now following the realization of synergies, National Starch won't be dilutive on the GP1 level, but initially, and we communicated this, it is dilutive. So that therefore closes the gap to the 41.8%.</p>
          <p>Price increases contained in the cost of sales National Starch and Henkel of more than 120 million in this quarter for direct materials and including National Starch.</p>
          <p>Restructuring charges by cost line, total of 181, composed of 98 relating to cost of sales, 17 to marketing, selling and distribution expenses, 45 to R&amp;D, and administrative expenses 21. That then adds up to 181, I hope.</p>
          <p>Income statement adjusted for restructuring, gross profit to adjusted EBIT. First of all sales, cost of sales, numbers that you know, gross profit 1.670, and we have changes in R&amp;D and administrative expenses, increases by 20% or 28%.</p>
          <p>Explanation, we have a higher R&amp;D ratio compared to total Henkel in the National Starch business. There again, there'll be some synergies to be realized and therefore the ratio is going to come down somewhat.</p>
          <p>You also know from, I guess from history, from memory, that the R&amp;D ratio in our Adhesive Technology business is above the Henkel average. So the 3.1% that we have inherited with the National Starch business is not unusual. Our Technology business has been above 3% as well. But obviously, it is increasing total expenses for R&amp;D on the Group level and thereby increasing the ratio somewhat initially.</p>
          <p>Second, with respect to administrative expenses, there again that's pre-synergies, that's an increase through the acquisition and there are two impacts. First of all, we are taking over an existing business which runs with its own structure and has been running with its own structure, which in turn permits us to realize synergies, because obviously once integrated into our administrative processes, we'll be utilizing much fewer resources than what we do need at the very beginning when taking over the business.</p>
          <p>So that's therefore an initial negative impact in terms of administrative expenses on the Group and therefore part of the synergy realization story that we expect for National Starch.</p>
          <p>Changes in the financial results. In Q3, we have a negative of 48 million compared to 22 the year before. Here's the explanation. It's not the investment result, it is entirely in net interest. An increase in net interest is entirely due to the fact that we had to finance the National Starch acquisition. Obviously last year we did not have the additional debt that we took on in order to finance the National Starch acquisition.</p>
          <p>That again is composed of partly additional debt capital and utilization of cash that we would otherwise have invested and generated returns.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operating activities changed in one through nine of this year versus last year. We have a higher rate of depreciation of non-current assets. That again is a major part or entirely due to depreciation that we've taken in the Global Excellence program. So the difference is entirely due to depreciation that we've taken on as part of the Global Excellence program.</p>
          <p>That's our major pride, we've been able to increase or to decrease the ratio of net working capital and cash net working capital to sales. It's a fantastic success story over the past three years, even longer. We started out at 18.1%, we're now at 12.8. Again, another improvement over last year of 110 basis points. That's something which we've been very proud of because it has generated lots of free cash flow that we can utilize to reduce debt and also in order to fund our growth.</p>
          <p>Net debt development, that's simple, a little bit more than 108 million, which we have reduced our net debt level at the end of Q3, in major part through free cash flow against which financial &#x2013; other financial transactions.</p>
          <p>Debt structure and maturity, that's perhaps an interesting point these days. In the past five years that I've been CFO of this Company, nobody was ever asking for this but today we are getting questions. What is the maturity profile of our debt, are we secure in terms of our access to funds, what is the situation? We have assured two major bonds, the Hybrid Bond and the Senior Note, 1.3 billion and 1 billion.</p>
          <p>Maturity of the Hybrid is 2104, that's a long time to go. Obviously, there's some triggers in &#x2013; I don't want to argue around it, so therefore there's some likelihood depending on the interest rates obviously that this might be retired in 2014 but be that as it may, the duration of this Hybrid is 2104.</p>
          <p>The Senior Note has a duration until 2013 and we have the remaining part of the acquisition financing, which is bridge loan, we've communicated that we've taken basically two tranches of bridge loans. One was 1.6 billion, the other was 1 billion. We have retired the 1 billion already, so that &#x2013; what is remaining is the 1.6 billion was the duration until 2010.</p>
          <p>Now the remainder of our financing is bank and other loans, 1.2 million with further durations in commercial paper and you know that's up to three months.</p>
          <p>What is the status of our commercial paper? Interesting because we've been able to access the commercial paper market in the U.S. as well as in Europe without any problems. We're obviously rolling over these amounts every month because there's always one-third that is to be rolled over.</p>
          <p>We have not had any issue with getting it done. We're financing still at very attractive rates. I guess you're aware that normally banks in lending to each other use interbank lending rates or else something below that. And today that market is somewhat dry, to put it mildly, but we get financing at interbanking rates minus. So therefore, that's a very attractive financing instrument for us.</p>
          <p>We have no immediate need for refinancing. We have therefore &#x2013; we still have some cash available at the end of September, and therefore we feel in a very secure position in terms of our financing.</p>
          <p>Global Excellence and National Starch, we have booked in the third quarter &#x2013; at the end of third quarter 395 million restructurings of the total volume of 500 million, which we still expect for the full year 2008.</p>
          <p>We have confirmed savings of 30 million to be realized already in 2008. We have realized 8 million of that, therefore a little bit more than 20 million remaining for the fourth quarter, which will help us in reaching our targets.</p>
          <p>Implementation of the program, albeit difficult is still very well on track, so therefore we're going to get there.</p>
          <p>National Starch acquisition, similar picture, although we've booked less, 32 million of restructurings, we still expect to have one time charges of 250 million in 2008. And we have confirmed our expectation to realize 20 million of savings yet in 2008, of which 7 million have already been realized in Q3.</p>
          <p>There again, the integration process is well underway, which means that we have established the structure that we wanted to establish in order to go forward with this business as an integrated part of the Henkel businesses, of the UA business of Henkel.</p>
          <p>We've also pretty much confirmed and defined what other actions we need to take in order to go through the other items of restructuring and therefore we're very well on track in getting our program executed in the terms that I described.</p>
          <p>Updated outlook, what are the trading conditions that we expect for the rest of this year? We've seen slowing markets in North America and Western Europe already. That's going to continue. You've seen how some of the announcements that some of our customers have already made, closed down their facilities for a week or extend Christmas holidays or similar actions.</p>
          <p>So therefore, while we do expect, and that's based on statistics that are publicly available, that total car production will be slightly ahead of last year in total. We do expect that fourth quarter will be a weaker quarter in that respect.</p>
          <p>We do expect emerging markets with further expansion. We've seen a little bit of slowdown but not much. You've seen the 13.5% which we have experienced in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We do expect consumer spending to be stable. That doesn't mean that the competitive situation is alleviating, it's going to be as tough as it has always been and it remains our job to maintain and increase our market share. Industry output is expected to weaken over the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We still see some direct material cost increases which have peaked in the third quarter and therefore we would expect stabilization at a high single-digit level. What we expect is that the decrease &#x2013; the rapid decrease in the oil price obviously will come into the system of raw materials with a time delay between three and six months. That's what we always communicated.</p>
          <p>We've seen the peak of the oil price at the end of the second quarter, so therefore we'll see a little bit of relief already in the fourth quarter and some more then in next year. And we expect the dollar to remain strong for the time being, at least for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, we would describe the environment to remain challenging certainly for the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>This is the updated outlook. Sales, we confirm our 3 to 5% organic sales growth. One through nine were 4.3%, so we feel pretty confident that we're going to make our 3 to 5% organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>One-time charges and restructuring charges to be adjusted in order to arrive at adjusted EBIT, 770 to 780, that's the number that we've communicated.</p>
          <p>Consistently adjusted EBIT, Henkel, around 10% based on EBIT OF 1,370 of last year. That should be within expectations of the market. Adjusted EPS, based on &#x20AC;2.19, in the low to single-digit commensurate with the adjusted EBIT increase.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, that therefore requires a strong finish that we need to deliver in the fourth quarter and we have taken all actions that are needed in order for us to be able to deliver a strong finish.</p>
          <p>We continue to expect strong organic sales growth in the emerging markets and we'll continue to have an impact from the price increases not only in the emerging markets but also in the mature countries where we have announced and implemented the price increases already.</p>
          <p>Characterizing our business performance, we would describe Laundry &amp; Homecare as catching up. We've been trailing some of the strong impact from the raw material price increases in the first six months. We've taken actions, counter actions and we're now getting the benefit.</p>
          <p>Personal Care is very well on track. That's a fantastic performance that we've seen on Personal Care in terms of sales growth as well as margin improvement, so therefore, that's a very strong finish that we're going to expect from Personal Care.</p>
          <p>Adhesive Technologies remains challenged, not only because of the increase in the input costs, but also because of what we see in our customer industries that relates to some of the announcements that have been made and some other risks that may be materializing over the next months.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBIT growth in Q4, how do we think that we get to our outlook? First of all, we're getting an additional quarter of National Starch, that's obviously clear. We will have an higher impact from our own price increases and I've been alluding to that several times because of the delay that we had in order to get the price increases into the retail.</p>
          <p>We do expect 35 million additional savings from Global Excellence in National Starch based on our expectation for the full year and what we have realized already in Q3 and we have defined an additional savings of 25 million from additional cost chase measures. Lots of different actions which we have communicated into the Henkel organization. Everybody is, perhaps not excited, but certainly fiercely determined to deliver on this promise.</p>
          <p>And that therefore, concludes my Q3 and outlook. I hand over to Kasper Rorsted.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lothar. I will choose to stand. The title is not chosen randomly; With Focus on Core Business to Higher Margins. It is chosen very deliberately because we do believe that if we were to pull out one objective for the next four years, it is improving the profitability of our Company to get into the range of what we believe is realistic.</p>
          <p>What I'm presenting to you here today has been discussed and agreed with our Board with our top 200 managers and tomorrow we'll have a video broadcast for 5,000 managers across the world. So there is a common and clear understanding of where we're taking it. It has been today communicated internally.</p>
          <p>So, it's a plan that has been driven top down with a bottom up input, but it's a plan where we've details behind it on the different activities and from a timing standpoint.</p>
          <p>But let me start, we've defined three key priorities and under each of those there is a number of sub-segments that I'll go through today, they'll be the key drivers for taking us forward and defining our strategic objectives for the next four years and the consequent financial consequences of doing this.</p>
          <p>The three objectives are, achieving our full business potential; the second is, increasing our focus on our key customers; and the third is, looking upon and strengthening not only our team but the performance of our team.</p>
          <p>In order to take you through the presentation I will go through a starting point, where we see the Company today, go through each of the three strategic priorities which I just described, take you through the bridge between the strategic priorities and the financial targets for 2012 and then summarize. And following that we'll have the Q&amp;A session, both on the fiscal year '08, but also the planning between '08 and '12.</p>
          <p>We are coming from a position, and these are our assumptions that we maintain our current structure of the Company with three business Groups, the Toiletries and Cosmetics and Adhesives. That is the assumption upon which we built the strategic priorities.</p>
          <p>What we're seeing is, and Lothar has alluded to it today, we're seeing a slowdown in the U.S. and also slowdown/stop in Western Europe. We are seeing the financial crisis, it is affecting the overall economy and we are seeing very high volatility in feedstock and currencies.</p>
          <p>Just as an example, I was reading the Financial Times this morning, and I'm certain you did the same, oil price was forecasted to be $200 in 2030. Just as a reminder, three months ago when I was reading the Financial Times, oil prices were forecasted to be $200 in the next year. So there's a certain amount of volatility in our planning and I'll also come back to the assumptions upon which we build our plan.</p>
          <p>We still see upsides or potential in our emerging regions, not only through household spending but also strong industry.</p>
          <p>We're coming, if you take the five-year view on Henkel, from a period of between 3 and 5% organic growth over the last period of time. During that period of time we've also been capable of increasing our operating margin, our profit margin from 8.8 to, at this stage, 10.2%. So we have made overall progress, not to the level that we believe is realistic with the portfolio we have at hand.</p>
          <p>We come from a position which started out with the mature markets where we have a strong position in a number of the mature markets. In Europe and in Germany and North America we have a good foundation. But I strongly believe that the real big asset and the long-term assets in our portfolio is coming out of emerging regions.</p>
          <p>What I tried to do here is just giving you two different pictures. There is the category picture from Cosmetics and Detergents, and in the category picture we have approximately 100 plus number one or number two positions in the emerging markets. And you can see emerging markets for Detergents and Cosmetics is defined as the emerging market minus Asia Pacific because we hardly have any presence there. So we have a very, very strong position in Eastern Europe, Middle East Africa and we'll build upon that more than 100 leading positions.</p>
          <p>From a country standpoint, because that is a more relevant measure point in our Adhesives business, in our emerging countries we have 35 number one positions, meaning that we are the largest adhesives and surface treatment company in 35 countries in our emerging regions.</p>
          <p>We believe that we've taken a number of steps this year, and this year has been a busy year, that will prepare us for next year. We have a good and solid business position. We have a very strong position in our emerging countries; Lothar mentioned that 39% of our overall business is coming from emerging countries. We have initiated Global Excellence very early. I've seen a lot of other Companies also gone in for restructuring and we started out early, which I think will be advantageous for us.</p>
          <p>National Starch, which Lothar also mentioned, and we've taken some fairly radical cost cuts, looking upon and addressing the current financial outlook. Our target is also to retain our A rating and looking upon it and taking that very, very serious, and we don't have any need for refinancing between now and 2010. What this slide also explains is that right now, large transactions is not a priority for us, it is down to basic execution and getting the profitability improvements through our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Now, let me take you through the strategic priorities and articulate how we see some of the very important steps to get to the increase in our profitability level.</p>
          <p>I'll go through on the full business potential, four different elements, the portfolio, our brands, innovation and operational excellence, starting out with our portfolio.</p>
          <p>What we've done is, and I'll speak in portfolio &#x2013; in several categories when it comes to regions and when it comes to products.</p>
          <p>In our Laundry &amp; Homecare it's clear that we need to improve our profitability in our mass categories, and I'll come back to articulate how later.</p>
          <p>So, increased profitability, not necessarily volume in our mass categories and increased volume in our specialty categories where we have much higher profitability.</p>
          <p>Within Cosmetics it's keeping the high innovation rate where it is, because that is allowing us to improve the margin improvement that you've seen, so we continue with the focus on our innovation rate through that drive our margins up, and use Schwarzkopf as the overall master brand and build that for the future.</p>
          <p>In Adhesives, it's driving growth back into our specialty solutions, these are the high margin businesses, it exploits the scale effect in industrial adhesives around National Starch. The less specialty part is where we need to get the scale effects and utilization out of our manufacturing side and then, through innovation and selective pricing, improve profitability in automotive and consumer business. This could &#x2013; and the latter also mean decrease in topline through aggressive pricing. You've seen that in the second and third quarter, we'll continue that strategy moving forward.</p>
          <p>When it comes to our regional strategy, it's a balance between mature markets and emerging markets. In our mature markets, it's protecting and gaining market share in the markets we're in. Increased cost is when basically mean flat cost structure or declining cost structure in mature markets, and improved profitability mix our portfolio mix, which I just spoke about in order to drive up profitability.</p>
          <p>In our emerging markets is where we're going to focus our investments. We will have disproportionally large investments both as it comes to OpEx and CapEx in our emerging regions. Expand selectively, and what we mean by that is that for us it's more important to have a leading position in a country instead of being in many other countries, so we'll continue to expand, but selectively, with a clear target of getting leadership positions in those markets. And along with that, improve our portfolio mix.</p>
          <p>I've taken this picture because it is time for the key profitability improvement measures, moving forward. In 2004, we had 26% of our business coming from our emerging business. One to nine is 37%, the third quarter alone is 39% and our target for 2012 is 45%.</p>
          <p>What we've done here is I indexed the EBIT margin just to give you an insight into why this will help improve our margin. In 2004 we indexed at 100, right now it's at 157 and that EBIT margin will go to 190 in 2012 and right now we're balancing, finding the balancing act between revenue growth and improvement in margins.</p>
          <p>So what we're seeing is we're seeing a consistent improvement in our EBIT in the emerging regions that help to reach the overall EBIT targets that we set as a Company.</p>
          <p>So the target is approximately 45% of our business in 2012 will come from the emerging markets, which gets me to brands.</p>
          <p>I've taken here and articulated the nine largest brands for our Company, three by business Group, and what they articulate, let me just explain to you, starting with Laundry &amp; Homecare, we have a market that grows between two and 3%, we grew 5.5% and our top three brands grew 8% and they account for 32%. Likewise for Cosmetics, a market of two to 3%, overall growth of 5.8%, top three brands growing 9%.</p>
          <p>And for Adhesives, three to four, 6.5 and 14, a total of 34%, meaning that the top three brands from Henkel as a Company accounts for a quarter of the total business.</p>
          <p>If you take the top nine brands, they account for approximately 42% of the business, and they all have over-proportional growth compared to the overall growth of the Company.</p>
          <p>Our target this year is to have 2x growth of our top brands from now until 2012; they have higher growth rates and higher margin contribution to our business. So what you're seeing is you're seeing an increased focus on products under those brands, innovation and also sales efforts. So they will, along with our emerging regions, be part of the topline growth drivers, but of course, also, our margin drivers.</p>
          <p>What we are doing is, and this is articulating our brand strategies, we are working in three different dimensions. We are strengthening the global brands that we have around Schwarzkopf and Loctite. We have a number of very strong local/regional brands and what we're going to do around those, and which we are doing. We're taking a brand like Persil in Germany, which is the same product in France, it's just called Le Chat.</p>
          <p>So the only difference here is the name of the box. R&amp;D, packaging, content, manufacturing is exactly the same, so standardizing around everything in the product. The only thing that remains different is the brand and in very few instances, maintaining local strong brands but moving more and more to the right-hand side in order to get the scale effects either out of the brand, subsequent R&amp;D, packaging and manufacturing, all the same just without the brand. That is the key driver for our brand strategy moving forward.</p>
          <p>On the innovation side I think you most probably have seen earlier this year the corporate R&amp;D function that we had. We've taken that function and integrated it back into the business Groups in order to shorten time to market and create high levels of customer proximity. That integration is done and is over.</p>
          <p>And the reason why this is so important for us is that we are very much aware that innovation is a key driver for being able to pass price increases on to customers. So in order for us to improve our profitability on our products we need to have a very strong innovation capability. That is the driver for having dissolved the corporate R&amp;D function and brought it back into the business groups.</p>
          <p>What we've done, as an example, three recent launches, Vernel, Diadermine and Loctite and what you can see is that on this we have improved the GP1 margin by respectively 10.4, 5.6 and 5%. So we have a very clear strategy articulating each of the business groups that we will only launch products which are accretive to the gross margin, so we are foregoing launches in the innovation process if they are dilutive to gross margin.</p>
          <p>That is a process that was started to be implemented approximately 12 to 18 months ago and that is, right now, being implemented across the board, meaning every new product that we bring to market will be accretive to gross margin.</p>
          <p>We have approximately 30% of our revenue being generated by products that has been introduced over the last three years.</p>
          <p>Let me go to operational excellence. On this we have a number of different initiatives. First of all we are purchasing and we have four different categories. We have global sourcing, i.e., using our global footprint to continue to get better conditions from our global suppliers. It's a program that was initiated in 2005 and we're so to speak, in version two or three at this stage. It's building a stronger emerging market capability to source products from the emerging regions.</p>
          <p>It's thirdly, getting much closer to our strategic suppliers, having reduced our supplier portfolio dramatically. All we want to do is to increase the innovation capability through our supplier pipeline.</p>
          <p>As an example, very recently, the entire management team with Lothar and myself met up with our largest supplier and spent a full day with that supplier. We didn't speak about Ts and Cs, we spoke about innovation; we spoke about strategic alignment, joint manufacturing capabilities, supply chain capabilities, inventory. And what you're seeing is, like we'll speak about with the customers, spending much more time on the strategic element of the suppliers. The Ts and Cs have to be right but at the same time we've got to have more value out of our suppliers than just Ts and Cs.</p>
          <p>And then eventually looking into new business models, are there things that we can do differently in purchasing, purchasing with other companies, also. We expect that these purchasing activities will drive savings to the tune of &#x20AC;350 million by 2012.</p>
          <p>Our manufacturing footprint and our supply chain, we are in the process of a large overhaul, so to speak. We have already announced 30 projects in this area through our Global Excellence projects and they're looking upon consolidation. You've seen consolidation in Western Europe for our detergents business. Outsourcing, we have a number of initiatives going on that we'll also announce. Joint production, where it makes sense. And complexity reduction, taking approximately 20% our SKUs out to drive down back-office cost, and also getting a leaner manufacturing footprint.</p>
          <p>We expect that the efforts that we have put in place and initiated at this stage will drive savings to the sum of approximately 100 million by 2012.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A optimization &#x2013; really, taking its foundation around, first our standardization around SAP, where we're automating more and more processes. That is also being made possible through the consolidation of not only customers at one end, but suppliers on the other. We'll extend the use of our offshore service capabilities in Bratislava. And in Manila we are consistently looking for outsourcing opportunities. Right now we already identified IT infrastructure and helpdesk, and we've initiated a project that is looking upon consolidation of our admin sites globally.</p>
          <p>The first outcome is a consolidation in Shanghai and Moscow and Scottsdale. And we're doing this on a global basis, led by our Finance function. So taking our entire admin structure and looking upon how we can consolidate it country-wise and regionally. We expect savings of more than 50 million in this area until 2012.</p>
          <p>Which brings me to the customer side, no, the team side. Excuse me, customer side, there was a &#x2013; yeah, customer side, I'm sorry.</p>
          <p>We have initiated approximately four months ago a program where we have allocated our top 20 customers, globally, to the top management of the Company. I personally have responsibility for two customers, globally, and some of these customers are substantially larger than some of our Western European countries, so we have customers that are getting closer to the revenue of between 0.5 billion and 1 billion.</p>
          <p>And what we're doing is, we're getting a much closer strategic alignment on expansion, on product strategy, on supply chain, on manufacturing, and we've initiated top-to-top contacts, as we said. We discussed global coverage, we discussed innovation, what's important for them, what's important for us, and we looked upon supply chain initiatives.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we're also taking our corporate social responsibility value proposition and bringing that into the equation. And for some of our customers this is very important. We have defined that we want in our corporate social responsibility a strategy where we have five elements. We have said that all new products have to contribute to sustainable development in at least one focal area. And for many of our customers, this is a very, very key part.</p>
          <p>Those of you who follow Wal-Mart will know that they have immense focus on CSR, and as an example, one of our most successful products right now in the U.S. is detergent, high concentrate, driven through the Wal-Mart channel where we've gone in and worked on high concentrate which drives down logistics cost and also overall manufacturing costs.</p>
          <p>So what we're saying is we believe that we can drive substantial growth in our large customers over the next years by focusing much more on them As you can see on the bottom, we believe, and we've set a target that our top customers will grow one and a half time our overall sales growth. So we're seeing a number of growth drivers, regions, brands, innovation and sub-customers.</p>
          <p>Which brings me to the people that actually have to do the job and this is crucial, that we ensure that we have the right team, the right training and the right compensation models and cost structure around the Company.</p>
          <p>What we've done is that we've been very clear as a management team in that, people management is a top management item. There's no delegation and we're measuring people on their capabilities to retain and develop top talent, starting with us in the management team.</p>
          <p>At the same time we've reduced the number of people in the Board from seven to five, we brought in a number of new managers across the board, we have our top 30 leaders deployed globally, which was not the case three years ago. We've enlarged the span of control in order to drive a flatter organizational structure and quicker decision-making.</p>
          <p>We're using diversity as we see it, as one of our key factors and diversity is defined by us as gender, age and nationality. Where we do 39% of our business in emerging regions, we need to make certain that we actually have the competence and the capability to address those regions, having the right Chinese people in our management team, having the right Russians in our management team, having the right Americans in our management team.</p>
          <p>We have today approximately 26% of our managers are female. We have 40 different nationalities in our headquarter, and we have more than 100 different nationalities in our management structure. We don't have any quotas in the Company, the quota we have is based on competence, and that's how we'll drive it.</p>
          <p>We're increasing the variable components of our compensation and extending the scale to ensure that we reward the good performing managers in the Company, and subsequently also deal with the people that are performing less good.</p>
          <p>We're actively empowering people to make sure that they step up and lead, and we are implementing a top-talent program. We made a commitment within our Company that we strive to develop our leaders from within but every key management position will be benchmarked internally-externally to ensure that we get the right people in the right jobs in our Company. People management is crucial for us to get to the targets that we are defining.</p>
          <p>So we see our three strategic qualities as previously said, achieving our full business potential, increasing our customer focus and strengthening our global team. By executing around the areas I had outlined, we believe that the financial targets will be as follows.</p>
          <p>We see as assumptions CAGR on the GDP growth between now and '12 of between three and four, a euro to the U.S. dollar of between 1.40 to 1.55, and a crude oil in the range of 100 to 120 in that timeframe. This, based on the planning that we've done over the last three months, gets us to a organic sales growth of between three and 5%, an adjusted EBIT margin for 2012 of 14% and an adjusted earnings growth in that period of time of about 10%.</p>
          <p>What we've done is that we've built a detailed plan articulating the different elements and also articulating the timescale how we get there. And to give you the macro of it, we will get, and I'll go from gross to net, we'll get gross savings of 0.9% from Global Excellence. We'll get gross savings of 1% of National Starch defensive synergies. And if you remember, we said we would get synergies in National Starch of approximately 240, 250 million; two=-thirds defensive, one-third offensive. We will get synergies to the tune of 1.5% from our full business potential and through pricing, purchasing and material cost, which are offsetting each other where you get the gross to net, we get an increase of approximately 0.4%.</p>
          <p>That will mean that we'll &#x2013; these are the steps that we see in our planning process, will get us to the 14%. So this is a bridge we've build with a lot more detail behind it.</p>
          <p>We are also aware of that some of these assumptions will change over time. We believe that we have enough assets in our portfolio and also in the activities that we've defined that we can get there.</p>
          <p>It does not mean that we will not take further steps along as we go because it would be a poor statement if I were to say that we can't get wiser the next three years. So of course we'll actively manage the position moving forward, but this is the overall bridge.</p>
          <p>If you want it on a very rough level, you could say if we grow our topline three to 4% and we grow our cost line 3%, we'll get to the same number, we'll get to the 14%.</p>
          <p>Use of free cash flow. Dividend approximately 25% of net earnings adjusted for exceptionals.</p>
          <p>We expect a reduction in debt in order to secure our A rating. When that is happening we will look upon acquisitions but it's very important for us that we have a strong balance sheet. At the same time, we're also looking upon at that stage, the option of share buyback at that stage, and it's still an option. So there's absolutely no commitment to what I'm saying; I'm saying here are the options that we are evaluating as it relates to our cash flow.</p>
          <p>In summary, we believe we have the right profitability and growth drivers, defined and initiated. Some of them are both growth and profitability and some are more on the profitability side.</p>
          <p>Profitability, we can see from operational excellence, growth from emerging markets and more and more profitability as you can see from the index that we've gotten through active portfolio management has both, innovation has both, brands has both and integrating of new businesses.</p>
          <p>We believe that we have the right activities and assets in our portfolio to get to a 14% EBIT margin by 2012. It'll by no means be a walk in the park. If it was we would have been there by now, but we are willing to take the necessary steps to get there. Also with the pain that it might cause and I think 2008 has been a year that &#x2013; very clearly, in the steps that we have taken, not only is it related to cost cutting and restructuring, but also management changes.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to stop at this stage and hand over to the Q&amp;A session. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Yes, good afternoon, Emmanuel Bruley des Varannes from Societe Generale. So two questions, my first one would be at this stage of the year, would it be possible to have an idea of the cost savings of your Global Excellence program by division, because until now you've not given us any kind of breakdown by division?</p>
          <p>Secondly, would it be possible to have in your 2012 EBIT margin target for the Group, to have a breakdown &#x2013; sorry, to have a breakdown by division as you are operating in very different businesses between additives and laundry detergents and customer care? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't disclose Global Excellence savings by division. What we've done on previously, we've outlined the activities so we're not disclosing the savings, end savings by division. And the same also at this stage goes for the targets we've set by business group. But as you can see from the targets that we have, we are &#x2013; all the business groups, I can say, will be above 14% but there is a variance in the different business groups. We have implemented the margin targets by business groups; at this stage we've not disclosed them. Lothar, do you want to say about, in savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Global Excellence savings by business sector, I think in the final analysis the total savings, we've given that information but not for this year. So in terms of total savings, which is the 150 million at the end of 2011, it will be composed of 38 million for Laundry &amp; Homecare, Cosmetics is 11, Adhesive Technology is 23 &#x2013; that's percent sorry. And Corporate, which will then be distributed into the divisions, 28%.</p>
          <p>So that's the final picture and obviously we're moving in different speed and therefore particular information for this year is not available.</p>

          <p>Next one, Martin R&#xF6;diger [Cheuvreux]?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, two questions. Martin R&#xF6;diger from Cheuvreux. First, you moved R&amp;D from corporate to the individual segments. Is there still basic R&amp;D in your corporate level and to which extent? Second question concerning private label, can you elaborate how do you see private label competition to develop in the near future, especially in Western Europe? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is no and Lothar can answer too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Private label obviously is an issue in more difficult times. We've seen some increase, slight increase in Western European countries. It's not an issue in our businesses and our business sectors in North America, so there's no issue. There's pretty much no issue in Eastern Europe and emerging countries.</p>
          <p>It is something which is obviously well known to everybody here in Western Europe, particularly in Germany with Aldi and Mercadona in Spain. Those are the most important players in this area and they have again been increasing their share this year, but not dramatically. So therefore that's currently in our view not a real threat or not a different threat from what we have seen in the past.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Harold Thompson, Deutsche Bank. Just two questions, before we start on the new business plan, you had a margin target of 12% for 2008 and you're going to come about 200 basis points short of that. Could you try and give us an idea of why have you come short of the business plan? Is it the synergy targets of previous restructuring program not flowing through to the bottom line or other items?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if competitors were to use falling input cost to lower their prices, what would be your response? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I get the second question but I'll try to answer it anyway. First question, the shortfall in terms of 12%, I think we've tried to communicate, maybe not sufficiently and unsuccessfully, that the major deviation between when we made this outlook in 2004 and today is the steep increase in raw material prices that we have experienced over the past, at least three years.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately it started pretty early at the end of 2004, so by the time that we really got into 2004, our outlook was already endangered and therefore we've been struggling ever since. We've been able to improve our margin, but not at the rate that we had anticipated when we made this &#x2013; provided this outlook.</p>
          <p>I think that we probably see some turning back to some extent because oil prices are down considerably compared to the top level that we've seen in the middle of this year. And we'll &#x2013; and I mention that we are yet to see the impact on the raw materials but there will be an impact, there's no question. So therefore, that's the major negative impact that we have experienced.</p>
          <p>The other question I understood to mean that if we're expected to lower our prices because raw materials are going down. The first thing what we expect is our suppliers to lower their prices, and that's what we're in very aggressively. And it's no surprise to us that we will get a similar demand from our customers.</p>
          <p>And I think you know that the name of the game is to delay and be slow in reacting. I'm sure that our suppliers are trying the same thing, and it very much depends on what is our strength, our significance with our suppliers. And therefore, some of the actions that we've taken in the more recent past will help us a great deal in getting a bigger impact there. I've communicated on some occasions that we have reduced the number of suppliers in our portfolio, in particular with respect to the bigger materials.</p>
          <p>So therefore we're more important now, and that's why they've decreased their prices, because &#x2013; one example, one of the big materials, we have reduced the number of suppliers from 20 to four, which increases the volume of the four considerably. And therefore, we're now very important to the four while we've not been as important before for the same.</p>
          <p>So therefore we have a different negotiating position than what we had before we entered into this structure. And therefore for us it is a more viable proposition to &#x2013; I shouldn't say force, but I guess initiate or motivate them to lower their prices, faster than what we have to do with respect to our prices.</p>
          <p>And once we're quite confident in terms of looking at the adhesive sector, where we have increased prices and we're still continuing to increase prices, and where the way back is usually lower or I should say not as fast as it is on the way up. So therefore we do expect to be able to retain some of the upside that we have been able to generate through increasing our prices and not &#x2013; and we'll not decrease our prices at the same rate that we force our suppliers.</p>
          <p>In Laundry &amp; Homecare we're facing obviously now already pressure from the retailer because they obviously see what we see. But there again, we see a lot of, I should say, similar behavior by our peers in the market. If you look at the private label, they have to increase because their margins are sharp, very, very small and they've been increasing prices.</p>
          <p>So therefore I think we have reason to assume that prices will go down and we'll have to give up some. It will be slower than what we can wrest away from our suppliers.</p>

          <p>I think there's one thing that's important to mention is, and that is our active participation in the price setting, which we've been criticized for in the past. We have this year taken pricing every quarter and you have, in this audience, also previous quarters asked, are you getting the pricing through?</p>
          <p>Following the second quarter our growth for the first six months in the &#x2013; after one to six, volume was 60% and pricing was 40% after the first nine months, now they reversed. So we consistently have been active on the pricing market, and I think that is a discipline that we have to continue to monitor and master very well moving forward in a high volatility market.</p>
          <p>So you might have areas where pricing will go down, there are other areas, as Lothar just spoke about, of getting pricing up. While at the same time, some of the advantages we'll get moving forward, is simply getting the utilization rates up in our manufacturing plants through the consolidation of the manufacturing footprint I spoke about before. And that then gives you higher flexibility on the pricing.</p>

          <p>Lutz Gr&#xFC;ten, Kepler Capital Markets. To achieve the 14% EBIT margin you've mentioned that you want to focus on core brands and core activities and that you want to also be active in portfolio management. What percentage of today's Group sales are generated by your core activities and core brands, and what EBIT margin is generated already by these core activities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on how we define core. If you take our largest nine brands, as I alluded to, they account for 42% of our overall business. And the target we set ourselves was that they will grow with 2x compared to the rest of the Company. So you can then start calculating during that period of time, so you'll get to a 50% plus very easy over the next three to four years. They have a over-proportionally high EBIT contribution without mentioning the EBIT contribution, because we don't go to that level of detail.</p>
          <p>So of course by the consolidation of that you don't only get growth, you also get a disproportionably high EBIT contribution. The consequences, of course, that over time a number of plans will fall out and that is what &#x2013; the focus is driving the investment and the resource and the innovation around the core of our businesses, speaking brands in this context.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but we've done that -- I just want &#x2013; this is, we've done it in the past, we've divested Morris, we've divested our food business in the U.S. Consistently, we'll continue to look upon that and making certain that we have a core that will allow us to get to the 14%.</p>

          <p>We had &#x2013; I've communicated on various occasions that our portfolio is not a stagnant thing. Business evolves, markets evolve, and therefore we need to react with our portfolio. And I've given the example of our National Starch acquisition, which obviously has put a greater emphasis on the industrial part of our Adhesives business.</p>
          <p>It doesn't mean that we're divesting the whole rest of it, but it means that there are going to be shifts in terms of significance and emphasis, and that may mean eventually that there are going to be changes in the portfolio. So therefore, over that period of time &#x2013; that's pretty long actually, four years &#x2013; we would expect shifts of significance and therefore also some portfolio changes.</p>
          <p>Again, it's not to mean that we have decided on changes in the portfolio, it's just pointing out that we watch what we're going to be able to achieve in terms of our core portfolio, and what happens then at the fringes in terms of profitability and our market positions.</p>

          <p>Hi. Mark Christensen, Morgan Stanley. If I interpret you right it seems there's been a further &#x20AC;500 million of cost savings identified through this operational excellence between now and 2012. Can you say if there's any extra costs that you anticipate to realize those 500 million? Can you give us an idea of perhaps how you expect to realize and whether it's relatively straight line back-end loaded, front-end loaded, et cetera?</p>
          <p>And also when you touched on the remuneration side of things how will senior managements' remuneration be aligned perhaps with the 14% target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We just quickly answer the question with respect to the additional savings. Part of the savings that we have, as you've seen on the chart is already part of the Global Excellence program, so that's already factored into the expenses that we're taking on the Global Excellence program. There's another part, purchasing savings, which have no expense other than to improve our purchasing situation in terms of the areas that I have addressed.</p>
          <p>In summary, there is no other program that we think we need or that we currently have in mind, so there's no major expense to be expected from realizing the improvements that Kasper Rorsted has shown.</p>
          <p>With respect to remuneration maybe that's something that you should -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've said it a couple of times and I'll restate the position I have. In the short term I think we have a compensation structure that doesn't stand in our way. I think in the long term, there could be changes added to that structure. What we've done is and we've initiated that and that is done already, we've increased the variable part of the compensation structure for the top 200 managers in the company with upside and downside. And we'll be managing that very, very tightly aligned to the targets that we're setting ourselves. And I believe in the short to medium term we have a compensation structure that will not stand in the way of doing what we need to do in the short to medium term.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we're also looking upon other opportunities in the compensation structure, but I think it's important to communicate the following. This year we initiated the global restructuring program in the Company. We have acquired National Starch, and it's moving very radically ahead with that. We are in a market that is more volatile than before, we have initiated a number of management changes on all levels of the Company at a speed that hasn't done before. And as Lothar said, we've also stopped a number of cost drivers for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>It's important that you have enough &#x2013; you don't have too many battlefields at the same time, and the battles that you have or the priorities that you have you get to closure of those. One of those that can create most disruption in a company and also most upside is the compensation structure. And when you change your compensation structure you need to make sure that you change it for the long term and not for the medium or short term.</p>
          <p>So we will be addressing that but we'll be addressing it in a way so we don't have to do it two or three times. We'll do it the right way the first time. And if people are uncertain about compensation then very rarely does it lead to good performance.</p>
          <p>So the point I'm making is, I believe we have a structure today with the changes we already made to the structure that will allow us to take the first couple of steps, we'll actually be looking upon our comp structure moving forward. But I want to make certain that we close one priority and another, and not have a battlefield of priorities open at the same time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Let me perhaps add one observation. We've always had additional special incentives attached to special targets, in other words the 12% target has also been connected with special incentives and we'll miss the 12%. So therefore, remuneration, special incentives in itself do not do the trick. We need to have the structure, the processes and the programs in place which permit us to reach our targets. That's even more important.</p>
          <p>You're totally right, there needs to be alignment between the targets that are to be pursued and remuneration. There is no question about it and we need to do some more in that respect. But that in itself is not going to do the trick. We need to have the structure in place that permits us to do it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just wondering to what extent you would sacrifice topline growth to achieve the 14% margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there's a black-and-white answer to that. I actually think this quarter was a good example of it. This quarter our entire growth was based, if you look upon from a macro standpoint, on pricing. Do it over exaggerated. You can do that for a given period of time but you've got to be able to grow along with the markets, or grow stronger than the markets in the key markets that you're in. So finding the right balance is the key and not offsetting one completely with the other. So that's why I can't give you probably a satisfactory black-and-white answer.</p>
          <p>It's finding the right balance, but what we have seen is, you use pricing as one of the drivers, we've seen that it's an ongoing adjustment. First quarter, if you remember, in our Adhesives business we had positive growth of approximately 2.6%, if I remember correctly, 3.4 was pricing, minus 0.8 was volume. It goes back to the overall managing of the business. But if you ask what signal have we sent internally? We've been very, very clear on, and that was also why I stand up by the title, that the message internally is to improve the profitability of the Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I add we've been discussing that question for quite a period of time because there are some proponents of absolute EBIT improvement or growth over margin improvement. And I think that it is important to realize that it does not make sense to just dispose of a business in order to improve the margin, because short-term that may improve the margin because then the lower margin business goes out, you lose absolute EBIT, you lose absolute EPS, and eventually the real question is what do you get for it. You get a fair price which permits you to reinvest into your existing business thereby improving your operating performance.</p>
          <p>So it's a little bit more complicated than just to say, I get rid off the low performing businesses and then thereby improve my performance. I think what we want to do is have a sustainable business model which permits us to realize the margins that we target, the 14% out of the operating, the ongoing business. So we want to generate this type of profitability with the Company on a sustainable level, not just short-term actions which permit us to show better results. So that's the trade-off between long term. And therefore sales growth remains extremely important otherwise we're pricing ourselves out of the market.</p>
          <p>So we don't have a sales growth problem so far. We've been performing fantastically over the past three years, and that's why we're now focusing more on margin improvement. But we'll not forget about sales growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. The first question is on the roadmap to the 14% margin target, and I appreciate the breakdown you've given by concept, but I was wondering if you could perhaps provide some insight on to the timeline of achieving that target. Obviously we can all do the straight line calculation of 90 to 100 basis points per year. But I was wondering if that's going to be achieved consistently over time, is it front-end loaded, is it back-end loaded? Of course there's going to be a lot of cynicism about your ability to meet the target. So can you at least give some guidance so we can measure progress towards that target in the short to medium term?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on Ecolab. We've been waiting for over a year now for some news on disposing of all or part of that investment. And I'm really wondering why it's taking so long. Could you give some insight into the negotiations, what the complications are? What limitations you have of just simply selling or bleeding that stake into the market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The easy answer would be is that we stay at 10.2 until the third quarter of '11 and then we'll make the miracle happen in the fourth quarter of '11. But it's probably a bit more linear than that. I can't give you &#x2013; I will not give you details, but I'll give you indications of it. We have given you indications on the gross savings as it relates to National Starch and also Global Excellence where we said that we expect 80% of the gross savings to come through by 2010 and we will manage towards that on a gross level. I'm not saying that is net level. The big swing factor right now is and we won't comment on that today, we'll do that in February, how does '09 actually look and what will '09 bring?</p>
          <p>So our ambition level and our planning is to drive a cost structure, and particularly in our manufacturing footprint a utilization structure, or capacity, that will allow us to get much better cost. What we can't control in the short term and we believe that's where the medium term will help out. Is in the short term you will have higher volatility in the market than you will in the medium term unless you expect that you have four years of potential recession which is not what we're expecting. We're expecting a sort of CAGR three to 5% growth rate.</p>
          <p>So that's why I'm saying at this stage I will not give you a definite outlook. I'll give you the outlook, as I said, I'll give you the outlook on Global Excellence and National Starch where 80% is supposed to come in the first two years. And our commitment is to drive the elements that is completely within our control, which is cost structures and efficiencies, SG&amp;A and cost of goods sold down to a level that will allow us to get to the 12. Completely back-ended is not going to be the case, but '09 is going to play a key role, and that's why we're saying, '09, we need to wait for the guidance in '09 that will come in February.</p>

          <p>Ecolab question is a total surprise to me so therefore I'm completely unprepared, except that I have the communication that we have issued in February, it's not a year ago. So it's February but that doesn't really answer your question. The communication is as follows: We have issued a press release in which we announced our intention to undertake the divestiture of all or part of our stake in Ecolab. No final decision has been taken at this time as to the size, the timing and the method of any such divestiture, which would be carried out in accordance with the stockholders' agreement.</p>
          <p>If I could continue; except as set forth herein, Henkel has no current plans or proposals that would relate to or would result in any of the actions or events enumerated in Clauses A through J of Item 4 of Schedule 13D, as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>What that means is there are constraints on what disclosure one can take as a big shareholder in a publicly listed company in the U.S. And what you have to do is describe your intentions in this famous Schedule 13D, what we have done in February. And unless and until we change our intention and amend our filing that's what governs our relationship.</p>
          <p>So I ask for your indulgence for many reasons, particularly legal reasons, we will not comment at all on this situation. It is what we can say, is contained in our public disclosure, and if that changes there's another public disclosure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, it's Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst. Two questions. Point number one, you mentioned various times that obviously volatility of the oil price is quite heavy. How do you believe you can cope with this volatility? Quite often you had more long term contracts, can you shorten the contracts, how &#x2013; are your IT systems in place to a measure, that you really know what your cost impacts are that you can forward them? So could you little bit describe the mechanisms you have in place to cope with this potentially high ongoing volatility?</p>
          <p>Second question is to currencies, two issues here. Point number one you were quite negative on the euro, rightly it seems so. Are you going or are you relatively unhedged right now, meaning can you benefit directly from the weaker euro?</p>
          <p>And additional question here too, many emerging market countries have seen much weaker currency development. Is that any issue for you. Do you have negative effects from these currency movements of emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to oil prices I need to remind you first that we're not buying oil, we're buying derivatives of oil which are not based on the same, very same volatility that we see in the oil price market. So therefore there's no way to hedge raw materials that we're buying, except for a few exceptions such as, for example, silver which has nothing to do with obviously with oil. That's something which is traded on a stock exchange or an exchange and therefore can be hedged.</p>
          <p>Other raw materials, if you look at hot melt raw materials, affectants and similar things, there's no market where you can buy derivatives. So there's no way to hedge a major part of our raw materials. The volatility that we see in the oil price, which then translates but unfortunately not in a direct correlation until volatility in our raw materials is therefore something which we cannot address through hedging.</p>
          <p>The other thing is if you look at development of oil price and raw material prices earlier this year and now, all those who could have hedged would now be in a very bad position because they would pay a high price even though the prices are coming down. So hedging is not a solution to everything. It is a solution in certain specific situations, but not in all situations.</p>
          <p>With respect to our businesses, we have decided that given the nature of our businesses, the relatively short period of time within which we can increase prices on the output side, normally, under normal circumstances permits us to reflect within a period of, let's say, six months, changes in the input situation. What we have experienced, and that's the difficulty creating the volatility, was that raw material prices have gone up faster and that's not just because of the oil price. It's also because of scarcity situations that we have experienced in some of our materials.</p>
          <p>That again has been triggered by very high demand in emerging countries. If you look at China, some other countries, Russia, for example. So there's a lot of reasons why we've had over the past two years a specific situation which, if the industrial output goes down will not persist, that's very clear. So that therefore is a situation where we may not like what is happening right now, certainly will have a mitigating impact now on the scarcity situations, and therefore, mitigating impact on the raw material situation.</p>
          <p>Summary, there's very little of our materials that we could hedge and therefore we haven't. With respect to the raw material price and oil price volatility, the major difficulty that we have experienced was earlier this year, when expectations for the oil price were pretty subdued, I think that going into the end of last year early this year expectations were $70 per barrel and then it ran up to 140, 145. That's obviously creating difficulties but nobody was expecting that and therefore, it was impossible to prepare for it.</p>
          <p>So that we don't expect to be a recurring event. We would hope that the volatility will come down. Right now I think the bigger issue that we're facing is a question of how the industrial markets are going to develop and how the economic environment is going to develop.</p>
          <p>Second question on the currencies. First of all, as you might imagine or maybe remember, we're not hedging translation risk, which is the major risk that we have in our currencies, so therefore the changes, the translation changes that are occurring now as a result of the strengthening dollar will be reflected in our P&amp;L. As it was negative in the past it's going to be positive in the future.</p>
          <p>We do selectively hedge transaction risk, which is a major part only where we have imports or exports in our subsidiaries, total volume of which is not significant, and therefore the transaction risk is not something which will have much of a positive or a negative impact, because as I mentioned we hedge it selectively.</p>
          <p>Emerging countries, weak currencies, that is starting to get a concern. It has not affected third quarter yet. We'll have to see what happens depending on some of the currencies which we have seen in Russia, for example, some other &#x2013; Turkey regions, we need to watch it.</p>
          <p>Now there again, question is, is it a reflection of inflation and then it will pan out over a period of time or is it fluctuation for other reasons. We're watching that very carefully. The benefit that we have is we have operations in the countries, so therefore we're sourced locally, we have the local cost structure, and therefore there's a translation impact but really not a transaction impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do want to mention one thing that you also asked about and that is our IT know-how, the purchasing capability. I would argue today that &#x2013; I'm not saying we're best in class but we made substantial progress in our purchasing organization, not only as it relates to process and systems but also people. Today we have a system which is not &#x2013; it is not an Excel application. It is a truly global system that give us full transparency per vendor group, per raw material, per raw material type, and gives access and opportunities to purchase much better today than we could two-and-a-half to three years ago. That has been developed over the last two years.</p>
          <p>There has been a total change of management, I think &#x2013; on previous occasions we also alluded to that. That is by no means, to say that we at the end of it, if we believe it was the end, we didn't say that we could get another 350 million of savings there.</p>
          <p>It's clear when you got enormous volatility in your input cost, and you have the greatest system in the world, you'll still suffer. But I would argue that with the systems we have today in the processes, we are well-positioned. We need to do more. And, as I said, we have quantified the progress that we can make to 350 million, but that will not come through systems. It's going to come much more through the initiatives I mentioned. One of the most important being low cost country sourcing.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Just two follow-up questions. If I look at your third quarter, your volumes are down, your margins are down. So, is pricing really sticking, I guess, is the question? So, are you not sacrificing too much volume for the price?</p>
          <p>And the reason I ask that is, as we enter 2009 and you're, clearly going to push the organization to go for margin, should you not stabilize your volumes, i.e., get the volumes growing before doing that? Just your thoughts on that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a consistent balance you need to look upon. And if you look through our fiscal year this year, you can see the varying parts that when you take prices up in one quarter, the volume will go down. And if you tick through the difference ones, Laundry &amp; Homecare was 4.1 price, and minus 1.1 volume; Personal Care was 0.7 price, and 2.7 volume; and Adhesives was 4.7% price, and minus 1.1% volume.</p>
          <p>The previous quarter it was the other way around. So, right now, we have a balance of 60/40. As I said, previous quarter was 40/60 or one to nine.</p>
          <p>I believe we need to look upon it consistently. Part of it is, and you can see that in the margin line, that we have been late on the pricing because it has taken longer for us to get pricing on the retailers through than our input pricing has been. And that's why it's important that we've taken the pricing actions that we've taken.</p>
          <p>If we believe over time we will lose market share, that come back to the question over here before we'll of course, take the appropriate action. But I think that right now we're finding the right balance, and that balance is the thing we manage on an ongoing basis. Over time, of course, we cannot afford to lose volume if the market is overall growing, reversely we can't afford to lose margin either, because you guys will be chasing us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I have two questions, please. My first question is on the assumptions that you are using for your guidance. You're, basically, saying GDP growth next year of two to three. If GDP growth was much lower than that, like 1%, what would that mean for your assumptions? Would that be a big setback as a starting point?</p>
          <p>And the second question is about your top brands. When I look at Personal Care, 75 brands, basically, account for 100% of the sales. Can you maybe comment a little bit on the other 25? What the intentions are, whether they're still not growing, or whether there's been a shift this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>GDP growth for that matter was meant to be the average over the next years, not just next year. With respect to next year, we've consistently tried to communicate that we will address next year next year, which means that we'll take the benefit of getting the most recent information when we do our update on our expectations for next year in February.</p>
          <p>GDP growth for next year, I think from what we &#x2013; what you and us read in the papers is still positive. So, therefore, right now we're not as negative or not as pessimistic as one could be. But that's something which we all need to watch out in order to make sure that we're getting it right.</p>
          <p>I think all companies who are in the process of budgeting for next year, obviously, take into account, or put as basis, normal expectations based on what you get from the official organizations. And you have to prepare for bad &#x2013; for worse situations. So, therefore, you can rest assured that we will not run into next year without being prepared for more negative development if it comes about. But, right now, we stick with the outlook that has been provided on an official level.</p>
          <p>The chart that Kasper has used is the long-term chart.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Eva, on the brand management, very recently we had a in-depth conversation with Hans Van Bylen, the guy that runs our Cosmetics business. And he has a very structured approaching looking upon which are the key brands, which are "sold as big milking brands," and which are brands that have no position. And we're actively managing that. And I think you will see over time a consistent reduction of brands, but you can't reduce for the sake of reducing. I think that's also clear.</p>
          <p>There are certain brands and certain markets which might be of limited size, but the maintenance cost is actually miniscule and they can have a very positive contribution over a given period of time. But there's no doubt the ultimate consequence will be fewer brands and less complexity, and more consolidation on spending and investments around the major brands.</p>
          <p>What the number will be, I think, at this stage, is &#x2013; look at my English, less relevant. I think having a very clear position on what you are doing with each of the different brands, and disproportionably investing in those that have the long-term perspective, is important part. And there is a very, very clear roadmap in the different business groups to address that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Two questions from my side too, on the price increases. You mentioned earlier that there were some delays in Q3 for the price increases. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit what these problems were and what was going on there, first?</p>
          <p>And second, on your favorite, Ecolab, you say that you want to stick to your A rating. Does this imply that you, generally, stick to your plan to divest Ecolab?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start out by doing one and Lothar will do two. Pricing and push through pricing, there was basically, no problems. But the dynamics of the markets are different depending on which market you look upon.</p>
          <p>So, if you take the fast-moving consumer goods market, typically, in Europe, and now it's starting to average out, the delay in pricing is approximately six months depending on &#x2013; because you can do price negotiations with major retailers with approximately twice a year &#x2013; once to twice a year.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., it's more between 90 and 120 days. So, the last example we announced, the first week of July that we would take pricing action on our detergent business and cosmetics products in the U.S., we announced that first week of July, and they took effect in October. In a number of Western European countries, assume we just have a six month process. That's the process.</p>
          <p>In our industrial business, you've got to go almost business sector-by-business sector. But in some of our business sectors we've taken pricing eight to 10 times this year. So, it's really where you have input costs versus output costs. And, typically, in Western Europe, on fast moving consumer goods, you have a longer cycle, which is not a problem. It's just how that market works, which is great if you can argue if the price are going down. It's less great when they are going up.</p>

          <p>I thought I had answered conclusively all questions relating to Ecolab. I think that the communication that we have issued in February says that we have the intention. And I said that unless and until we change our intention and file another 13D, that's our intention.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Sarah Wilford from Merrill Lynch. Just two questions. First of all, when you talk about your improved portfolio mix, can you clarify, is that more skewed towards walking away from unprofitable opportunities, or is it more skewed towards actively looking for better opportunities?</p>
          <p>And secondly, as a point of clarification, your &#x20AC;500 million of savings translate &#x2013; does it just translate to the 1.5 percentage points of your margin uplift, or does it actually spread to the 0.4% that you're talking about that encompasses pricing and purchasing savings, or is that incremental?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start out, and then Lothar can help me. On the portfolio mix, we actually, we are doing both. What we are is we are actively managing towards higher margins in our portfolio, and we are, through, pricing initiatives also walking away from businesses, so to speak. And that was what we said earlier today.</p>
          <p>We've seen decline in some of our businesses, and that decline has been by design. Basically, we've said, in certain occasions on certain market segments, that we will not go below certain pricing levels. And if that means we'll lose business, we will lose business, and if that means we will walk away from the business, we will eventually walk away from that business. So, pricing is determining a walk-away.</p>
          <p>We are actually managing the portfolio also. One of the examples of that, as of recently, was our Right Guard acquisition in the U.S. We went in and acquired actually a business that had an accretive margin to our overall business. That is also what you will see in the future. As I said, with innovation, the same will be true for when we eventually come to that point; acquisitions have to be accretive to our portfolio.</p>
          <p>So, it's a mixture overall, but with a very high level of profitability. And if, over a given period of time, products can't contribute to the overall improvement of our portfolio, we will then, eventually, walk away from it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I understood the second part of the question, but I'll try to answer it anyway, and then you'll determine whether it was responsive.</p>
          <p>I thought you were asking about the portfolio mix item in the full business potential piece of/or component of the uplift. The portfolio mix here is in major part, it includes the National Starch offensive synergies. That's important. It also includes the change in the regional portfolio. In other words, as we move up or share of sales in the emerging countries, improve our profitability there, we improve the portfolio. That's the part of it.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. A couple of follow-up questions. Firstly, we're missing a working capital to sales target. I was wondering if that was deliberate. And what your view is on the potential for further improvement in working capital to sales?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I'd like to go back on the excuses for missing the previous 12% target, which you attribute to commodity cost increases over the last three years. Clearly, the implication therein is that you were incapable of passing that through into pricing. And so, going forward, might we have that same excuse in four years' time, or what is your determination to improve your ability to take commodity cost increases through pricing? And what I'm trying to get to is your level of commitment to the 14% target, come what may? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we can share the answer. On net working capital, we have not communicated a target at this stage. Lothar has alluded to it in his presentation. We've made great progress in this area. It's an area that we believe is very important for us moving forward in order also to settle our debt in our balance sheet. And when we have a target, we'll communicate the target.</p>
          <p>It is, right now, in our comps structure also. So, we have targets in our compensation structure for that. We haven't, at this stage, not communicated progress. But, if you look upon the different elements, we believe that in certain parts of our business there are room for improvement still.</p>
          <p>On our 12%, and we can spend a long time on that, I think the important part is are we committed to the 14. And the 14, I believe, that was why I said what I said before, this year we've addressed areas we've not addressed in the past. We have taken the largest restructuring initiative of the company in Germany. We have closed manufacturing sites or communicated the closure of manufacturing sites, which a couple of years ago were almost unthinkable. We have taken a number of, I would say, drastic would be over-exaggerated, but very consistent management decisions based on lack of performance.</p>
          <p>Under the agreements that we believe are realistic, we believe that the 14% is a doable target. That's why we communicated that. That's why I'm sitting here today along with Lothar, and that's why we're spending time this morning, 6 o'clock, with the rest of our management. That's why we're doing it tomorrow afternoon also. It's been communicated extremely clearly that we want to do this, and we are also willing to do it on assumptions that might be hard for the company.</p>
          <p>But also I want to make certain, and Lothar has said that previously, in the short-term, we could probably get &#x2013; we could probably have got to 12% very, very quickly by doing some things that would significantly hurt us. We need to make sure that we take the right decision in the right sequence. And the 14% is what we believe is a realistic but ambitious target for 2012.</p>
          <p>But with the actions that we've defined, we believe that we'll take a very, very big step towards those actions, towards the 14%. And some of the challenges that will come along the way, I'm certain that we'll also be able to address during a four-year time period.</p>
          <p>Lothar, do you want to comment any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe quickly on the net working capital to sales ratio, we will communicate, or we'll set new targets, and we'll communicate them. I thought it was appropriate for us to focus now on the long-term targets in terms of margin because too many targets, too many different targets will take away the determination and seriosity that we're applying to this target. This is our major effort and, therefore, all other areas and other sub-targets are nothing else than designed to permit us to reach that overall target.</p>
          <p>So, that's our main topic for today, and I don't want to intervene with any other targets, which then may have the potential for distracting from this important discussion. So, that's &#x2013; 14% is our target. That's it.</p>
          <p>With respect to net working capital to sales, we'll, obviously, set ourselves new targets and communicate about it.</p>
          <p>With respect to the excuses, I will, obviously, not get into the semantic question whether that was excuses or explanations. But I think the important aspect is the level of commitment that you ought to expect from this management team. And I think Kasper has made it very clear that not only management but the whole company is going to be determined and committed to this target.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Andy Hargreaves at Pictet here. Just coming back to your &#x2013; the assumption &#x2013; I'd be interested to know, post the acquisition of National Starch, the sensitivity of your model to GDP growth, coming back to this question. Obviously, your three to 5% longer term average growth is predicated on three to 4% worldwide GDP growth. If we knock a percentage point off GDP growth, does that knock a percentage point off your sales growth? How does that relationship work?</p>
          <p>And just coming back to the previous question on this point. You're working on 2 to 3% for 2009 GDP growth. What would happen if that number halved? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, briefly, with respect to the sensitivity of growth to GDP growth, there's a correlation, obviously, and we've pointed out that we want to outgrow our markets. So, therefore, if GDP growth, and then commensurate with that our markets grow pretty much inline with GDP, we want to outgrow by one or two percentage points, depending on the business division. That's the one thing.</p>
          <p>And, therefore, if there is a long-term average lower GDP growth than what we have anticipated, then we would have a lower long-term net sales growth. However, that is not to say that we are not going to reach our margin target because, if there was lower growth on topline, we'd have &#x2013; we would expect to have a lower growth of input costs, input side, and, therefore, with that changes, our margin target still stands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And does that also apply to your Adhesives business alone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, same answer. We're outgrowing our markets in the Adhesive sector as well. We have had, actually, an even stronger performance over the past three years, outgrowing our markets by two to three percentage points. Whether we can sustain this level depends. If there is a more positive development than what we see right now then we would expect to be able to do that, but that's, therefore, a proviso.</p>
          <p>If markets go into either recessionary mode or something closer to recessionary mode, then we would not expect to be able to outgrow our markets at that rate.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I'd like to come back to the subject of pricing, and this time a little bit more going forward. Could you give us an idea what you think will be the contribution of pricing versus volume within your targets going up for the next couple of years? And how does that tie in with your focus on your top clients, your top customers? Have you communicated that to them? How are you going to go &#x2013; how are you going to cooperate with them in that respect?</p>
          <p>And secondly, how does it also tie in with your marketing strategy, advertising and promotion strategy?</p>
          <p>The second question I have is relating to your assumption on emerging markets growth, and, in that respect, in particular to Eastern Europe. What are your growth expectations there? Is it vital that emerging markets are continuing to grow, as they have throughout 2008, for you to reach your targets? They also have been outlined as a major building block in your strategy. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="audio gap" /> change. In other words, there is also a certain assumption on input costs, rising input cost. If that goes down then, obviously, the pricing component is expected to go down somewhat. There again, we don't expect that to have an impact on our ability to reach our margin target.</p>
          <p>Have we communicated to our top customers, I think Kasper has tried to make clear, that what he's targeting, or what he's been targeting, or the Company wants to target, is not that we send top management to negotiate prices with our top customers. That's not the idea.</p>
          <p>It is getting in a strategic relationship with our top customers. That in the first place has nothing to do with pricing. So therefore, that's not a topic that needs to be addressed or will be addressed on the top customer, top management level connection with customers, and I think it would be &#x2013; shouldn't say foolish, but it would be very inappropriate to do that, because we have very good key account managers. They are the ones that need to be driving our sales and our relationship to our customers.</p>
          <p>We're trying to get beyond this level. And that key account management is standard practice, nothing that we have invented. So that's therefore the venue where to discuss prices, and particular actions. We're targeting something else, a stronger relationship with top customers permitting us to accelerate our growth with our top customers. That's not a pricing question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On &#x2013; just one word on the customers also, and then on emerging markets, then we'll go to marketing. To give you an example, some of our large customers in the reselling space, what we're doing is, we're taking them in one of our regions, two days to one of our headquarters, and discussing our innovation pipeline for the next two years, looking upon how our products fit into their overall assortment. Looking upon, in which areas do they want to make progress? Where do they see competitive space being opened? Where do they see competitive space being closed? And that's where you need to get alignment.</p>
          <p>On regional expansion for a lot of these customers, in some countries, they're very strong; in other countries, we're very strong, and getting to the leverage points in those areas. That is, in my opinion, a huge opportunity, still, for the Company to come, both in retail, but also industrial.</p>
          <p>You've got to make sure you can get the right price, but at the same time, you've also going to make sure that you're strategically aligned. Because if you've only got one and you don't have the other, the value proposition is not going to be a win-win position over time. And every time I've been in contact with some of our large customers, and Hans Van Bylen, Friedrich Stara and Thomas Geitner, who is involved very deep in this also. And two out of three were meeting our top customers this week, as an example. I'm having exactly the same experience. We've had only open doors, using this approach. Very constructive dialog.</p>
          <p>It doesn't mean you agree about everything, but there are certain elements you can reach agreement on, which are all complementary to the Ts and Cs.</p>
          <p>Just before we move on to the marketing spend, on our assumptions for the emerging markets. If you look upon &#x2013; we did 39% of our total business in the third quarter in the emerging markets, run rate one to nine was 37%. So if you do a bit of guerilla mathematics, we're between 37 and 38 for the year. If you say 38 for the year, and we start in 2004, that meant we gained 12 points from 2004 to 2008.</p>
          <p>And we're saying we're going to gain seven points in a three to four year timeframe, from '08 to '12. So what you are seeing &#x2013; you're actually already seeing a decline in the growth assumptions in our planning. So, I believe that we have a realistic target, because if I were to just take the number and just progress the number, we would get to probably closer to 50.</p>
          <p>If you were to keep growth rates stable, Western countries or mature countries versus emerging markets. So we already have a decline in that business model built in.</p>
          <p>Marketing spend is assumed to be flat year-over year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll ask two questions actually. Little bit after we discuss all the long-term issues, back a little bit to the fourth quarter. There are two questions on the fourth quarter actually. You mentioned, point number one, Cosmetics, you are quite positive to see an acceleration if I heard rightly. Can you, a little bit, elaborate what will drive that fourth quarter, and how's the risk on that?</p>
          <p>And potentially more important, Adhesives, we see that major customers of your automotive or others announcing production cuts of 25% or so. What is a kind of worst-case volume decline you could imagine for the fourth quarter? Are we talking about 5% or less or more, or can you give us a kind of feeling on that?</p>
          <p>And an additional question to the raw materials. If the oil price would stay at these levels, when do you believe you will see the benefit or is that something Q1, Q2 next year, or how is that evolving to your value chain or to your raw materials?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When referring to the performance of our Cosmetics division, I was referring to the performance that we have experienced in the first three quarters, which ended up with a very substantial margin, plus very strong organic growth. Our expectation, therefore, is that we're going to end up this year, and thereby, going through the fourth quarter on a similar performance level. I'm not suggesting that there are specific surprises coming from the Cosmetics division. What I'm suggesting is that we're going to see a similar level of high performance going through the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that compares to Q3, or to the first nine months? Because Q3 was a slowdown versus the first half-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a slowdown compared to the second quarter and the first quarter, that's true, in terms of organic growth. But we still have seen good organic growth in North America and the emerging countries. So therefore, I'm not referring to continuing the same rate of organic growth that we had in the first two quarters. What I'm suggesting is that there will be a positive contribution to reaching our 3 to 5% sales growth target from the Cosmetics division.</p>
          <p>With respect to worst-case volume scenarios, we've not done this. And I don't know how one can do this. Worst-case scenario would be that some of the major automotive companies go bankrupt, and then there's no sales anymore. How do you end up &#x2013; what's the worst case that can happen? Citi going bust, what does it mean to the financial world? Is it going to be a collapse, that's the worst case.</p>

          <p>I was more referring to Q4, and I wouldn't expect anyone going bust in Q4, so looking at if your customer cut production by 25%, some major customers, some others potentially are, okay, what that mean to your volumes, roughly?</p>

          <p>No, we have not calculated that into our expectations right now. What we have, obviously, looked at is the volume development based on announcements that have taken place, not which might be expected or could be expected. There are no &#x2013; not for the fourth quarter, though. No volume cutbacks of 25%, what we have so far seen is only extended holidays or production cuts for a week. That's therefore &#x2013; and that's something which we would not be able to at least, to some extent, reflect in our cost structure. That's not a worst case. That's what we have already factored into our expectations.</p>
          <p>With respect to the oil price, when's that coming through? We've consistently communicated that there's a delay of between five and six months for that to come through, at least in full impact, so therefore, as the oil price has peaked in end of June, mid of this year, we would expect that to come through then next year, first quarter.</p>

          <p>First of all, thank you very much for coming here today and discussing our long-term outlook with us. I can hear you are as excited about it as we are. I can tell you there's been a lot of hard work put into the planning of what we're trying to go through.</p>
          <p>At this stage, I believe it's important that we have a clear vision of the long term without losing the sight of the short term. At the same time, don't let the short term get in way of the long term, so finding the right balance. We've defined what we believe is a realistic but ambitious target for 2012, a realistic but ambitious target.</p>
          <p>As I said before, if it was a walk in the park, we would have taken that walk earlier than we're doing. We are committed to take the appropriate steps to get there. We've outlined the assumptions upon which we've communicated that, we believe we have the foundation in the Company to get there.</p>
          <p>2009, As Lothar said will be talked about in detail in February, but we also believe that 2009 will be a year where we'll take a number of steps that will be in the right direction for getting us to the 2012 targets. At this stage, we also believe it's important to keep &#x2013; for lack of better English &#x2013; to keep calm, not to take panic actions to reflect what's in the paper every day, because every day there's something different in the paper.</p>
          <p>So make sure that we do what we believe is right, but we don't do things that are silly. And so far, the management believes that we have taken a number of steps early on that will help us later on, as I alluded to before with our very early engagement in our restructuring program, the National Starch activities from changes in management, further cost reduction cuts, that will allow us to get to the 2012 targets.</p>
          <p>With this, thank you very much for coming on behalf of Henkel, and look forward to seeing you all, probably, in the first quarter, or hopefully all of you in the first quarter. Thank you.</p>
