          <p>Thank you, Chris. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Steve Chazen will provide details about our financial results for the first quarter in a moment. But I want to give you a brief preview of our meeting with all of you in the financial community in New York on May 19.</p>
          <p>Both Steve and I will present at the meeting, but so will 4 of our senior executives, who are responsible for International Oil &amp; Gas Operations, U.S. Oil &amp; Gas Operations, the California Oil &amp; Gas Operations, and also the fourth addition will be the worldwide exploration preview.</p>
          <p>We will give you details on developments in numerous key areas of our operations, which we know are of keen interest to you. Among the areas we will cover at the May 19 meeting are, one, we will provide you a multi-year production outlook and build-up from our asset base, which will provide considerable detail about the continued growth of the company. We will also outline significant and exciting new opportunities in California, including both conventional and unconventional prospects in the state. We will present details for our continuing growth and success in Oxy's existing Middle East production and also insight into new project potential. And we will provide you our anticipated capital spending program over the next 5 years.</p>
          <p>My colleagues and I look forward to meeting with you in 3 weeks to give you a thorough presentation on these and the numerous other outstanding growth areas at Oxy.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Steve Chazen, for the details on our first quarter performance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ray. Net income was 1.1 billion or $1.31 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 368 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations in core income were $1.32 per diluted share. 2009 first quarter core income was $0.50 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>For comparability purposes all of our prior period volumes, as well as volume based statistics, such as operating cost per barrel are being stated on pre-tax basis as we previously discussed with you. Please see the investor relations supplemental schedule for the previous 5 year and the 2009 quarterly sales volumes presented on a pre-tax basis.</p>
          <p>Here's a segment breakdown for the first quarter. Oil &amp; Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.8 billion, compared to 553 million for the first quarter of 2009. The improvement in 2010 was driven by significantly higher commodity prices and the higher volumes. Realized crude oil prices increased 83% in 2010, and domestic natural gas prices improved 59% from the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Partially offsetting these gains were higher operating expenses, largely resulting from fully expensing CO2 costs in 2010, as well as higher DD&amp;A rates and the effects of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>The year-over-year production was negatively impacted by a 38,000 BOE per day in Middle East North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia, which are a result of the higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas first quarter 2010 core earnings of 1.8 billion was essentially the same as the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, the 2010 first quarter earnings reflected higher crude oil and natural gas prices partially offset by increased DD&amp;A rates, the effect of fully expensing CO2 costs in 2010, lower total volumes resulting from 2 fewer days in first quarter of 2010 and the timing of liftings I will discuss shortly.</p>
          <p>Oxy's average realized crude price in the 2010 first quarter was 71.88 per barrel, an increase of about 3.5% from the 69.39 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009. Oxy's domestic average realized gas prices for the quarter was $5.62 per MCF compared with $4.37 per MCF for the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Worldwide oil and gas production for the first quarter of 2010 was 743,000 barrels equivalent per day, an increase of over 3.5% compared with 717,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of last year. Daily volumes increased in Bahrain by 2,000 barrels of oil and 126 million cubic feet of gas. Our domestic operations added 5,000 BOE, largely in the Kern County discovery area.</p>
          <p>Partially offsetting these increases were 4,000 BOE of lower volumes resulting from the Dolphin gas plant maintenance, which was shut in for 50% of the production for approximately 2 weeks.</p>
          <p>Sales volumes in the first quarter of 2010 were 726,000 BOE a day compared to 722,000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales volumes were lower than the production volumes I just mentioned due to the timing of liftings of 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the Middle East/North Africa Latin America of which 11,000 BOE a day were in Libya. Please see the investor relations supplemental schedules for net sales volumes per day and the net production per day by asset.</p>
          <p>Exploration expense was $56 million in the quarter. Oil &amp; Gas cash production costs excluding production and property taxes were $10.05 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to last year's 12-month cost of 9.37 a barrel. The increase reflects $0.32 a barrel higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense 100% of CO2 injected in the beginning of this year and higher field support, operations and maintenance costs.</p>
          <p>Taxes, other than on income were $1.82 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.60 for all of 2009. These costs which are sensitive to product prices reflect the effect of higher crude and natural gas prices.</p>
          <p>As a result of the factors discussed above, the first quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 benefited by $174 million from higher prices, $43 million lower exploration expense, 62 million of lower cash operating costs and G&amp;A expense. These gains were offset by the lower liftings of $102 million, the effect of 2 fewer sales days of $77 million, higher DD&amp;A rates of $69 million and higher CO2 costs being expensed of $25 million.</p>
          <p>Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $30 million compared to $33 million in fourth quarter of 2009. The first quarter 2010 results reflect the continued weakness of the domestic market, particularly in the housing and construction sectors and the significant margin erosion that was experienced through 2009 that carried in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Midstream segment earnings the first quarter 2010 were $94 million compared to $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in earnings was due to improved margins in the marketing and trading business, partially offset by lower pipeline income from Dolphin resulting from the 2-week partial shutdown in the gas plant for maintenance.</p>
          <p>Phibro's earnings for first quarter of 2010 were not significant.</p>
          <p>The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the first quarter of 2010. Capital spending for the first quarter of 2010 was about $850 million. Capital expenditures by segment were 80% in Oil &amp; Gas, 15% in Midstream with the rest in Chemicals. The spending run rate will increase throughout the year as we ramp up in California, Bahrain and Iraq. Our total year forecast has been increased by $200 million to $4.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations in the first quarter 2010 was $2.2 billion. We used 850 million of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $250 million on largely Permian acquisitions and &#x2013; Midcontinent, I'm sorry, acquisitions and 50 million on foreign contract commitments. These items amounted to 1.2 billion of cash use. We expect property acquisition activity to continue during this quarter as there is a sizeable build-up of opportunity.</p>
          <p>We also used $270 million to pay dividends and $225 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our 1.2 billion cash balance the end of last year by $700 million to 1.9 billion at the end of the quarter. The first quarter free cash flow after capital spending and dividends, but before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the 3 months of 2010, 812.1 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.5 million.</p>
          <p>As you look ahead in the current quarter, we expect Oil &amp; Gas sales volumes to be in the range of 750 to 760,000 BOEs a day at about current prices with production slightly above these levels.</p>
          <p>Production volume increases the second quarter expect to come from the following sources: domestically the Kern County discovery area expect to show modest improvement during the second quarter. The production continues to be constrained by the lack of additional processing capacity. More significant increases are expected to occur late in the second quarter when we add the skid mounted gas processing facilities. We are continuing with drilling and have completed a number of wells. We have sufficient completed wells to fill the entire capacity of the skid mounted processing facilities. Our oil production is also constrained by the lack of gas processing capacity since these wells also produce natural gas. The Midcontinent gas region we are currently drilling shallow gas wells &#x2013; shallow oil wells, is also expected to show production growth.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East, increases are expected in the Oman Mukhaizna field and Dolphin. For the first quarter plant maintenance down time not is expected to repeat. In Latin America, assuming no labor related stoppages; increases are expected in Argentina where the current run rate is about 2,000 BOE a day, higher than the first quarter, which was negatively affected by a short strike.</p>
          <p>The Argentine Provincial legislature passed enabling legislation in the first quarter that will allow a 10-year extension for hydrocarbon extensions. We are now negotiating the specific contract terms for the 10-year extension of our concession.</p>
          <p>With regard to prices, at the current market prices $1 per barrel change in oil prices, impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $36 million. The average first quarter WTI oil price was 78.71 per barrel. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs domestic's gas prices has a $31 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4 per MCF. Additionally we expect exploration expense to be about $80 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs.</p>
          <p>In the Chemical segment demand for caustic soda and vinyl is expected to continue to improve both in the United States and international markets. Moving caustic soda pricing and low natural gas prices will contribute to margin improvement. The Chemical segment is expected to provide about $80 million of earnings in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the second quarter to be about 42% depending on the split between domestic and foreign sourced income. Our first quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the investor relations supplemental schedule. Copies of the press release announcing our results and the schedules are available at our website www.oxy.com or through the SEC's Edgar system.</p>
          <p>We will provide additional detail at the May 19 Meeting with the financial community in New York City. We request that you limit your questions today specifically to the quarter results as opposed to strategic matters such as Iraq, Bahrain and California operations, which will be discussed in detail at the meeting. We're now ready to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As I think about one of your future sources for CO2 that has made a strategic shift towards more oil activity, can you talk about any of the specific terms of your contract regarding deliverability, any penalties around that deliverability? That would be helpful for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to cover this really in a lot of &#x2013; a lot more detail in the May meeting, but there's a sizeable penalty for failure to deliver if for some reason they don't deliver. But our current &#x2013; we currently anticipate they'll make their early numbers based on what they've told us. So &#x2013; but there is a sizeable penalty which would allow us to buy new CO2 elsewhere at an attractive net <mark type="inaudible" />. But we're going to cover this in a lot of detail in May.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just specifically on second quarter guidance and liftings, you mentioned growth in specific areas and no expected downtime. How much of the delayed liftings in first quarter come into that second quarter number and then how much volume would you expect to come into third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually what we said in the remarks was that we expect that production will exceed sales again in the second quarter. The numbers I gave you are sales numbers and we expect currently that production would be higher than that. So the answer to your question is none of &#x2013; effectively none of the liftings will show up. Traditionally what happens is that they lag just a little bit and it catches up by the fourth quarter, because it's just off a little bit and seems like a lot, but it's just off a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I look forward to the March meeting. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" />, of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Just a quick question on cash flow. You obviously generated a lot of free cash flow this quarter and I realize that the CapEx spend was &#x2013; is going to be a bit more back-end loaded throughout the year. But as we look at commodity prices and we look at relative levels to free cash flow, I realize you bumped up your CapEx a little bit, but how can we expect you to think about your uses of cash in terms of more aggressive deployment of organic capital versus cash return to shareholders and also the increase in CapEx, can you tell us was that in any particular area or just inflation across the board?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to talk about the use of cash &#x2013; I view it as a strategic question as opposed to a quarterly question. So we'll talk about the use of cash in much more detail in May, but the first quarter tends to be a very strong quarter for cash, because there's no tax payments. So there's more tax payments in the second quarter, so it will be a little different. The 200 million of capital is largely going to California.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And is that a result of increased activity from what you originally anticipated or is that just higher cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's increased activity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the tax rate, was there anything wacky or unusual other than your standard line which obviously is that it's a question of the mix between international and domestic, was there anything other than you would highlight as being particularly unusual about the lower than guidance, tax rates for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably the most difficult number to estimate. We do the best we can, but the tax department likes to always be a little more aggressive on what they think they are going &#x2013; the tax rate going to be. But it is &#x2013; I think what happened, was the lesser liftings out of Qatar and Libya made the tax rate appear a little lower because those are high tax rate areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So it really does go back to the international versus -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just noise.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On kind of news flow in the quarter, if you like, Conoco notably backed out of a project that you had expressed interest in. Is there any change now to the way you're looking at that project? Obviously, I'm referring to Abu Dhabi, and generally, Steve, any comments make about the M&amp;A environment that we're seeing? I'll leave it there, thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ray Irani here. We have consistently said over the last 2 years that the terms of the contract that was negotiated between ConocoPhillips and Abu Dhabi; the terms economically are not attractive to us. However, if the government wishes to approach us with different terms we'll look at them. Nobody's called us yet, that's our position.</p>
          <p>With regards to M&amp;A activity, Steve has mentioned that yes, there is more stuff asset-wise becoming available and Steve will give you more detail. Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the activity clearly has picked up and we're seeing a good flow of mostly Permian opportunities. And we expect to have a pretty good year for acquisitions in the Permian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And would you expect &#x2013; just going back to the Abu Dhabi thing, would you expect the government to potentially pursue that project alone or is it your understanding that they wouldn't?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, definitely. I was in Abu Dhabi recently. The government plans to proceed with that project, either alone or inviting partners, but the project will go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand. And then just back to the M&amp;A question, much less internationally, is that a function of just the nature of the opportunity set that we see internationally or is it more to do with your own interests? And I will leave it there. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just the flow from quarter-to-quarter. I don't think I would read much into any of this. A lot of individual sellers in the Permian as they fear the rising tax rates and the &#x2013; so we've seen quite a flood of a lot of small oil deals that people want to cash out before the tax rates go up.</p>

          <p>A couple things. Steve, in Argentina, if I could just ask you for a little bit of clarification as to what's going on down there. Have you now actually got the extension on your contract then?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>It is a 3-step process. You start with the government, the legislature passing a law, which enables the &#x2013; and the parameters of any extension, so there is a law which says these are the parameters of any extension. That's talking about the Provincial legislature. The government of Argentina then negotiates with us about the detailed terms, complying with the underlying legislation and that's where we are now. Then they will have to submit the final contract to the legislature when that's all negotiated. So the answer to your question is we've made progress, but we have not crossed the finish line. That's 10 years from when it expires, and I think it expires in about 3 years, so talking about 13 more years of production on average.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the ramifications if you get the extension, I'm guessing you would have reasonably substantial reserve bookings and so on along with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is it too early to make that kind of assessment, or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll tell you the numbers in a few weeks. But clearly you're going to have a significant amount of reserve bookings just from the &#x2013; not cutting the decline <mark type="inaudible" /> off in 3 years and a fairly sizeable decline in the DD&amp;A rate in Argentina.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. A couple other quick ones, if I may. I don't know if I missed this earlier, I apologize. You had a competing call going on, as you probably know. The jump in DD&amp;A, anything specific there that you can point to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the 2 areas that are the major increases are when we took the gas down, the amount of gas, <mark type="inaudible" /> using the $4 gas, that results in less gas reserves and a higher DD&amp;A rate in the Rockies. And the second area is Argentina, we continue to spend in anticipation of the contract being extended, but it hasn't been extended yet, and therefore you boost your DD&amp;A rate. The second one will &#x2013; once the contract extends will clearly go down and the first one we hope goes down if the natural gas prices were to cooperate, which I guess they're not doing today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and a couple of very quick final ones. The &#x2013; can you quantify the lost opportunity cost from the underlift in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I really don't. I can't quantify it. It's a sizeable number, though. You could &#x2013; on an after-tax basis you could probably take that number and use somewhere around $20 a barrel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And the final one, I don't know if you're prepared to answer this one, but you've given us end of quarter run rate or production rates out of the Kern County discovery, would you care to share what they were at the end of the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because &#x2013; we'll have some story here 2 weeks from now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I'll leave it there, thanks, Steve.</p>

          <p>Question comes from Monroe Helm of Barrow, Hanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot guys. Actually my question I think you answered is to &#x2013; unless you want to amplify it, as to why you are assuming these opportunities to buy reserves in the Permian, I guess you said it's basically because small operators are worried about tax rates going up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And royalty owners, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Small working interest royalty owners. The is spigot really a lot of small deals.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You may not want to say this, but can you tell us what the processing capacity was in California in the first quarter and where you expect it to be when you get the additional capacity on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill. Why don't &#x2013; Bill answer the capacity question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Our current &#x2013; Monroe, our infrastructure capacity at Elk Hills is 420 million a day.</p>
          <p>And the skid mounted gas plant is name plated for an additional 90 million a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, thanks a lot. We'll see you at your meeting.</p>
