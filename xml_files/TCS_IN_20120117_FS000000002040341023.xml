        <plist>
          <p>Chandra and Maha will give us a brief overview of the company's performance followed by the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>As you are aware, we do not provide specific revenue or earnings guidance. Anything said on this call which reflects our outlook for the future or which can be construed as a forward-looking statement must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. We have outlined these risks in the second slide of the analyst presentation available on our website and to &#x2013; and which has been mailed out to everyone on our mailing list.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chandra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kedar. What I would like to do today is to give you a brief overview of the results of Q3 and also address some key points regarding the future.</p>
          <p>I'm happy to report that we have had another strong set of numbers in this quarter. You know the numbers; the revenue in terms of INR terms is 13.5%, and constant currency 4.5%, and U.S. dollar terms 2.4%. And in terms of operating margin, we have been able to expand it 213 basis points and the net profit is at INR287 crores, which is 18.4% Q-on-Q and little over 23% on year-on-year.</p>
          <p>And in terms of client addition has been healthy. We added 40 new clients and deal signings have been on track. We signed at least 10 large deals. Again it is broad-based. These deals have come from all markets, three from U.S., four from Europe including UK, and two from Asia-Pacific.</p>
          <p>In terms of industries, two each from retail and banking and one each from telecom, insurance, high-tech, manufacturing, utilities and life sciences. So, it's been pretty broad-based and come from different markets and across sectors.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the deals that we are pursuing, it is healthy. We have added a large number of associates, more &#x2013; 18,000 associates we have added and the attrition levels have come down to around 12.3%; and IT services attrition is below 12%; and in terms of utilization, it is at roughly about 82%, excluding trainees; and including trainees, it is about 74%. So, we have been able to manage a healthy utilization, a good gross and net addition of associates and also the deal pipeline remains healthy.</p>
          <p>Now, when you look at the future, I want to talk about three points. The first one is the macro. We all know what's happening in Europe, and there is a lot of commentary, and there is the down grade of some countries and there is also a lot of talk about the eurozone, what's going to happen et cetera. So, I would not elaborate on that, I would take that as a given and it will follow its normal course.</p>
          <p>But on the ground, if you look at the budgets for the next fiscal year, what we did was looked at our top 120 customers. And out of the 120 customers, 96 customers have finalized their budgets. And out of the 96 customers, two-thirds of them have either increased their budget or remaining flat. The remaining one-third have reduced their budget for the next fiscal year.</p>
          <p>And in terms of discretionary project, we looked at a sample of 130 discretionary projects across industries, across markets that we have been pursuing this quarter. Roughly about 50% of those budgets &#x2013; of those discretionary projects have a delay in decision making.</p>
          <p>None of the projects have been cancelled. Some projects got closed later than they were scheduled to. So that is the trend we are seeing. So if we have to articulate all of this in terms of what it means, we feel that the pipeline remains intact, and there are no calculation of projects. So, we are confident at this point in time.</p>
          <p>Having said that, from a discretionary spend perspective, the delay in the projects can mean a lag in the ramp-ups in terms of volumes for those projects. Those are all the comments I want to make with respect to the outlook; otherwise, things are business as usual from our point of view.</p>
          <p>With those words, I would like to turn it over to Maha to give a color on the Q3 performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chandra. As Chandra has mentioned already, our Q3 revenue of INR132.04 billion represents a sequential growth of 13.5% and year-on-year growth of 36.6%. Translated into dollars, our revenue of $2.586 billion represents a Q-on-Q growth of 2.4% and year-on-year growth of 20.6%.</p>
          <p>Removing the negative cross-currency impact of 2.1% and expressing the dollar revenue in constant currency terms, our revenue was $2.640 billion; that's a sequential growth of 4.5%. The breakup of quarterly revenue growth in INR terms is as follows: volume growth, plus 3.2%; constant currency realization, plus 198 basis points; offshore shift, minus 64 basis points; currency benefit, plus 8.95%. The currency windfall helped us to expand our EBIT margin by 214 basis points to 29.25% even after accounting for some increased costs this quarter. The impact of different levers on the operating margin is follows: currency, 282 basis points plus; shift to GDC, minus 10 basis points; rate productivity impact, minus 94 basis points; provision for bad debts, minus 10 basis points; others, plus 45 basis points. And that gives us 214 basis points plus.</p>
          <p>The rupee's slide also meant a higher ForEx loss of INR3 billion in this quarter. Despite that, our expand &#x2013; we expanded the net income margin by 90 basis points to 21.9%. Effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%. DSO for the quarter was 81 days. Invested funds stood at INR96.8 billion.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we have delivered a good growth in a seasonally weak quarter in the time of global macroeconomic uncertainty. At the same time, we have maintained our pricing discipline and our cost discipline despite the windfall from the weakened rupee.</p>
          <p>With that, we can open the line for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We have the first question from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. My first question is, you talked about how you were seeing some delays in decision-making; I wonder if you could talk about what would cause those delays to turn into cancellations and what would cause them to increase or decrease?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think I want to clarify it a little bit. There are two types of spends happening. Projects which are outsourcing in nature, transformational in nature, efficiency driving in nature, those things are happening on target. But, when we look at the projects which are discretionary in nature, which are developmental projects, building new capabilities, we find across sectors, across market, roughly half of those projects get delayed. But, we have not seen any projects being cancelled. And, I think the reason I would say is extra due diligence. When they are spending money on developmental projects or new capabilities, they are spending more time in the due diligence. That's the only rationale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, do you just mean that as we look out into next calendar year that you're expecting a slow start to the year as one of your competitors has sort of indicated, and then a ramp as you go later into the year. How does that affect the seasonality of <mark type="ph" /> whatever it is (11:03)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I wouldn't say that it is going to be back-ended for the whole calendar year; I wouldn't say that. I would just say that as we are entering the year the discretionary projects which will start ideally in January &#x2013; sometime in January, may not start in January. I hope they will start sometime in the quarter. That's the way we're interpreting it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, then just one last question for me; as you look at your basic services, verticals, and geographies, maybe you could give us a breakdown of which should perform well in this type of environment and maybe the ones that you are a little bit more concerned about, if you could just take look at your offerings and give us a breakdown? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you really ask me about the performance, we are particularly happy because it's very secular. All our industries have grown, and all our markets have grown. If you look at the market perspective, Europe has done well, U.K. has done well, U.S. has done well but slightly lower than the Continental Europe, and then we've also got in Asia-Pacific, India which had an issue last quarter. So, I think it's pretty much an all-around growth. And, if you take the industries, all the industries have grown. The volumes compared to last quarter to this quarter is primarily due to the seasonality of having lower working days. Otherwise, all the industries have by and large grown, particularly if you take telecom. It first grew for -- in so many quarters, in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>And, I've said that we need to wait one or two quarters and this quarter, it's more or less flat or slightly negative, but more or less flat. And, the deal pipeline in telecom is good. We have one deal in telecom. So, I expect telecom to grow from here. So, I think from an industry's point of view, retail, consumer goods, manufacturing, telecom, utilities, licenses, all have shown good traction from &#x2013; if you look at the order book and the deal flow point of view. Insurance has also done well. So, I think I am not particularly negative on any sector at this point or negative on any market at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. Chandra, it wasn't very clear from your comment, and again maybe you're &#x2013; I think you're using the speakerphone. Some of the project ramp-up delays that you've kind of mentioned, are they specifically concentrated in one or two verticals? Is it more focused on Europe versus North America and across the board, I think it will be helpful if you give us some more better color on that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the discretionary projects in general, there is no specific pattern. There is no specificity in terms of a market or an industry. Discretionary projects in general, when we took a sample size of about 130 projects, half of them had a delay in decision making and a delayed start in the last three months. That is the data points we are giving you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is no pattern here. And as I said, it is primarily due to more rigorous due diligence in those projects. That's the way I interpret it, that's way we interpret it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So what gives you the comfort that these projects will start some time during the quarter and this could not be kind of the beginning of kind of a &#x2013; maybe a prolonged spending freeze on discretionary work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I don't have a crystal ball and I don't predict the future. But having said that, we have not seen any cancellation of projects. Second is that when I have said delays, and those projects have started as well, some of the projects have started as well. It is just that we expect the project to start on November 1, it is not starting on November 1. Sometimes there is a month delay, sometimes there is a six-month delay, sometimes there is a movement from Q3 to Q4. And those kind of patterns we are seeing. So, I really feel, based on all the specific data points we have, we should expect a lag in terms of ramp-up of discretionary projects at least during Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood and then can you give us any commentary on pricing trends which is something you do every quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment on pricing trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing, yeah, pricing has been &#x2013; this quarter these have gone up, but overall we believe that the pricing is going to be stable in a very narrowband, exactly as I said last quarter.</p>
          <p>It's going to be hard to get increases unless there has been a scheduled increase. If there is a scheduled increase, you will get that. Otherwise it's going to be very hard, especially with the current macro environment being what it is. But there are no decreases as well. So it's going to be stable in a very, very narrowband.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mitali Ghosh from Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Mr. Chandra, it will be quite helpful if you could give us a bit more detail on the banking vertical and the trends that you are seeing there in terms of spend, in terms of growth obviously, and also the kind of services there, probably you are seeing some demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I had talked about a sample size of 120 clients &#x2013; top clients and 96 of them having finalized the budgets, and I said two-thirds of them have either a flat or an increasing budget, and the trend is not varying depending on the sector. Even in the banking and the insurance sector, we see patterns where some clients are increasing, some clients are flat and some clients are dipping. So from our point of view, we have not seen any shocks, any negative vibes in the banking and financial services sector at this point in our client portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you &#x2013; I mean, are there any trends that one can draw in terms of service lines overall where you are probably seeing more demand and where there is more risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, definitely from a banking and financial services point of view, there is spend happening in regulatory related areas, that there is a spend happening in business intelligence and also in terms of infrastructure &#x2013; optimizing the infrastructure, and we are also seeing some consolidation among vendors as well. So these are the type of things.</p>
          <p>And obviously the other area which is very strong whether it is banking, whether it is insurance or retail is the digital consumer, building applications for mobile use and also incorporating some of the analytics and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:06) so on and so forth. That's the other area that we are seeing traction. These are the four or five different areas in which we are winning deals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just, overall enterprise solutions saw a good growth for you this quarter, but it is typically more discretionary in nature. So, how should we think about that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what &#x2013; Mitali, it's not that every project is getting delayed, that's why I was pretty specific. 130 projects were the sample and we took this sample across industries, across markets and also different sizes. So truly a representative sample I would say. And 50% of them is on track. They &#x2013; I mean we were bidding and we won and they started and everything happened on time. Remaining 50%, there is delay. Some are taking with a lag of one month, some are taking more time, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So I wouldn't draw too many conclusions, whether it is enterprise solutions or BI. You saw SAP numbers. They've had one of the best quarters. So, I don't want to be overly negative. At the same time, I don't want to say that macro doesn't matter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just in terms of campus offers, how many campus offers have been made so far and if you have a target perhaps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for campus, we have given 43,600 offers and that &#x2013; with that, we have closed our campus season as far as this year is concerned, and then we'll start joining from June-July timeframe onwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Ajoy, what sort of &#x2013; what is the kind of fresher to lateral hiring you're targeting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>That &#x2013; we will do all of our business planning somewhere around February-March, and that is the time, depending upon the business demand, we will work that out. At this stage, the only certainty is the number of campus offers, which is 43,600.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See the &#x2013; there are two types of hedges. The first one is the revenue hedge. We have $1.7 billion outstanding of which $1.3 is for Q4, that is the March quarter, and the remaining is for this subsequent period. And as we can see that is not very much. In addition to that, we have $1.1 billion in terms of receivable hedges, which are &#x2013; so whenever I talk in terms of the currency rate and so on, it really applies to the revenue hedges.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question in terms of our cash flows, can't reconcile the fact that despite our operating income over the last nine months has having grown at 25%, our operating cash flow has actually declined and our free cash flow has also declined year-on-year over this period. And this is despite no deterioration &#x2013; no material deterioration in our DSOs. So what exactly explains this deterioration and do we see a reversal in terms of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See the &#x2013; as far cash flow is concerned, the &#x2013; we are in a &#x2013; there are two points that we have to look at. One is, we're in a growth environment. And therefore, the growth environment itself is taking additional working capital of the organization. And the second one is, of course, the exchange &#x2013; exchange that you will see. So, those are the two things that have really &#x2013; that you have to factor in. All the others are normal, whether it is dividends, capital expenditure and so on. So, there is no &#x2013; given &#x2013; you see, the one way to calculate many of this, certainly from a current account perspective, is in terms of looking at the last 12 months' revenue and then looking at it as a percentage. And we have not seen much of a deterioration as &#x2013; in regard to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because in terms of cash flow from operations, looking at the percentage of sales, there is a deterioration from around 19% for the last nine months versus the previous year same period. It is 14% in this year versus 19% last year.</p>

There isn't &#x2013; we haven't seen any reduction in the quality from a cash flow point of view.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a couple of questions. I know we kind of discussed the vertical split, but initially you spoke about how &#x2013; while two-thirds of the budgets <mark type="ph" /> with clients (24:37) has closed, they have actually been stable to positive. One, is there a color you can give us in terms of your vertical exposure there? Is there any particular sector where you've seen a bit of stress and a more negative outlook? Could you &#x2013; has there been any sector where you've seen more negative budgets than the rest?</p>
          <p>And secondly, how relevant is an annual budget in this kind of a year where there is greater scrutiny on budget? Do you think that budgets could be announced, but they will not get spent through the year? Is that a possibility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Diviya, I think &#x2013; good question. I tried to see a pattern, but there is no pattern. And in every sector, I have a mix in terms of customers spending more, spending less and also being flat. And also, just because there is a budget cut doesn't mean that our volume is going to go down. We have been winning market share there. And just because there is a budget increase doesn't mean that we should have a significant volume in that account. That &#x2013; we should keep that in mind. But by and large, I don't see a pattern.</p>
          <p>The second thing is &#x2013; the sense I am getting is that all the decisions that people are taking today is fully knowing what is going on. That is what is different now compared to two to three years ago. So I feel &#x2013; as I said before, I don't have a crystal ball. I cannot predict the future, I really cannot comment on it. But by and large I feel that customers are aware of what's going on and then deciding on their plans in that context. To that extent, there is likely to be more certainty in what they say now than what they said two, three years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. And secondly, I think just coming back to how you're feeling about growth in 2012. Has your optimism waned in the last three months compared to where we were at the end of the last quarter numbers? Or do you think you're as confident as ever going into 2012, despite ongoing uncertainty?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good evening. My question is on the wage side. We've heard a little bit about some, maybe pulling back of wages; one of your competitors suggested maybe overall wage increases in the single-digits. Could you comment about your fresher offers, how those offers were versus a year ago? And also maybe any thoughts you can offer on the overall wage outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I think we will decide wage increases, et cetera, in the next quarter towards the end of the current quarter, but having said that definitely it is likely to be in single digits. I can't tell a number or range now; it's likely to be in the single digits. Ajoy, do you want to add any color?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the other question was related to the fresher hires. The fresher hires that we have done this year vis-&#xE0;-vis what we did last year, there has been no change in salary. <mark type="ph" /> There has been the (28:04) same compensation level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And can you talk a little bit about the business process outsourcing part of your business, what's the tone there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's been healthy. Even if you look at the current quarter, they have grown in INR terms 13.1% and on the constant currency term 4.1%, so it's been pretty healthy. The &#x2013; we have also won a couple of deals in the business process outsourcing during this quarter; good, important, bulky wins. And the pipeline is healthy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And final question is are you &#x2013; there was a wave of consolidation after the Lehman issue. Is that consolidation of vendors still happening or is it pretty much steady state at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some &#x2013; it depends on the particular customer situation. In some customers definitely under-consolidation is happening. In some other customers, there are projects to consolidate, <mark type="ph" /> and around their (29:09) infrastructure applications. So it does happen; it's a mixed bag really. Can't really have a broad-brush statement.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Viju George from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. I'm just trying to understand when you talk about discretionary projects what percent of your revenues would you classify as discretionary? Is it just a straight addition of enterprise solutions or business consulting &#x2013; or business intelligence and consulting? Or is there something that is more layered? Just trying to understand what percent of your of revenues might be vulnerable to a lag in decision-making?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in general, I would say discretionary to be 20%, 25% as the overall portfolio, as discretionary projects. And out of which, some of it will come from the past signings. And all of that doesn't reflect in the current quarter. And as I said, it is not a uniform thing. On the sample size we did, about 50% of the projects are on time, the remaining 50% is where we saw the delay and some are delays within the quarter, some are delays which are moving across the quarter. So I think that when we project the volumes for Q4, we need to take that into account and moderate it. That's the only message I'm trying to get across. If you ask me straight, that's the only message I'm trying to get across.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. But I also at the same time noticed that your people addition numbers have been pretty strong in this quarter. And I think you are just about 9,000 or so away from the next quarter numbers from a gross addition perspective; it looks like you're going to doing maybe 10,000 more than that. So, in a way your people addition numbers don't seem to square up so well with the slight <mark type="ph" /> muteness in comment you pointed (31:14) out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Viju, we are not going to change the people addition number based on one data point in one area of the market. Second thing is we don't see this as phenomena for the entire calendar year.</p>
          <p>Let me say that we don't think that the growth is going to be backended or anything for the next fiscal year. So we want to be prepared for the next fiscal year. And we will be adding additional 15,000 people at least during Q4.</p>
          <p>So all I am saying is that, currently as we leave Q3, we have experienced this and we will see that impact to some extent in Q4. And we will be watching all these discretionary projects as we move into the &#x2013; as we move along in Q4. But otherwise we are not seeing a cause of alarm of any kind for us to stop hiring or anything like that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And actually, Viju, if you see the margin that we have delivered that has come, as currency improvement has happened, the margin improvement due to the currency has happened, but also utilization has dropped from last quarter to this quarter to more than 1%. So still we have shown a credible margin improvement, so execution has been pretty good. So we have taken all that into account and we are staying on course on hiring.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Just wanted to get your commentary as to how you look at some of the projects that are coming up for rebid that were given out in 2006-2007 timeframe, because <mark type="ph" /> CPA was (33:18)  quoting a pretty large number that's coming up for renewal. So just wanted to see, how do you see &#x2013; do you see any vendor churn happening and what kind of interest you're having?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are definitely winning market share, but at the same time we don't bid on each one of those projects, because of the nature of those programs. So we will bid on some of those projects, and some of those projects we will not bid, some of those contracts we will not bid, because of the nature that is involved in asset takeover and so on and so forth. But we are looking at a healthy deal pipeline as we look at things today. We have delivered good wins, and currently are foreseeing a good number of deals in all markets. So it's &#x2013; I think &#x2013; we will have our reasonable share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And in terms of Europe, especially Continental Europe, has there been an increased acceptance towards cost takeover deals and probably couple of years, but just wanted to see how are Continental Europe &#x2013; clients in Continental Europe looking at, is there an increased urgency to &#x2013; or especially on the cost takeover deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cost takeover transfer, transformation, some are combined cost takeover in the near-term, or the first 18 months then there is a transformation, all those kind of deals we are seeing. And we &#x2013; frankly, we have done well in Europe in Q2; you saw the numbers. And then we have again done well in Q3. And, the deal signings in Europe for the current quarter has been good as I mentioned earlier and four deals come out of Europe, both including Continental Europe and the U.K.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. When you mentioned that two-thirds of the budgets you see as flat so therefore the third would be down, where was that number last year about this time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry; I don't have that data. I did this is a lot more meticulously and &#x2013; this year because we wanted to see lot more trends and I can't really give a like-to-like comparison from last year to this year. But, I would say as I said some time ago, everyone who is deciding on the budgets are a lot more knowledgeable about the environment today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, they know the context in which they are making these decisions. So, those are the data points I can share because a lot of analysts have been asking me over the last month or so, any color on this. So, we've really tried to make sure that we give you a very good perspective. And, I don't want to give you more data that can lead to any misleading conclusions. So, there are no specific patterns we see that we can give you. But, I think....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, let me try two more if I could then. If the budgets are still getting settled, is it &#x2013; can you give us any color or perception on scope or duration changes? In other words, are clients looking at smaller chunks, if you will, of spending with either dollar or timeframes? Or, is the scope or duration relatively consistent today compared to last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's &#x2013; you have to repeat it. I think it's too complicated for me. Can you repeat the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of the dollar amount of contracts being bid out, are clients shortening up either in terms of years...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. See, again as I said, there are two ways to look at it. The transformational contracts, contracts which are <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:46) contracts, they are very large and those contracts are not slowing down. In fact, the ten large deals I announced today all are quite large. They are INR50 million, INR100 million, INR150 million, INR250 million type sizes. So, they are not coming down in size. That's one. The second aspect is that if you look at the discretionary contracts, they always vary; from INR0.5 million, it can go &#x2013; INR300,000, INR400,000, it can go up to tens of millions, typically transformation contracts &#x2013; discretionary projects. So....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...there is no &#x2013; see, I think there is no &#x2013; I have to clarify this very carefully. There is no pattern to suggest there is a change in the way they contract or change in the way they split the money, et cetera. The only conclusion I could draw is that they are doing a deeper due diligence, especially when they are doing a developmental project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Could I ask one more and then I will cede the floor is &#x2013; on the third that presumably have lower spending level or lower budgets, is there any patterns that you could draw from that? Is that mostly Europe? Is it more financial services? Any patterns in the clients who are indeed lowering budgets or appear to be lowering budgets?</p>

          <p>No. Honestly, there is no pattern. And, it is not sector specific. It is not market specific. In fact, when we did this analysis, we were going through &#x2013; one of the &#x2013; one of the things that we wanted to come up with is can we narrow it down to a particular market or a particular type of client, et cetera, or industry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is not. There is no such pattern. And, I am just saying this on a basis of about 100, 120 clients when you look at large companies. If one-third of them are going to have a decreasing budget, we also have to know that in any year there will be some of them will have a decreasing budget. So, the thing to look for is the speeding up or on-time decision-making in projects and no cancellation of projects. Those are the things that we should look for. It is not to say that out of this one-third how much are they going to reduce, are they going to increase it by another INR50 million, INR100 million; that is not what I would look for. I would look for whatever visibility we have and whatever projects we are bidding, everything to stay on course in terms of decision-making; that's what I would look for.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just is it possible to break down the pricing increase of 2 percentage points in terms of rate card versus non-rate card, as there is some 40% increase in the hardware and license revenue, as well as the pricing increase is not being reflected in a margin increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sandeep, no, it's not &#x2013; we'll not be able to break that pricing increase into different categories. And, the second was we take out hardware revenue while calculating all these.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, the pricing increase is excluding the revenue coming from hardware?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is right.</p>

          <p>Okay. And, Maha, is it possible to give us the volume increase in the international business?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I think it is pretty standard <mark type="ph" /> bus (41:48). Both of them are more or less the same. I think there is a few percentage point difference between international and domestic. The domestic has grown largely volume based. There is no pricing increase. It's about 14% on a 13.5% international &#x2013; global increase in rates &#x2013; in revenues. So, from volumes point of view and a constant currency point of view, it's not...</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, this time if you look at there is some slowdown within the top two to five clients as well as top six to ten so is it a quarterly aberration or is it more to do with the decision-making delay impacting more the top clients?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. Actually, the top client has stayed exactly at the same level as last quarter, has grown exactly at the company level. And, two to five, five to ten have all grown in terms of &#x2013; absolute terms, they've grown. You will always find aberrations in the two to five and five to ten. Sometimes they will grow below the company average; sometimes they will grow above the company average. But, the important thing is that all of them are growing.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. I just wanted to understand what's happening in Europe. I think the whole industry has done extremely well in this region. So, is it that you are seeing a lot more off-shoring happening or you're seeing new outsources coming in? And, particularly relevant given the macro environment, what are you seeing in the banking <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:00) space in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think your voice was very feeble. If I understand it, your question is, are European clients open to more off-shoring and what...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And banking &#x2013; and particularly the banking sector in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said that we are seeing good growth in Europe, not necessarily all of it from banking. I think it has been broad-based. We have got clients in multiple sectors. But we are not seeing anything specific and at least let me put it this way. The deals that we have won in continental Europe are non-banking, so &#x2013; but we are pursing banking opportunities as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, the thing is given all the concerns, the macro concerns in the eurozone and the crisis that's going on, what is it that's actually driving off-shoring in the region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I think everything cannot be linked only to the eurozone crisis because as I said companies are driving efficiency and when they have to drive efficiency they adopt a number of things. They look at off-shoring. They look at vendor consolidation. They look at application consolidation. They look at rationalization. They are even open to BPO off-shoring, and they are consolidating their SAP footprint. So, so many different things are happening and European companies are also adapting to all of these opportunities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have a question for Chandra and then have a follow-up question for Ajoy. First Chandra, we saw a good performance in this quarter also in fact, but like earlier also you have mentioned &#x2013; I agree that cost efficiency and things will drive growth in Europe, but we were expecting some more growth in the BFSI part probably. And also the churning in vendor that was &#x2013; what is your view on that? How is it picking up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think from a growth perspective, at the end of last quarter during the Analyst Call, we had clearly said Q3 is going to be a weak quarter, primarily because the number of working days are less and that has &#x2013; that is reflected in all the verticals, not necessarily on BFSI. So, that's the only comment I have with respect to the volumes <mark type="ph" /> really (50:26) expected. The second question is what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question is &#x2013; my second question was primarily basically how you're seeing like &#x2013; almost as you mentioned that some third &#x2013; one-third of the clients have shown a negative &#x2013; basically shown cut in the budget. Is it just as a normal thing which happens every year or you're seeing this to be exaggerated this time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I really don't have data points at the same time last year to say how many of them have cut the budget this year compared to last year. But it's fair to expect that some of them will cut budgets in any year. So, that's where I am. So, I am more focused on all the projects getting kick-started and all the decisions continuing to be made on time. That's the only thing I would look for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I have a follow-up question for Ajoy. Ajoy I just wanted to know some like we were last time talking about a comfortable range of 80% to 84% on the utilization front, and our attrition level of 11.5%, 12% maybe is a comfortable level. But now my question is like, suddenly the utilization has started dipping, although I agree that Chandra last time also mentioned that you're comfortable between 82% to 84% utilization level. But is it possible that we can have a consistently 83% to 84% range rather than 82% to 84% range going forward because of the kind of base on which we are operating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have maintained that 82% to 84% is the comfortable range, and this quarter I think as Chandra mentioned that we dipped from 83% to 82%, about a percentage point dip, but still the margin we have been able to retain. So our goal is to operate there and given the overall scenario I think we are also prepared for a slight drop if that comes to it and he talked about the hiring 15,000 that we'll be doing this quarter and all that we have covered.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Chandra, you talked about vendor consolidation in the financial services domain, are you sensing anything different in this round of vendor consolidation compared to what happened in 2008, and are you seeing any &#x2013; the entry of any new players or are you seeing kind of predatory pricing? What are the trends you are seeing there and can I just talk to or compare it to what you saw last time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, first is that I am not singling out financial services for vendor consolidation. All I was saying was across sectors the efficiency drive is resulting in any one of the following. We are seeing vendor consolidation, we are seeing infrastructure consolidation; we are seeing application rationalization, application consolidation &#x2013; a variety of things that was the context in which I said. And I am not seeing anything peculiar this time around, compared to any other time. Actually I have no data point to report there that's positive or negative.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And second question is on IMS, you had three strong quarters of growth. Anything different you are winning here or what are the kind of deals that you are getting here? What's leading to this rebound in growth there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's a practice that's growing very well and we have built a lot of capabilities and the deal pipeline is good. And we continue to bid for large engagements and are also winning large engagements. Many of them are global as well. So the pipeline is good and robust. We should continue to see growth in IMS.</p>

I think your issue comes in because you are seeing this by realization increase, but you've not seen any improvement as far as the margins are concerned. So all that we are essentially saying is that there is a lot of moving parts here that is this issue of the different mix of services, different mix in terms of locations and also different mix in terms of resources, different mix in terms of geographies. So there are many points here. So...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Yeah. So that's the &#x2013; those are the kinds of factors.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So shift towards global GDC should be a bigger factor as compared to the others?</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rachael Stormonth from NelsonHall. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. I noticed a number of the service lines have seen a significant slowdown in revenue growth this quarter, I'd like to ask you about the BPO service line and also about the Asset Leverage Solutions, to what extent is the latter a cyclical phenomenon? And also can you explain why the slowdown in BPO revenue growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you ask only about the BPO or did you ask about something else in the beginning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Asset Leverage Solutions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The software as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See the Asset Leverage Solution is doing very well. If you go back and look at the last several quarters it's beginning to grow. And this quarter it has been almost flat in the constant currency terms. In INR terms, it's been about 6% but constant currency terms it's flat compared to the previous quarter. But the deals &#x2013; deal wins have been healthy but if you look at last five or six quarters, it has been continuously growing and especially when practice is growing and it is small compared to the larger units, you should always expect that there will be &#x2013; sometimes neutral growth, sometimes heavy growth.</p>
          <p>But Asset Leverage Solutions really is one area where we are very bullish about. We have got a fantastic set of assets and portfolio ranked very well by all the analysts and delivering great results for the last several quarters. So, I think, I expect that &#x2013; this will do well as we go into FY '13.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I understood that &#x2013; so that's lumpy. Could you explain the slowdown in BPO, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>BPO has not slowed down. BPO has delivered a Q-on-Q growth of 13.1%. On a constant currency basis it has grown 4.1% as opposed to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:10) 4.5% of the company. So it's pretty healthy. It's not &#x2013; it's not slowed down.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good quarter in a challenging environment. I just wanted to understand that one-third of those clients, you know 120 clients where there is possibility of cutting the IT budget, where are they actually placed in client bucket, is it towards the higher end or lower end or evenly spread across bucket size?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let us not disaggregate this number more because any data point I have will be data points, which are not consistent enough to give you any meaningful guidance. All I would say is that, if that's your question, there is no risk in our top clients.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sure. And also 50% of the discretionary projects that are seeing some delays, are those projects deferred beyond Q4? You know if you have what percentage of those projects has been deferred beyond Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't know yet. I mean, I won't know yet. I expected them to start during the Q3. Some of them started with a delay. Some of them are moved into Q4. But whether they will go beyond Q4, I will not know today. I will know as we go into the &#x2013; as we go into the &#x2013; because I don't have a forecast from the customer that they are moving beyond Q4. We expect them to start sometime in Q4, but I don't have any other information. If I hear anything, I will <mark type="ph" /> obviously want (60:07) to talk to you guys.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints that was the last question. I would now like to hand the floor back to Mr. Shirali and the management for closing comments. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you who are &#x2013; all of you. Thanks to all of you for joining the call. We are quite happy with the Q3 numbers, more than the numbers, the foreign currency growth. The fact that it is secular, it has grown across markets, across industries is satisfying. We are quite happy with the utilization where we are. We have a good bench strength and the deal signings have been good.</p>
          <p>Frankly speaking, in terms of the budgets, we are quite happy with where we are. I would like to watch the discretionary projects. I do expect a volume impact due to the late start of the discretionary projects at this stage as far as Q4 is concerned. But going forward, we remain very positive about FY '13.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and wish you all a wonderful 2012.</p>
