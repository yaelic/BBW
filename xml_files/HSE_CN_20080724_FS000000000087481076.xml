        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brock. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased that you could join us today to discuss our 2008 second quarter results that we released yesterday. With me in the room are Mr. John Lau, President and Chief Executive Officer; Alister Cowan, Chief Financial Officer; Rob Peabody, Chief Operating Officer, Operations and Refining; and Don Ingram, Senior Vice President of Midstream and Refined Products.</p>
          <p>In today's call John will discuss the financial results and give an overview of the operational highlights. Don Ingram will give an update on the Midstream and Downstream divisions. John will then conclude and we'll open the call up for questions, starting with analysts and followed by the media.</p>
          <p>Please note that today's comments contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of the various risk factors and assumptions that are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings which are available on SEDAR, EDGAR, and on our website.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to John.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick. Good afternoon to everyone. I am pleased to report that in the second quarter of 2008 Husky achieved record results in this strong price environment. For the second quarter of 2008, sales and operating revenue was up 125% to $7.2 billion, compared with $3.2 billion in the same period of 2007.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations increased 66% to 2.1 billion, or $2.46 per share. Earnings were 1.36 billion or $1.61 per share in the second quarter, up 89% from 721 million, or $0.85 per share, in the same quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>For the first six months, sales and operating revenue was $12.3 billion, up 92% compared with 6.4 billion in the same period of 2007. Cash flow from operations increased 38% to $3.6 billion, or $4.28 per share. Earnings were $2.3 billion or $2.65 per share, up 64% from 1.4 billion, or $1.61 per share in the first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>To allow shareholders to benefit from high commodity prices, the Board has approved an increase of our quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.50 per share. This dividend on annualized basis translates into approximately a 5% yield at current Husky share price levels.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, Husky's production averaged 359,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting a reduction of 5% from the second quarter of 2007. The decrease in production volumes was primarily due to the suspension of the White Rose production for 11 days due to severe ice pack and iceberg conditions, <mark type="inaudible" /> of Terra Nova turnaround and reduced natural gas drilling in 2007.</p>
          <p>Total crude oil production was 256,000 barrels of oil per day in the quarter, while natural gas production averaged 618 million cubic feet per day.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, Husky progressed well in a number of key areas. Work continued in the second quarter on the development, planning, area infrastructure and site preparation for the Sunrise Oil Sands Project. Regulatory approval of technical amendments have been submitted and Phase I of the Sunrise project for 60,000 barrels per day of bitumen is expected to begin production in 2012.</p>
          <p>At the McMullen property located in the west central region of the Athabasca oil sands, Husky progressed planning for its development. Initial plans are to increase production for a multi-well drilling program in 2008 on the portion of lands that can be developed using cold production techniques.</p>
          <p>Husky also plans to implement a pilot project that would test optimal thermal recovery techniques on the McMullen lands. Offshore of the East Coast of China -- offshore of the East Coast of Canada the White Rose satellite tie-back project remains on schedule for a late 2009 or early 2010 start-up. Work continued on the west White Rose satellite projects, with start-up anticipated in early 2011.</p>
          <p>In terms of exploration, a 3D seismic program, covering 2,500 square kilometers on the White Rose satellite fields, the Terra Nova oil field, and on a portion of five exploration licenses in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin, commenced in May. Husky will anticipate an exploration well, on exploration license 1049 in the Flemish Pass Basin. Statoil-Hydro is the operator and drilling is expected to commence in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Offshore China, Husky increased its holdings by signing a petroleum contract for a new exploration block, Block 63/05. This block covers approximately 1,770 square kilometers and is located approximately 100 kilometers south of Hainan Island.</p>
          <p>The West Hercules deep water drilling rig currently is undergoing commissioning in South Korea and is expected to arrive at the Liwan field in the third quarter of 2008. Husky plans to drill delineation wells on the discovery area before drilling two exploration wells on the Block 29/26 and another two exploration blocks on the Yingge Hai blocks in the period 2009 to 2010.</p>
          <p>In April 2008 Husky completed an agreement with CNOCC -- C-N-O-O-C -- to jointly develop the Madura BD field and natural gas liquids field located offshore Indonesia. In the second quarter, the Madura BD field development plan was approved by the Indonesian government, and the Production Sharing Contract extension has been submitted for approval. Husky will continue to focus on exploration and drilling activities offshore Indonesia.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Don Ingram to give you an update on the Midstream and Downstream divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Our Downstream and Midstream divisions again had a solid performance in the second quarter. We're pleased with the contribution from our US Downstream segment. Second quarter earnings were 159 million from our 100% interest in Lima and our 50% interest in the Toledo refineries, both in Ohio.</p>
          <p>Improving crack spreads in the second quarter, primarily driven by strength in the distillate prices, and refinery solid operating performance were the reasons for our results.</p>
          <p>At the Lima refinery, Husky completed the conceptual stage evaluation of the optimal reconfiguration to increase capacity to enable us to process heavier feedstocks. Husky is also working with BP to evaluate the reconfiguration of the Toledo refinery to process bitumen.</p>
          <p>Our Canadian Refined Products division contributed 35 million of net earnings in the second quarter, down from the same period in 2007. Additional throughput from our Prince George refinery and ethanol plants were offset by lower gasoline and diesel sales volumes, due to shortages from our other suppliers and on weakening margins in the ethanol and asphalt business.</p>
          <p>Upgrader earnings for the second quarter were 67 million, more than 130% higher than last year, due to higher volumes and higher unit margins. The volumes in 2007, as you will recall, were reduced by a scheduled 49-day turnaround and the unit margins improved partly due to the addition of low-sulphur off-road diesel to the upgrader product mix.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure and marketing earnings for the second quarter of 2008 were 86 million, 79% higher than 2007, due to higher pipeline throughput and tariffs and higher brokering margins on crude oil and sulphur.</p>
          <p>I'll now pass the call back to John for his concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Don. The second quarter of 2008 demonstrates Husky's strategy and success in the strong commodity price environment.</p>
          <p>Husky is currently looking into an execution phase on the satellite development of the White Rose on the East Coast and progression in the Southeast Asia with drilling at the Liwan and with commencement of front-end engineering on the site of Madura.</p>
          <p>We are also expanding on enhanced recovery in the Western Canada and are making good progress on our Oil Sands Project in Sunrise.</p>
          <p>As previously reported, we expect the year 2008 will be another record year for Husky.</p>
          <p>Back to you, Patrick.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. That concludes the formal part of call.</p>
          <p>We would be pleased to answer any questions that you might have, and I'll now turn it back to the conference operator?</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today comes from Andrew Fairbanks of Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I was wondering if you could provide a little more color around what you've determined in the initial studies of the reconfiguration of Lima, and possibly Toledo if you're far enough along to speak about that. Just curious what types of processing that you're considering there, just an overall scale of the capital costs you might be contemplating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start. It's Don, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Don.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of things. We're reconfiguring Lima to handle most of our heavy oil coming out of our heavy oil operations, in addition to our current upgrader. What we have done here is we've looked at that as our main, our first choice in terms of what we can do at Lima.</p>
          <p>Toledo's primarily going to be a bitumen conversion to handle our Sunrise operations as we announced in the last quarter. So, the difference is quite material in terms of the quality of crude that's going to be handled. More technically, Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Rob Peabody. I guess I'd just say that the way we're focused on this is to reuse most of the equipment on site. So, we've configured this in the conceptual work so that we're making maximum use of the kit on site.</p>
          <p>So, the major modifications are really likely to be around additional coker capacity, as you would expect, and we'd be expanding the coking unit at the plant. And we'd also be looking at a probably -- well, essentially a new hydrocracker, probably a two-reactor hydrocracker.</p>
          <p>And then, most of it is about metallurgical upgrades around the plant as well. So -- and then the target is to process a heavy crude, very much a cold-like sort of blend crude. And I think the current cost estimate, it's way too early in a way, but it's not inconsistent with the guidance we've been giving all along about what we think we're going to have to spend at that plant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's similar to what's happened at BP. We've had no surprises up until now in our preliminary -- in our preliminary work that we've done in that. But there's still a long way to go, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the one thing I would add is, clearly you'll understand there's a lot of cost inflation out there in the project market, but what we've found as we've gotten into this in more detail is that we were actually able to make use of the existing crude unit, when our original assumptions were we might have to replace it. So we think there's a big savings against our original assessment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. That's excellent. And any thoughts on sort of a rough timeframe that you'd be able to execute this in? Would this be kind of a 2012 project or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This is John here, Andrew. And for Lima we are looking at a period of about four year conversion. And for Toledo, it -- we will be working together with our Sunrise Project expansion. At the current planning stage we are looking at around five years in a row for the Toledo refinery to be able to handle heavy crude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's excellent. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Robert Plexman of CIBC World Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good John, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if you've given any thought to raising -- well, I'm sure you have -- raising the CapEx program? Because you're spending $3.7 billion -- thinking that you might want to drill some of those gas fulls that you didn't bother to drill when prices were lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did -- we looked at CapEx. We are more or less quite conservative. We are still looking at around 4 billion -- 4 billion in total CapEx for the year 2008. But during this year, we did acquire a little bit of other assets in which divestiture of some. So on the next <mark type="inaudible" /> basis, including the carryover, we are still thinking about below $4 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I ask you other question which, you have a lot going on in the East Coast. I'm just wondering about the gas, the potential to develop your gas resources offshore of the West Coast or offshore of the East Coast, I mean to say, with higher prices. Is that project evolving? Is it continuing to evolve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and as I told you before, that will be decade-away project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So before we really have to put forth to the government, we expect that the government would give us a framework about the gas royalty, the tax regime and also the equity ownership. So at the moment we are quite patient. We have already a dialogue and talking with the various government body. And we even talk with -- work with the University Memorial regarding the network how and what to handle the gas development in the East Coast.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, in terms of the '08 upstream guidance, you have provided a figure of 385 to 410 and then you mentioned that would be brought down by 5 to 7%. Do you have firmer numbers on that?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, absolutely. Well, I mean so, is the question about sort of how is it coming down or...? I mean, it is -- it's between 5 and 7% down on our previous guidance. What were you looking for beyond that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
