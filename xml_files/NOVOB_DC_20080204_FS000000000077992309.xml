          <p>Very pleased to welcome you all here today. I am particularly pleased to welcome Management of Novo Nordisk. You all know Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen and team. I'll just turn it straight over to Lars now.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much ladies and gentlemen, and welcome and thanks for taking time out of your schedule and your day to see us. We're going to go through the presentation in, I hope, rather quick session so that we can get through the Q&amp;A. So we will skip some of the slides. Please &#x2013; we can always refer to them should you have any particular interest.</p>
          <p>First of all, the usual forward-looking statements, just to give me a little bit of actions if things does not turn out the way that I have predicted. Highlights, strategies, sales update, R&amp;D, financials and then Q&amp;A. Obviously, if we look at the overall performance of the company, we had strong top-line growth, improved margins from operations, tailwind from the taxes and then we had a few things which went against us and few things which went for us. We lost about 1 billion Danish kroner in currencies, but made up for that. On our hedging contracts, we monitorized on assets by selling the activities or our interest in Dako, and we had a once-off expenditure in connection with closing of our pulmonary insulin project.</p>
          <p>You see, the growth in sales is driven by modern insulins, 35% in local currencies. NovoSeven, relatively strong growth, a little bit stronger than we had anticipated with 10% in local currencies. And the continued strong growth of our growth hormone franchise with 11% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Strong performance of our R&amp;D organization in 2007. We've had a promising launch starting here in December 2007 in Japan, and we have completed and reported all the regulatory studies for liraglutide and are currently working on the filings, which will take place in Q2 in Europe and United States, and Q3 in Japan.</p>
          <p>We also had worked diligently on replacing power in terms of being able to replace the modern insulins that we are currently seeing some nice development on. In the next decade, with two new insulin analogs that are in Phase II clinical studies and we have a very interesting portfolio of clotting factors, which gives us aspirations to expand the operations in the hemophilia area.</p>
          <p>Financials, as I mentioned strong top-line growth. Margin improvement from operations and of course the impact from AERx closure, meaning that operating profit was actually minus 2%, but adjusting for that, underlying close to 25%.</p>
          <p>I should skip this one, if anybody is interested in sustainability issues, we can have a word afterwards. So, let's deal with our strategies. We have clarified our position in the diabetes area by exiting oral antidiabetics in the beginning of 2007, entirely focusing on proteins, insulin GLP-1 with the possibilities of expanding GLP-1 into the obesity space and the pre-diabetes space, but also working in research with other proteins for that application.</p>
          <p>Hemophilia is currently the largest use of NovoSeven and we have a portfolio of interesting research projects, which may expand our business from currently only including the inhibitor patients. We are also continuing to work even though it's difficult in the critical bleeding area, growth disorders and chronic dialysis patients.</p>
          <p>We still have hormone replacement therapy products, the business we've been in for 30 years and our business is doing quite well. We had seemed to have been bottoming out and we are now seeing growth coming from our HRT business. We are launching lower-dose estrogen products and we have the world's leading topical product, the Vagifem. And we've made a decision to now focus into biopharmaceutical area where we have been looking to expand our business to that of inflammation, and hence we have decided to stop our future activities in oncology.</p>
          <p>The underlying growth case, 5% volume growth, 5% value growth in the insulin business on an average per year, so many years we are doing better, and that means that we are gaining market share. The great picture is 250 million people are diabetes, 450 million people with pre-diabetes, of course, unfortunately a major public health problem, but also a great opportunity for our company in many years to come.</p>
          <p>Just as an example, the U.S. has now estimated that they have 17.5 million individuals diagnosed with diabetes and another 6.5 million undiagnosed and the total treatment cost in diabetes related healthcare costs of U.S. $174 billion. 1 in 5 dollars is spent on something related to diabetes. And it's only going to get worse before it gets better, unfortunately.</p>
          <p>An interesting opportunity for the company, the OAD market, about a little bit more than $10 billion with zero growth at the moment, which is one of the reasons why we decided not to pursue the long-standing interest we've had in this area. Insulin market also about U.S. $10 billion, but with nice growth, of around 8%, and GLP-1 a new area for us, with the filing of liraglutide and the seismic proportion of GLP-1 will be dependent on of course how our product is being used by the regulators and the extent to which we can expand its application also in the weight management area as well as the treatment of pre-diabetes.</p>
          <p>Mads Krogsgaard will come back to that in much greater detail. So, with that K&#xE5;re Schultz.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. I will go through the sales situation, the market shares and some of the key development trends. Let me start with the key focus of the company, the insulin business, and you can see here that we are actually volume leaders in all the four regions that we group the world in, North America, Europe, Japan, Oceania and International Operations, as we call all the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>You can also see that there is a clear upside potential still in North America. We have historically come from a very low base in North America, having only about 20% market share 10 years ago, and we are growing that as we speak, and that's also where you can sort of see the long-term upside whereas in the other markets we've had a very strong position for many years and we are really having a pretty stable situation in the other three main markets.</p>
          <p>Where is the growth coming from, it's kind of simplistic in a way because three-quarters of the growth is coming from insulin, and all that growth is coming from the modern insulin.</p>
          <p>So, it's the three brands there, Levemir, NovoMix and NovoRapid, that's carrying the basically three-quarters growth of our channel. And that is also the trend that we expect to see this year.</p>
          <p>How is this happening? Well, it's happening in a market place that is quite conservative in the sense that you have low dynamics, but you have very, very high sustainability of the dynamics you see in the market place. That basically means that whenever you launch a product into the insulin market, you will, hopefully, be able to establish a nice trend where you take share on a consistent basis, and if you can do that, then you will often see that your penetration will keep on growing for five, 10, 15 years. So it's, it's a long-term gain, this one.</p>
          <p>That's also why you can see products having a sort of plus 20% growth rate even 7 to 8 years after launch. Basically because this is a market where you roughly turnover maybe 6, 7% of the patients per year, and that means that even when you get a high capture rate, you will not see sort of one, two, three years and then you're taking your share, it will be a long-haul game. That's also what we can see here.</p>
          <p>And as you all know, we started in all the three segments, the fast-acting, premix and long-acting segments as number two with the modern insulins, and we are fighting our way in there. We've been fighting longer on the fast-acting, and we've actually just surpassed our biggest competitor, Humalog, which we are very happy about. We also surpassed Humalog Mix with our NovoMix, and of course we are now working very hard to make sure that in the future we will surpass <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>What about the total market? It's converting from human insulin to modern insulin. Any major news there? No, it's converting basically around 6% a year, kind of the same dynamics as you can see on market shares and right now we have 52% of the market has been converted to the modern insulins. That's in volume, so in value of course, the number is substantially higher, and you should expect that this will continue at a steady pace in the coming years, and that means basically in some five years, you will have by far the majority of the market converted into modern insulin.</p>
          <p>This, by the way, is now a world market picture, where we include all the retail markets, in what, we call International Operations and the emerging markets, where IMS is now providing data. So where this used to be only industrialized markets we are now trying to give you a picture here of the whole world.</p>
          <p>You can also see the market share dynamics. Obviously, Lilly did a great job of coming first to market with the modern insulins with Humalog and they have done a less impressive job in maintaining that market share. So they have been declining for a long time. It is sloping off a little, so they are still declining month-on-month, but the delta is becoming slightly less.</p>
          <p>And in our case, we've been growing in the modern insulin space for now many, many years but we did start as number two in all the segments. Of course, we are trying to make our way into the market, and we are still growing nicely, but you can also see the delta per month is coming down a little bit. We are still fighting to get share of the modern insulin equal to what we have of the total insulin market, where we right now have 52% of world total insulin volume.</p>
          <p>Talking about NovoSeven; not really any major dramatic news here. NovoSeven grew 10% last year. You can see it's still very much up and down on a quarter-by-quarter basis, so you should analyze it on a moving annual total, I would recommend when you look at it. And we are not seeing any dramatic events in terms of new clinical data coming from the market. We have a stable competitive situation with us having by far, the majority of the inhibitor patients and then Pfizer having a minor market share.</p>
          <p>This year, I am not expecting any dramatic news either and that means that as we move along being the leaders in the haemophilia inhibitor segment, we do see a slightly less percentage-wise growth rate because we are sort of not saturating on a worldwide basis, but in U.S., Europe, Japan, we are pretty close to market situation. But then of course there is market growth in emerging markets where the treatment of haemophilia is being upgraded on an ongoing basis. So we expect that NovoSeven will be growing single-digit during this year.</p>
          <p>Norditropin, interesting case, growth hormone is available from a high number of manufacturers and pharma companies worldwide, somewhere between 3 and 7 to 8 manufacturers in the individual market. We have, based on our protein know-how and scope, been able to produce what is the most convenient, the nicest way of getting a growth hormone in the pre-filled NordiFlex. We are having a high-price strategy, and so far it seems to pay off. We were able to grow the business more than 10% last year. We also have positive expectations for this year despite the very strong competitive situation.</p>
          <p>It is really a case of, you could say, in reality biosimilar competition because growth hormone is growth hormone, there is no difference between the many suppliers, but the delivery mechanism, the device, the science around it, all those things that take both patients using the product and doctors prescribing it. And that is the reason for our continued success despite the strong competitive situation.</p>
          <p>If we look at the regions, then it's a very, very diverse picture. We are of course totally globalized, so we basically cover, I think every market except maybe North Korea where we're working on it. And we have a situation where it's very much the demographics and the dynamics of the economies that also affect the progression of diabetes and thereby our business. So, in Japan, we have a very mature market, very high-price, high-margin, good treatment, but of course, stagnating in a way that the market growth is limited. We have 75% market share and we are hanging nicely on to that. We have the launch of Levemir in Japan this year, which will do very well, I am sure. But the total demographics of Japan is so that you will not see really strong growth on a long-term basis and we didn't see that last year either.</p>
          <p>Then, we have Europe, which is somewhere in between you could say U.S. and Japan in a way. We have relatively low demographic developments in Europe also, reasonably good healthcare systems taking care of diabetes, but still a big upgrade that can be done in the eastern parts of Europe. Big price pressures from under-funded public healthcare sectors, and therefore a situation where you're seeing single-digit growth and that's also what you should expect in the coming years from our side.</p>
          <p>We have a stable market share in the 50s on insulin, and we had a good penetration of both growth hormonal segments in Europe. Then, we have a big opportunity for us in the U.S., and that's basically because all our products have been launched from a very low base. So we have a very low market share in growth hormone that's growing nicely. We had a very low market share in insulin. It's also growing nicely, and still very strong upside there. You could say before we gave I would call the fair market share that the quality of our products makes it reasonable to assume and to go for. So, the U.S. very, very strong dynamics there; strong, strong growth last year and also expectations for this year being very positive.</p>
          <p>Then we have the emerging markets or International Operations. Here, it's really demographics. Here, we have a high market share. We've had that for a long time, and we can see that the demographics really are such that there is, and I'll get back to some of the details, but 5.5 billion people in this part of the world, in our system; in the industrialized part there is less than 1 billion. So, and they buy products from Novo Nordisk in this part of the world equivalent to roughly 15 cents of a euro per day. In the industrialized world, a person buys on average 40 times more. So, our sales in the emerging markets is 1/40th of the per capita of what they are in the industrialized part of the world. Then of course that means it's all linked to economic development in this part of the world.</p>
          <p>Now, just taking a snapshot at what is really driving the delta, I said we had stable market shares in Europe, but what is driving it up right now is of course the penetration of Levemir into the basal segment. Lantus was launched before Levemir as a long-acting insulin analogue and we are now fighting back with Levemir, and you can see we've come sort of a quarter of the way roughly, around 25% market share. Now, I don't mean we go to 100% market share, but of course we are trying to go above 50; that's our ambition and you can see we keep on growing it on a steady basis. But again it takes time. You got to be patient in this business; you don't go out and launch, and then after 12 months you are done; you have to be committed on the long horizon, and that's what we are.</p>
          <p>If you look at the U.S., pretty much the same story. Here you can see the dynamics since the launch of Levemir. And of the modern insulin base or the insulin segment, we are now having around 10% and a nice and steady progression month over month, and we are very pleased about it, and of course financially, it's very attractive because we used to have nearly nothing of that <mark type="inaudible" /> base of segment in the U.S., so it's all gain basically.</p>
          <p>In the emerging markets, I talked before, you can see here that we've had basically the same market share, around little shy of 60% for many years, and that it's really the volume growth that is driving the business. And that is linked to the fact that we now have market economy basically everywhere despite whatever political system you see in most of these countries. There is now market economy and there is a tendency to have economic growth in basically all parts of the world whether it's Latin America, Southeast Asia, India, China and so on, we see strong economic development and that links into better healthcare and that links into better sales of insulin.</p>
          <p>And the prime example is China. In China, we were naughty or clever enough to have our industrial colleagues moving in early 90s with manufacturing. We got our own license to have a wholly-owned Novo Nordisk company, selling pharmaceuticals in China very early on.  And you can see here we've had a phenomenal growth path, of course, we came from nothing basically. So for many years, the absolute number was not so big, 43% annual growth rate, but on a very small base, of course, it's not that dramatic. But now we are actually at a situation where China is getting close to 5% of turnover, and of course, if we keep scoring at the rate it's being doing so far, then it suddenly starts to be a meaningful number that you can also see in our total sales development.</p>
          <p>The last final thing about the situation in China and that is that you often hear, you are not afraid of generic competition in U.S. and Europe and so on, and then we're saying, well, we take it very seriously, but we are also very used to it because we are actually competing with each companies on a daily basis in both India and China. And so far, we are doing okay. We have, as you can see here, in volume 60% of the Chinese insulin market competing against very low-cost local manufacturers. We have the same situation in India, and also having something around 60% market share. So, we're pretty confident, we know how to compete about &#x2013; with these people, and it's also interesting that the Chinese healthcare system and the Chinese government, they have elected to work with us on fighting the diabetes pandemic in China because they've realized how serious it is, for how many millions of people will have diabetes. And I think they realize that we have the intellectual capacity to help them with this task, educate tens of thousands of nurses and doctors every year.</p>
          <p>In last year, we educated more than 20,000 nurses and doctors together with the Chinese authorities in China on diabetes. And this, the small local manufacturers could never have done.</p>
          <p>So, we have a very good relationship with the Chinese authorities, and we are very optimistic about the outlook. You could say unfortunate on the background of an explosion in terms of how many people have diabetes in China, but it is on the other hand linked to the fantastic economic growth. So it's not all bad for the population you can say, but how to treat them in the future, Mads, let's hear more about that.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, K&#xE5;re. Thank you, K&#xE5;re, yes, what I'd like to do is first give a few more general statements about the strategy of Novo Nordisk in R&amp;D based on the technologies that we believe we master to a large extent. Most of you will consider us a company that for ages and ages has been life cycle managing a few proteins including insulin, growth hormone and factor VII, soon to come, we hope also the GLP-1 class of proteins.</p>
          <p>I think it's more recent to you that Novo Nordisk is now also entertaining moving into opportunities that can expand the business and this is done by the mixed skill pack of protein science and protein engineering and acylation, PEGylation technology that we have in the R&amp;D labs. And when I say so, what I mean is, for instance, entertaining or moving into new paradigms such as prophylactic treatment of hemophilia rather than on-demand treatment, creating value for the customer but basically also entering into new segment from Novo Nordisk, done by long-acting PEGylated versions of the factor VII and the likes of it. But, also moving into new groups of administration using dedicated or tailored analogues of molecules such as long-acting GLP-1 and the basal insulin to allow for inhaled delivery and this kind of approach. Of course, also using protein science to engineer new classes of drugs in here, specifically we talk about GLP-1 or there could be others to come.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I would also like to mention that old molecules quote unquote such as growth hormone and sales well through asset exploration moving into new therapeutic areas. And there Novo Nordisk has, for the last 30, 40 years, been mostly working in the growth disorder segment, but utilizing the anabolic and anti-catabolic effect of growth hormone we are now also seeking to move into a more high-volume area namely dialysis patients that are suffering from kidney failure.</p>
          <p>Now, Lars mentioned the notion that on the next slide, replacement power is important. It's particularly important to a company like ours which really has the ability to life cycle manage our products. And if we look at the most important product such as Levemir, NovoMix, NovoSeven, we are in the fortunate situation that we have Phase II molecules that we believe based on Phase I results of a great promise for being able to supersede the existing compounds, and likewise, in fact the earlier stage of development namely Phase I, we will exit with a long-acting growth hormone.</p>
          <p>Similarly, in the GLP-1 portfolio where liraglutide is going to be filed for the approval with EMEA and FDA in the next quarter, we are already in Phase I with further engineered analogue for once-weekly administration. So, we believe that the replacement power of our company is stronger than it has been for quite sometime.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look more specifically at the diabetes pipeline, I'd just like to highlight the notion that the two analogues mentioned by Lars, the NN1250 and 5401 are respectively rather than discussed within the fifth, sixth or seventh-generation compounds, or may we call them the last-generation injectables within the field, we believe that they can really make the ultimate within injectable therapies, maybe basal insulin in the case of 1250 and a fixed-dose combination of two analogues in the compound particularly in NN5401. Both of these have very recently entered Phase II trials based on very extensive Phase I investigations in both people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>Now, this molecule up here is liraglutide. I do believe that we have shown this beautiful creature several times before. I would like to do it again, because what we can do now is really highlight the aggregated data from the LEAD program, we have in totality now exposed around 6000 people throughout the last many years of clinical development of liraglutide, 6000 people on either lira or its competitive drugs and the totality of those studies have showed us that we have in our hands a product ready for submission based on data where we have HbA1c decrements of up to 2 percentage points, typically 1.5 when you add it on to other drugs and 1.0 if you actually replace another drug, so you both have to overcome the effect of the other drug and exclude the benefit with liraglutide.</p>
          <p>We have seen the benefits in the form of weight loss, consistently throughout the program as well as a very low background level of hypoglycemia, if we avoid giving lira together with sulfonylurea, which uncouples the glucose dependency, and the therapeutic profile has been good.</p>
          <p>In Japan, we actually finalized somewhat ahead of schedule the two Phase III trials monotherapy and also an add-on to sulfonylurea, which is a kind of standard treatment modality in Japanese individuals. They were both of half a years' duration and HbA1c started out all the way up to close to 9% in the monotherapy and 8.5% in the add-on to SU [sulfonylurea] trial.</p>
          <p>Regardless of that we were able to bring half of the patients all the way from close to 9 down to 7 or below in the monotherapy study and 70% in the add-on to SU study, which is from an efficacy point of view really confirms the risk on profile that we had in the Phase II trial that we announced last year.</p>
          <p>Also in the monotherapy trial, we actually saw a weight reduction of around 2 kilos compared to the SU comparison, but these Japanese people are not really that obese. They only have an average weight of around 65 kilograms at the onset of the studies and this of course has to be taken into account. NovoSeven was reported at single-digit level.</p>
          <p>If you look at the haemostasis portfolio, the news that we are communicating is a) that in the trauma study, there is a pre-planned interim analysis assessing futility or not of the statistical analysis plan and its assumptions which is targeted to take place pending patient recruitment around the middle of this year, also that we have announced the headline results from the cardiac surgery basically showing that we have, biologically speaking, a haemostatic effect measured as reduction in blood loss in the chest of these patients that have been opened, undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, and also, we should mention that we have now entered a subcutaneous administration or formulation of Factor VII into Phase I aiming at prophylactic therapy to make a more convenience-driven possibility for the patients.</p>
          <p>We mentioned that rather than focus in a dualistic way on immunotherapy of both cancer and inflammation, we will now focus further down and dedicate more resources to the inflammation area while closing the oncology area. We do believe that inflammation and autoimmune diseases, they lend themselves well to the Novo Nordisk approach of a long, whole dedicated approach, lifecycle management, chronic disease, specialist treatment, injectable therapies, benefits to patients and the likes of it.</p>
          <p>On this slide, which is my last, you will see that here we have the non-haemostasis related biopharmaceuticals projects and the news here is that the Vagifem low dose, Vagifem is doing very well in the U.S., and in this regard, we are happy to announce that we have a low dose version that has been filed for approval in the U.S. while still undergoing Phase III development in the European setting.</p>
          <p>Also, I should mention as earlier that a long-acting once-weekly analog, based on PEGylation at a site specific in the molecule has entered Phase I. And the blue projects are the oncology projects, which we, together with our partners ZymoGenetics and Innate Pharma down in Marseille, France, will seek to partner out during the remainder of this year.</p>
          <p>And with that, Jesper, it's over to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Moving to the financials, I am not going to go through all the numbers on this slide, just highlighting a few key developments. Sales growing 8% reported for the 5% negative currency impact. A 5% negative currency impact for the top-line gives us 11% negative impact on operating profit.</p>
          <p>In terms of gross margin, you've seen a significant expansion, 10% going ahead of reported sales and 130 basis points improvement that was underlying just over 200 basis points improvement and I will just cover that in a short while how that is developing.</p>
          <p>Sales and distribution costs dropping below 30% even though we'd expanded our sales force in the U.S. with 700 reps. The R&amp;D cost significantly impacted by the discontinuation of AERx having a negative impact of more than 3 percentage point of sales on the R&amp;D to sales ratio.</p>
          <p>Admin expenses continuing to slightly decline going now through 6% of sales. Net financial significantly impacted by the 1.5 billion divestment of the Dako activities but also impacted by significant hedging gains to the tune of 900 million in 2007. The tax rate are unusual in 2007, both because of the tax-exempt status of the income from Dako, but also an effect from the lowering of the Danish tax rate taking the corporate tax rate in Denmark from 28% down to 25%, and that left us with a net profit growing to the tune of 32%.</p>
          <p>Maybe just commenting on the operating profit growth, reported minus 2% for the 13% impact from the AERx in continuation, and then if you add back the currencies, if you are looking at what would have been if we had stable currencies in 2007, you would have been looking at something like a 24% growth in operating profit.</p>
          <p>The gross margin reported 130 basis points, 80 basis point negative currency impact, 210 in local currencies, more than half of that coming from our continued improvement in production efficiency. Both from our bulk production primarily of insulins and secondly, also coming from our filling activities within insulin basically more and more efficiently being able to fill our insulins in our six sites around the world. Note that we don't &#x2013; in 2007, we have not increased the number of employees within Product Supply in Novo Nordisk. So our production of roughly 10% higher volume is more or less done on a constant number of employees within our production.</p>
          <p>We also have benefited in 2007 from a positive pricing impact coming to a large degree from the introduction of the Medicare Part D reform in the U.S., but also from positive price increases in the U.S. market, which more than offset the impact we had of prices in Europe and Japan.</p>
          <p>And then the final element was that we didn't do any significant impairment or obsolescence charges in 2007. We did that in 2006, and that can probably account for some 50 basis points in the development in gross margin.</p>
          <p>In terms of currency development, here you see the quarterly hedging gains and then also the spot rate of the U.S. dollar and we've also illustrated what the currency sensitivity is for Novo Nordisk in 2008 of a 5% movement in the key currencies. And we have lifted the level of hedging we have when we went into the year, we had some 17 months of forward hedging and that has actually enabled us to postpone more than 600 million in gains, which are for income recognition as we have realized the cash flows in primarily 2008 and a small degree in 2009.</p>
          <p>In terms of our outlook, we continue to believe that we can deliver more than 10% in local currencies. Our guidance is slightly above 10% in local currencies. We will be facing currently with a 3.5 percentage point negative currency impact as it looks of the 29th of January when you see the rates we have been using for that forecast on this slide.</p>
          <p>The operating profit growth is referring to a growth of at least 20% and that growth is really &#x2013; the logic behind that growth is a wish from us to deliver an underlying growth of at least 15% and then we have an additional 5% of growth coming from the disappearance of AERx and hence a 1 percentage point lower R&amp;D-to-sales ratio than we would have had otherwise. Our guidance currently for the R&amp;D-to-sales ratio for 2008 is now 17% whereas we previously were guiding towards the level of 18% and hence a saving of around 500 million.</p>
          <p>In reported terms, because of the lack of this significant discontinuation charge, we are expecting reported growth of at least 25% in 2008 over the reported number for 2007. The effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 24%, of course this year not benefiting from significant one-offs, but on the other hand benefiting from the structural change we have in our overall tax structure with a significant proportion of our biopharmaceutical franchise being taxed from the Swiss base that we have for those activities.</p>
          <p>Financial income in 2008 is expected to be around 450 million primarily reflecting income from the hedging as I've referred to before, probably being offset by losses pertaining to our share in ZymoGenetics. Capital expenditure also in 2008 expected to be at the 2.5 billion level and that will give us a investment-to-sales ratio of around 6%.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow expected in the ballpark of 7.5 billion Danish kroner, and that significant cash generation ability enabled us to transfer significant amounts to our shareholders. We have set the payout ratio at around 35% transferring 4.5 kroner per share or approximately 2.8 billion for 2007 back following the AGM in March. And then on top of that, we anticipate that we will transfer some 4.2 billion in share repurchases transferring the last 200 million of the Dako transaction in the repurchase program and 4 billion return from our ongoing operations. And then we've actually extended the program to 2009, adding another 4.5 billion which are going to be transferred back to our shareholders through the repurchase program. And through that, you'll basically have a gradual increase in the level of recurred earnings which are transferred back through repurchase program going from 3 billion in recurring earnings in 2006, 3.5 in '07, 4 in '08, and 4.5 in 2009.</p>
          <p>And then just rounding off, this was a short presentation of Novo Nordisk. We've covered our leadership position in the key markets we have. The only one where we are not yet number one is the global growth market where we hold the number two position. The drivers are of course our modern insulins within diabetes care. We have a promising GLP-1 compound. We believe our growth hormone product will also take us to also more prominent position in that market and then we're expanding the presence not only in North America, but also in International Operations where K&#xE5;re alluded to the significant potential that China holds for us.</p>
          <p>So with those comments, Lars, over to you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much to my colleagues. And as we had hoped that we had answered all your questions by the presentation, I'm sure that's not the case. So we would make ourselves available for some questions.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mads, if I could start with a question for you please. If you fast forward five to seven years, how would you like to see liraglutide being used? What I am trying to understand is how you fit together the thought process about the way the product's used today, potentially used in pre-diabetes, the weight loss, what sort of label should we thinking about, how should we really think about the concept of this product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well first of all even though we are seeking a label that will take us all the way from diet failure patients, who are targeting their first therapy, all the way down through secondary failure into patients who normally would have been entering insulin therapy. It's beyond doubt that the primary positioning of liraglutide and the way that we are comfortable that people will really like using this product is probably not as a frontline therapy in most cases, because metformin is a darn good and cheap offering, but from thereon and onwards.</p>
          <p>Now you can then say obviously we are targeting here the obesity program that will be kicked off late this year, a whole new segment, which is kind of attacking it from the other side, mainly from the pre-disease side or pre-diabetic state in terms of medical obesity, BMI above 30. And here, rather than fall into the trap that others have done who went before us, of really witnessing kind of not the correct usage of their obesity therapy, we will see not only weight management, but risk reduction in the approach to weight management, and coming from the diabetes care side of things, the most obvious for us is of course, to look into the comorbidity, which is pre-diabetes and diabetes. So really trying to first apply for approval based on one year data, but seek to get data after a three-year study period in those people who already have to progressed to pre-diabetes to show that we can reduce the fraction of those who go on to diabetes.</p>
          <p>So that means that if you go five to seven years from now, which I think your question was, then in principle, if things work out the way we hope they will and which we cannot prove until we have the data, you can see we are attacking both from the declining side of the slope and from the pre-diabetic state. And this we will do as of next year whereas the other part will be contingent upon the Phase III study program in obesity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of labeling, would you look for a label specifying weight loss period or perhaps it'd be linked long-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, here of course after one year of data, you should not be so optimistic as to think that you will get a lot of statements about pre-diabetes and so on, but I had to remind ourselves that in the 20-week study we've done already, we <mark type="inaudible" /> that among those close to 30% of the population that already had pre-diabetes, we saw an 80 to 90% of those returning back to normality within 20 weeks.</p>
          <p>So yes, we will seek an obesity label after one-year study, this is as per FDA guidance, but we will do so, hopefully under the realm of very good data that already after one year will put things into the package insert that talk about in this population there was also seen fewer pre-diabetics, fewer overt diabetics. But the label that could state that more vigorously will probably be contingent upon the full three-year studies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, question over there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Natexis. Thank you for taking my question. The first one is a non-scientist question to Mads. I read somewhere that in fact GLP-1 seems to have the ability of restoring beta cell function, and if this is proven, to which extent do you think that it will affect the global diabetes market dynamics so to speak, the interaction between insulin and the GLP-1? Do you see the GLP-1 as the next insulin, for example? And so in point, much more industrial, looking at CapEx, where are we at the moment for liraglutide in terms of production capability? Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mads, first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, first of all, all the studies or the discussions about really either creating new beta cells or inhibiting the apoptosis or programmed cell death of the existing ones have all been based on animal studies. That being said, we do see all clinical studies both using HOMA analysis and also measuring the stress level of the beta cells by measuring pro-insulin to insulin ratio that in each and every case the beta cells do become less stressed the ones that already exists in these human beings. So I have no doubt that the data that where in the LEAD 3 study we followed liraglutide for a full year and saw that HbA1c was taken down and kept down in contrast to glimepiride, which tended to peak its effect after three to six months where after the effect waned because of the wearing out of the beta cells. There is no doubt that the GLP-1 class of drugs such as liraglutide at least mitigates this wearing out of the beta cells.</p>
          <p>Whether we actually have a situation where we modify the long-term disease outcome remains to be seen, but these are things that will be in the works, and we can study them more closely. The more longer-term studies that we do; you typically need 3 to 5 year studies in many patients to address whether you are breaking the curve, the declining beta cell slope curve. That being said, if that were to take place, you could argue that GLP-1 such as lira should of course then be the preferred primary offering because basically you should intervene at a point where you still have many beta cells to save quote, unquote.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mads. K&#xE5;re, would you like to shed some light on our capabilities for launching liraglutide and implications for CapEx when this product will be globally rolled out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, liraglutide is basically manufactured in the same kind of production system as insulin, it's the same kind of yeast fermentation <mark type="inaudible" /> purification, filling and so on. And the devices will be of a similar nature as insulin devices. So that basically means that in terms of CapEx, we have already undertaken what had to be undertaken to be ready for the liraglutide launch, and we have already manufactured substantial amounts of bulk substance for liraglutide. So you will not see any significant effect in the coming years on CapEx from this, and this also why the guidance we are out with is saying that this year we expect around 6% of sales for CapEx, and we are saying for the next three years that it will be around the 7% level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have seen a significant decline of the CapEx over the years, and in particular also the closure of the pulmonary insulin project does take future CapEx expenditures out of our program, so that has some bearing on liquidity generation, et cetera. So I hope that answers the question. In the middle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a bunch of liraglutide questions, one on R&amp;D strategy. Coming back to the weight loss, just asking a simple timeline question because I understand you want to first show the data to the opinion leaders and gather their input, is this a program which can still kick off this year, the Phase III program or is that something which comes much later?</p>
          <p>And also on, when you comment in the Phase II data you have seen the proportion of people who are pre-diabetes being reduced, do you just look at A1c levels because then the question obviously isn't that to be expected given that you lower A1c with your compound, and would that be sustainable after a washout effect?</p>
          <p>The second question is I think at some point you sort of spoke about Byetta head-to-head study. Is there any guidance when that is going to kick off and roughly how that's going to look like? Is that also going to be all comers similar like the Byetta versus &#x2013; the IR versus the LAR, and is that also going to be open-label?</p>
          <p>And then in terms of the, you made a comment on the market potential of liraglutide, you said the seismic proportion depends on the regulators. Is there any reason to assume that the regulators won't give you a broad label in metformin failure and I'm particularly looking at Europe where obviously you may have some cost issues potentially here and the question on R&amp;D strategy is, I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we try to start with the liraglutide because Mads will hold a lecture for 45 minutes to cover just that and then we can come back to the R&amp;D question perhaps in 15 to 20 minutes later on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we would seek a label including diet failures, not only metformin, I mean monotherapy and add-on to single OADs, add-on to dual OADs all the way down to let's say the ultimate failure patient. So it's a broad label we are going for based on the LEAD program. In terms of the Byetta study, that already has completed recruitment. We have recruited the head-on comparison in 500 plus patients where lira given once daily is targeting superiority over Byetta given twice daily, so that will of course be reported and ready for announcement at major conferences at the point of launch. And in terms of the obesity, that is. Sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All comers &#x2013; is it all comers, everybody? Like no specification patient population in that study?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are diet or monotherapy failures as I recall, but that I can check. We are doing many, many things in the lira segment, so I will just check. In terms of the question about obesity, it is quite true that you have two effects of lira on obesity. One is of course the weight loss which was up to seven kilos in the highest group, and you have to add to that beta cell effect, and they are difficult to disassociate out from each other. And that means of course that in the Phase II study once you terminate the study you terminate the study and you don't follow the patients thereafter because they are unblinded and leave study but when you do your long-haul study kind of the pivotal program there will be elements of follow-up as per protocol after termination of lira treatment to see is there a rebound of diabetes but that's not done in the Phase II study. It's something you typically will do in the pivotal program, so you follow it both during treatment and follow-up after treatment as per protocol. Were there &#x2013; no, I think that was it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...the three year study you were broadly referring to which will get <mark type="inaudible" /> would include a washout?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, I think that is something the regulators will ask for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Europe?  The broad label in Europe you see no reasons...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Europe and US, it will be the same. We are targeting a broad label all over the world, Japan, Europe and US. Japan is mostly I have to say for monotherapy and add-on to SU, these are the two studies but of course we will try to broaden it out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the question on R&amp;D strategy, I understood correct me if I am wrong your exit of oncology not so much of &#x2013; wasn't a question of lack of compounds or lack of knowledge or technology, but more a question of investment. Because it's a crowded field and you are a relative latecomer. How do you make sure that you are not going to have to make the same decision in inflammation, because this is also going to be an exceedingly crowded field, and yet you have technology and knowledge, but how do you make sure you are not late here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Short version, I think Lars, Jesper and I communicated from the beginning that cancer was so different from diabetes that for us to be successful we'd have to find an M&amp;A partner &#x2013; a party we could acquire simply. This we investigated more than 200 companies, didn't find one that we wanted and that wanted us. In the case of inflammation, we think that we have much more the skill base and the business model to take care of that by organic growth and in-licensing of discrete projects. So it's a slightly different situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, following on to the last comment. I'm just intrigued about what criteria or hurdles you apply to your presence in inflammation to set a continued presence there. What you have to do in development to keep you investing in inflammation as opposed to following the path you've finally taken in oncology?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure that I exactly know the answer to your question. Could you repeat?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean clearly you've been operating doing R&amp;D in inflammation and oncology for several years and you've been talking about...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, three, four years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, five years maybe?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Three, four years, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just thinking in terms of continued presence here, and we've clearly gone down the route of considering M&amp;A and ruling it out perhaps in oncology for availability or price. And I'm just wondering, is inflammation really that much easier for you to make inroads in looking forward in terms of presence there?  And in terms of judgment day for you in that business, do you have certain hurdles that you look at in terms of deciding whether you continue to investment money in inflammation or is that something we can forget about for another three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we intend to invest in inflammation for the long haul. There is no question this will be an investment period of perhaps even more than ten years before you start to see any significant impact, positive significant impact on our P&amp;L. I agree with you acquisitions in the inflammation area is going to prove to be as equally difficult as in the oncology area. That's why Mads said that he believes and we believe that the inflammation area is an area which lends it more to an organic growth for a company like Novo Nordisk. Whereas we had already predefined that in the oncology area we would need to make a significant investment in skills and in pipelines, and market presence to be able to compete in that area, and that we were not able to accomplish. Mads, do you have anything else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only just to add that most inflammatory diseases are often autoimmune origin. That means basically that by definition, therapy has to be a dampening down of the immune system, just like you ideally would want to do in Type 1 diabetes. In cancer, it's still somewhat speculative to what extent you can actually boost the immune system to eradicate tumors. So the market for immunotherapies in cancer is minute whereas the market for immunotherapies in inflammation is huge and the unmet need out there is still rather big.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A very quick follow-up, if I may. Your commitment to HRT, is that 100%, or is that still under slight review?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, our commitment has been unfailing. We have communicated to you several times that we don't believe that we will be in HRT in 10, 15 years from now. However, we are generating significant financial returns in this area. And in the past three to five year period of time where there has been difficulties in the HRT business, it has not been the right time to divest this business. In the meantime, we have managed the file for approval of lower-dose versions of our historically quite successful products. So we will retain the HRT business for the next five years, I can't guarantee you that we'll be in HRT 10 years from now.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, John, on the what precondition do we need to basically continue to invest in inflammation. Clearly, we have to be able to demonstrate that we can build up a clinical pipeline of products within the inflammation area. And we anticipate that we will bring the first crop of compounds in and we should build a broad base within inflammation over the next two, three years in order for us to have a reasonable chance of bringing a product to market. So that's more specific.</p>

          <p>Thank you. A couple of questions. Firstly, could you, Jesper or I'm not sure if K&#xE5;re, one of you, referred to the pricing environments for insulin both in U.S. and Europe, which one disturbs you the most?  And second, thinking about the timing of introduction of biosimilars for insulin, could you give us an update of where you are as that relates to pricing?  And the last question is on Lantus and the litigation you have with Sanofi over the pen, could you just give us an update on where on timing on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>K&#xE5;re, would you comment on the pricing environment in Europe and in then United States and how you see that then we will come back to the other question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the pricing environment in Europe and United States is radically different. The pricing environment in Europe is characterized by healthcare systems that are publicly funded in general, meaning that prices are set by authorities in negotiation with the pharmaceutical manufacturers. We have a situation now, where the old products have very diverse pricing for reasons of currency exchange rates back 10, 20 years ago. The new products have quite uniform pricing. <mark type="inaudible" /> operation has a very uniform pricing label all over Europe. There has been a big battle going on with the introduction of modern insulins, where we market by market have had to convince the Southern European governments that they would have to double the price they pay for insulin, because they had very low prices historically for human insulins. This has all worked out and we now have a reasonably stable situation. There is a very high level of pressure nearly every year from every government just trying to say, "Why don't we just get it 5% cheaper, 10% cheaper, 2% cheaper." For whatever crazy reason they can dream up. And that's, you could say, a tactical negotiation game market by market.</p>
          <p>We think we have it reasonably under control, but of course it's a negative environment in the sense that you don't take price increases on the individual products, you have to get your better price through your mix. So our way of getting better prices is by moving patients from human insulins on to modern insulins. In that way, we get the price effect.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., it's completely different. In the U.S., you have a very high list price, and you can increase that within reason on an ongoing basis. We do that, but then you have a contracting managed care part of the market where you negotiate contracts with big customers and you have maybe more than 1,000 contracts on an ongoing basis, also with the government. And these contracts can have some very heavy discounts. Human insulin, for instance, typically carries 40 to 60% discount in the marketplace. That relates a little bit to the opportunities for biosimilars also because if you're a biosimilar and you look at the list price of human insulin in the U.S. you think this is going to be fantastic. I'll come in and discount by 50% and take the market, but if you went there and started negotiating, they would say what are you talking about. I mean you have an inferior product and we get a 55% discount from Novo Nordisk already. So forget about it. So it is, it's a complicated story, once you get into the details, but in general a more positive pricing environment in the United States.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And your &#x2013; just a quick follow-up, the stability of that, you are more, you are concerned about that Europe is more stable than the U.S. or vice versa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the European situation now is getting more stable. It's been very tough the last five years, but it's stabilizing but not in a nice way where it's stable. It's like it's stabilizing because there's now a balance of power between supply and demand which sort of keeps the prices in check.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., you could say it's more a situation where there is a political risk. If the Democrats come into total control including the presidency, and if they try to pursue a broad-based healthcare reform, then you could see a downside on the actual pricing, but on the other hand, you might see an upside on volumes if you get more general healthcare coverage so that you have a bigger part of the population being covered. So there, it's probably a marginal downside on price. But then again, if it's a very sort of uniform healthcare system they want to build, then you will have an upside on coverage and volume.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mads, would you just give some comments on biosimilar regulation and where we see that right now and then Jesper on the legal case with Sanofi-aventis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean very briefly in Europe the regulation is already in place. And we saw recently from EMEA that that they are setting high standards. When <mark type="inaudible" /> and their collaborator withdrew their <mark type="inaudible" /> of approvals or applications that was based on, I guess lack of the quality requirement fulfillment that EMEA kind of desires. FDA is still finalizing, I guess that some people thought that with the new PDUFA Act there would be biosimilar guidelines. There were not, but they are coming independently and we will have to watch. But for every year that goes you can say K&#xE5;re is upgrading our patients that are basically using the modern insulins. And even if not, we still have the device benefit. So we don't see the guidelines from them as being that critical for what we are doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on SoloSTAR, we believe that the SoloSTAR device from Sanofi-aventis is infringing our patent portfolio on devices. We have current court hearings in both the U.S. and Germany. There is no ruling or decisions yet from any of these cases, I believe there will be more clarity on a three to six months horizon in both Germany and U.S. in that respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is over here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions please. Firstly on that biosimilars in Europe, what's your expectations when the NovoLog or NovoRapid patent expires in Europe? Would you expect the EMEA guidelines which now only cover the human insulin be updated to cover short-acting insulin analogs as well? And then secondly, on the liraglutide weight loss, could you &#x2013; now when you have five to seven Phase III studies on liraglutide behind you, could you give us your general feeling of the time profile of the weight loss versus placebo of liraglutide? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mads, I guess it's you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the biosimilars, I mean, we have a whole set of different guidelines some from the very easy to copy proteins such as human insulin, interferon and growth hormone and a complete lack of guidelines on the very complex proteins such as glutaconic factors, where you basically have to redo an entire preclinical and clinical program of let's say your own choice so to speak.</p>
          <p>So where does NovoRapid fall into that? Yes, we have to work under the assumption that there will be biosimilar guidelines that allow for <mark type="inaudible" /> to be genericized, so to speak. So we will have to continue to work on alternative delivery on even better devices and so on to keep growth in that franchise, because it's the only of the analogs of the modern insulins where we don't have at this point a Phase II program in place for a superseding molecule. And then the other question is about lira...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lira, the profile on weight loss</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...profile on weight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. Yes, in the study where this is most easy to follow because the signal is the strongest namely the obesity trial, where we have compared against placebo and benicar. There we see a linear relationship between time and weight loss. So that's what we have seen for half a year, when and if there comes a plateau, I think this is something that we will simply have to study over longer periods of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to specify that &#x2013; you mean continuing increase in the weight loss versus placebo not versus baseline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one more question over there, I'm sorry to have you run around here, but you'll get some exercise you know the risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question about liraglutide, and whether you have plans to initiate studies in patients who are on insulin. I understand there has been some more observational studies that have shown that insulin dosing can actually come down, I assume mainly short acting insulin and what are your plans to look into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. We'll take one more question. That was quick. Final questioner in the front, and then we'll break for a little cup of coffee and we'll be around to have additional questions if there are some. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just looking at your key growth drivers in international markets and China, and your market share growth in China is very, very impressive so, how big value-wise is China right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's 5% of sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>5% of sales. And to what degree do you see, would you see a potential threat of maybe local producers. I mean you've got such a big market share that maybe local producers might actually come in and try to take that market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a picture here which actually showed you the answer to that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Shows you today, I'm thinking forward actually, maybe over the next five years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, there we go, here you have the local manufacturers. All the local manufacturers are losing market shares. The only ones that are gaining is us, Eli Lilly and then hardly noticeable sanofi-aventis on this chart.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask that in a slightly different way then, to what degree do you talk to the Chinese government, and to what degree do you get any sense that Chinese government would be keener for local producers to do better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>K&#xE5;re, do you have any comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think I even tried to comment on it, we have a very positive working relationship with the Chinese health authorities and the Chinese government. And we see that they are going for creating a system based on innovation and based on know-how. And I don't think they are seeing that coming from their local manufacturers.</p>
          <p>They are being very tough on their own pharmaceutical industry right now. Firstly, the way I interpret it is that they want the top companies to win, and they don't really see a big future for the companies who cannot drive innovation. And those competitors we have in China are mainly characterized by not really being very strong on innovation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the only one you are really seeing making progress of the Chinese, Tonghua Dongbao is actually making a copy of Lantus which is sold in the market. And that's why you've seen that product, it was actually approved prior Lantus coming on to market. So that's a little bit unusual situation in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the activities are significant in relationship to the growing Chinese market, it's also significant for us in terms of overseas markets because it limits the size of the Chinese manufacturers to a level which we believe we can manage, and it dampens their competitive pressures elsewhere in the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course specifically it goes hand in hand with us investing in research and development. We have a research and development center in China in clinical trials, in manufacturing and so on. So of course if we were not bringing know-how and investing in China, then I am not sure whether the authorities would be as positive as they are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One more question and then that will be the final, final for <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lars, I thought I'd ask you a question because you hadn't answered too many questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh! So I have my colleagues here working hard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is more a question about what's really the overall NPV of your business. If you go back one year you were having at that time all anti-diabetic drugs, you were having cancer drugs and even an inhalable insulin product. What is that &#x2013; what has changed in your assessment of the overall NPV of the company since you lost three assets, something must have moved in a positive direction just for the NPV to be positive. Is that the obesity pre-diabetes liraglutide or what has changed in a positive direction for that NPV to be...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think definitely it's lira and definitely in our own view perhaps not at the NPV seen from externally, the second-generation modern insulins. Let me just back up maybe three to four years when we started looking at diversification into oncology and biopharm. At that point in time, when we looked our businesses, we could see that in ten years' time we would be exposed to patent expirations. Our long-term projections seemed to indicate a growth rate which was stagnating towards the end of a ten-year period because of patent expiration. We at that time &#x2013; we did not have the visibility we have today on liraglutide. We did not have the visibility that we could reinvent parts of the insulin market. We did not have the knowledge and indications that we could perhaps reinvent the NovoSeven franchise or even indeed expand that into the whole hemophilia area. We did not have a long-acting human growth hormone in clinical trials.</p>
          <p>So what has changed &#x2013; so we thought we should have a broad based exploratory look at diversifying our portfolio so as we had a chance in a ten-year perspective to build another business. Today, the situation is quite, quite different. With our insulin franchise which accounts for the majority of the growth at the moment, there are replacement power with the two analogs that are in Phase II clinical study. With liraglutide, there's an expansion opportunity to compete directly with OADs. There's perhaps, and this is not known fully yet, a diversification opportunity into weight management and pre-diabetes which are areas that we believe that we know something about.</p>
          <p>With regards to the hemophilia area, as I mentioned, we have identified analogs of NovoSeven that either work faster or stronger or can be administered subcutaneously and that opens up a significant perspective of us expanding the current application of NovoSeven, even within the hemophilia area. And in addition to that we are undertaking research in the area of other clotting factors as well.</p>
          <p>Add to that the possibility of rejuvenating our growth hormone franchise, I would say that the pressure for us, seen from a growth perspective long term, to diversify our business has diminished. And that is why we have said let's not go broad based into oncology and inflammation, let's pick the one that we believe is the one that is most suitable for us. Invest R&amp;D-wise probably 10% of our resources into inflammation leaving significant funds aside for investing in these key franchises where we do believe that we have a better chance of success longer term. We can perhaps talk about that in the coffee break.</p>
