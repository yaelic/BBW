          <p>Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this conference call for the first quarter 2011 results of Enel. Once again let me excuse for the delay which was basically due to technical problem and let me hand over to the Chief Financial Officer Mr. Luigi Ferraris for a brief presentation and then we will open the Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome again to our first quarter 2011 results presentation. First, I will like to start by doing a quick analysis of the general macroeconomic trends in the areas in which we operate. In March, we indicated new average demand growth assumptions for the next five years. Let me state that we expect to continue a recovery from the minimum level recorded in 2009. For the time being, the gradual 2010 upward trend is being confirmed by the demand growth register in the first quarter of this year in Italy, Russia and Slovakia among others. As far as Spain is concerned, if we consider the demand on a like-for-like basis the trend is 1.1%.</p>
          <p>Now, allow me to provide an overview of some of the key financial highlights on chart number three. Group EBITDA remains in line versus 2010 after taking into account the perimeter effect for us as sold during last year in Spain, some negative one-off effect in Latin America and unfavorable idle conditions in Italy. The stability in group EBITDA has been possible thanks to the double-digit growth contribution of our international renewables and market divisions as well as the 7% growth of the domestic infrastructure and network division.</p>
          <p>Group net income amounted to &#x20AC;1.2 billion or 14.4% higher than last year. The growth mainly resulted from lower net financial charges versus first quarter 2010. I will go into more detail on this in the following chart. Net debt has increased by about &#x20AC;600 million to &#x20AC;45.6 billion. I will provide more details on this later on as well.</p>
          <p>Now moving to chart number four, EBIT decreased by about 3%, mainly due to lower EBITDA. Our net financial charges stand at &#x20AC;738 million registering a decrease of about &#x20AC;200 million. This variation is the net effect of the following: higher interest charges of &#x20AC;14 million mainly due to the effect of higher costs on the shorter portion of debt. We expect these interest charges for the full year 2011 to be lower than 2010 as the cash in from accrued tariff deficit reimbursements and the group operating cash flow will reduce the opportunity cost of our financial receivables and the total level of gross debt respectively.</p>
          <p>A decrease of &#x20AC;213 million of other interest charges, mainly as a result of lower interest charges of about &#x20AC;100 million related to the partial recovery of a non-recurring effect on the Spanish tariff deficit regularization recorded in the first quarter 2010 and the positive impact of about &#x20AC;100 million related to the authorization of past employment benefits and other provisions. This decrease in other interest charges will be maintained for the full year. Also, let me remind you that our normalized annual average cost of gross debt stands at 4.8% versus 4.4% of the last year. Finally the group's tax rate decreased from about 39.6% in the first quarter 2010 to about 35.2% in first quarter 2011. On a normalized basis our annualized tax rate is about 31%.</p>
          <p>Let's continue with an update on forward sales activities on chart number five. In Italy we have fully hedged our 2011 production at an average base load price of about &#x20AC;71 per megawatt hour and 55% of 2012 at an average base load price of about &#x20AC;75 per megawatt hour. In Spain, we are fully hedged for 2011 and 45%, 50% for 2012 at an average price of about &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour for 2011 and 55%, 60% for 2012. In Latin America we are 75%, 80% hedged for 2011 and 65%, 70% for 2012. In Slovakia we are 100% hedged for 2011 and about 60% hedged for 2012 at an average price of about &#x20AC;52, &#x20AC;53 per megawatt hour both for 2011 and 2012. All of this helps to explain our EBITDA evolution on chart number 6, which gives an overview of all of our operations.</p>
          <p>Now I will go through the EBITDA of each of our divisions in detail, starting with Generation &amp; Energy Management Italy on chart number 7. Overall divisional EBITDA declined by &#x20AC;102 million. This was mainly the result of a decrease in the generation margin of &#x20AC;88 million, mainly caused by lower prices and hydro volumes; and a slight reduction of &#x20AC;10 million in trade and gas margins. As a result of the above mentioned effects on prices and hydro conditions the overall generation unit margin net of ancillary services decreased to &#x20AC;42.8 per megawatt hour versus &#x20AC;44.7 of 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the EBITDA evolution analysis of the market division on chart number 8. EBITDA total &#x20AC;179 million versus &#x20AC;157 of first quarter 2010. This strong performance has been driven by the following effects: first the increase of &#x20AC;29 million in the contribution from the free market; mainly thanks to higher electricity margin partially compensated for by both lower gas margins and higher client related costs. Second, the slight decrease in the regulated electricity market mainly due to lower volume sold related to the market liberalization process.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 9 on domestic Infrastructure &amp; Network division. EBITDA amounted to &#x20AC;984 million, an increase of about 7% versus last year. This is the net effect of the following: The decrease of &#x20AC;20 million in the energy margin mainly due to negative price components on the tariff partially compensated for by higher volumes distributed among other factors. Higher connection fees of &#x20AC;52 million mainly related to energy producers and other items were &#x20AC;31 million positive.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide number 10, on international operations, EBITDA increased 19% or &#x20AC;72 million versus the first quarter of 2010. All the divisions have contributed to this positive performance and in particular Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne recorded an increase of &#x20AC;17 million, mainly due to increased production, partially compensated for by lower unit margins. Southeastern Europe was stable over the period. France increase by &#x20AC;21 billion benefiting from higher volumes. Finally, Russia increased by &#x20AC;32 million was split between generation and supply activities which accounted for &#x20AC;18 million and &#x20AC;14 million respective.</p>
          <p>Before analyzing the remaining divisions, I will like to quickly bring your attention to our Russian generation activities on slide number 11. OGK-5 reported first quarter 2011 EBITDA of about &#x20AC;93 million or 19% up. This was mainly the result of increasing power prices in the free market, higher capacity payments, and higher non-regulated sales on total volumes versus last year. All of this translated into a 21% increase in unit prices mainly driven by the day-ahead market price.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to Endesa results on slide number 12. First, let me remind you that numbers we report in this slide and in the following one are the results of the application of Enel Group's accounting principles which might differ from Endesa's principle due to a difference in local standards. The Iberian division has recorded an EBITDA decrease of &#x20AC;151 million. This has been the outcome of a decline of &#x20AC;88 million in the generation and supply business mainly explained by the increase in energy cost related to the higher level of Spanish fuel prices and better extra-peninsular generation margins, a decline of &#x20AC;31 million in the distribution business mainly due to lower connection fees versus last year and finally a decrease of &#x20AC;32 million in other items mainly related to the lower perimeter effect on the distribution assets sold last year for an amount of &#x20AC;78 million in balance, partially balanced by other revenues.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to Latin America on chart number 13. The Latin-American division has recorded an EBITDA decrease of &#x20AC;30 million. This has been mainly the result of: an increase of &#x20AC;65 million in the generation business mainly due to higher margins in Colombia for better hydro conditions, higher margins in Peru, thanks to higher volumes and prices, and Chile where the poor hydro condition related to a nil effect had been more than compensated for by other energy related revenues. A decrease of &#x20AC;16 million in the distribution business mainly due to a normalization of ample regulated revenues in Brazil versus last year partially compensated for by higher volumes distributed in Colombia and high activity in Chile after last year earthquake. And finally a decrease of &#x20AC;113 million in other items mainly related to a one-off increase in Colombian parsimonial tax for an amount of &#x20AC;109 million. Taking into account the above mentioned one-off tax impact the EBITDA on a like-for-like basis has increase by about 11%.</p>
          <p>And now let's review Enel Green Power on chart number 14. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;390 million representing an increase of about 20% versus last year. This is mainly due to the following; a decline of &#x20AC;22 million in Italy and Europe mainly due to the termination of the CIP 6 incentives, an increase of &#x20AC;74 million in Iberia and Latin America which is mainly the results of the consolidation for this year for &#x20AC;41 million, a one-off effect &#x20AC;423 million due to the acquisition of the controlling stake in SEA S.A., and higher volumes growth in Panama together with general cost reduction. And finally an increase of &#x20AC;12 million in North America, thanks to higher volumes and one-off positive impact of &#x20AC;16 million in damage on a renewable plant expropriation.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt is concerned, you see on chart number 15, that net of discontinued operations &#x2013; overall net debt stands at &#x20AC;45.6 billion. The &#x20AC;639 million increase during the period is mainly due to dividend payments to Endesa minorities for &#x20AC;266 million and an evolution of the working capital due to seasonal effects which recur every first and third quarter each year mainly because of the group building profile.</p>
          <p>Our liquidity position is supported by the availability of committed credit lines aiming at serving the management of working capital. Also taking into account, cash and cash equivalents liquidity at group level amounts to about &#x20AC;24 billion and allow us to cover more than 12 to 18 months of maturities. Please refer to the annexes for further details.</p>
          <p>Moreover, cash-in from the tariff deficit securitization started in January and continuing with yesterday's emission of about &#x20AC;1 billion, of which 50% pertaining to Endesa, is strengthening our consolidated liquidity position further. At this regard, I remind you that on May 4, Moody's confirmed our group A2+ rating and upgraded the outlook from negative to stable.</p>
          <p>Let me now sum up these results by remarking the following. The resilience of our Italian operations together with the strong performance from our international and renewable activities offset the expected decline in our Iberian operations. This allows me to confirm the targets already announced to the market for the full year 2011.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and now let's open the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Before starting the Q&amp;A session let me remind you that we have people connected not only via phone calls but also on the website and therefore we could possibly be collecting questions from those guys and then I will be posting those questions. So let's start with the first question in the row. I understand that Mr. Alberto Gandolfi, UBS, is ready to ask the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. It's Alberto Gandolfi, UBS. I have four, four very quick ones, I promise. First of all starting with the numbers, could you please summarize just once again whatever is non-recurring in these figures in the P&amp;L, I see financial expenses you talked about some non-recurring. Can you please again state in absolute terms, what's in Q1 there which you can be treated as non-recurring? Also the same issue, the D&amp;A line, as I understand you don't have many provisions, you provided us with a guidance at the D&amp;A provision level and this negative &#x20AC;60 million, &#x20AC;58 million in equity method income as well how to treat these going forward.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of working capital how do you expect this swing to swing during the rest of the year or you can provide us the guidance for full year net debt otherwise.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, talking about Endesa and LatAm, has anything changed since the Investor Day as far as minorities are concerned? Chairman of Endesa has very recently talked about stepping up investments in LatAm organically as well as via external growth, does that mean that there could be an acceleration of the minority restructuring.</p>
          <p>And very last one, a bit bigger picture, how is your view on LNG prices changing in light of what's been happening in Japan and all the nuclear plants that have been taken off-line over there, and possibly could be taken off-line in Europe? Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alberto. I will start from your question, which means summarizing the non-recurring items that we have in our profit and loss specifically, if we understand correctly, in the financial expense line. Well, let me repeat more precisely what I said, in the net financial charges we have seen a decrease in 2011 versus last year because of two reasons. First of all, we had in 2010 &#x2013; in the first quarter 2010, a one-off adjustment of, let's say, the financial interest or financial income attributable to the tariff deficit receivable and this has been &#x2013; has occurred last year and this year it is not taking place anymore therefore we have stabilized the situation. So we have &#x2013; if you want &#x20AC;100 million saving versus last year which of course will remain also at the end of the year. So it will be definitely reflected into our net income at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the other item, which is the authorization of post-employment benefits, well here what happens at Endesa level, last year we had lower level of interest charges and therefore the tax that has been used &#x2013; the rate that has been used to discount, the future post-employment benefits was lower than the this year. And therefore the net present value at that time has been higher than what we see at the end of the first quarter of this, where we expect to have higher rate of interest and therefore higher rate of discount. According to the projection that we foresee in the next month, I would say that we can assume easily &#x2013; we can easily assume that this saving again will be reflected in our net income as well at the end of the year. So I see here a couple of &#x20AC;100 million of improvement versus last year.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the pure cost of debt, I mean the deleveraging process has of course started to show its impact in terms of reduction of size of debt. But, as you know, we are using on one hand, in particular, the cash-in from the tariff deficit to reduce some short-term financial credit line which might be more expensive because of the increase in the rate of interest.</p>
          <p>I think this is it when it comes to the non-recurring items or financial charges. There is something else that you asked me which is the &#x20AC;58 million profit that we have, which is the results of the equity method applied to our minority investment that we have in the different, of course, legal entity. Should we assume that this is going to continue? I would say that for the time being it's too early to say if this &#x20AC;56 million will remain up to the end of the year, there is every quarter of course an application of the method but I think it's very likely that this is going to happen.</p>
          <p>The following question, any particular items in the D&amp;A line. To be honest with you, I cannot see any change or any non-recurrent on any particular items in the depreciation and amortization line. It's really a very ordinary quarter with no major impact. So you can assume this number also for the following quarter.</p>
          <p>Working capital; let me try to be more specific about this. Normally, the first quarter has been resulted with an increase of our working capital. In particular, in this first quarter, this increase is the result of, I would say, two major items. One item regards our billing profile which has deteriorated the working capital of &#x20AC;1 billion, in particular in Italy. Therefore you have an increase of the working capital and absorption of cash. Then we also have a reduction in our trade payables and this is typically of the period, because you know that in the first quarter our CapEx are particularly low versus the budget that we have each year and then we have a rush at the end of the first quarter or at the end of the year or in the fourth quarter and at the end of 2010 basically happened exactly the same that happened at the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>The level of CapEx of the last quarter of 2010 has been higher than the level of CapEx of the last quarter of 2009. Therefore, the level is pretty stable that we have recorded at the end of 2010 has been higher than the level of trade payables of the previous quarter in 2010. Basically this is the result or this is the reason why we are showing such an increasing working capital. Our expectation for the full year is to absorb this change and we confirm, as I said at the end of the presentation, the commitment to deliver &#x20AC;44 billion of net debt therefore showing up an increase or an improvement of our operating cash flow in the region of about &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>Any change in the Endesa Latin America minorities? No, there are no changes versus what we have already said in London presentation. Of course the reduction of the rationalization of our Latin American minorities is one of the targets for the long run of our group. Therefore, as we already said, we are working on that and once we have something to announce, of course, we will do as usual.</p>
          <p>Then I think the last question regarding expectation in the energy prices in light of what happened in particular in Japan and therefore in particular with regard to the evaluation of the nuclear investment and euro. But clearly, what we see today is a general trend in particular in Germany to reduce the level of capacity of new power plants to revisit the future program or even to cancel the nuclear capacity at the German level.</p>
          <p>Across Europe, you know that there is now in particularly at the European level a dedicated working group to state the parameter to be used for the stress test. Generally speaking, we should expect that both in Japan and in Europe there will be a reduction anyway of this nuclear capacity. What is the outcome of that? Well, of course, if the nuclear capacity will be reduced &#x2013; by the way this has happened already, we should expect an increase in the energy prices not only in Italy where as you know the gas price and the energy price follow a different story and they can be considered &#x2013; so Italy can always be considered a sort of island under this perspective. But we should see increase in the energy price in Northern Europe as by the way we start to see after the earthquake in Japan where we have seen in Germany an increase of &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>If I look the forward curve when it comes to Italy, for instance, well, the last concept that we have &#x2013; we are signing in these days I can tell you that &#x2013; are being signed in the region of &#x20AC;75, &#x20AC;76 per megawatt hour with a peak of &#x20AC;77 per megawatt hour. I am referring of course to the cause of signed for dispatching electricity in 2012. Therefore, I think it is reasonable to assume that the price should go up. And we see this reflected in the cost of the commodities and also in the level of gas supply which is going to be absorbed by Japan and by other European countries the more we go ahead with the reduction of the nuclear capacity.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mrs. Francesca Pezzoli, Cheuvreux.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes, good evening. One question regarding electricity prices and margins in Italy. If you can give us an indication about spark spread and dark spread embedded in your forward sales? Thank you &#x2013; for 2011 and 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So let me start with the dark spread. When it comes to 2011, we see dark spread in the region of &#x20AC;35 per megawatt hour plus; even 37, I would say. When it comes to 2012, we see dark spread in the region of the &#x20AC;38, &#x20AC;39 per megawatt hour for the time being and, of course, should the price go up furthermore, we should see something better.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the spark spread and, of course, I'm referring to hour on the spark spread, I'm not referring to the spread that we have on the market. With regards to 2011, we are in the region of &#x20AC;15 per megawatt hour. When it comes to 2012, now we are building a backlog in the region of &#x20AC;14 per megawatt hour.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Javier Suarez, UniCredit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon to everyone. Three questions, if I may. The first one is again on the duplication and amortization line. It has been &#x20AC;1,363 million. I think that you have mentioned that this is a figure that should be maintained is stable through the early quarter. So the question is, should we assume that this line by the year end should up around &#x20AC;5.5 billion. I am bringing this question because I think that the consensus number is pointing more towards a number close to &#x20AC;6 billion and the question is will you be so kind enough elaborating why the year end number is going to be close to &#x20AC;5.5 or &#x20AC;6 billion and from where the difference could come from. The second question is on Slovakia, I think that the International business has been performing very well. You have mentioned during the &#x2013; your speech that in Slovakia you have seen higher production and lower margins. The question is could you quantify for us how lower the margins has been in Slovakia during the first quarter and your expectation for the next quarter because I think that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:08) is quite significant and you could argue the price impact you could get in Slovakia going forward to be significantly better.</p>
          <p>And the final question is on the Endesa authorization, an important segment benefit. A slight clarification: had you mentioned that the benefit part in the first quarter 2011 when compared when the first quarter 2010 is, roughly speaking, &#x20AC;100 million; can you confirm that amount? And can you specify the rate at which you are discounting this to calculate the net present value and how this rate comparable with the previous assumption. Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, let me start from the second question, Slovakia first quarter reduction in unit margin. Well, we are really talking about very modest amounts in the sense that Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne has shown a &#x20AC;17 million increase, the reduction in the unit margin is negligible, we are talking about few million euros. When it comes to the 2011 &#x2013; well, I think that in 2011 we will not see the improvement I was referring to before. This is something that we start seeing in the backlog that we are building and therefore very likely next time when we'll see each other and we will talk about the implied price in the Slovakia forward sales, you will see an improvement with regards to 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, the other question is what should we expect on a full year basis, if I understand correctly, in terms of D&amp;A at the end of the year. Well, we are &#x2013; I mean, projecting something in the region of totally &#x20AC;5.5 billion out of which &#x20AC;5.2 billion is depreciation, and other accrual could be in the region of &#x20AC;200 million. So I would say that &#x20AC;5.4 billion for the time being unless I mean something unpredicted takes place can be easily assumed in your projection.</p>
          <p>What is the difference in terms of discount rate applied to the authorization of the benefit &#x2013; the sole benefit, the preretirement cost for our employees is 50 basis points. The saving is in the region of &#x20AC;100 million, and I repeat, I expect this number to be confirmed also by the end of the year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. A few questions, if I may. The first one is related to the market business. If you can elaborate a bit on the very good margins that you're enjoying in this quarter, if this trend is going to persist also over the coming quarters and the reason why it seems that the unit margins are increasing particularly in relation to the liberalized market. Second question is related to Russia. If I am right, the new two CCGT plants were expected to start at the end of 2010 and at the beginning of this year if you confirm that they are operational if this is the reason mainly why the capacity payment increased.</p>
          <p>And in relation to the trading business, there was an <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:37) I think that the EBITDA was around &#x20AC;30 million in this quarter. In the Russian presentation, you are expecting around &#x20AC;20 million per year. So if the business situation is improving by the point of view of this business. And lastly, going back to the nuclear issue in Europe, if you can give us a flavor on the reaction in Slovakia to the news flow coming from Japan if your plans in terms of timing for the start of the two new units at Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne are concerned, or if you see a risk of a delay because of the new situation. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Let me start by the last question with regards to nuclear. What has been the reaction in Slovakia? Well, for the time being, we have not seen any negative reaction from the government. There is a strong commitment from the government to finalize these projects. That part of the world is going to be tight or short of capacity very likely in the next few years, not specifically Slovakia, but the country very close to Slovakia. Therefore, we confirm we expect that the construction of the Malta power plants were proceeding according to our program which foresee the first reaction coming into operation by the end of 2012 and the second reaction &#x2013; reactor during the third quarter of 2015.</p>
          <p>Russia, I move to Russia, the two gas combined cycle are not yet contributing to the result of this first quarter. We expect that this is going to take place in the third quarter of 2011. Therefore, we expect that this new capacity of this new two gas combined cycle will contribute to further boost the profitability of this country and specifically our OGK-5.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Rus-Negosvik our third company, well, it is performing quite well also because of the progress in the liberalization of the Russian market. We at this stage, I think, we could assume that, of course, the &#x20AC;20 million EBITDA will be definitely higher. We have recorded &#x20AC;30 million and not inclined to multiply by four this result but I would say that something in the region of &#x20AC;100 million is something that we can foresee or cross to that amount. So it is getting much better. The capacity of tapping the market and increasing the volumes is quite strong. So they are delivering quite solid growing results.</p>
          <p>Let's go back to Italy; market, the market has performed quite well. Well, the reason why we are reporting this improvement in EBITDA margin in the market division Italy is because first of all we are targeting as you know a mix of customer which foresee more residential, more small office, home office segment, less large consumer or and therefore this allow us to have a final price higher than of course the average of last year, and of course the expected average margin for the current year is in the region of &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hour, which I think is quite solid because of the mix of our final customer base. So I am inclined to say that the market division this year will definitely deliver a strong set of results. Then I think this is it. So I hope I answered all the question.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. One question if I may, looking at your long-term debt maturity profile looks like your 2011 debt has increased at a level slightly 31 relative to the end of the year. I just wanted to have the confirmation that this is related to the working capital movement, so if you can just elaborate a little bit on that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Anna Maria, definitely yes. This is a result of our working capital seasonal effect. I also commented before that we paid &#x20AC;200 million to our minorities in Endesa. Therefore during the course of the year we are going to absorb this negative variation, like it happened last year. If you look at the previous quarter last year you will see the same trend, the same evolution. When it comes to our maturity profile, as I said before now we are sitting on &#x20AC;24 billion liquidity. Our coverage is 18 to 24 months, so not only this year but the following year is full covered. But of course we will look in the coming months if there is opportunity to further extend our maturity. You know that our target is to extend the maturity. Should the market allow us for sure in the coming months we might have a look at that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good evening, sorry, I just, I think it was clear after the first answer about D&amp;A provision and so on. I am probably a bit confused after the second, when you talk about &#x20AC;5.6 billion or so you are referring to the line within EBITDA and EBIT. Sorry, if I ask in such a silly way but because you have the depreciation and amortization provisions and the basically the PP allocation for the Endesa acquisition, as you can see we care a lot about this line, because it seems much lower than everybody was assuming before hand. Thank a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I confirm that there are no expected additional changes because we have definitely finalized all the purchase price allocation of Endesa last year. So the profile of depreciation and amortization that you see now should be stable during the course of the year. There are items like the bad debt receivable accrual that we do not expect to further increase. I think we have already reserved enough last year and the previous year so we go back to an ordinary course of accrual and definition of this type of amortization depreciation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening. A question on the discounting of the retirement benefits, just wondering if that is something that could happen again in the future and as we should take into account while measuring the sensitivity of your financial charges to interest rates or is that something that from now onwards you are going to hedge in some way. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understand correctly, you're asking me if we should expect additional changes in the tariff deficit receivable interest rates, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, absolutely no because at the end of the last year, beginning of this year we have definitely settled all the parameters and the technicality of calculating this type of remuneration. In theory, not only in theory we should expect an upside rather than a downside because up to now, we have applied the pure cost of debt without any spreads and we have appealed the court at the first level that we have been, I mean what we want and therefore it might be possible that the final outcome of this appeal might end up with the recognition of the spreads on top of the interest rates that we are talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what I was asking for, so I guess there is no hedging on that. If it comes to be a higher interest rate then you're going to get the benefit additional on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be an upside. It will be an upside, that it is not reflecting the numbers.</p>
