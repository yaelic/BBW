          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Nestl&#xE9; 2009 Full Year Results Conference Call, hosted by Jim Singh, Chief Financial Officer and by Roddy Child-Villiers, Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>As usual, there will be first a presentation and then we will open the call for question and answers. My name is Asan and I'll be your coordinator this morning. Throughout the conference, you'll remain on listen-only. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like to advise all parties this conference is being recorded and now I'd like to hand the conference over to Mr. Singh. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning to you all. I am delighted to have the opportunity to present our results to you today. As usual, I will take Safe Harbor Statement as read and go straight into my remarks.</p>
          <p>We started the year in a business environment of unprecedented economic turbulence, which progressed to a semblance of relative calmness at the end of the year. It was in this environment that the Company once again delivered outstanding results, exceeding expectations on all key metrics of the most recent consensus.</p>
          <p>Our organic growth at 4.1% clearly outperformed the industry. With a disciplined focus and clear alignment against our strategic priorities and key initiatives, we once again improved our EBIT margins 40 basis points in constant currency, while at the same time increased investment in our brands and reinforced our capabilities, positioning us for another year of total performance improvement.</p>
          <p>In these yet uncertain times, we are proposing an increase in dividends of 14.3% to CHF 1.60 per share, a 51.8% payout ratio of the underlying EPS for a total sum of CHF 5.6 billion, a 3.2% return on the year-end stock price of CHF 50.20.</p>
          <p>We completed a 7 billion share buyback in 2009, also completed CHF 20 billion out of the 25 billion program started in the fourth quarter of 2007. We will complete the 25 billion program this year and buy an additional 5 billion as part of the new CHF 10 billion program, making CHF 10 billion purchases of shares in 2010. This will result together with dividend in CHF 15.6 billion to be return to shareholders this year, a record for the Company. This is the essence of our performance in 2009.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows our performance against the Nestl&#xE9; model over the last decade. We continue on average to deliver the Nestl&#xE9; model with an average organic &#x2013; with an annual average organic growth of 6.2% and RIG of 3.5% and an annual average EBIT margin improvement of 30 basis points.</p>
          <p>This clearly demonstrates that the Nestl&#xE9; organization is quite capable of delivering performance within its framework &#x2013; within the framework of our objectives, in spite of the varying economic and business conditions over time.</p>
          <p>Our guidance for 2010 is that, Food &amp; Beverages will increase its organic growth over the level achieved in 2009. We will also once again deliver an improvement in EBIT margin in constant currencies. In relation to the proposed dividend and share buyback, we expect to return CHF 15.6 billion to shareholders in 2010.</p>
          <p>Let me now come back to 2009. The sales were CHF 107.6 billion. Organic growth was 4.1%. The EBIT margin was up 30 basis points to 14.6%, and was up 40 basis points in constant currencies. The Food and Beverage EBIT margin was also up 30 basis points to 13.1% and was also up 40 basis points in constant currencies.</p>
          <p>The net profit margin was 9.7%. This is not comparable to 2008, which benefited from a gain of CHF 9.2 billion on the sale of 24.8% of Alcon to Novartis. The underlying earnings per share were up 9.6% or 16.3% in constant currency. The average net trade working capital improved by 30 basis points, contributing to free cash flow of up to a 146% to SEK 12.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the performance in more detail and start with the quarterly performance. As you can see, RIG was a driver of acceleration throughout the year, more than compensating for the declining trend in pricing. All operating segments contributed to this acceleration. It is important to note that although pricing was in a downward during the year, it remained positive in the fourth quarter as our efforts to engage consumers in the value of our brands were successful. This demonstrate that price was not our key tool to drive growth, so much so as innovation and renovation, communication and a focus on the growth drivers in the Nestl&#xE9; roadmap.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you can see the cumulative acceleration in the RIG, which resulting in an increase &#x2013; increasingly volume driven organic growth for both the Group and Food and Beverage.</p>
          <p>Next is a geographic overview of our total Food and Beverage business for the year. All three regions accelerated during the year and achieved 3.9% organic growth at year-end. In emerging markets, consumer demand remained robust and we achieved over 8.5% organic growth there. In the developed markets, both RIG and organic growth were positive for the year.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Food and Beverage business achieved total business point improvement in its EBIT margin, 40 basis points in constant currency. This is in line with our commitment to achieve a sustainable annual improvement in EBIT margin and it was achieved whilst continuing to invest for future profitable growth.</p>
          <p>I'll now run through the zones, starting with Zone Americas. Zone Americas had sales of CHF 32.2 billion, organic growth was 6.5%, RIG was 2.8% above the level achieved in 2008. In North America, PetCare, Ambient Dairies, Soluble Coffee and Chocolate performed particularly well. Overall, North America achieved higher RIG, or RIG than in 2008, a great performance in view of the economic turbulence that engulfed the U.S. market at the end of 2008 and continued into 2009.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, Brazil achieved double-digit organic growth and there were good contributions also from Mexico and the other regions. There were strong performances from most categories in Latin America with Chocolate, Soluble Coffee, Ambient Dairy, PetCare, Biscuits and Powdered and Ready-to-Drink Beverages, all achieving double-digit organic growth.</p>
          <p>Market share improved over 60% &#x2013; in over 60% of the zones measured business segments and at the same time, in some markets accelerated development of sales forces to sell PPP products directly to consumers. The EBIT margin increased by 20 basis points to 16.8%, reflecting the benefits of strong growth in mix as well as efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Next is Zone Europe, Europe was the region most affected by the economic crisis. And some markets continue to be under considerable pressure.</p>
          <p>In that context, Zone Europe with CHF 22.5 billion of sales was able to hold its business base with organic growth of plus 0.3% and to maintain its EBIT margin at 12.4%. This was a resilient EBIT margin performance during the year, in which the zone had to &#x2013; had increased marketing investment against key initiatives and reflects a great job in terms of efficiencies throughout the business.</p>
          <p>Great Britain, France and Switzerland achieved good growth in Western Europe. Germany accelerated during the year after weak start. Amongst the categories, there was a strong growth in PetCare, Soluble Coffee, Powdered Beverages and Sugar Confectionary.</p>
          <p>Eastern Europe achieved mid single digit organic growth despite the tough economic environment in many countries. Soluble Coffee, Ambient Culinary and Powdered Beverages all contributed well.</p>
          <p>Market share improved in several measured business segments in the zone and the zone organic growth momentum improved during the year to 0.3% for the whole year.</p>
          <p>Next is Zone Asia, Oceania and Africa. The zone had sales of CHF 15.9 billion, organic growth was 6.7% and RIG was 4.6%.</p>
          <p>This was a strong performance built on RIG that accelerated throughout the year to year-end above the level achieved in 2008. Increased marketing support drove market shares, which improved in over 60% of the measured business segments in the zone. And we continued to build direct-to-consumer sales network in the emerging markets. Among emerging markets, Africa, Greater China, South Asia, the Philippines and Indonesia in particular performed well. Australia was the best of the developed markets. Amongst the categories, Soluble Coffee, Ambient Dairy, Chocolate, PetCare, Ready-to-Drink Beverages and Powdered Beverages had particularly strong growth.</p>
          <p>The EBIT margin increased by 20 basis points to 16.7%. The zone's EBIT margin benefited from the strong growth, particularly, in the emerging markets and was achieved whilst increasing an investment in brand support. Whilst the level of capital expenditure overall for the Group in 2009 was lower than in 2008, we actually increased investment in AOA to a record level. This reflects the great opportunities that we have in AOA to further expand our business.</p>
          <p>Next is Nestl&#xE9; Waters. Nestl&#xE9; Waters had sales of CHF 9.1 billion. Organic growth was negative 1.4% and RIG was negative 1.5%. The full year sales numbers reflect positive RIG and organic growth in the final quarter of the year. The performance was similar in Europe and North America with both regions improving. The emerging markets had a strong year, once again delivering double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Continued brand investment drove market share improvement in 75% of the business segments globally. North America improved its market share, France was flat and our market share improved in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Nestl&#xE9; Pure Life, the biggest water brand in the world present both in emerging markets and North America, achieved 14% organic growth. There were good performances also from Perrier and San Pellegrino both with positive organic growth.</p>
          <p>The EBIT margin increased by 100 basis points, benefiting from management's focus on optimization of its cost base particularly in the supply chain. There was a considerable improvement in working capital and a meaningful rationalization of SKU. Capital expenditure was at a lower level to optimize output from existing facilities. We exited HOD business in the U.K., but acquired growth platforms in Brazil and China. To conclude on Water, the division achieved its 2009 priorities of increasing margin whilst defending or building shares and right-sizing its structures and capital base.</p>
          <p>Next is Nutrition. Nutrition had sales of CHF10 billion. Organic growth was 2.8% and RIG was flat. The segment's improving momentum seen early in the year in all four divisions continued in the final quarter. Infant Nutrition had a good year generally, achieving double-digit growth in many emerging markets in Latin America and AOA. It also had a great year in Russia, with 30% growth. Its global share of total Infant Nutrition improved. Finally, its fourth quarter growth was strong against any benchmarks.</p>
          <p>For Healthcare Nutrition, 2009 was a year of finalizing the integration of the Novartis Medical Nutrition business, a process that started late in 2007. Over that time, we have addressed several product overlaps, have rationalized SKUs and discontinued less profitable customer relationships. We have also delivered on the promised cost synergies of 5% of sales.</p>
          <p>In 2009, Healthcare Nutrition achieved a good improvement in its EBIT margin and delivered accelerating momentum in organic growth. Of greater importance, the division is now well-positioned to accelerate top and bottom line performance in 2010 and beyond. Jenny Craig, the weight management division which was impacted throughout the year by lower consumer spend in the U.S., saw an improvement in the latter part of the year.</p>
          <p>Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition EBIT margin increased by 10 basis points to 17.4% despite a significant increase in marketing spend. There were good contributions, steady improvement from Healthcare Nutrition and Performance Nutrition. Overall, Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition is well-placed for a better performance in 2010.</p>
          <p>Next is Other Food &amp; Beverages. This segment had sales of CHF10.2 billion, organic growth was 6.8% and RIG was 3.6%. Nespresso had another dynamic year, its over 25% growth driven by innovations and market expansions. It had almost CHF3 billion in sales, 7 million members in its club and is approaching 200 boutiques. We made a major capacity investment in 2009 to meet the continuing high level of demand.</p>
          <p>Nestl&#xE9; Professional, previously Nestl&#xE9; Food Services in the markets, became a globally managed business at the beginning of 2009. This coincided with the global food service industry experienced significant declines, the steepest in recent times. It was in this environment that the business refocused on two growth pillars, Branded Beverages and Food Solutions and managed a significant reduction in its SKU, cleaned up its portfolio and optimized its cost base.</p>
          <p>At the same time, it delivered positive growth in the Americas and AOA and accelerated through the year to achieve a slightly positive organic growth overall. Its EBIT margin improved also.</p>
          <p>Cereal Partners worldwide enjoyed mid-single digit growth. It now has total sales of over CHF2 billion, operating in a &#x2013; over 130 countries and accounts for nearly a quarter of total Cereal sales outside of North America. The Other Food and Beverages EBIT margin increased by 80 basis points to 15.7%.</p>
          <p>I'll now run through the product groups. First is Powdered and Liquid Beverages. The product group had sales of CHF19.3 billion, organic growth was 9.5% and RIG was 5.6%. Soluble Coffee achieved good growth in all three zones, it benefited from the continued rollout of renovated products, renovated Nescaf&#xE9; brands such as Alta Rica, innovations such as Nescaf&#xE9; Greenblend, and initiatives such as PPP in Asia and Latin America and targeting Hispanic consumers in the U.S. with Nescaf&#xE9; Clasico. Powdered Beverage brands such as Milo and Nesquik also grew well around the world. Nesquik enjoyed a resurgence in Europe following a renovated recipe with an improved nutritional profile and accompanying communication. Nestea Powder had a strong year with launches such as Nestea Litro in the Philippines.</p>
          <p>The Ready-to-Drink business, incorporating those same brands, also performed well with good growth in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil and China, amongst others. The product group's EBIT margin was at 21.7% after increased levels of brand investment for new products in Soluble Coffee and Powdered Beverages and the continuing investment in the successful rollout of Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto, now in 24 countries.</p>
          <p>Next is Milk products and Ice Cream. The product group had sales of CHF 19.6 billion. Organic growth was 2% and RIG was 1.3%. In Ambient Diary, we adjusted our prices in early 2009 which allowed for increasing growth momentum during the year with double-digit growth in PPP.</p>
          <p>Growth was supported by increased investments to launch new products on the Nestl&#xE9; Id&#xE9;al and Nido and the launch of a broad range of innovations including nutritional Milks for elderly consumers in China and elsewhere.</p>
          <p>In North America, CoffeeMate continued to contribute strongly and is expanding its international presence. The rationalization of Ice Cream in some non-core markets in Europe positions the business for improved performance in 2010. The North American business extended its leadership position with accelerated growth compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>The product group's EBIT margin increased by 50 basis points to 12%. There were savings from the lower dairy costs in the Milk business, which allowed for lower prices and increased investment in brand support. The Ice Cream business achieved a good improvement in its EBIT margin with most markets contributing.</p>
          <p>Next is Prepared Dishes and Cooking Aids. It had sales of CHF 17.2 billion. Both the organic growth and the RIG were positive at 0.8%. There were particularly very good performances from Ambient and Chilled Culinary.</p>
          <p>The Frozen business serves both the retail and out-of-home markets. Its retail business enjoyed some benefits from consumers eating at home, particularly in the U.S., but conversely the out-of-home business suffered from the same trend.</p>
          <p>Consumers in the U.S. favored the value propositions exemplified by Stouffer's Family Meals and Hot Pockets, both of which performed well over single dip &#x2013; single serve dishes, such as Lean Cuisine and some Stouffer products.</p>
          <p>In Europe, Pizza was the most dynamic category. The Nestl&#xE9; Toll House Dough business performed well in the U.S., quarter had a strong year for RIG.</p>
          <p>The Ambient Dairy business, predominately Maggi, enjoyed double-digit growth in the Americas and Zone AOA, due partly to its PPP range as well as the nutritional innovation in areas such as Noodles.</p>
          <p>In a highly competitive European environment, volumes improved during the year. The product group's EBIT margin increased by 20 basis points to 12.9% after all the segments increasing their marketing investment.</p>
          <p>Next is Confectionery. Confectionery had sales of CHF 11.8 billion. Organic growth was 4.3% and RIG was minus 1%. In Europe, excellent performance in Great Britain, France and Switzerland.</p>
          <p>KitKat had another strong year, achieving organic growth of over 7%. Category performance in Russia was impacted by the weak economy, but we maintained our market shares there. Excluding Russia, the products group's RIG would have been positive.</p>
          <p>The Chocolate business grew rapidly in the Americas and Zone AOA. The business performed well the U.S. driven by innovations such as Cranberry Raisinets as well as the continuing good performance by Toll House. Biscuits had another strong year in its main zone, the Americas, with double-digit growth in Brazil. The product's group EBIT margin increased by 50 basis points to 13.6%.</p>
          <p>Next is PetCare. PetCare had sales of CHF 12.9 billion. Organic growth was 7.9% and RIG was 3.1%. The Nestl&#xE9; Purina business supported by increased brand investment and a very active innovation pipeline outperformed its markets with mid to single-digit organic growth in the all the three zones.</p>
          <p>Innovation in key brands such as Bakers ONE, Friskies and Beneful continued to drive growth, whilst new launches such as super-premium Chef Michael's, targeted at smaller dogs, achieved encouraging momentum.</p>
          <p>It is great to be able to report that the annual sales of Friskies brand exceeded $1 billion in the U.S. alone for the first time. The product group's EBIT margin increased by 60 basis points to 16.3% due primarily to strong growth and the mix benefit from fast development of premium and super-premium products, particularly in Europe and AOA.</p>
          <p>On the next slide are our Billionaire Brands. It is interesting to note that the fastest growing 12 brands come from seven different categories. This again reflects the broad-based performance I mentioned earlier and is evidenced by the outstanding growth achievement of our larger brands.</p>
          <p>The best news in this slide is the addition of two new brands, both in PetCare. Beneful and Purina ONE. Beneful was launched in 2001 and joins the Billionaire Brand less than 10 years later. ONE was launched in 1986. This is a great achievement by both brands, not least as they have had to overcome significant currency headwinds over the past few years to become Swiss franc billionaires.</p>
          <p>I'd like to remind you that Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence is more than a cost savings program. Its objective is to improve our performance in all areas of the value chain. Clearly that includes improved efficiencies in our factories and supply chain. But it also includes improving everything from the environment KPIs to bag goods, working capital to customer service.</p>
          <p>So the cost efficiencies and improvement in working capital that we are reporting today are only part of it. Another example is our customer service levels, which improved by 40 basis points in 2009.</p>
          <p>Key principles of Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence include lean thinking and lean activities, zero defects, 100% achievement of objectives and a one-team approach with goal alignment and people commitment. It is supported with leadership skills training involving 170,000 employees. This initiative is already building momentum as evidenced of &#x2013; by savings of over CHF 1.5 billion in 2009 and that is a good link to our next slide, the EBIT bridge.</p>
          <p>The Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence efficiencies touch all areas of the income statement. A big beneficiary was the cost of goods sold and a result, our gross margin rose 110 basis points. The savings achieved from our NCE programs allowed us to more than overcome inflation on our input cost.</p>
          <p>There was a 40 basis points improvement in distribution. This is a result of mix of efficiencies, improved route management in Water and optimization of our route to markets in other categories.</p>
          <p>We continue to increase our investment in our brands in 2009. Consumer facing marketing spend was up 10% in constant currencies. Administrative costs increased as a result of increased pension costs and the impact of the Swiss franc. R&amp;D was up 10 basis points. Overall, we moved the EBIT margin up by 30 basis points to 14.6% or 40 basis points in constant currencies.</p>
          <p>On the next slide you have the bottom part of the income statement. I'd like to touch on a few points. 2009 restructuring costs were lower at CHF 200 million. The level of goodwill impairment was significantly lower in 2009 than 2008. Net financing cost was lower at 0.6 billion, clearly we benefited from lower interest rate &#x2013; from the lower interest rate environment in 2009.</p>
          <p>Overall, the tax impact was lower, driven primarily by market mix. The 2009 net profit is not comparable with 2008, due to the CHF 9.2 billion net profit on the sale of 24.85% Alcon Holdings in 2008. The underlying earnings per share were up at nine points &#x2013; up 9.6%. In constant currencies, they were up 16.3%.</p>
          <p>We had a terrific year in terms of our cash flow performance. Operating cash flow increased by CHF 7.2 billion to CHF 17.9 billion. The working capital improved in all areas as shown on the slide. This reflects an outstanding operational and financial performance, characterized by a high level of discipline and a particular focus on operational efficiencies. Our cash conversion cycle improved by three days.</p>
          <p>Our capital expenditures in 2009 was 4.6 billion, down about 5% from 2008. This reflects lower CapEx in Waters as well as a group-wide review early in 2009 of all our major projects.</p>
          <p>I'm staying with cash in the next slide, but turning to the cash return to shareholders. Between 2005 and 2009, we have paid out over 20 billion in dividends and spent over CHF 24 billion in share buyback, making CHF 44 billion in total. In 2010, we will likely spend a further CHF 10 billion on our share buyback and will likely pay a further 5.6 billion on the proposed dividend. We will do this whilst maintaining our gold standard credit rating in the industry in terms of our balance sheet and we continue to believe that the credit rating we had at the end of 2009 is appropriate for the group longer term.</p>
          <p>As I start to wrap up my presentation, I'd like to show you our total performance framework, which you already are familiar with. There are four areas: driving performance, capturing scale benefits, simplicity and investment for growth. We have delivered in each of the four.</p>
          <p>Starting with driving performance, we achieved organic growth of 4.1%. Popularly positioned products or PPP have delivered well with nearly 13% growth and we have continued to grow with our key customers. Equally, we have a strong delivery of efficiencies and a good working capital performance.</p>
          <p>Next is scale benefits. GLOBE continues to facilitate efficiencies as well as provide improved transparency, enabling faster decision-making. We continue to rollout shared services on the GNBS.</p>
          <p>Next is simplicity, we have divested non-core or under performing business with annualized sales of CHF 0.8 billion. We have reduced SKUs by 16%. Our factory number is down by seven in total to 449 facilities across the world, despite having acquired or opened 10 new ones. We've had &#x2013; we've reduced legal entities again by 4%.</p>
          <p>Finally investment for growth, we have made bolt-on acquisitions that bring annualized sales of 2.3 billion, primarily Kraft Pizza announced earlier this year. Our capital expenditure was CHF 4.6 billion, R&amp;D was about 2 billion and we increased our media spend by 10% in constant currencies.</p>
          <p>Now to conclude my comments, I hope you recognize these results for what they are, a great achievement in a tough economic environment. I talked to you just now about our total performance framework. This means not making compromises. It means driving improvement in all areas with discipline. It is what we have done in 2009. Organic growth was well balanced within the context of the prevailing economic environment. As RIG accelerated, we were able to maintaining &#x2013; maintain pricing levels based on the clear value proposition in our brands.</p>
          <p>We increased our brand investment to drive volume, but also delivered a meaningful EBIT margin improvement. The underlying net profit, the return on invested capital, our cash flow and working capital all show the benefit of our continued drive for acceleration in all areas of our operational performance.</p>
          <p>All areas of the world contributed well. The Americas and Asia, Africa and Oceana were growth drivers and improved their margins, whilst Europe and Waters suffered from more subdued consumer demand, but did a great job in maintaining their businesses and on extracting efficiencies and managing working capital.</p>
          <p>Most important, we are converting our good performance into return for our shareholders through our plan to return to shareholders about CHF 15 billion in 2010 through a dividend and our share buyback program.</p>
          <p>To conclude, 2009 was a great year for the Group. We delivered a well-balanced strong base performance across all parts of the world and in all aspects of financial performance, truly a credit to our employees around the world.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the current year for our Food and Beverage business, we expect to deliver a further improvement in our EBIT margin and constant currency as well as an improvement in our organic growth from the level achieved in 2009.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. Now let's go to questions and Roddy is here also, as been announced at the beginning of our call.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning and congratulations on a very strong set of figures there. I have a couple of questions for you. My first question is, you've made no mention of your long-term target of five to 6%, but I know Paul Bulcke a couple of weeks ago was saying this remains a sort of a long-term goal. Wonder if you can just clarify, Jim, that this remains a long-term goal but you don't want to just go ahead and say you are going to do it this year, given the uncertain environment. Second question, just on the gross margin. I am wondering what part of that is say, gains as a result of efficiencies in the production set-up and what proportion was from lower commodity prices? And obviously what I am trying to get is what can be maintained and what may disappear if commodity prices move higher. And I wonder if I can just ask a third question, just on the working capital, great work there. I am wondering how much further can that go. Or do you think now in terms of say working capital to group sales we are now it at a fair level or do you think we can still see further improvements there? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Jon. First of all, the Nestl&#xE9; model you have seen clearly over the last decade and even if you go back beyond that, that over the years we have delivered organic growth of 6.2% on average. On average as we proceed and 3.5% real internal growth. The Nestl&#xE9; model is our long-term objective. In some years we do very well, and other years we fall slightly below. But it is the way we guide our performance that our objective is to achieve our Nestl&#xE9; model as we progress the business over time. And you've seen that delivered in spite of varying economic and business conditions.</p>
          <p>Now your other question on gross margin, here I would say that we had on the positive side, we had considerable benefit from our efficiency program in our factories around the world. Plus, very favorable market mix which together more than offset the increase in input costs which we told you that we expect this year would be somewhere close to 2% and that's what we actually experienced and improvement in &#x2013; also increase in other areas of the conversion cost. So looking forward, I think we are looking at an environment where we believe that we are going to once again experience a two to 3% increase in our input costs. But we are determined to continue to drive our efficiency program. As I said, Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence is not a one &#x2013; it's not a program that starts and ends, it is a behavior that is being driven across the Company. So we have every confident &#x2013; a very high level of confidence that we will continue to extract significant cost savings from our operations as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of working capital, what I would say is that we have adjusted working capital in a very disciplined way at a level that now allows us to continue to improve on servicing our customers. And that is the level in terms of our inventory, especially with respect to our inventories, where we believe we've reached a level that allows us to have a best-in-class service level with our trade partners around the world. Around the world, this is a global objective.</p>
          <p>So I would say that our objective is to make sure that our ratios as we progress in the future does not get out of kilter and it was a significant improvement this year. As you would recall in 2008, we told you given the environment in which we were, we had to increase slightly our working capital. We have taken that out of the system, plus significant improvement in efficiencies to drive the lower standards in terms of coverage, but also very much linked to our ability to service our customers. Hope that answers your question, Jon.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim, good morning, Roddy. Also a couple of questions. The first one is on pricing. Obviously, we saw a further deceleration in Q4. I'd value your input on pricing, looking ahead into 2010. Do you think pricing can decelerate further from here? Or do you think the pricing in Q4 represents the trough in the cycle?</p>
          <p>The second question is on your Billionaire Brands, you showed five brands below zero. I was just wondering whether you can talk about that and what plans you have to improve the performance of those brands below zero. And then just finally on AOA, we saw a very nice acceleration in Rig in Q4, I think it was almost double the levels of Q3. I was just wondering what's driving that and do you think that's sustainable at these kinds of elevated levels. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Warren. I notice you went to the bottom of the chart under Billionaire Brands. But let me just come back to the pricing. Pricing is a reflection of the value you create in your brands and also influenced by major commodity cost. We are in an environment where &#x2013; that is very volatile with respect to commodity pricing. In the last couple of weeks, in the last month or so, the volatility was somewhere between 2% and 23%.</p>
          <p>So we will take pricing that justifies the value in our brands to the consumers. We will also continue to extract efficiencies in our operations to help mitigate the need for significant price increases. So, as you know &#x2013; you would recall, Warren, I said before that pricing is not the only action we take to manage input cost pressures, but it's surely an option that we exercise from time to time. Not forgetting that, at the end of the day, our challenge is to make sure that we do not destroy the value of our brands to the consumers.</p>
          <p>And as you see in &#x2013; as you would have seen in 2009, we did not play the price game. We did not play the price game and we maintained the value of our categories and our brands. And that is important and an important part of our strategy going forward.</p>
          <p>The Billionaire Brands, I would say, clearly our larger brands are driving growth. And you have a range of performances and it's very important to look at those brands above the Group performance, which are significant in number. And in addition to that, as I said, we have added two new Billionaire Brands this year in the PetCare, in our PetCare business. Yes, there are brands that are below zero in 2009. Herta and Nido were pricing-related. We have had to take price reductions in those brands, but in both brands we had a positive RIG. So we believe the strategies there are very clear.</p>
          <p>In the Ice Cream, the rationalization of the business in Europe positions us for better performance in 2010 and our business in North America and the rest of the world continue to improve. So plans are in place to deal with Ice Cream on a global basis.</p>
          <p>On Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine, any negative performance in these two brands relate to the single-served dishes. And yes, we have plans in place to restore those brands to positive growth. Now AOA, you mentioned the acceleration in AOA. I think part of it in the fourth quarter has to do with the comparison to the China situation in 2008. But generally, generally across the zone, we are seeing a momentum in our growth and we have objectives this year that hopefully will build on that momentum.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just on the AOA, Warren, just to add, just to really underline what Jim says. Basically every single product category improved in the final quarter and almost every single market as well. So basically, it really is a very broad-based general improvement, as well as the China situation that Jim mentioned. And of course, on the Dairy business, don't forget that the China situation did actually impact our broader Asian and AOA Dairy business, not just China, so there is a fairly big positive impact there.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Jim, just going back on the Billionaire Brands, the Buitoni brand, has that dropped out of the Billionaire Brands? I can't see that on the charts, but I think it was there previously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it was. I think there was the Buitoni in &#x2013; the Buitoni non-frozen prepared meals continue to do very well. And it's not on the chart because the frozen prepared meals part of the business has not &#x2013; is not being &#x2013; doing well of recent and we are addressing the issues there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Roddy. Maybe I can push you a bit further on your outlook, at least I am going to try. And bring that in perspective in light of consensus, maybe you want to bridge that in your outlook statement. Currently, consensus is looking for 4.6% on the organic growth and 20 basis points of margin expansion to 13.3. Are you feeling comfortable with that consensus at the moment?</p>
          <p>Second question is indeed on your dividend policy going forward, a good surprise there, solid improvement to up 14%. What should we be expecting in terms of the payout going forward? Last question is a more technical one, it's on the non-allocated items. We saw that slightly moving up to 1.6% of sales. Now that Alcon is out, what are your expectations for the non-allocated items, in terms of sales? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, the outlook &#x2013; Marco, what we just said, we are not going to change where the consensus &#x2013; we have seen the consensus, but our outlook is that we will improve our organic growth performance above the level achieved in 2009. So, and we will continue to improve our EBIT margins in constant currency. So that's our guidance. We are not going to &#x2013; we are not going to be saying much more than that. I think that is a fair objective and very clear guidance from our Company.</p>
          <p>The other question was on dividend policy. Look, our dividend &#x2013; you should look at the way we have distributed dividend in the past. It is really a function of the underlying performance of the Company. And we will continue to pay dividends based on the underlying performance of the Company. We have increased our dividend every year by an average annual growth of about 15%. Last year was slightly under 15% and this year is 14.3%. So that is our &#x2013; that is the guidance and that is the guidance we use to decide on our dividend, the way we pay dividend to our shareholders. It is the result of the performance of the business, which you have seen over the recent years.</p>
          <p>On the non-allocated items -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The &#x2013; the only. Marco, there isn't much impact on that from the disposal of Alcon, because the cost items are &#x2013; that Alcon has are attributed to Alcon. The non-allocated items are really the essential costs, R&amp;D, which we don't allocate to individual businesses. Clearly Alcon's R&amp;D costs are attributed to Alcon. So there is a &#x2013; there is no impact on those non-allocated items from the disposal of Alcon.</p>

          <p>Good morning. I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about the Infant Nutrition business and specifically, what steps have you taken to address the issues in France and Germany, which give you confidence that that business will improve its performance in 2010?</p>
          <p>And secondly, could I ask a question about the impact of the dis &#x2013; the income of Alcon on your cash flow? I can see the operating cash flow from the note to the accounts. But could you just talk at the free cash flow level? What proportion of your free cash flow in 2009 did Alcon represent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We've &#x2013; thanks, Julian. Just on the Infant Nutrition in Germany and France. We have implemented changes in &#x2013; early in 2009. We've introduced new products in, not only in those two markets, but in other markets with good performance and the business, including those markets, continue to improve. So I do not want to get into the specific actions, but I could tell you that in both markets, we expect an improved performance in 2010, based on the actions that we've taken in 2009 and also the progress we've made, especially in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>On cash flow, the Alcon contribution to our cash flow is about CHF2.6 billion in terms of the operating cash flow.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no. I don't think so, because you know as the Company. Well, look, this year, our cash flow from operations was about 2.7, CHF2.8 billion over last year. We believe that as we continue to drive our performance, we should be seeing some improvement around that range. I do not think by selling Alcon, our cash flows will be diluted.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Could we please talk a little bit more about Europe? It looks like you reported positive RIG and price in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk through what you're doing to drive volume growth, specifically in Europe? And what your thoughts are for this year, both in terms of price and volume in Europe? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Europe, like all other markets, accelerated during the course of the year with actually positive RIG and organic growth in the fourth quarter. We expect to continue to experience a positive organic growth in the region. Last year was a difficult year for Europe, especially not only in Eastern Europe, but in Western Europe. So I think we will continue to see improvements based on some of the initiatives that were introduced last year, including the introduction of several new products in several categories. So I am confident that we will continue to see a positive momentum in Europe for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think also, Polly, some of the things that we talked about on the conference calls earlier in the year have reversed. So, for example, we talked about, earlier in the year, tough negotiations with some of our customers, that today have all been put behind us and that clearly is always a positive for growth. We talked about issues with Mercadona in Spain. They are now back stocking a number of branded goods, including a lot of our branded products. That's clearly a positive.</p>
          <p>So, a number of these issues that we talked about earlier in the year have reversed, which means that it's good news for our distribution and if our distribution is broader, then clearly that's good news for growth. So I would add that to Jim's comment. And since you mentioned the fourth quarter, it is perhaps notable that every operating segment in every product group that we report had positive volume in the fourth quarter. So Jim mentioned broad-based performance and the acceleration, and that's clearly the case.</p>

          <p>Again, Patrik Schwendimann, Z&#xFC;rcher Kantonalbank. Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Roddy. Again regarding pricing for 2010, what's your best guess there? You're mentioning that you want to keep your brand value, but what does this mean? Would you really say that this 1.1% in Q4 was the lowest level, or what do you expect for 2010? And secondly, regarding the tax rate, which was extraordinary low at the published rate at 23.4%. Now excluding Alcon, what's your best guess here for 2010? And lastly, what do you see as the biggest risk for 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Patrik. First of all, on pricing. Look, our focus is on organic growth, which as you know, includes a component of pricing. And as I think we answered that question earlier in the conference call, we believe, as I said, the organic growth for our Food and Beverage business will be at a level higher than what we achieved this year. I don't think it is value-added to get in to try and splitting it up so early in the year. We believe that we will continue to maintain the value of our brands and our relationship with consumers and that is part of our strategy. So I would not get into separating the elements of our organic growth, but to commit to you that we will continue to improve our organic growth next year.</p>
          <p>On Alcon, the Alcon divestiture, we had said last year that the underlying tax rate going forward for the continuing business will be somewhere between 27 and 29%. We're sort of narrowing that guidance to closer to between 27 and 28%. And risk for 2010, well, every day you come to work, there is risks. We have assessed the risk, as you've seen, at the beginning of this year and late last year looking at the market and of course I think today, we are in a sense of some degree of calmness although there are some other pockets of difficulties in some &#x2013; on some markets.</p>
          <p>And we are very well aware of those and are on top of them, but when we give you our guidance, we have considered existing risks and probable risks in our business, in the business conditions. Overall at the end, we will have to do the best we can as we have done again last year in perhaps one of the most turbulent economic environment we have experienced. So we &#x2013; I hope we have demonstrated our ability to manage our risks in the business, in the business environment.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Apologies for going back to pricing, but just a clarification. The deceleration at the back end of the year, which Warren referenced, is that just the lapping of last year's price increases or were there actually some categories in the fourth quarter where you did take pricing points lower? I think you referenced Milk as being one of them, but was I just wondering if there are other categories where pricing might have followed some commodity costs going down.</p>
          <p>And then I had another question on your margins by division. In H2, I think you saw a very strong margin progression in Milk and Ice Cream and Nutrition compared with declines in H1. Is that again import costs coming off in those divisions? Or is that where you've seen what looks to have been accelerated cost savings in the second half of the year? And similarly, the H2 margin in Water, up again very strongly. I know you stated that was focus, to take out costs out of that business, to right-size the cost base there. Is that job done now, or can we expect further margin progression in the second half of the &#x2013; in next year in Water as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on pricing, the trend in pricing in 2009 of course had the effect of phasing out prices that were taken in 2008. So I would say that was a major contributor to the trend. But where it is necessary, where it is necessary for us to take pricing to manage our value and our margin, we will. And that has been our model and we will continue to do that. The improvement in margins in the Milk and Ice Cream category has to do with two things. First, with a decline in prices that we have implemented, following a reduction in dairy costs during the course of the year but also an improvement in the mix of the business in terms of product categories and also market mix. So that explains the margin improvement in that category.</p>
          <p>On Water, a lot of the actions that were implemented in 2008 and early 2009 really benefited us in the second half of the year. In addition, I think coming into the second half of the year, the Water business had better volume performance. So yes, we can &#x2013; we expect a continuing trend of improvement in the Water business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You also asked about Nutrition. I think you need to re-read the press release or conference call from the first half of the year because we explained that the reason in the first half of the year as margins were down was because of the timing of loan shares and various other things we're doing in that business. I can't remember the precise wording. And we said then that we'd see the benefit in the second half of the year and we thought that margins would come back to be at least flat. In fact, they're up 10 basis points, but I can't remember the exact explanation. But as you know, we don't spend lot of time analyzing our second half margins. We tend to look at the margins for first half accumulatively.</p>

Do you think we see an improvement in 2010, or will there be an additional negative impact on margins in the current year overall if we look at the last quarter and expect that the capital markets are more or less stable?</p>
          <p>The second thing is on marketing. Could we expect an additional with all the initiations you have taken, an additional negative impact on the margins available for marketing or i.e. increase in marketing expenses again versus this year? And the last question is how much is now the outlook for Water in the emerging markets?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's talk about the first question on pension fund. I believe we had to take a step up in our costs in 2009 to reflect the realities of the financial markets. And I think you are right, if there is stability in the financial markets, we believe our pension costs will remain stable at last year's level. We have a sense of what those costs are already this year and I could tell you that we do not &#x2013; we are not forecasting an increase in our pension costs relative to last year.</p>
          <p>On marketing, we will continue to invest in our brands. I do not we're in terms of the products and geographies because the focus is on building our brands, driving real internal growth in all geographies around the world.</p>
          <p>So we have increased our spending, especially in the second half as you would have seen and we continue to maintain a high level of support for our brands. I do not think you should look at our marketing spending especially our consumer facing marketing as necessarily margin dilutive because they drive growth, they drive margins that pay for these support. I mean it doesn't happen on a monthly basis, but over time that is the expectation.</p>
          <p>Now and your last question was Water on emerging markets. I would say the emerging markets which is at double-digit growth, are faster than the developed markets today. Our business in emerging markets is somewhere between 11 and 12% of the total business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>recall on market mix there. Could you just go into some more details on that? And then the second question, just coming back to this point on the dividend. Obviously your payout ratio is getting relatively high now particularly once you exclude Alcon from the earnings. So could you just talk about where you see your dividend payout ratio going from here? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The first question was on market mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned that was very favorable towards your gross margin and I wanted some more detail on that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The market mix is basically, we are growing faster in those markets where our margins are slightly higher. And that's what we mean by market mix. The &#x2013; and within the markets there are of course &#x2013; there are of course different product categories. So, you know you have different product categories influencing the mix in the markets. So when we talk about market mix, we are talking about category and geographical mix within their respective zones. On dividends as I said earlier, the dividend is based on the underlying performance of the Company. It's not necessarily influenced in particular by a payout ratio. Based on the performance during the last decade you have seen relative to the Nestl&#xE9; model, we have made considerable progress year-after-year and therefore over the last three or four &#x2013; over the last four years, we have shared that improvement in our progress with our shareholders. Part of it was the dividend policy. So based on our confidence on the underlying improvement performance of the business, you will see us continuing to pay a very competitive and reasonable competitive dividend that delivers a very competitive return to our shareholders.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, morning. I have two questions. Firstly, going back to Europe, in the past you've actually given the growth rate for Europe as a region not just as a zone. So I wondered if you could give us this. And secondly, you talked about PPP. Could you possibly give us a percentage of the sales that are now from PPPs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sara, I answer the last question first. PPP today represents about 8% of our Food &amp; Beverage sales. And in Europe you have a &#x2013; we don't necessarily &#x2013; you have a particular market, you -you're interested -</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The total Food and Beverage Europe, the organic growth was 1.2% and the RIG was minus 0.2% for the year. That was your question?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you for your question. Your next question is from Pierre Tegner from Oddo.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim, good morning, Roddy. I have two questions. The first one is concerning the decrease of EBIT margin in AOA in H2. If my calculations are accurate, it's the only zone and the only area where you have a decrease in margin in H2. Is there a specific reason? Did you need to be more aggressive in term of IMP or was there less cost savings to generate in this zone? That's the first question. And the second question is could you give us an idea of the RIG we had in Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition if we exclude China to take into account the easy comparison basis you had in this activity? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Pierre. Well first of all in AOA, we don't manage the profitability by half year or by quarters. I think we invest to grow our business wherever there is an opportunity to do so and any variation in the margin is because of the variation in the level of investment against our business. And you would have seen on the chart the acceleration, which also includes Zone AOA in a very significant way. So I do not get distracted if there is a change in profitability between one period to the next. At the end of the day, we look at a performance on an annual basis to make sure that what we are achieving and what we are doing drives sustainable improvement over time. And I don't have the RIG on Nutrition excluding China. I mean, so I am sorry, Pierre. I don't have that information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But excluding China, we have at least a positive rating in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could tell you that our Nutrition business, especially, our Infant Nutrition business had very, very good performance throughout the year in emerging markets. So I &#x2013; and I know we did improve in China because of reasons &#x2013; that issues were late last year, but our Nutrition, Infant Nutrition business have had a very, very good year in emerging markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The RIG trended meaning fully better in Q4 in Europe and the Americas as well as AOA. So I mean, I haven't got the maps whether it was positive or not but it trended significantly better in both &#x2013; in all three zones. So, I slightly answer your question is, yes, it was positive because it was slightly significantly better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Roddy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much for your questions. You've heard Paul Bulcke talking about the need for acceleration and about how we have our people aligned behind the Nestl&#xE9; roadmap. These results demonstrate the benefits of that acceleration and of that alignment behind a clear strategy.</p>
          <p>You will hear more of that from him, if you tune into the press conference in 15 minutes as well as in the road show next week. I intend on the road show, to look in more detail at our performance framework and how we are managing our business in the current environment as we did in 2009 and what we are doing in 2010 to drive continued profitability. Thank you very much.</p>
