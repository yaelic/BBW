          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is the Chorus call conference operator. Welcome to the UniCredit Group Third Quarter 2009 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alessandro Profumo, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, Mr. Profumo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So, good morning to everybody. Before starting, Marina Natale will read a remark which is necessary since we are in the capital increase process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for joining us today. I will like to point out before we begin that the purpose of this presentation is to discuss our third quarter results. And we ask that any question made be limited to ones regarding such results. So please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So, many thanks. Shall we start from the third quarter results? As we have seen, we have a net profit which is 394 million in the quarter. With the asset quality deterioration which is slowing down, we continue our assets optimization and so that the capital ratio even before the capital increase improved. You will see the number later on.</p>
          <p>The revenue side is 6.7 billion, which is flat year-on-year, with net interest income which are down due to the sensitivity we have to the decreased interest rates, while net fees are again growing and we have &#x20AC;715 million of trading profit as well in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to manage the cost so the third quarter, as in all the quarters of 2009, are going down and as well, the provisioning are going down 11%. And as I said before, there are signs of deceleration in the growth of impaired loans. The total assets are still decreasing, went down in the quarter by 2.6% with a 46% quarter-on-quarter drop in the net interbank position and a further 7.4 quarter-on-quarter decline in trading assets.</p>
          <p>The leverage ratio is further decreasing. We have today 25.4%, which is 1.9% down versus June and with &#x2013; the capital increase would be at 23. The core Tier I is at the end of the quarter at 755, pro forma with a capital increase would be 8.39, which is a 70 basis point capital generation in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Shall we move to the numbers? So we can go line by line as usual. We have a comparison on quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year stated and year-on-year normalized, which means at constant Forex and perimeter. As you can see, the growth &#x2013; there is a growth on year-on-year normalized of the revenues by 5.9%, while quarter-on-quarter we are down by 14.1%, mainly due to the decrease in net interest margin, as you will see later on, and in trading profits. You remember the second quarter has been an exceptional quarter.</p>
          <p>The operating costs are still down. if we consider quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year and year-on-year normalized, which is, we think, quite an excellent result. Operating profit is down quarter-on-quarter but is significantly up if we compare year-on-year, as you can see, 23.2% year-on-year growth.</p>
          <p>The net write-down on loans are at 2.1 billion, you see there is a decrease of 11 &#x2013; decrease of 11% quarter-on-quarter, despite increased provisioning in Kazakhstan, we will talk about later on. All the other countries are improving. Other non-operating income are &#x2013; non-item, sorry, is not relevant.</p>
          <p>Income tax for the period has been 188 million, so that the net income pre PPA is 460 million. The cost of risk is slightly down. We are at 150 basis points, minus 14 basis points on the previous quarter, without Kazakhstan, would be at 134 basis points.</p>
          <p>If we go to the line-by-line revenue of the profit and loss, Page Six, as you can see, we have a decrease in net interest, which is down 16.6%, but if we don't consider the one-off of the previous quarter, the decrease is lower. In reality here the number is 783 million without &#x2013; that is without the one-off, is a 170 million decrease.</p>
          <p>The net fees are growing quarter-on-quarter. This is quite a good result, also because if you consider the seasonality, is a good number. The trading income, slightly down on the previous quarter, which has been quite exceptional, but if we consider the non-recurring gains we had in the second quarter in corporate center, which we spoke when we presented the results. CIB is still doing quite well, despite the very relevant de-risking we have done in CIB, which is a very important element.</p>
          <p>Page Seven, a drill-down on the net interest. You can see that the decrease in reality is lower if you don't consider the one-off we had in the second quarter and the overdraft interest and this is a mainly related to three elements, lower trading-related interest. So you have to consider always that the trading profit in CIB has to been seen together the net interest margin we have in CIB as well.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the significant reduction there has been in Euribor. We had the significant deposit base in Italy mainly, which with the lowering of interest rates as well as significant reduction in terms of contribution. Clearly, we are completely open to an eventual increase of interest rates in terms of sensitivity to the rates. So clearly, this is &#x2013; position us positively when the cycle will regain momentum.</p>
          <p>As I was saying, we continue to reduce our loan base. We are working on all the different areas and the focus is clearly always on the less profitable customers in terms of contribution of the overall relation. Here we have a breakdown of the reduction. We had &#x2013; we are working everywhere and we show as well the corporate center. Corporate center are mainly the special credit portfolio we have in Germany, which had a significant reduction. We continue to reduce our exposure on these non-strategic portfolios.</p>
          <p>We went down as well on CIB. We have also to consider that in CIB, we have moved the assets of the famous ABS portfolio, which has been moved. And also the banking bond portfolio, we have re-classified in the third quarter of last year. So today, these are in the loan receivable in the meanwhile are repaid or are sold. We have this reduction of the overall exposure. Clearly, this is also one of the reasons why we have a reduction in the net interest margin in CIB.</p>
          <p>Retail is mainly due to the mortgage portfolio, where we had a significant repayment and the new activity has been lowered by cause in the sense that today, the positive marginality of this product is pretty low, and so is a matter of capital allocation. In the CEE region, we had a reduction mainly in Hungary, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Russia and Bosnia. And this explains the reduction in the loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>If we go on to the net commissions, here we have split, net commission coming from investment services and other net commissions. As you can see, we have a positive trend on the commissions coming from investment services. Clearly this is due to the improvement of the financial markets, which is quite an important element in terms of management fees, but as well of upfront fees, but mainly management fees. And the other net commissions are also improving, thanks to the introduction of the commitment fees, plus a slight improvement also in GTB in the transactional area, where clearly the slight improvement in the global trade is supporting the number.</p>
          <p>Cost, on the cost side, we continue to reduce. I think it's quite important that we have a significant reduction in both in western countries and in the CEE region. Quarter-on-quarter, the staff costs are slightly up, also because in the second quarter, we had a one-off on release of 2008 over-accruals. And also we have an accrual of the compensation schemes due to the good results we are having in some areas of the Group. So clearly, we are accruing the incentivation scheme.</p>
          <p>You see, I think, is very important also the reduction we have in the other costs is also partially due to a lower infra-group VAT. But this chart is very important. You can see here we have a sort of connection, Page 11. We have a sort of connection of the cost with the staff base. We went down in terms of staff both in Western Europe and in Central Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Quite clearly, the improvement we are seeing in Central Eastern Europe in terms of market conditions ask us to start to rethink to some investment in the area, because we cannot lose. The opportunities can come from the improvements we are seeing in the market.</p>
          <p>So in the future, you will not see a continuity of this decreased trend, because in some countries, clearly, we have consider to restart to invest in terms of employees and branches mainly. Clearly, we will continue to reduce in quarters, but again, I think that the trend both in Western Europe and in Central Eastern Europe is quite relevant.</p>
          <p>If we move to the following page, Page 12, you will see that the reduction in terms of staff since the beginning of the year is above 8,000 people. So it's quite significant. In the third quarter, we had also a reduction close to 1,600 people in the Group. And you have to consider that in 2010, we do expect a further reduction of 3,800 people, which were already announced and have been also charged with the industrial plan. So there, you &#x2013; nothing new in terms of further staff reduction, but we think that is quite important, because this will continue to reduce as a cost base at the Group level.</p>
          <p>We are having a very good contribution from all of the entities in the different &#x2013; entities and central functions during the year. In the third quarter, you will see that there is a small growth in the corporate centers when you will see the detail of the number. This is due to the fact that in the third quarter in Germany, we hire apprentices, which is a stable activity we have in Germany, is quite good in terms of introduction of young talent at the Group level.</p>
          <p>Next chart is &#x2013; and we start to see the loan loss provisions. As I said, in the second quarter, we had the peak, the maximum level in terms of loan loss provision. The third quarter is lower, would be even lower without Kazakhstan. In Kazakhstan, we are going through a cleaning-up of the portfolio. We have this &#x20AC;249 million of provisioning and the cost of risk without Kazakhstan would be 1.9 billion. The cost would be as well in terms of percentage point, 134 basis point, with a reduction in all the areas, because if you consider retail would go down from 117 to 91, CIB from 169 to 148. Central Eastern Europe would go down from 210 to 160, is at 280 with this Kazakhstan one-off and high level provisioning.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, this is a repetition of the chart. I think it is very important to say that the coverage ratio at the NPL is going slightly down at 62.7, is quite an high level, while in the other impaired loans, went slightly up from 27 to 27.4%. So the coverage ratio is quite comfortable and also the generic reserve went up during the quarter.</p>
          <p>There is a slowdown in terms of deterioration of the portfolio. We have the growth of impaired loans, which has been 7.8%, vis-&#xE0;-vis the 10.7 we had in the previous quarter. And this deceleration is visible both in gross non-performing loan on as well as in other impaired loans. The slowdown is in all the geographic areas of presence, including Central Eastern Europe, net of Kazakhstan.</p>
          <p>This is quite a simple chart. We explain how we move from the operating profit to the net income. As you can see, the tax rate is slightly lower than the expected one. You have to consider on a yearly base a tax rate which is close to 36% on an annual base. This is the position you have to consider during the year.</p>
          <p>We had a very good improvement in terms of capital ratios. The capital ratios, Basel II went up in terms of Core Tier I from 6.85 to 7.55, in terms of Tier I ratio, from 7.66 to 8.39, in terms of total capital ratio, from 11.33 to 12.08. If we would do a pro forma with the capital increase, as you can see, the quarter one would be at 8.39.</p>
          <p>The risk-weighted asset went down by 5.5% due to the different elements, earnings, clearly the decreasing of the available for sales reserve and the risk weighted asset, which are down quite significantly in the market area and driven by the lower volatility and improved credit spread, but as well in the credit risk weighted asset, where we went down by 4.6%, mainly in CIB.</p>
          <p>We continue the deleverage of the balance sheet. You can see the reduction of total assets. We went down another 2.5%, so today, we are more or less 90 billion lower than the number we had at the end of December '08, which is quite a significant reduction. And we are showing on the right side of the chart some key indicators.</p>
          <p>The trading assets are down at 146 billion, so have been further more reduced. The net interbank is down 27 billion. This also partially explains the reduction in the net interest margin. Clearly, we have deleveraged the balance sheet and we don't have any carry trade position. The loan to deposit ratio is down at 96% on a comparable base with our other main competitors. This number is improving the bond on the liability side, so is quite a comfortable position. Again, the balance sheet is ready to take any opportunity will come from the recovery of the real economy.</p>
          <p>In terms of tangible equity, we are slightly up in absolute terms but as well in terms of tangible equity per share, which is another key element, because during the crisis, we always went up. The leverage ratio is significantly going down. You have to consider that this is a number before any &#x2013; on netting on the derivative side, which is quite important, as you know. In terms of International Accounting Standard, there are different implementations, so this leverage ratio is with our International Accounting Standard, not with the U.S. GAAP. So we are, I think, in a very strong position with a slimmer balance sheet structure which is ready for growth.</p>
          <p>So if we consider our sales through the cycle, summarizing, we have a net interest income which is geared to recovery with 100 basis point of parallel shift of the rate curve, we would have around 500 million of positive impact on our balance sheet. The commissions show room for improvement. Today, we are seeing a starting of shift towards mutual funds, also the asset mix is still less profitable than pre-crisis.</p>
          <p>The cost, we have a constant improvement in terms of cost base since December '07, we went down by 10,000 people and we have other almost 4,000 people, 3,800 people scheduled for next year. In Central Eastern Europe, where we are &#x2013; we think we do see a growth in terms of GDP in 2010 of at least 1% in terms of weighted average. So we think that Central Eastern Europe will start to increase the contribution to the Group quite soon. And in terms of capital and leverage, as we said, we have a Core Tier 1 pro forma which is close to 8.4%, the leverage at 23. So we think that both in terms of profit and loss and in terms of balance sheet, we are ready to take the benefit from the improvement of the cycle.</p>
          <p>Now, many thanks for your attention and I am here with the CFO, Marina Natale, my deputies, Roberto Nicastro, Sergio Ermotti and Paolo Fiorentino and with the CRO, Karl Guha, as well as Federico Ghizzoni, responsible for Central Eastern Europe. So we can answer to any of your questions. Thanks a lot.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Mr. Marcello Zanardo of KBW. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning to you all. I hope that I will be able &#x2013; or you will be able to answer the question given the statement read by the CFO. The first question has to be on capital ratios really. You explained the significant risk-weighted asset reduction and in the last call, I remember that you said that in the second part of the year, you were expecting risk-weighted asset to fall by less than in the first part of the year. And there has been since December a 53 billion reduction, which is at 10% and that you detailed very well in the presentation, also customer loans down by 47 billion, so 8% fall.</p>
          <p>So given the significant improvement in the capital ratios and the further significant improvement that will come from the right issue, I was just wondering, number one, has there been any significant sudden acceleration or any changes that you didn't expect before in Q3, which has significantly improved your capital position?</p>
          <p>And the second, you mentioned a few times and rightly so, I believe, we are ready to take any balance sheet opportunity, also asking the question to Mr. Ghizzoni and to you. I mean in addition to Italy, where sooner or later rates will go up, but you have a very big franchise. You're second in Poland, first in Croatia, first in Bulgaria, fifth in Turkey now, clearly very different countries here, some with very good macro expectation, Poland, Turkey, others are a bit more uncertain.</p>
          <p>But clearly, with the capital ratios moving much upwards, we should expect a significant balance sheet pick up, especially where in country, I have Poland in mind, where you have the Tier 1 bank, yourself, PKO, very solid, well capitalized and you have other banks which have been struggling. And the competition in the deposit base remains still very fierce. So I was wondering if you could give us an idea first on risk weighted asset reduction, having in mind Basel II for cyclicality, and second, expectation on loan growth?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on cost. I mean, we read in the press that you've been speaking with your key shareholders of a significant domestic restructuring, merging five banks into the holding, we read 70,000 people. Now if these figures are correct and if you can comment on this, if not on the figures, on the direction on the cost line, my estimate would indicate if through a 5 to 6% EPS uplift to 2011 numbers and with a much more solid capital base and with the net interest income finding a bottom, the market will be clearly much more excited to buy the stock on better 2011 numbers. So if you could give us an idea where &#x2013; what you're thinking, what are the chances, how the situation is moving on the cost base, especially on the Italian domestic restructuring? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Many thanks for the two question. Loan portfolio growth, clearly, as you were stressing, we have &#x2013; and also I have stressed in my presentation, we have a very strong balance sheet, ready to take any opportunity in terms of good loan portfolio, in the sense that &#x2013; and for us, good means a combination clearly of revenues and risk implied. So we are on the market, we continue to have a strong partnership with our customer base.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we will see opportunities coming in, quote-unquote, a stronger way from Central Eastern Europe and I would say Germany as well. In Germany, we have clear opportunities, thanks to the fact that the market as we know, is changing quite a lot. Consider the Landesbank, you consider the merger of our competitors and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>But again for us, what is key is to combine risk and I would say revenues or risk weighted asset, which is the key element. We don't want to waste capital even if we have &#x2013; we are long of capital. So this is &#x2013; and we continue to be cautious in terms of new risk we assume. But you can be sure that any opportunity we have and I said before also on Central Eastern Europe, we will get the opportunity.</p>
          <p>In terms of the project for redesigning the business model in Italy, this &#x2013; the key focus on that is on further improvement, we are already at a good level, but further improvement of the customer satisfaction of our customer base. This is the key focus of the project. Thanks to this project, we are sure that we will improve even more this service level, because we will have on one side also an improvement in terms of proximity for as medium size enterprises that will be followed by the strategic business area, family and SMEs, so that we will have a proximity benefit for them.</p>
          <p>We will have a further growth of the private banking area, because all the customer above &#x20AC;500,000 will be fine in a move and this is not only in Italy, across Europe, so that also in Germany and Austria, to the private banking division. This would be already the threshold map. As we know, we have a significant portion of the customers that are still in the family business area.</p>
          <p>Thanks to that, we can also redesign the network, thanks to the integration of the three banks. We can also redesign the network in order to have an enlargement of the responsibility of the colleagues who are closer to the territories and on top of that, clearly, we will have an efficiency gain at the Group level. I already said that in the last year plan, we have these 4,000 people that are already charged. When the project will be finalized at the broader level and so on and so forth, so we will be also more detailed on the benefit we can have in terms of bottom-line. But as I said before, the key focus of the project is a further customer satisfaction improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just to understand, sorry, on the risk weighted asset evolution, because I was very surprised on the positive side by the fall and the very strong capital ratios. I mean, can you help us, giving some indication, because you guided us to be a bit more cautious in the last call to a fall and yet the fall has increased &#x2013; I mean again, what has changed? I have seen &#x2013; I have seen the detail in the presentation, the AFS reduction and so on.</p>
          <p>But what should we expect assuming Basel II pro-cyclicality and all other elements? You are cautious on not taking market share at this point; so really to try to understand, because this is quite an important element, because that's where you can have some control on offsetting the weak deposit spreads, mainly in Italy, on the NII. So if you really think market share is good market share with the capital, you can clearly offset that.</p>
          <p>And second, I mean, I understand the principle what you are telling me, but again, it would be very helpful to see since when you think given the macro, given your capital position which is clearly stronger, now you can start pushing loans, having in mind asset quality, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The key focus for us the revenues on risk-weighed asset. So it's not a matter of decreasing or increasing significantly the risk-weighted asset, also because we do expect an improvement of the cycle. But today, it's not yet quite solid, the improvement of the cycle in terms of asset quality. I'm not talking of us, I am talking of the industry for us as we have seen &#x2013; we are seeing a lowering of the duration.</p>
          <p>But &#x2013; so the key focus is to remix the risk-weighted asset, having the same risk-weighted asset with an improvement of the revenues on them. We have also to consider that a significant portion of the reduction we had in the third quarter is due to the market risk, which is almost one-third of the total reduction. The lowering we had on the business side in terms of risk-weighted asset is mainly related to CIB, with also a reduction in the loan &#x2013; the portfolio we have reclassified. So this is also related to that.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we do expect to have a small growth in terms of risk-weighted asset. But again, it is a mix of different elements. Clearly, now we are working on the budget for next year and considering the capital base, as I said before, we'll take any good opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a very final, simple question, the new disclosure with the CIB now, this is the new disclosure you will use going forward, so you will not show corporate Italy any more or corporate Germany?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think &#x2013; clearly, one of the issue we are facing is that why we will highlight any major issues related to domestic items, for example, looking at Germany, without considering the fact that out of Germany, we are running the fast or fairly pan-European Global business. It would be a misleading figures, more and more, to quote this number as a reflection of the German economy. Therefore, happy to provide you trends on single country, but the view you had before considering the restructuring , the reorganization of CIB doesn't make sense any longer.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. Three quick questions from me. The first one is on the new CIB Division. You don't provide any more the breakdown between the Corporate Division and the MIB Division. Just wondering what is the rationale for putting all these divisions together and whether you're going to give us any breakdown in the future?</p>
          <p>The second one again is on the capital position, we've seen a decrease in the AFS, I'm just wondering whether you can give us an indication as to your number for these? And also, we've seen a decrease of 12 billion in corporate loans, I'm just wondering whether this is a big position or whether there is anything structural here?</p>
          <p>And finally on the cost of risk, we've seen a positive trend in retail with the cost of risk decreasing from 146 to 108 basis points. In the corporate sector, I'm just wondering whether you can give us the breakdown by region, i.e. Italy and Germany and Austria, which I can't find. And also if you can give us any view on the cost of risk in the CEE region, with particular interest on Turkey, where the cost of risk was 307 basis points in the third quarter? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I mentioned before, clearly by the fact that we have evolved the business model by merging the corporate division and the MIB division, by default, we will not represent a P&amp;L view of something that doesn't reflect the dynamics on how we manage the organization and we manage clients' relationship.</p>
          <p>The scope is very clear. We are breaking down de facto into four main products that are serving our customer base, being financing and advisory activity, where we have all the loan businesses from plain vanilla to structured loans, all the advisory businesses and principle investment activity. We will &#x2013; we have the transaction banking unit, which was all cash management and trading &#x2013; structured trade finance and trade finance activity, as well as deposits. We have our leasing operation and then we have all market, capital market-related activity, basically access to financial markets and servicing corporate clients.</p>
          <p>So in that respect, the way we are then breaking down, the coverage groups around the countries, Germany, Italy, Austria and financial institution group are basically distribution channels and that's the way we are organizing going forward and that's the way we will report. Of course, any time we see any major trend, we will highlight these things and for sure, on occasions like this one and one-on-one, we can answer any specific question you may have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The improvement in the available for sale reserve is mainly due to the improvement in the market and we can, let's say, split it in to three different components. 50% is mainly driven by our bad debt, while 25% is driven by our shareholding and the remaining 25% by &#x2013; driven by our equity investment. So one of the main components is for sure the development of general stock price.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>For the question that you raised with respect to the overall provision numbers, this is the breakdown as you would like to have. Retail for third quarter is 405. The way it decomposes is Italy is 323, HVB is 18 and Austria or BA is 63. CIB is 1,143, the way it would decompose, Italy is 543, HVB is 321 and BA is 80. And then you have to add private banking, which is effectively 2 million. Then for CEE region, total including Poland is 575, excluding Poland is 540 so therefore Poland is 35, adding to a total of 2,124. The remainder effectively is in GBS, 41 million in GBS related Central &#x2013; and then the corporate center is 20 million. So when you add that whole thing up, it's 2,184. That's the number that is reported for the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a follow-up question on the capital position. I asked for the decrease in the corporate loan book, which was 12 billion in the third quarter. I am just wondering whether you can comment on this and also give us any figure for the value-added risk, which has decreased significantly? We see the same trend for the French banks. What we've been told by the French banks is that actually the value-added risk will increase back again in the fourth quarter. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, on the 11 billion reduction on the CIB loans, as Alessandro Profumo mentioned before, you have to take in consideration that at least a third, around a third is basically due to amortization and repayment of loan and receivables, securities classified under loan and receivable.</p>
          <p>Then you have for sure also the effect of the migration to impaired loans, then you have the deleveraging, that we are taking selective areas in non-core countries or non-core clients, and last but not least, I think I would say that it is clear that many of our clients are using cash to repay loans and they are not really reinvesting and you can see it also from the drop in our deposits on the CIB side. So overall, this is the three main areas in which you can justify the decrease on the loan book.</p>
          <p>When you look at VAR, I do not expect any major increase of our VAR number in the last &#x2013; in this quarter, at least for the current &#x2013; as we speak today, due to the fact that the effect of the lower volatility of this year coming into the rest of the year &#x2013; into the rest of the quarter and the still ongoing deleveraging and derisking that we are running should not translate into major increases of our VAR.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, good morning to everyone. Just two very quick questions. First of all, on the net negative interbank position, which has much improved in the quarter. I think it is now about half of what it was in the second quarter and the fourth, what it was at the end of last year, I guess this is driven by the deleveraging and the reduction in market assets. But I was wondering, what is the target there? Does it indicate wants to be totally independent from interbank markets going forward?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if it is possible to have a little bit more color on the developments in the asset quality in Germany? Clearly the cost of risk was very low in retail, I think about 15 basis points. What is -- is this a recurrent level and what is happening in corporate as well, given that in the second quarter, there was a spike in provisions above 200 basis points? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On net interbank position, we work a lot in order to shrink the level of our net interbank, but nowadays we are working in order to develop the next year budget and let's say, a longer-term view and so it's very difficult to give you a target or a level we are aiming to achieve there and it will be a function of the business appetite in term of growth. For sure, let's say, we are keeping an eye on the leverage ratio. Also take into account the stricter rule which will be introduced in term also leverage ratio, and we are, for sure, keeping an eye on this specific KPI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of overall cost of risk in Germany, we have an improvement both in retail and corporate retail. The asset quality is quite good. You remember that after the acquisition of HVB, we went through a significant reduction of the portfolio. So, and we also strategically decided to continue to be present in the mortgage business, mainly via Planet Home, our subsidiary, which is serving the customer base as an open platform for mortgages. We think it has been the right choice there.</p>
          <p>Clearly in CIB, we have seen an improvement in the quarter, but it is more related to single names as well to partial write-backs. We think that the write-back area will be a very important area in the future clearly, because we had a significant provisioning until now. And clearly if the cycle will start to improve, hopefully we will be able via our activity also to bring back the customer in the performing area and clearly, this is another very important element.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Ronny Rehn of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, everyone. Brief question from my end. I shall try. First on the net interest margin, do you see further burdens in Q4 or should we have seen the trough at this level? And secondly, could you give us any color on NPL coverage by region? In particular, I would be interested in Eastern Europe. Thirdly, how has Q4 sort of come along so far? That would be interesting particular on the trading line?</p>
          <p>And then a bit more, two strategic questions. First, do you see any moves from the regulator to tighten liquidity regulations either in Eastern Europe or in your developed market exposures, in Italy, Germany, Austria? And once more on the capital level, what's sort of the level we should work with going forward? I mean 8.4% pro forma to capital increase is sort of the level we've probably been looking for and more retained earnings, I shall think will come through. Should we take this as the new level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting from net interest margin, clearly, it's quite related, as we said, to interest rates. So we don't see think that the Euribor will continue to go down on -- so. Clearly we are not far from zero, just to be clear and as we said, we have a significant sensitivity to an eventual increase of interest rates. In general terms, we don't see further reduction.</p>
          <p>So clearly, on the reclassified assets, with the repayment or with the pull to par, which goes to the net interest margin so &#x2013; which means a net interest margin in CIB, we can have some reduction due to the fact that the portfolios are expiring so &#x2013; and is not any more replicated.</p>
          <p>I want to say a very important element. We have decided, as I said before, not to invest or not to take further risk when the spread were incredibly large because &#x2013; so you can see also that the trading &#x2013; the portfolio within CIB is going down. This is very, very important, because it is current with what we said in terms of a consistent reduction of the risk profile of the Group. This is quite important.</p>
          <p>Before leaving the floor to Karl Guha on the coverage ratio, I have to say two things. We cannot answer, as you can imagine, on the fourth quarter and on the capital increase, we have been very clear at the beginning of the presentation. On the regulatory changes, it is important to say that there will be not a single country regulatory change. We are talking of European regulation on one side, mainly by the capital requirement directive on one side, so talking of European regulation and what the CEBS [Committee of European Banking Supervisors], future EBA, European Banking Authority, will put in place. This is for Europe.</p>
          <p>And then, as you know, there is a Basel Committee, which is working on a new overall framework in terms of regulation. The expectation is that by the year end, there will be a sort of overall framework. There will be an impact assessment during 2010 and then the regulation will be implemented in 2011, 2012. This is quite important, because we don't expect regulation country-by-country. But in Europe, we expect to talk of European regulation. And the Basel Committee will come with this framework by the year end in order to define &#x2013; not to define, to have the impact assessment of the overall regulatory framework.</p>
          <p>I think it is very important what we have seen before in terms of our numbers. On one side, the leverage ratio, which is significantly low, on the other side, the loan-to-deposit ratio and the interbank position. It is not our aim to go down to zero in terms of interbank position. We have to be very clear on that. On the contrary, because we are a market player and it is important for us to optimize the structure of the balance sheet. So clearly, we think that we are very well-positioned also in relative terms when we talk of eventual new regulation. Now, I'll leave the floor to Karl Guha...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>May I ask one question in between, just on the regulation just to close on that issue? We know about capital regulation, that it will come and it will increase capital requirements and we are just waiting for a new level, et cetera. And you've done a lot to get there. Do we have to expect anything on the liquidity, because as you say, it will be on a European level. We have seen quite strict proposals from the U.K. side, and is there anything you hear and then any impact you see for UniCredit coming from tighter liquidity regulation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, we are already working with four different liquidity pool. In U.K., we have a very specific position because on one side, there are many branches of American investment banks, so I think in terms of regulation, there has been some specific issue. So again, today, we are still very far from having a very clearly defined new regulation, because I think that Europe will be something and what is outside of Europe will be something that's, I am talking of European Union. But today, again, we are far from that.</p>
          <p>Within Europe, personally, I can't expect even an improvement on our side, because today as I said, there are these four different liquidity pool. There are also talks in terms of recognition of the concept of European Banking Group, which would facilitate the intra-group liquidity within the European Union, again. But sorry, the discussion is still so open that in my opinion, today, it is impossible to foresee changes. As I said, today, we think that in any case, we are very well positioned. So I don't see more fragmentation than the one we have today. In the case, I can see some reduction or fragmentation and also, you have to consider that there will be three elements working together; one, capital liquidity, and leverage ratio. And on the thrift side, we think that we are well positioned.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The starting comment that I would make about coverage ratio is that &#x2013; is the following, that the overall group number that you have taken has a huge influence of Italy. Italy is roughly 62% of the overall impaired asset, so therefore, that has a bearing in terms of the group numbers. Now the decomposition, firstly, if you look at the total group, the number for non-performing, per se, is 62.7 for group. For Italy, that number is 64%. For HVB, it's 52.3%. For BA, excluding obviously the Bank Austria excluding CEE, the coverage ratio is close &#x2013; sorry, is 68.5%. Then if we look at Poland, it's 85.2% and CEE individually is 64.8%. Now when we look into the CEE &#x2013; okay.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'll stick to the two questions. First of all in CIB, in your trading line, I just had, what is the benefit, if at all, of any mark ups on your structured credit portfolio? And also in your reduction on that credit portfolio, have you actually done any asset sale or it seem to adjust amortization and if you have, kind of &#x2013; in what kind of prices are you able to recover on that portfolio?</p>
          <p>Any my second question is on net interest income. Thanks very much for the sensitivity to interest rate. That is significant. I guess that is coming from the commercial banking business. Can you give us an indication of the total contribution in NII, which came in the course of 2009 from your MIB division related to some of your trading strategies, which we should be consider as one-off in those numbers for the nine months? And also, corporate center within NII is back to a negative charge of about 240 million. What does that relate to? How should we be looking at it? It was actually zero almost in Q2. Have you had some additional funding cost or is that not representative, maybe if you can just give us a feel of how your funding costs are behaving, that would be great? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first of all, on the &#x2013; I would say that around 70, 80% of the reduction is due to amortization. We have also been taking an opportunity to sell assets that we are pricing outside our expected risk parameter and also expected return. So I would say around 70 to 80% is amortization and repayments and the rest is active reduction. The contribution to the overall trading activity results is, I would &#x2013; is around 40%, is due to that. I think the faster acceleration of the tightening of spreads is creating clearly an opportunity in that respect that we are taking on with this 20, 30% proactive reduction before expiration or amortizations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So around 40% will be around 300 million this quarter from markups or benefit from sales? From structured credit portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good guess. That's a good guess.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the corporate center, you asked about the level of our NII margin. So we &#x2013; as we discussed last time, there has been some one-off event which, let's say, jeopardizes the natural development of the figure. So the one we recorded in the second quarter was not inordinately inflated by this one-off element. So we should expect as a run rate level slightly negative, but not of the order of magnitude we are seeing in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And third, the one-off negative are some specific funding that you put out, how should we read that? That has been more expensive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there are no specific issue, only, let's say, accounting adjustment related to relationship with third parties, but in term of transfer rate with the division, no specific issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, broadly we should be seeing your cost of funding broadly as improving in any case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that implied that and the net interest income in MIB, which should be considered as non-recurrent, that has been booked in the nine months 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we say several times in the past, these dynamics between NII and trading line keeps changing quarter-by-quarter. I cannot give you a clear trend, an indication. Of course, when you look at the overall returns on the trading and the NII, line we have some effect of clearly dilution on the NII line because of basically the yield curve is flattening and certain strategy that we had in this line are not there any longer. But I can't every quarter, last &#x2013; second quarter changed in a different way than the first quarter and this quarter, we have again a deterioration on the NII line, which is benefiting on the trading side. So it is not possible to extract a clear trend.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Pascal Decque of Natixis. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning everyone. I have also three questions. First, you mentioned a number for the loss of net interest income for the end of overdraft fee, 131 million. I didn't notice or I didn't get it, so how much you were able to recover in fees of other quarter and how much do you plan to recover on finally medium-term?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding the reclassified asset, IAS 39. Could you give us the number of the so-called shadow P&amp;L into the beginning? I mean, the amount of mark-to-mark-to-market you managed to avoid on these assets since Q3 '08 accumulated, please?</p>
          <p>And the last one is the exact number of your market risk-weighted assets knowing that they should potentially be multiplied by three by the regulator's demand at the end of 2010, had &#x2013; I had &#x20AC;19 billion, my last number? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for &#x2013; on the reclassified assets-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I will start. The recovery of the overdraft commission is more or less 50%, we have been able to have and this is a sort of running rate. Clearly, it's quite important to say that today, we have a market condition which is similar to the one we have in other countries with the commitment fees. So this is what we have been able to record there. On the mark-to-market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'll give you two figures in order to clarify, also reconcile the numbers. First of all, at Group level, Group level, we booked around 231 million of profits from pull to par and gains from sales of reclassified assets and we had also a deduction to write-downs on loans, for some of these assets were being impaired or are partially impaired. So 231 for the total Group, while for CIB, CIBs around 210 million.</p>
          <p>When you look at the basically unrealized gains that we would had made if those assets were still on &#x2013; held for trading, we would have made around 540 million this year in &#x2013; at Group level and 497 at CIB level. Overall, overall, we still have unrealized reclassification positive effect of 1.544 millions -1.544 billion at Group level and 1.461 billion at CIB level.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>On the new regulation, we think that it is almost impossible today to say what would be the impact, because really, there are still so many open issues that in my opinion, we have really to wait to the year end in order to see the framework and then we have to consider that there will be an impact assessment.</p>
          <p>Today, one of the worries is due to the fact that clearly, if there will be significant changes in the regulation, first of all, based on the Basel II concept and not implemented in U.S., you will create an incredible competitive advantage to the American investment bank on one side. And on the other side, you can have a significant reduction of the lending activity to the real economy, which is one of the main worries today all the authorities dwell, because you can increase the pro-cyclicality of the regulation.</p>
          <p>So personally, I am really against any calculation without having the stable new regulation. So clearly, we are making internal exercise, but in my opinion, it's completely wrong to work on that, because we can increase the pro-cyclicality of the regulation, which would damage not the industry, but the overall economy. So I think that really, it is very important to have the impact assessment made in quite a professional way at the system level and then to see what will happen with the effective new regulation in order to avoid that the pro-cyclicality will be even more increased.</p>

          <p>Good morning. I have two questions. The first one is on net interest income, that was 4 billion in the third quarter. I see the consensus for 2010 is at 18 billion and I feel uncomfortable, because it's, in my opinion, too optimistic. My question is if you share this view or you can give any qualitative comment?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on Kazakhstan, if you have any argument, anecdotal evidence to support the fact that the provisions are one-off and will not be, let's say, repeated in the last quarter or in next quarter? So thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to everybody. I have just one question on the Italian asset quality. On the corporate side, putting together Slide 60 and Slide 38, I have calculated &#x2013; and this is a rough calculation, that the cost of risk in the Italian corporate is in the region of 125 basis points in the nine months. I have calculated in Italian retail, more or less in the nine months, 100 basis points, weighted average 110, 115.</p>
          <p>I was wondering whether you can &#x2013; whether you agree on 125 basis points in Italian corporate, considering that we don't have any more the underlying loans of this? And secondly, this &#x2013; if this number is correct, it seems to be much higher than the numbers that other Italian peers have reported so far in the nine months. And I was wondering what could be the explanation of this and how you see evolving the asset quality in Italy? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the cost of risk of Italian &#x2013; Italy on the corporate side is around 150.Yeah absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For the nine months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So effectively, if you look into the Italian corporate base, it's a number that I gave at the very beginning of it. So what that means for CIB for Italy is 543 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but we don't &#x2013; okay, sorry, sir. And-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we compare with the others, I think that you are right. On one side, we have a portion of our provisions that are model based, so &#x2013; and we have a model which is very reactive to the cycle. I think that it would be proper to see the average cost of risk on a longer timeframe, personally, through the cycle, because I think that to see the number on a shorter base is, in our opinion, not proper. We think that our portfolio is at least as the one of the others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just to be clear, provided &#x2013; assuming there is an economic recovery and considering that you stated your model is very reactive to the economic cycle. If there is an economic recovery, should we expect in the future write-backs if the situation really improves, just to be clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If the situation really improved, PDNA will go down so that we will have a lower provisioning requirement, this is pretty clear. As I said, we have to go through the cycle in order to see all the facts, because &#x2013; all the facts of this modeling, because unless that we miss pieces of that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's all right. Firstly, on the dividend, I was wondering if you can confirm there have been no accrual year-to-date? Secondly, on the 500 million guidance for &#x2013; or sensitivity for a 100 basis points move, is this the benefit from solely on the customer spread or does it include a potential reduction in net interest income of &#x2013; in what was previously the MIB division? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no accrual, because as we said, any decision would be taken by the Board after the year end for the dividend and the 500 million of sensitivities on the overall balance sheet of the group.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just two questions. On the sensitivities on interest rates, I understand it's very difficult to give us specific indication how much of the contribution of net interest income is coming from hedging, but can you give us an idea what proportion of your retail and current accounts is that? And then second question, a follow-up or curiosity on Kazakhstan. I understand that there was a clean-up this quarter affecting the results. Is the clean-up anyhow related or linked with the rumors that the government could introduce more stricter limits for foreign banks? And more in general, if that happens, would that impact to your strategy in the country? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For sure, the sensitivity, let's say, I cannot give you the detail about retail corporate. But looking at region, let's say, the Italian &#x2013; the Italy part will contribute in a significant way to this contribution based on our internal calculations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Kazakhstan, the eventual new introduction of this regulation will favor us, because clearly this means that who is already in to have a certain value. The one that want to enter cannot enter, so it would be more and more difficult for them to come in or they have to buy the one already owned by foreign players. So in our perspective, this is potentially a good news, because we are there and there are no changes for no expected changes for the one who are already there.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Central Eastern Europe asset quality, yes, if we look also this quarter, we, net of Kazakhstan, we start to see already an improvement in terms of cost of risk. So we are not expecting in other countries any clean-up. Also in countries difficult like Ukraine, we think current situation is by far under control. We are very happy about the portfolio in Russia. In general terms we think the quality of our asset is average good, it may be also better than some competitors. So I am expecting rather an improvement than the opposite.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning to everybody. Just two follow-ups actually, one is on the NII. I'm looking at the Slide Seven. I was wondering whether you can give us, whether you can break down actually the reduction of the NII quarter-on-quarter. How much is due to volumes, how much is due to spread, how much is due actually to the amortization of the reclassified assets you mentioned before?</p>
          <p>And then just a little bit more color on the asset quality. I know that you are &#x2013; on the capital increase you can't, I mean, give any guidance on it. But I'm just wondering whether you can expand a little bit. Would you consider the peak already happened in Q2? Would you say that asset quality in Italy is little bit normalizing. You said before, you commented positively before the situation in Austria. So just a little bit more color on the retail SME segment? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On NII, shall we take Page Seven that you can split this 470 million, more or less, one-third in the trading portfolio, one-third in the corporate center and one-third in the commercial banking. Marina already commented the corporate center and Sergio, the CAB area.</p>
          <p>On the commercial banking, it is almost 100% due to deposit and so in reality, deposit is slightly more than one-third with a small offset on the lending side. And on the deposits as well, we have the spread effect, which is more or less 180 million, offset by 20 million by volumes. And on the loan side, we have a 30 million negative volume effect and 60 million positive spread effect on the commercial banking side.</p>
          <p>Talking of the amortization of reclassified assets, it has been more or less &#x2013; has been new trade. As you can see there are the pull to par on one side and the reduction of the assets on the other side. Talking about asset quality, as we said, we consider the second quarter as the maximum level we have achieved in terms of cost of risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you say &#x2013; I am sorry, just a follow-up, would you say that is going to be stable for at least another couple of quarters or you see further any normalization there, especially in Italy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yes, just something very quickly on Kazakhstan, you mentioned the one-off that explains the higher provisions. Can you expand a little bit on what is the one-off, given that you are actually writing off nearly 10% of your loan book in the quarter? So what has happened that has actually materialized in Q3? And has anything of that about changed the view on your presence in Kazakhstan or any change at all there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have &#x2013; in Kazakhstan, we went through the last few months to a deep analysis of the loan portfolio. And substantially in this quarter, we have decided to improve the overall coverage ratio. So what is very important to stress is that we know very well what is the situation of the portfolio. We have isolated critical loans and we are now in a process of restructuring and recovering of these identified problematic loans.</p>
          <p>Large part of the banks is performing quite well. Talking about business, the new business is promising. As Mr. Profumo said before, we are now quite relatively good position compared to the situation, if we look at the situation of the other banks, we are improving in term of business. We have increasing level of deposits coming to us. The bank has repaid the more than half of the funding since the beginning of the year to the Group. So the process is to really tackle and clean up the identified bad portfolios. That is any case below a certain number I have seen &#x2013; I have written in the past. So we are in the range of 30, 40%, the total portfolio. The rest is good portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the change in risk management that you have enacted, was that anything different that you're doing in any other countries or something specific to Kazakhstan that required this reclassification of the loan portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, simply again, we have decided to increase the coverage after having done further deep analysis on the portfolio. There is no difference compared to other countries in term of methodologies. We have now exactly the same. The only difference is that we have put in place a dedicated tax force in order to tackle these loans, in order to go quicker for a restructuring and recovery, also leverage on the fact that we are expecting for 2010 a recovery on the overall economy and this will favor the process of restructuring. It's not just recovery. Restructuring is very important. We have increased, for example, the level of collaterals in the last couple of quarters. Nevertheless, again, we decided to increase the overall coverage.</p>

          <p>As I said, in this moment, we don't see any need of further injection in term of equity. Also looking the first number, for the value 2010, we have a confirmation of what I'm saying, so no equity injection foreseen.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you. And you mentioned that around half of the funding from the parent had been repaid this year. Could you tell us roughly what the amount that is downstreamed as funding liquidity to ATF is as of Q3?</p>

          <p>Well, the funding was above 1 billion beginning of this year, is below &#x2013; is around half a billion now, but is in decreasing trend. So I'm expecting a further decrease of the funding from the Group to the company. We said we have an increasing level of deposit coming to us due to the difficulties of the other banks. So funding to me is not an issue for Kazakhstan.</p>
