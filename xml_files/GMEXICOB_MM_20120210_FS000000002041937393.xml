        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today on Grupo M&#xE9;xico's fourth quarter and full-year 2011 earnings conference call. Joining me today is Octavio Ornelas, CFO of Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano; Jorge Pulido, Head of our Investor Relations; and other executives of the company.</p>
          <p>On today's conference call, I will first briefly comment on the economic environment of this quarter and the main issues impacting the company's profitability. Then, I'll comment on our Mining division and most relevant results, to pass on the call to Octavio, who will explain the financial results of our Transportation division.</p>
          <p>As you all know, towards the end of 2011, we saw lower prices for copper and molybdenum as for other metals, which is mostly attributable to the global economic uncertainty, especially the European debt crisis and lower global growth expectations. We believe copper prices will remain macro driven in the short-term. However, copper fundamentals remain one of the most solid in the entire commodity sector.</p>
          <p>During 2011, we saw copper destocking in both Europe and Asia. However, the recent rebound in Chinese orders indicates the recovery of consumption in this country. Demand from emerging economies is also growing at a good pace, offsetting lower consumption from the European markets.</p>
          <p>On the supply side, production underperformed in 2011 due to labor unrest, power shortages, adverse weather conditions and ore grade deterioration. We believe these events could continue to a lesser extent in 2012, maintaining tightness in the copper market. For 2012, here U.S. could meet supply growth of 2.2% on a market deficit between 300,000 to 400,000 tons.</p>
          <p>In addition, we believe many of the new projects in the world have high costs and will require high sustained copper prices to yield positive returns. This implies that just to maintain market balance prices might have a new floor.</p>
          <p>Turning to Grupo M&#xE9;xico's financial figures, we're happy to report that 2011 was a great year for the company, as we achieved many record highs in our financial results, including revenues, EBITDA and net earnings, both as a consolidated group and each division on its own.</p>
          <p>We also reached a record number in capital expenditures of USD 1.2 billion, which is very important as this investment will result in significant production increases and even lower costs in the coming years. And we anticipate these good results will continue in 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Consolidated revenues for 2011 were a record high of USD 10.4 billion, an increase of 25% year-over-year. This increase is mainly due to higher metal prices and higher copper production volumes in Buenavista, combined with increase of 14% in the revenue generated by our Transportation division.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales for 2011 were USD 5.1 billion, an increase of 21% on a year-over-year basis. This cost increase is really explained by mine maintenance, increased energy and diesel costs and higher rights of track usage in our Transportation division.</p>
          <p>The company will continue with its efforts to reduce costs, improve productivity and maintain consumption and expense discipline. Among the investments currently underway is the construction of two combined cycle power plants, which are expected to considerably reduce energy costs in Buenavista and La Caridad mines.</p>
          <p>The year's accumulated EBITDA was a record high of nearly USD 5.2 billion, an increase of 32% year-over-year. The EBITDA margin for the year reached 50%, which positively compares to the margin of 47% in 2010. For the year 2011, net income was also a record high of USD 2.4 billion, a significant increase of 50%, compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>Now turning to CapEx and to provide you a breakdown of our USD 1.2 billion investment program for 2011. Our Mining division spent USD 715 million, mostly allocated to increase production and lower operating costs. Our Transportation division spent USD 355 million, which is a significant increase of 98% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Those investments were used mostly to improve railroad infrastructure in order to increase speed, improve mine service and achieve cost-efficiencies. And in our Infrastructure division we spent USD 130 million, mainly for the construction of the two power plants in Sonora, Mexico.</p>
          <p>For 2012, we are happy to announce that the Board approved a capital investment budget of USD 2.6 billion. USD 1.7 billion are allocated to the Mining division, USD 231 to the Transportation division, and USD 636 million to our Infrastructure division, out of which USD 355 million will be invested in the acquisition of two ocean platforms, USD 236 million in the power plants, and USD 30 million in equipment for the Highway Construction project.</p>
          <p>Now, switching to our mining production, copper sales of Americas Mining Company, which as you remember consolidates our subsidiaries Southern Copper and Asarco, reached 790,103 metric tons, an increase of 13% year-over-year. This increase was mainly due to the restart of production of Buenavista, which has been operating at its maximum capacity since April, producing 172,488 tons in 2011, compared to 20,700 tons in 2010.</p>
          <p>Molybdenum sales for the year decreased 9%, compared to 2010. This was due mainly to expected lower ore grades at the Cuajone mine. At current price levels, we are seeing some production cuts, particularly from high cost Asian producers. We expect that in 2012, the balance between supply and demand will decrease the current market surplus, thereby improving market prices in the near future.</p>
          <p>Silver sales for 2011 decreased by 11% on a year-over-year basis, however, sales were 14.5% higher in the fourth quarter 2011, driven by more mineral processed at our refinery, La Caridad, as a result of the production at Buenavista. We expect this increased production to continue throughout 2012.</p>
          <p>The cash cost per ton of copper excluding byproducts was USD 1.81 per pound in 2011, compared to USD 1.63 per pound in 2010. The consolidated cash cost per pound of copper, net of byproducts was USD 0.74 per pound for 2011. This positions Americas Mining Company as an industry leader in efficiency and low cost.</p>
          <p>So, now turning to Americas Mining USD 715 million for 2011, let me break down the USD 1.7 billion for 2012. USD 747 million will be invested in the expansion of Buenavista, including the new concentrator, the SX/EW plant and mine equipment, USD 200 million will be allocated in the expansion of the mine and concentrator at Toquepala, USD 164 million will be spent for the expansion of the mine and concentrator at Cuajone, and USD 84 million for the expansion at Mission. All these investments play an important role in the five year expansion program that aims to increase copper production from 800,000 tons to 1,400,000 tons and molybdenum production from 8,500 tons to 25,500 tons.</p>
          <p>As most of you participated in the conference call of Southern Copper earlier today, I will not get into specific details of each project unless you have questions, and we'll be happy to answer those later on today.</p>
          <p>Although, I do want to mention that we have continued working in the expansion plans for Asarco as well. And I'm happy to mention that Mission expansion will expand annual production capacity at the concentrator from 66,000 to 77,500 tons of copper output, with a total of USD 60 million allocated for this project. This is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue to work on the refurbishment and reopening of the molybdenum plant at Mission. This plant will have a production capacity of 2,600 tons of molybdenum, with an investment of only USD 5 million. It is expected to start operations in the first quarter 2013.</p>
          <p>The total consolidated debt at year-end 2011 amounted to USD 3.8 billion. With a cash balance of USD 2.7 billion, that gives us a net debt of USD 1 billion. The company maintains a comfortable long-term debt amortization schedule and ample financial flexibility going forward.</p>
          <p>Our financial policy, which is reviewed on a quarterly basis by our board, is designed to maintain a strong cash flow position to support our operations, CapEx and giving Grupo ample financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities in the market, and ensure its growth.</p>
          <p>With respect to dividends, on November 27, 2011, we paid a dividend payment of $0.40 pesos per share outstanding plus a dividend payment in kind consisting of one share for every 389 shares outstanding.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter of 2011, the company's board approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.40 pesos per share outstanding. This will be paid all in cash on February 20, and represents a disbursement of approximately USD 223 million.</p>
          <p>With this, I'll pass on the call to Octavio, who will discuss the financial highlights of our Transportation division. Thank you. Octavio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Daniel. Good afternoon, everyone. In the next few minutes I will talk about the main developments during the fourth quarter and full year results for our Transportation division, represented by the holding company Infraestructura y Transportes M&#xE9;xico ITM, and its main subsidiaries, which are Ferromex and Ferrosur.</p>
          <p>ITM's load volumes transported during this year, during 2011, measured in net tons-kilometers, were 52.2 billion, very similar to the 52.1 billion transported in 2010. The 2011 volumes were affected &#x2013; negatively affected by the Agricultural segment, given the internal crop damages during the first half of the year, and the behavior of the Industrial segment, in particular, beer, compensated by an importer increase of 32% in the Intermodal segment.</p>
          <p>Ferromex load volumes during the fourth quarter were 11.2 billion tons/kilometer, pretty much in line with the volumes that were observed in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>In terms of cars loaded during the fourth quarter of last year, which were moved, we moved 212,000 railcars, an increase of 4% as compared with the last quarter of 2010. And for the whole year of 2011, 856,000 cars were moved for the whole year, which meant an increase of 5% as compared to last year's figure.</p>
          <p>On the side of Ferrosur load volumes, Ferrosur set new records in all major indicators, both in the fourth quarter of last year and for the whole year.</p>
          <p>During 2011, load volumes were USD 7 <mark type="audio gap" /> (13:14) billion, 5% increase as compared to the USD 6.8 billion of 2010. In terms of cars loaded during the year, Ferrosur moved 284,000 railcars as compared to 262,000 in the previous years, which means an increase of 8.1% year-to-year.</p>
          <p>The main increases were seen in the Energy segment with PEMEX reporting an increase in net tons/kilometers by 31%, and by cars of 29%. We also have an important increase in metals of 30% in net tons/kilometers, and 19% in cars.</p>
          <p>And finally, in the Automotive segment, there was an increase of 14% in tons/kilometers and 11% in cars. For this year, we expect to move nearly 1.3 million cars and 54.2 billion tons/kilometer, representing a growth of 3.5% and 3.8%, respectively, compared with 2011. This growth is expected to be propelled mainly by the automotive sector, which is expected to grow 11% after a bad year in 2011, which is explained mainly by the effect of the tsunami in Japan.</p>
          <p>Then the siderurgical sector is expected to grow 10% due to the Deacero opening a new steel plant; the cement sector will grow 7% with new traffic from the cement company, Moctezuma; and the expectation of increased growth industry-wide due to infrastructure projects. Intermodal will increase 6% because of increased freight at Manzanillo, and the energy sector expected to grow 4% with the start of the new fuel oil traffic for PEMEX from Tula to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:12)</p>
          <p>Regarding net sales, ITM net sales for 2011 were USD 1.6 billion, reaching a record high, an increase of 14%, as compared to the same period of 2010, mainly due to the more favorable mix of freight and traffics, basically rates, I should say. The sectors showing the best performance were intermodal traffic, which increased 33%, energy 30%, mainly due to the cargo that were due to PEMEX, iron industry, and metals and minerals with more than 15%.</p>
          <p>Ferromex net sales during this year were USD 1.3 billion, an increase of 12% above the USD 1.2 billion in the same period of 2010. During the fourth quarter of last year, net sales were USD 311 million, an increase of 4% as compared to the last quarter of the previous year. Ferrosur's net sales for 2011 were USD 308 million, an increase of 16% above the USD 265 million in the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, Ferrosur's net sales were USD 70 million, an increase of 14%, as compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year.</p>
          <p>ITM's operating costs for the year were USD 1.1 billion, an increase of 18%, compared with the same period of 2010, mainly attributable to increase in the cost of diesel, labor, maintenance, and connection and terminal services. For the fourth quarter of last year was USD 260 million, an increase of 5% year-to-year &#x2013; same quarter of the next year &#x2013; both years. ITM's EBITDA for 2011 was USD 464 million, 6% above the USD 437 million figure of 2010.</p>
          <p>In the last quarter, EBITDA was USD 113 million, an increase of 25% year-to-year. Ferromex EBITDA in the fourth quarter was USD 88 million, an increase of 14% as compared to the USD 78 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Ferrosur's EBITDA was USD 20 million, an increase of 80%, compared to the USD 11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Finally, I go with capital expenditure. The Railroad division investment a record, invested a record high of USD 355 million in 2011, 98% over the previous year, concentrating investments mainly in railroad infrastructure, the construction of new sidings, and increasing the fleet of locomotives. During 2011, 58 locomotives were purchased, bringing the fleet to 770 locomotives, of which 595 belong to Ferromex and 175 to Ferrosur.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure of USD 230 million are expected for &#x2013; for this year, 2012, to refocus principally on maintenance, improvement and expansion of the railroads to increase operating volume, safety and speed.</p>
          <p>And now, I will return the call to Daniel Mu&#xF1;iz for his final remarks.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Daniel, and everyone. I just have two quick questions here. I'd just like to know if you can give us a little more color on Asarco's cost performance in 4Q '11? And if you also &#x2013; as a second question, if you see any possibility of increasing copper capacity in the U.S.? Those are my questions, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I mean, Asarco, as most of the industry has experienced pressures on costs. However, I mean, we're very happy with the performance of Asarco. I mean, Asarco's cash costs, and let me give you the breakdown of Asarco itself in terms of cash costs.</p>
          <p>The cash costs with without byproducts was USD 2.20, that's accumulated cash cost. And with byproducts, USD 1.80, that's the cost there. I mean, pressures in Asarco are common mainly, I mean, already we had lower production because of lower ore grades, and we went through maintenance at our smelter in Asarco for this, I mean, as you know, those maintenance are not every year, but this year we had to go to maintenance. So, we are going to see stabilizing cash costs and probably improving in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p>The question regarding copper, what was it? I'm sorry, can you repeat that?</p>
          <p>All right, I think we can move to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Your next question is from Santiago Perez.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, Daniel, Octavio, and Jorge, and once again thanks for your time and congratulations on your outstanding 2011 results. My questions are regarding your Infrastructure branch. Could you please tell us how did you arrive to the 18% IRR? Probably a breakdown between oil, highway, and the power plant would be great. And also what stake do you have in the highway? And just at last, how much of your energy needs would be met by your energy credit? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start backwards. First of all, our energy needs are going to be met at the end at both construction plants 100%. As you know, there is going to be a 500 megawatt plant, because we grew our building in two stages, first a 250 megawatts, and we're doing a mirror plant for another 250 megawatts. These ones are being built with a turnkey agreement by Siemens, and we're implementing a project command structure for this.</p>
          <p>The highway, we have 100% participation in the project. As you know, in that project, the Mexican government is participating with funding, that's MXN1 billion, and we are also implementing a project finance structure. Ideally, we're aiming to a 70%, 30% equity versus debt or 80%, 20%. The first question was related to, Santiago, again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's related to the 18% IRR. You said the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Total of the investment projects &#x2013; the Infrastructure projects, I'm sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. I mean, as you know, we've &#x2013; we've acquired Perforadora Mexico and the idea to acquire that was to increase our participation in the infrastructure spectrum and particularly our oil drilling programs. As you know, we already own a platform, which is called <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:50) Sonora. And this is two state-of-the-art platforms that we are acquiring. We've secured contracts with PEMEX. And the IRRs, of course, you take a lot of assumptions that <mark type="inaudible" /> (23:01) dollars per day contract, approximately.</p>
          <p>Probably as you can imagine, I mean, there's a lot of speculations and I'll be happy to sit down with you to go after those, but, I mean, the idea is not to give the market every single assumption here with the product <mark type="inaudible" /> (23:18). I mean, we are focusing and trying to do projects that have very high IRRs, and that can turn into a very success story. We're choosing very carefully what we participate in, and that's part of the strategy of growing our Infrastructure division.</p>
          <p>Of course, the idea is to keep on focusing on mining, develop organic &#x2013; I mean, pipeline of projects. The railroad, as you could see, we've invested two years record high CapEx, and we expect a lot of efficiency there in the years to come. And then we are &#x2013; I mean, our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:59) building our Infrastructure division, that's really the strategy going forward. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my call. I just would like to ask three questions. The main one would be, if you could please talk a little bit more on which were the main fundamentals that kept the company from achieving its guidance of copper production?</p>
          <p>And also, maybe, if you could give us a little insight on the Transportation segment, if you have any updates on the possible spin-off that once was talked about? And also, if you could give us perhaps some updates on the situation with GAP? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Let us start with Transportation division, if you will, Octavio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. About the spin-off, right now the only thing that I have to say is that we are beginning talks with Union Pacific, as you may know. ITM has 100% ownership of Ferrosur, and on Ferromex side, 26% is owned by UP and the other 74% by ITM. So, right now, we are in evaluation of the companies and in discussion of the numbers. So, I think it's going to take the &#x2013; at the very least <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:33) for the first semester of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Excellent. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And going back just to production guidance, I mean, what happened last year was we had &#x2013; well, apart from the maintenance topics that I commented on, Asarco, we had lower ore grades in &#x2013; mostly in Peru and in Asarco. I mean, we had decreasing ore grades in the range of 12%, as high as 12% in Mission, about 8% in Toquepala, and 3% in Cuajone. That is stabilizing, that was just expected as part of the mine plan, and that's what happened last year. Raul, do you want to comment further?</p>

          <p>Well, for this year, we're expecting recovery in the Cuajone production. You will start seeing the first results of the project that has been developed as part of the Cuajone operation. In the case of Toquepala, we are basically maintaining the production at the level that we had in 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean, I think that hasn't changed much since last quarter. I mean, as you know, we've now filed our 13B with a 28.74% ownership of the company. I mean, things are still in the courts, being debated. The tender offer has not yet been authorized by the CNBV. So, we are still looking forward to hearing the authorization in order to launch a tender offer. I mean, we've &#x2013; I guess that's the update.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the U.S., besides any opportunities at the historical level, at this point we believe that, we see the prices &#x2013; the long-term prices has been evolving. So, it may be the case that all deposits are profitable at the current price levels or at long-term price levels that's much higher now than what they used to be in the past. Now, specifically in terms of specific opportunities for Southern Copper on that matter, we're not looking into anything like that at this point. We're more focusing on our organic growth at this point.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel, Octavio, and Jorge. I just have two quick questions. The first one is regarding the dividend. You paid in September, one quarterly dividend in paper, are you considering to do it again in 2012? And do you still have some treasury shares to do so? And the next question, and you &#x2013; last year, you did not &#x2013; well, you gave up the merger between the assets in the copper &#x2013; your copper assets. I just want to know if you might reconsider that position this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yeah, I mean, going back to dividends, we &#x2013; last quarter, we paid a dividend in kind, what we had acquired in treasury stocks previously, we have no more treasury stock at this moment. So, I mean, you could always issue stock, but I think that probably the next dividend will be in cash, although I do know that is the Board of Directors' decision. And it should be analyzed in the next quarter, and we do it on a quarter-over-quarter basis. But we don't have more treasury stock at the Grupo M&#xE9;xico level, so we anticipate that it could be in cash or it should be in cash.</p>
          <p>Your second question, you broke up a little bit, I couldn't hear. Can you repeat that one, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. It's about the merger of your copper assets. Last year, you gave up &#x2013; this merger between Asarco and Southern. I just want to know if you might be considering merging these assets this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay, okay, I got it. Well as we pointed out last conference call, I mean, we the board, both boards decided not to pursue that merger, given the decision of the Delaware Court. I mean, we still think that there's a lot of work strategically to be done in order to be able to have both companies together and to be able to extract synergies and have a cleaner and more streamlined structure from a Grupo M&#xE9;xico perspective. But we're working on strategic decisions, nothing yet to report. Thank you for your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is related to the loss rate involving the merger of Minera Mexico with SCC. I guess, I want to know if you have something to provide us with or any update on this issue? And what's your expected timeframe for a final resolution? And my second question would be if you have a production guidance for Asarco for 2012? These would be my two questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you for the questions. I mean, regarding an update, as we pointed out last quarter, we are going to appeal the decision of the Court. We're going to the Supreme Court of Delaware for that appeal. We have a deadline to file our appeal brief on March the 5th this year. We're working towards that and I think we're going to meet the deadline. And the timing will definitely be on the court hands from there on. We do think we should expect any &#x2013; I mean, news from the Supreme Court of Delaware by probably the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>And regarding production guidance, 184,000 tons is &#x2013; of copper contained is the guidance for 2012 for Asarco.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel, thanks, again. I just wanted to clear that the same hedging strategy is going on for Asarco as it is going for Southern Copper, the one that you discussed a few hours earlier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I mean, just for the benefit of everyone, Asarco has hedged 6,000 tons of copper per month for the first quarter of 2012. The put level is at USD 3.50, the call level is at USD 5.22 per pound, so these are &#x2013; I mean, happen to be very good callers if you like. If you look at it from an Americas Mining Company, we've hedged 4.8% of the production, and that also &#x2013; I mean, just having Southern Copper and Asarco together, is 13,000 tons per month in only zero cost callers. And the consolidated numbers will be USD 3.50 for the put and USD 5.20 for the call.</p>
          <p>We have not put any other hedges whatsoever yet.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, thank you for the call. I was just wondering if you could remind us about what happened last year in the Infrastructure division with the effective tax rate? So the &#x2013; well, this year's normalized tax looks so huge. Thank you.</p>
