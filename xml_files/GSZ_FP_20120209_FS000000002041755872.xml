          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's a very &#x2013; it's a pleasure for us to welcome you here this morning, with Isabelle Kocher, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Cirelli and everyone else from the group. We're going to presenting with you the results from 2011, as well as the strategy and outlook for GDF SUEZ for 2012.</p>
          <p>We'd like to thank you first for having &#x2013; with still the cold weather to come along and join us this morning. This is good news for energy producers such as us since we sell electricity and gas. It's also a challenge because we are constantly outperforming our previous records in France and in Europe.</p>
          <p>And our teams are working hard to make sure that we have a steady supply of Russian gas in order to serve all of our customers. We have a gas portfolio. It's one of the most diverse in the world, and this is something that says a lot about how much security of supply we can provide. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will tell us a bit more about that a little bit later on.</p>
          <p>This morning, we're going to be presenting to you the key figures and highlights of 2011. In particular, we'll be talking about our strong international growth in gas and electricity. Isabelle will be speaking to you in a more detailed manner about our accounts for 2011. And we'll be hearing about our optimization of assets, and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will be talking about progress that we've made in our long-term supply contracts and negotiations, the end of the freeze on gas rates in France, and also the establishment of our new business line, Energy Europe, for managing our European business. But let's begin by looking at what happened in 2011.</p>
          <p>2011 was a year that was of great strategic importance for the group. We finalized the merger with International Power, which was the second-largest merger and acquisition of 2010 when we announced it. So, it was &#x2013; the deal was closed in 2011.</p>
          <p>It's also a year during which we reached an agreement with the Chinese sovereign fund, CIC, which is a real premier for a European group. So, we have a very promising outlook in Asia which is one of the most dynamic parts of the world. And this constitutes a slight shift in the center of gravity of our activity, specifically when it comes to LNG.</p>
          <p>So, both of these operations and transactions are part and parcel of our industrial and commercial strategy. It is the acceleration of our development in the emerging countries. We have decided to move in this direction and we've done so in a rather spectacular fashion, with this shift in our LNG business towards Asia Pacific, with new contracts and new projects in China, India, Korea, Malaysia and Australia.</p>
          <p>2011 also was a year in which the general financial and business environment was impacted by some external events. It was a difficult year in terms of overall economic growth especially in Europe. It was also a year with major changes effort. We saw that with the nuclear disaster at Fukushima.</p>
          <p>Whoever would have been able to predict, for example, just how quickly the Arab Spring would spread? Who could forget the euro crisis and what happened in Fukushima, just underscores how important it is for our societies to have a proper energy mix.</p>
          <p>Now, for our group, 2011 was a year that was exceptionally warm. It's easy to forget that now because it's very cold today, but 2011 was the warmest year of the century so far, and we also had to contend with a freeze on gas rates in France in the second half of the year. Despite these elements that had direct impact on the group, the group's results are solid in 2011. We're up 7% with overall sales. EBITDA is up 9.5% to &#x20AC;16.5 billion. Net income group share is &#x20AC;4 billion. Free cash flow is at almost &#x20AC;9 billion, &#x20AC;8.8 billion, compared to &#x20AC;7 billion last year.</p>
          <p>Now, one of the things that we can say is that we've paid particular attention to the financial structure of GDF SUEZ. Our net debt stands at &#x20AC;37.6 billion. It's gone down by &#x20AC;4 billion compared to the level that we had at the end of 2010 on a pro forma basis, prior to the integration of International Power. So, we have met all of our financial objectives that we'd set for ourselves for 2011.</p>
          <p>Let me just remind you that all of the targets that we've set were on the basis of a hypothesis of no major regulatory or macroeconomic changes and normal average weather conditions. Now, if we exclude the abnormal weather conditions and the gas rate freeze in France, our EBITDA would actually stand at &#x20AC;17.4 billion which is at the upper end of the range that we had stated in our guidance. And our earnings per share was at &#x20AC;2.1, on par with what we saw in 2010. We've continued with our industrial development with gross CapEx at about &#x20AC;11 billion which is in line with our guidance. So, we are continuing with our industrial development.</p>
          <p>We also have a program for optimizing our portfolio. This is what we announced when we merged with International Power. We announced this in March 2011 when the deal was closed. The target was &#x20AC;10 billion over a three-year period, 2011 to 2013. We're off to a very good start because we've already made two-thirds of the way towards reaching that target by the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>Net debt is 2.3 times EBITDA, so it's lower than it was &#x2013; than our target of 2.5. And it constitutes an improvement compared to where we stood on a pro-forma basis at the end of 2010 with International Power. Our gearing is under 50%, so we have one of the strongest financial structures in the entire sector or industry. We will propose to the general shareholders' meeting in April a dividend of &#x20AC;1.5 per share which is on at par with what we had in 2011. This is a balance to be paid out of &#x20AC;0.67 in order to top up what we had already given by way of an adjustment of &#x20AC;0.83 in November.</p>
          <p>Now one of the priorities for GDF SUEZ is sort of a moral contract that we have in markets and with our shareholders. We've decided to have a stable dividend policy. Now since the merger, the group has focused on three main components, first of all, an ordinary dividend payout but also exceptional dividend payouts and share buybacks. Between 2000 and 2011, the average &#x2013; the ordinary dividend has gone up, on average, by 5% per year. In 2009, we also paid out an exceptional dividend of &#x20AC;0.8 per share, and we bought back 74 million of our own shares between 2008 and 2011 which is the equivalent of &#x20AC;2.4 billion, including &#x20AC;200 million being spent on the most recent chapter of that share buyback that we announced in September 2011.</p>
          <p>As you can see, despite the crisis, GDF SUEZ has provided an attractive return on their investments to our shareholders, and this is one of our group's priorities. I would like to say that we'd like to continue to pay our shareholders our dividends in two payments with an advanced payment before the end of the year and the balance when the final accounts are closed.</p>
          <p>Now, the group has committed to reaching not just financial targets but also industrial targets. This is our vision for the corporation. We want to be able to ensure our long-term development, and this is why we're also banking on sustainable development. We are a group that can provide solutions for its customers. It can create jobs, and it makes investments. I'm not going to go into all of the details of our sustainable development objectives. But when we presented our annual results in 2010, we decided to announce sustainable development targets for 2015 when it comes to renewable energy sources, biodiversity, health and safety, energy mix and training, employee shareholdings and hiring. So, on the one hand, we have an industrial project, but we also have a genuine human and social project as well. And this is something that will guarantee future growth regardless of changes in the outside world.</p>
          <p>Today, we can now give you progress report on these targets as you can see on the screen. For each one of these indicators, we are well positioned in order to meet the targets that we've set for ourselves for 2015.</p>
          <p>Let's now go back to what happened in 2011 and look at some of the major stages that we went through in our business development. Our strategy has three main thrusts. Firstly, international development in the emerging countries. Our target here is to reach 150 gigawatts of installed capacity by 2016 with more than 50% of it that is 90 gigawatts outside of Europe. We're also going to continue to consolidate or integrate our positions in Europe. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will tell us little bit about that later on, and that is why we've created the Energy Europe, the business line.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we are going to be strengthening infrastructures, energy, and environmental services. These are business lines which generate high levels of recurring income. And you know that our objective here is to have a balanced portfolio of activity. We also want to make sure that we can develop the businesses that give us secure returns on investment and secure cash flow on a recurring basis.</p>
          <p>Our industrial development in fact are part and parcel of this strategy. Let me just mention some examples. And you can see some of them on the slide. In electricity, we have about 5 gigawatts that came into service in 2011. I would like to mention, in particular Ras Laffan in Qatar, which is the largest in the gulf and the second largest in the Middle East. The largest one is one that we built in Saudi Arabia last year. We've also opened Estreito in Brazil. In France, we've gone beyond the threshold of 1 gigawatt of installed wind power, which means that GDF SUEZ is the confirmed leader in this business in France.</p>
          <p>In gas, GDF SUEZ has reached a strategic partnership with the CNP Assurances, a Caisse des D&#xE9;p&#xF4;ts consortium for gas transport. We've also purchased five underground natural gas storage facilities in Germany, bringing our total storage capacity to 12.5 billion cubic meters. And in today's context, you can see just how important it is to be able to store a large amount of gas in order to provide security of supply whenever the weather gets very cold. It also affords us greater flexibility on a European energy market that is increasingly volatile.</p>
          <p>2011 was also a year in which we had two gas pipelines come on stream, providing gas to European markets, Medgaz in the Mediterranean and Nord Stream in the North Sea and the group is a shareholder in that gas pipeline.</p>
          <p>Now, when it comes to services, we've won many new contracts, many new accounts in water supply and waste management in Australia, Spain, France. And in heating networks, the group has continued growing that business. It's a very dynamic business. We have 12 heating network contracts that we've won this &#x2013; in 2011 in France and in the UK. More generally speaking, the group in 2011 has strengthened its position on growth markets with the successful integration of International Power. This integration took place in record time as the closing took place less than a year ago, and the integration is now a daily reality and we are starting to tap the synergies already. We've also signed a strategic partnership with the Chinese sovereign fund, CIC, which is a very special relationship, something that will help all of our businesses and also our geographical position in Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>2011 has also been a year in which we're prepared for future growth. And as I said, we're setting our sights on the growth markets around the world, in particular, the emerging countries. On this slide, you can see some key figures on some of the operations that we have been involved in or that are under way for the development of the group, in Latin America, for example.</p>
          <p>We have 5.5 gigawatts that are currently being built in Brazil and in Peru. We have the acquisition of T&#xE9;rmika in Chile. The group now has, as a result, a strong foothold to have the sustainable development of its businesses in the region in the field of energy efficiency. In the Middle East, the group is currently building 4 gigawatts of electrical power. We also have been designated preferred bidder in Kuwait for a 1.5 &#x2013; 1,500-megawatt plant. This is an announcement that was just made a few days ago. We also have a contract that we've won in Qatar for a waste-water treatment in Doha and the Al Dur desalination plant which is currently being built in Bahrain.</p>
          <p>When it comes to E&amp;P, we are currently still working on building the Touat gas field in Algeria. In Asia Pacific, the group has been very active. 2.9 kilowatts are being built in electricity generation. In E&amp;P, I would like to mention a recent discovery in the gas field of Jangkrik in Indonesia and a very promising results for the license for Absheron in Azerbaijan. 2011 was also a year in which we continued with a very &#x2013; with a winning strategy of developing our activities in liquefied natural gas.</p>
          <p>Let me just focus on this a bit. One of the main challenges in gas markets today is very rapid growth of demand for LNG in Asia which is a region that is growing very quickly. LNG is a critical feature to fuel growth in that part of the world and GDF SUEZ is in a good position in order to profit and to take advantage of this. The presence of the group throughout the entire value chain of LNG and its position as a market leader gives us competitive advantages and offers to us special opportunities.</p>
          <p>We've signed a variety of contracts to sell LNG. We've redeployed large quantities of LNG from the western world towards Asia Pacific, contracts with major players in China, Korea, Malaysia and India, accounting to a total of more than 8 million tons. We're currently involved in discussions as well with other potential buyers. In 2011, our external LNG sales rose significantly by about 30%, 48 deliveries, 25 of which was sent to the Asian market, so GDF SUEZ is very active in these markets. So, this is the success story over the last 18 months and will last into the future because we have the unique capacity to respond over a long-term basis to rising demand for LNG.</p>
          <p>A recent study published by CERA forecasts an increase in demand for LNG from 2010 to 2016 of 71 million tons. 70% of this growth will happen in Asia, so it just shows that we are well-placed to take advantage of that since we're already there.</p>
          <p>The group has the third largest LNG portfolio, 30% of that comes from long-term supply contracts. And we also have a very flexible fleet of 18 methane tankers that makes it possible for us not only to uphold our commitments but also to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise. So, the group has special competitive advantages, competitive edge. This makes it possible for us to roll out our long-term strategy with comfort.</p>
          <p>That being said, we've decided to launch a short-term action plan across all of the group's business lines in order to make the group stronger because we are in a middle of an economic crisis in Europe. Nobody can really tell how long or how deep this crisis will be, and so we need to continue to develop the group's activities. And we're going to focus on four management priorities within the management of the group. We're going to be focusing, for example, on recurring net income. This will be the key indicator that we'll be using to measure managerial performance rather than focusing on EBITDA. In fact, tomorrow, we're going to be bringing together our 130 top managers from around the world in order to drive this point home to them.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have to increase our financial and strategic flexibility in the group. One of our greatest strengths has been not only our ability &#x2013; or not only our sound financial structure in order to withstand the crisis. In fact, as of the end of <mark type="ph" /> 2008, 2009 (20:30) when the crisis first broke, we decided to strengthen our financial structure in order to protect the group. This is what's made it possible for us to contend with this second wave of crisis.</p>
          <p>So, it's important to remain flexible. This is a categorical imperative for the group, both in strategic terms, we need to be able to be agile and as we've done with all of these different operations, International Power, CIC, LNG in Asia, and once the recovery kicks in, we'll be able &#x2013; we'll be even stronger. We also need to optimize the creation of value on our industrial and commercial base as it currently exists. And we also need to strengthen synergies in the market for the future.</p>
          <p>So, this plan actually bolsters the group's strategic vision and will make it easier for the group to deploy that vision. You've noted that amongst these priorities, we will be focusing more on the recurring net income. And this is a priority that has already been incorporated into the financial information that we will be sharing with you today.</p>
          <p>In the past, we would always talk about EBITDA as the key indicator. But now we're going to be referring more &#x2013; we're going to be referring more to the recurring net income indicator. And as of the 1st of January, this has already been factored into our management pay packages. And this is something that we've done also because the market has been asking us to do this. It enables us to focus more on the profitability or reflects the profitability of our strategy. And it should help us avoid the impact of changes in accounting practices in 2013 regarding proportional integration.</p>
          <p>So, in 2012 we are looking at a stable picture with a recurring net income between &#x20AC;3.5 billion and &#x20AC;4 billion. The other indicators, we're going to have a CapEx &#x2013; gross CapEx at about &#x20AC;11 billion and we shall be maintaining our &#x2013; a credit rating and a net debt to EBITDA ratio less than or equal to 2.5 times and a stable or slightly increased dividend.</p>
          <p>I'll now give the floor to Isabel so that she can take you through the financial figures for 2011. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I'm going to be spending most of my time talking about four fundamental issues. The two &#x2013; the first two concern our performance in 2011 and of course I'd like to comment on that. And the other two concern our prospects for the medium term.</p>
          <p>Now, our financial results 2011, this is the first message, very, very robust results despite the unfavorable impact that we've had on 2011, very, very unfavorable because of the climate. And you'll see, and I'll be showing you that despite that, our performance really has been excellent and our growth rates are very high. And this is the result of the strategy that we have been conducting. Second important message regarding 2011, you'll see that we have continued to strengthen our flexibility &#x2013; our financial flexibility in the form of various projects, that I'll be telling you about. The other two issues concern the prospects forward.</p>
          <p>And what I'll try and do is to show you that thanks to our business model which has made us one of the best-placed players in this industry because our business model actually has regulated and contracted assets of a large amount which means that we don't have to base &#x2013; we don't have to change our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:32) but also our merchant activity which allows us to make the most of the rebound. And thanks to that, our prospects for 2011 or 2012 to 2015 are very, very solid.</p>
          <p>And lastly, I'd like to come back to our priorities, which G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet has just talked about. And I think that these are the best priorities and strategies that we can have in the situation we're living. So first of all, our performance in 2011. Let me run through this slide, the changes in our EBITDA between 2010 and 2011. Now, you are familiar with these figures. I think they illustrate growth in EBITDA, large growth of more than &#x20AC;1.5 billion. And you can see there the 9.5% growth that G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet has just mentioned. This 2011 performance was characterized by two major events, first of all, the climate and secondly, the acquisition of International Power.</p>
          <p>Climate, first of all. Now, the climate impact when you compare performance in 2011, 2010 is a negative because although 2011 was a very, very hot year, specialists have been telling us that the climate scenario had 1% chances of happening. Well, 2010, in fact, was very cold. And when you accumulate the impact on accounts of this difference in climate, the distortion in climate between 2010 and 2011, well, you can see the impact has been almost &#x20AC;900 million. And that impact has been concentrated on two business lines, France Energy and Infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Second exceptional event, the acquisition in February of last year of International Power. Now, in our 2011 accounts, we have an impact over 11 months of the acquisition of International Power, which represents &#x20AC;1.3 billion. Apart from those two exceptional events, our growth rate in EBITDA would be 5.8%.</p>
          <p>Now, how is it broken down? Well, let me comment on this graph moving from the left to the right. Now, the energy &#x2013; the French Energy business line as you can see &#x2013; Energy France, as you can see, there is an EBITDA which has increased slightly. But nevertheless, it has gone up despite the major impact in 2011 of non-application of gas rates in France. And if you compare the 2011 rates and the ones in 2010, well, you can see that there was a negative impact of &#x20AC;350 million. And you've got all of the details in the appendices.</p>
          <p>Now, that negative impact was partly offset by the fact that we now &#x2013; since we signed in April 2010 a public service contract, we now have the margins for commercialization when it comes to gas sales activities. The impact for full year 2011 for those new margins make a difference compared to 2010 and represent &#x20AC;120 million. The other positive effect is the full year effect of the &#x2013; going online in 2010 of additional generation capacity, wind power and also heat power or gas power. And lastly, the last thing which has allowed the French Energy business line to do well is the Efficio plan. It's our cost optimization plan.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to Europe and International. I should point out here that this is shown to you &#x2013; taking in on board the old operational structure of the group. Later on, I'll give you the impact when it comes to the new breakdown of our group.</p>
          <p>Now, first of all, we've got European activities. And you can see that those European activities have slightly dropped in 2011, about &#x20AC;50 million drop which is actually nevertheless good performance given the price context that we had in Europe in 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, the price context was extremely flat, if I can put it like that. And since in 2010 we had &#x2013; we were still feeling the impact of our hedging policy, very high prices that we had in the previous year, we've actually seen prices drop between 2010, 2011.</p>
          <p>So, this good performance in the European Energy and International Energy, I think it's important to bear in mind. And of course, International, what I mean by that is International Power, basically, has seen huge organic growth, more than &#x20AC;350 million in growth linked to our South American business, particularly Brazil. Thanks in particular to the coming on the line of our first generation products in Estreito. That's a huge dam in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Enormous growth in North America as well, driven in particular by the huge contribution of the LNG activity. Now, Hungary, let me move on. We're moving on sorry, to Global Gas &amp; LNG. Now, this business line, the 3G as we often call it, covered three business lines' activities and let me run through them all. First activity, supply of gas; and the second, LNG; and the third, E&amp;P.</p>
          <p>Now, first of all, supply and sales of gas. This was characterized last year by a gas oil spread which was very high. But I should point out that thanks to price overhauling policy with our long-term contractors, our portfolio for supply and provision of gas has remained pretty much level, slightly increased in 2011. Same for 2012, given this policy that we have introduced, and which is clearly paying off with good results when it comes to price revision.</p>
          <p>So, gas supply business, LNG as a business grew as well in 2011. And E&amp;P also grew given the volume that we're talking about, there's been a ramp-up in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:25) platform in Norway and also because of the very, very high oil prices in 2011. In euros, the oil prices went from &#x20AC;60 on average to &#x20AC;80 on average in 2011.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure now, that's the next bar in the chart. Now, infrastructure is growing, as I said earlier, the climate of course has been &#x2013; in fact at the time, it has been neutralized in this bar chart. But the drop in sales of French storage capacity was more than offset by two events or effects. First of all, the coming into line of Fos Cavaou last year. And that generated a lot of business for all of 2011, and also the acquisition &#x2013; storage acquisition in Germany.</p>
          <p>Services did very well as well, thanks to a positive contribution from all of the business units in services, so very, very good operational performance. And also thanks to successful acquisition of various heat networks in France and abroad.</p>
          <p>Environment, SUEZ ENVIRONMENT, yesterday, the results were published, robust results with an increase in the EBITDA of nearly 7%. And I suggest that you look at the details that we provided yesterday by Jean-Louis Chaussade and his staff.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, I would say that despite the weather which actually played against us &#x2013; I mean it was very, very exceptional weather. Hey, you have to go back a lot of &#x2013; quite a few years to find a similar type of year. But despite that, the EBITDA growth was really very strong. And as G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet said earlier on, if we rewrite the performance by wiping out the climate performance and the price performance, the tariff performance, which is what our reference line is, and our EBITDA for 2011 is about &#x20AC;17.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me now give you some information about the other sections of the financial results. Now, the net current income of the group &#x2013; group share stands at &#x20AC;3.455 billion in 2011. And that's characterized enormously, or marked by the weather and the tariff impact. Of course, they had a far harder effect on the net income than the EBITDA. And if we process those impacts, then you have considerable stability when it comes to the net current income group share in 2011 compared to 2010. I should point out that 2011 in certain ways was a very exceptional year. Various specific events have to be noted.</p>
          <p>Now, the first thing is the depreciation and amortization. That stood in 2011 at &#x20AC;7.1 billion. So, huge increase compared to the previous year. And, of course, you can see the impact there of the acquisition of International Power. And you can also see the impact of the rolling out of new units and power stations. I should say that when you look at the PPA impact, there's a one-off effect of about more than &#x20AC;100 million which of course has an effect on the balance sheet or the financial exercise and the depreciation, amortissements (sic) [amortization] for 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, the capital gains of assets shedding were about &#x20AC;1.5 billion. If you reprocess those figures, because of climate and if you also factor in the one-off impact of D&amp;A well, then you have a margin rate which is stable between 2010 and 2011. In other words, we're not seeing some kind of twisting of our profitability or skewing of our profitability in net current income.</p>
          <p>Now, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:54) gap is stable in 2011. It stands at roughly &#x20AC;700 million. The largest part being of course the spin off capital gains linked to the portfolio optimization. But I'll come back to that later on.</p>
          <p>Our financial income &#x2013; income from operating activities or financial results I should say, &#x20AC;2.6 billion, an increase obviously compared to the previous year. The financial burden has increased. It's increased quite simply and this is because of the increase in the debt &#x2013; the gross debt because of the acquisition of Power. If we were looking at it on a pro forma basis, taking into account this acquisition, then we would have a financial debt of &#x20AC;2.9 billion. So, you can see we've already been working hard on financial synergy and working in general in order to optimize our financial results.</p>
          <p>Tax now, tax increased this year, and this is linked to the development of E&amp;P activities in Norway. You know of course, that those activities are far more taxed than the average of our business lines in the group. Minority stakes have increased also, and there of course you have the IP effect, the major effect, but there's also the effect of strategic partnerships that we have signed in 2011 and that appear for part of the year in our financial results. So, net income group share is &#x20AC;4 billion in 2011. G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet has already said the group wants now to concentrate in the next few years on growth of this recurrent net income group share. We want it to be a key indicator of our performance and our prospects in the group.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to talk about those aspects which make up our balance sheet and give you some information which will allow you to gauge the robustness of this balance sheet and the flexibility &#x2013; the financial flexibility of this group and we decided to continue to work on this area.</p>
          <p>Now, you can see that in 2011, cash &#x2013; free cash flow was very, very high. An increase &#x2013; a huge increase, I should say, actually more than the EBITDA mainly because the specific &#x2013; the free cash flow. Dividends stable, &#x20AC;3.3 billion. Our investments, as G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet has said, around &#x20AC;11 billion &#x2013; about &#x20AC;10.7 billion. So, in 2011, the investments are very high as they were before. Now, the spinoffs have provided cash to the tune of &#x20AC;6.3 billion. We often talk of the net debt effect of our spinoffs which is high but this is just the cash effect of spinoffs.</p>
          <p>Net debt, you can see, pretty extraordinary figures, &#x20AC;33 billion in 2010, &#x20AC;41.6 billion after the acquisition of International Power, and at the end of the year, &#x20AC;37.6 billion. So, when you look at the ratio or the gearing, I should say, and that's how we make our commitments. Well, you can see that that gearing has gone from 2.2 times in 2010 to 2.25 times pro forma, verging on the limits I told you. And then, one year later &#x2013; less than one year, it has come down to the point of departure.</p>
          <p>Now, I want to be fully transparent with you. I'd like to say that these figures worked out on the basis of the net debt and you have all of these mentioned in the appendices which allow you to understand this. We have decided in actual fact to exclude from our net debt the derivatives which every year are calculated at market value and which were booked into our net debt in the past, but which obviously nothing to do with the burden of that net debt in the future.</p>
          <p>So, what we've been doing as indeed almost everybody else has been doing, was done in order to reduce the volatility of the net debt and to make it far more easy to interpret and make it easier to follow the changes and pro forma IP of course 2010, as I said, well we started with &#x20AC;40.16 billion (sic) [&#x20AC;41.6 billion]. At the end of 2011, we're down to &#x20AC;37.6 billion, so &#x20AC;4 billion of less net debt. In the former definition, you would have seen exactly the same thing and the drop would have been &#x20AC;3.7 billion just to be perfectly clear about it.</p>
          <p>Okay. Now, what I'd like to do is to give you some information about spin-off program or disposal program. You'll remember that we announced at the beginning of last year a disposal program for three years to the tune of &#x20AC;10 billion. Where are we at the end of this first year? Well, you can see that we have done two-thirds of the spin-offs. The overall impact stands at &#x20AC;6.6 billion for the spin-offs. You know that these transactions &#x2013; there are eight transactions in all, which were carried out in 2011. And I think one can rank them into two groups, really. The strategic partnerships which have been developed on E&amp;P and gas transport and to do CIC on one hand, and then there's a consortium, CDC/CNP on the other hand. Also, we have spin-offs of certain business lines which are not strategic or we don't consider them to be strategic. Now, the full-year impact of these parts of the program, which has only been achieved in our spin-off program stands at &#x20AC;400 million of EBITDA and about &#x20AC;200 million of net recurring income.</p>
          <p>And obviously, we are going to continue this program of spin-offs. We're in a very comfortable position and we can now conduct this. We don't have to be overhasty. We can take it slowly and continue to grow &#x2013; develop it over the next two years and to roll out this program that we've begun. And we've ready got in mind some specific assets. And I think that soon, we're going to be able to announce quite a few operations.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. I'd like to say a couple of things about our cash flow now. You can see at the bottom left here that we have strong liquidity, &#x20AC;27 billion and cash more than &#x20AC;15 billion &#x2013; nearly &#x20AC;16 billion in cash at the end of 2011, which means that we really are covered if there's any problem regarding cash availability in the next few years. And you can also see that the group's signature is greatly appreciated by the market. We, in 2011, as in the past, in fact, have undertaken quite a lot of operations on the bond market. We had the first issuance of &#x2013; in history, I think over in 100 years and again in the second part of the year, we had bond issuances on the euro market and the UK market to the tune of &#x2013; well for the entire year, more than &#x20AC;3 billion. And you can see that our debt maturity &#x2013; our net debt maturity is more than 11 years now whereas in the past it was between six years and seven years in 2008. And you also know &#x2013; I stress this because it's very important in our strategy. You know that our credit rating is very, very good with S&amp;P and Moody's.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to do now is to talk to you about future prospects. Now perhaps I could stress one thing, the balance that we have in this group. And I'd like to explain to you that if we had to rank our business line or group them into two parts; the contracted and regulated business lines on one hand, and the merchant, what I call merchant activities, on the other hand. Then you'd see that more than half of our EBITDA in actual fact is based on contracted and tariff-regulated businesses.</p>
          <p>I'm thinking of infrastructure here. I'm thinking of some of storage activities not in France, but in Germany in particular. It's also the case for electricity generation in certain countries, particularly in Latin America, in the Middle East, and it applies also to some of our LNG business. As we've heard, these are contracted on a multi-year basis and also applies to services; both energy services but also environmental services. And it's on that part of our business that we have planned to really invest as much as we can in terms of CapEx for development. And that's where we're going to be creating value, thanks to those investments.</p>
          <p>And then turning to the other group, on the left of this slide, you have what I call the businesses which are exposed to volatility in market prices. Most of our businesses there are energy businesses in Europe. Well, that's the case. I'm not talking of renewable growth. It's true for E&amp;P which are very exposed to price fluctuation, particularly for oil. And in fact, they were favorably impacted by that price <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:08) last year. Also, to certain extent for LNG and also for gas storage in France.</p>
          <p>So, in this particular part of our business lines, we are very exposed to market prices. Now, our clout, our strength is based on the fact that our exposure is very varied and diversified. It's diversified in terms of markets, in terms of business lines, in terms of commodities, so we're exposed to electricity prices, but also gas prices, oil prices. And natural fact, this diversity of exposure is a very good form of protection.</p>
          <p>Let me explain. We talked about the increases in oil prices, that increase has meant, the spread is very high which weighed on supply margins, but at the same time, particularly for gas, but at the same time, the oil prices has favorized the EBITDA of our E&amp;P activities. So, you can see we've got this natural hedging effect thanks to this enormous diversity of our portfolio of businesses.</p>
          <p>Now, 2011, as we'll see in a few minutes, the price situation for energy in Europe will be stable. I would almost go far as saying that it may drop on a spread basis. We are banking on a return to gradual growth in energy prices. That will one &#x2013; this will happen one day because Europe, of course, needs to renew a large part of its energy basis and investments are only possible if the prices start gradually going up again.</p>
          <p>So, that part of our business, the merchant or upstream business means that the group has in its portfolio a very large range of options rebounding. We've got a lot of stability throughout the next five years when it comes to profitability.</p>
          <p>Let me now talk to you about 2012 and our prospects for that. And I'd like to set that against the backdrop of the new structure of our group. You can see, on the left here, our first assessment. And we'll be giving you more detailed figures at the end of the first half of the year but you can see, at a first glance, the pro forma EBITDA of this Energy Europe business.</p>
          <p>Now, Energy Europe business line suffered in 2011 because of the climate as I've already said and we imagine that in 2012 there's going to be stabilization of the EBITDA because of the increases in gas prices that we've obtained from the 1st of January of this year. And also, because of enormous efforts undertaken throughout Europe, we have all been talking about synergy optimization for all of our cost basis.</p>
          <p>Now, the new business line, B3G, that's Global Gas and LNG, there will be an increase next year, basically because of the increase or high level of oil prices and the increase in generation. Also, there'll be an increase in sales of LNG to third parties despite the spin-off of Atlantic LNG at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>And looking at these two business lines, what you've got is the basis of our merchant business lines. These two really include pretty much most of the business or merchant activities of the group. So, depending on that we reprocess in &#x2013; or factor in or factor out the climate effects, what we're talking about is stability or slight increase of these business lines in 2012.</p>
          <p>Next areas or businesses which are mostly contracted or regulated, that's the case for International Power. International Power published its results yesterday. So I'll suggest that you look at the detailed information that was provided. What you need to takeaway from that is that the financial results of IP will be increased in 2012, thanks to the coming online &#x2013; continued coming online of this product, particularly in Brazil, thanks also to a major LNG business. Even though there was a slight drop, we are expecting a little bit less cargo ship routing for 2012.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the levels will remain high. I should say in passing that we think there's going to be a deconsolidation of Al Hidd, which is one of our major power stations in the world and you'll see that in the accounts of International Power. But generally, the business will be growing in 2012.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure, infrastructure will continue to grow. Obviously, the regulated will continue to grow. And the storage acquisition in Germany will be felt throughout the year. Services, now, for reasons of prudence, I would say, stable prospects because of the growth forecast that we felt would be probably going to be zero for 2012. We're being cautious here. But I hope that we'll be able to give you better news at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Environment now, as Jean-Louis has told you &#x2013; had told you yesterday about SUEZ environment, yesterday. So, the very least we are talking about stability for the EBITDA in 2012. So, all of this means that for 2017, we'll have an indicative 2000 &#x2013; EBITDA because, of course, it will the net current income that we will be able to judge things on. But you can see that the &#x2013; we're planning on an EBITDA of around &#x20AC;17 billion &#x2013; I'm sorry, 2012, not 2017. You would have been very disappointed if that had been the forecast for 2017. So, &#x20AC;17 billion for 2012 including the &#x20AC;600 million of improvements for Efficio plan 2, which leads us to the recurrent net income guidance of &#x20AC;3.5 billion and &#x20AC;4 billion. And I should point out that that includes the full-year effect of the spin-offs carried out in 2011 and the full-year effects of course are estimated at &#x20AC;200 million for the <mark type="ph" /> RN EPG (53:18).</p>
          <p>Now if I try and shed some lights &#x2013; more light on the future, let me try and give you some more long-term ideas about what we're thinking of. As I said in the short term, we are counting on average growth, specifically, when it comes to regulated and contracted business, flatter perhaps on merchant activities.</p>
          <p>Looking further down the line of mid-term, we're expecting more solid growth based on a return to gradual growth in energy prices particularly in Europe. And as I already said, our merchant business line portfolio, of course, will pick up enormously if there is a slight increase in energy prices in Europe. We think that there's potential. We think there's potential for recurrent net income group share of about &#x20AC;5 billion in 2015.</p>
          <p>Now, this is not guidance because we believe that the macroeconomic situation is uncertain, so we really cannot honestly publish guidance. But this nevertheless gives you an idea of what we think is going to be happening and what basis we're working on. So, &#x20AC;5 billion in 2015 and in terms of EBITDA, but as I say, our focus is more about <mark type="ph" /> earn-out (55:08) but the indicative EBITDA will be &#x20AC;21 billion. You know that we're going to be seeing changes in consolidation standards. We haven't taken any decisions yet but you will appreciate the EBITDA potentially could see changes or variations because of the changes in the accounting processing of some of our businesses.</p>
          <p>So, this helps you understand a little bit more about where we're going and the prospects that we're working on in-house and also it helps you to understand better what our priorities are in terms of steering this company and G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet talked about this.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll come back to it. First of all, we want to increase financial flexibility. The potential I just talked to you about, I think is based more on the lower end of the range, &#x20AC;9 billion to &#x20AC;11 billion of investments. &#x20AC;9 billion to &#x20AC;11 billion because we want to remain flexible and the results, we are sticking to &#x20AC;9 billion to &#x20AC;11 billion in terms of prospects.</p>
          <p>Something else which is very important, of course, and this is one of the toughest things about the group's policies, we want to maintain a good credit rating. So, financial flexibility is our top priority. And then, we want to concentrate on net recurrent income so that we will be able to be confident when we can maintain our dividend levels even in the mid-term. The third priority, in terms of management optimizations of assets basis.</p>
          <p>I'd like now to give the floor to Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Cirelli.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks you, Isabelle, and good morning, everybody. Just very quickly, I would like to discuss three topics with you this morning. The first one is the optimization of our portfolio of long-term gas supplies. Secondly, I'll be giving you a brief overview of the gas situation in France and in Belgium. I'll also be talking about nuclear energy as well, because these are clearly two subjects that have caught the public's eye over the last year. And we've made progress, especially, when it comes to clarifying the outlook in these two markets. And also &#x2013; I'm also going to be telling you about the group's European market integration strategy with the establishment of the Energy Europe business line.</p>
          <p>First, let me give you a status report on the price renegotiations and reviews with our main long-term supplier. These price reviews had actually &#x2013; the cycles for renegotiation prices have been shortened as of last year. This is something that has become increasingly important to the financial community because of the decoupling of gas index prices and oil index prices.</p>
          <p>I'm going to focus on three things that are very important in order to give you the proper background to understand all of this. Firstly, let me say is that despite the broad spread, and as Isabelle said, the spread is still quite high &#x2013; quite large in 2011. The gas business for GDF SUEZ is still profitable. It's &#x2013; we're still in the black in 2011 and this will certainly be the case for 2012 as well.</p>
          <p>And why is our gas supply business is still making profits? Well, first of all, I would say it's because of the structure of our portfolio. We still have a very large portion of our customers' downstream demand, the demand side with oil-indexed gas rate and this is apart from most gas operators in Europe. Another thing that sets us apart is that, we have a huge amount of flexibility. We have the largest number of delivery points in Europe. And LNG also makes it possible for us to have greater flexibility than most of our competitors. And also, price reviews that kicked in 2011, and I'll tell you a little bit more about that in just a few moments.</p>
          <p>Another important feature is our strategy. The strategy of reviewing our long-term contracts on a shorter cycle, this is a strategy that's paying off. Of course, we do have an objective every time we review prices. We want to narrow down the length of the renegotiation cycle. You know that in gas contracts the average duration of the cycle was three years, and with every cycle of negotiations we've managed to bring it down to &#x2013; by one year or two years in order to follow the evolution of the market in real time insofar as possible. Of course, this means that you have to do &#x2013; put more work into negotiating things. There might also be more question marks in the market itself, but it does give us a much narrower spread compared to actual market conditions.</p>
          <p>And then one last thing I can say when it comes to review prices is that when we talk with our suppliers, we have three things that we can use to leverage in our negotiations. First of all, we can increase the portion of indexed gas in our long-term contracts. The second, this is usually what people perceive on the surface but below that, we also try to bring down the level of oil indexed prices or to revise those oil indexed prices in order to limit the impact of oil increases. And, of course, we want to reduce off-take commitments. So, for us, in working with our suppliers, these are the things that we tend to avail ourselves of.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the impact of the spread on our long-term gas supply, and you can see on the slide what happened in 2011. Okay. We didn't have a take or pay, even though in Europe, gas consumption, it went down by about 10%. We're still waiting for the final figures on that. But it was because of the warm weather conditions, nonetheless, we did manage to uphold our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:01:27) to be our long-term supply. We also managed to renegotiate the things with practically all of our suppliers and so as a result, the gas supply business in GDF SUEZ accounts is still in the black. We're looking at &#x20AC;200 million to &#x20AC;300 million for 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at what we anticipate happening in 2012. Well, first of all, if we look at our residual exposure to the spread is extremely limited because it's already February. It's just a few terawatt hours, so it's basically negligible.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in 2012, we will fully benefit from all of the renegotiations that were achieved in 2011, and in particular, the share of market index prices which was at an average of about 10% for our entire portfolio going up to 25%, and we also have the reduction in oil-indexed prices. So, as a result, what we can say today is that the results for the gas supply business in 2012 will be more or less equivalent to those that we've seen in 2011. For the time being, we don't anticipate any major improvement in our results, but the result will still be a positive one.</p>
          <p>And a third component that I'd like to discuss with you and it's important because it's part of our long-term strategy. We want &#x2013; we have the right to renegotiate 80% of our gas &#x2013; our long-term gas volume supplies before the end of next year.</p>
          <p>For 2013, moving further down the growth with our forecast, our exposure to the spread in 2013 will be equivalent to last year at the same time, because basically, our portfolio of customers is about the same, that's 100 terawatt hours that we're going to narrow down throughout this year by once again using all of the various mechanisms that I've already mentioned, and in particular, price renegotiations that we'll apply for 2013. So, we are making progressive leaps forward year in, year out in order to limit our exposure. And again, I really do want to stress this, the business is making a profit, of course, but the profits aren't as high as they once were.</p>
          <p>So, what else are we forecasting? Well, generally, we tend to think that the spread will narrow over the next few months with restoration of balance that should kick in by 2014. That's our best estimate on the basis of current knowledge with reopening of a new cycle of negotiations on prices.</p>
          <p>So, just to sum, we have a rather complicated issue when it comes to long-term contracts. We also have a different structure with our downstream portfolio which sets us apart from our competitors. We also have a wide range of different sources of supply and a greater flexibility especially because of our capacity in LNG. And this is why it's possible for us to reach agreements with our suppliers year in, year out on the terms.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at what's going on in France in 2011. There were two major events that occurred. First, gas rates were frozen that were announced by the government in the middle of last year. This decision was overturned by the Conseil d'Etat in December 2011. The second event which is tied into the first one is that, we have a new rate of formula that is part of the regulatory framework that currently applies and that was established in 2011. So, in 2011, the main change was &#x2013; well, was introduced in order to reflect this change from 10% to 25% of our gas supply being indexed on the market. So, basically, the framework in France hasn't changed. It's just the formula that's changed, and in fact this formula will be up for review on a periodic basis, that was part of the regulatory framework or re-framework that was established. So, we are going to maintain our long-term supply contract vis-&#xE0;-vis our private customers in France.</p>
          <p>And secondly, there's also the maintenance of sales margin, this has been kept onboard with the framework that was adopted in 2010. And also, we have adopted a formula to our long-term contracts. And as you know, there will be a new adjustment to rates on the 1st of July 2012.</p>
          <p>So, having said all this, if we look at what happened in 2011, what we see is that our costs weren't totally carried over into our rates, and so there is a shortfall of about &#x20AC;400 million for the entire year and roughly &#x20AC;290 million of that kicked in the fourth quarter. And the group has filed a claim before the Conseil d'Etat, and the Conseil d'Etat should be handing down a decision within the next few months so that our costs can be reflected more accurately in the prices.</p>
          <p>So, the shortfall for 2011 isn't something that we've decided to just swallow. We actually involved in legal proceedings to recoup that. For 2012, we received an increase on the 1st of January of 4.4% which was once our cost. And so, in July we will see where we stand before requesting an adjustment of the equity downwards depending on prices and how they fluctuate between now and then.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Belgium and in particular, I'll speak mostly about nuclear energy. Four comments; firstly, the contribution of the nuclear industry for 2012 and 2013 has already been established, &#x20AC;550 million for the entire industry. For GDF SUEZ, our share is &#x20AC;466 million. However, this figure has to be put into the proper context that is, the real impact that this has on our net result, &#x20AC;250 million on the basis of prevailing conditions for implementing this contribution and particular, the fact that it is tax deductible.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the results of the stress tests that were organized after the tragedy at Fukushima, we anticipate the final results by the middle of the year. What we can say so far is that the preliminary conclusions confirm the safety and solidity of Belgian nuclear power plants. They also confirm the high degree of safety in the group and confirm that the group has always made this its top priority in Belgium.</p>
          <p>They've also proven the great efficiency of the power plants and the expertise of the people in charge of operating, these power plants in Belgium, which has given these power plants one of the world's highest availability rates. So, the group has highly efficient power plants that are extremely sound. That's what the stress tests are telling and now also they are fit for service provided the policy decisions make it possible.</p>
          <p>Let's look at stress test CapEx results. Again, this figure is just in order of magnitude because the final figures haven't come in yet, but we're looking at about &#x20AC;200 million in order to incorporate the results of the resistance test for the seven power plants that we have in Belgium.</p>
          <p>The third point deals with the extension of the working life of the three oldest power plants. Firstly, the Belgian government has decided to uphold the provisions of a law that was adopted in 2003 which called for the closure of the three oldest power plants by 2015. But the government in Belgium has also said that it would review this question, especially in light of the findings of the report on the ability to provide energy supply security for the country by the end of June 2012. Of course, the company and the government have every interest in finding the definitive conclusions of all of this, because we don't want to hold up any necessary investment decisions.</p>
          <p>So by the end of June, we should know what's going on, of course, now, if the government does opt to extend the life span of these power plants for another 10 years, because this is one of the hypotheses that the government is looking at, our CapEx obligations would be &#x20AC;1 billion, &#x20AC;700 million would fall to GDF SUEZ, because we don't have all of the power plants. And also, we would also have to do all of the CapEx that stem from this stress test, so that gives an order magnitude of all of the money that's at stake in Belgium. Just one last point, the group has decided to review its overall strategy and this is one of the things that we'll be working on throughout 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, let me tell you a little bit about the Energy Europe business line. First of all, why had we set up this new business line and what are its objectives. Well, this is something that's part and parcel of our attempts to contend with changing energy markets in Europe; and also, we want to be one step ahead of the game as European markets do change. So, within one single business line, we put together all of our unregulated assets in the energy sector in order to be well placed, in order to get maximum value out of these assets through more integrated and optimized management.</p>
          <p>So, the new business line has been in operation starting from the 1st of January this year and it brings together all of the group's activities in Continental Europe, excluding the UK, in the following areas: electricity generation, management of energy, portfolio management and trading, this really is the core function of this business as well as marketing and sales; downstream activities. So, what have been &#x2013; the other things that have been included under this business line; first of all, we have everything that we do in France, the Energy business line of France as well as Global Gas &amp; LNG, with the exception of LNG. Although LNG and E&amp;P still remain part of Global Gas &amp; LNG.</p>
          <p>And then, we have two business areas from Benelux, Germany and Europe, all of those things that were not France, actually it's everything that is to the south <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:28). So, basically that gives us a business line and that has a total installed capacity of 40 gigawatts, 6.5 gigawatts of which are from renewable sources, 17% relatively high proportion. We have a highly diversified energy mix with low CO2 emissions, 22 million customers with 30,000 employees and an industrial footprint in 13 countries.</p>
          <p>EBITDA is about &#x20AC;4 billion pro forma for 2011 and you will see the first reporting of this business line during the presentation of the half-year results in the middle of 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, what's the outlook growth; of course, all of this will depend on the overall business climate and the market in general. But we have a large number of gigawatts that are under construction. You can see on this slide. We have 2 gigawatts that are under construction. You can see on the screen, red is coal; biomass is light green, et cetera. We also are going to make sure that this business line can take a financial stake in the development of LNG working with the B3G business line in order to have proper integration of the group's activities when it comes to developing LNG.</p>
          <p>Just one last point, you can see our objectives for growth. And on this slide, you can see that we're going to be giving priority to renewables and the four things that we are going to try to stick to in building this business line is, firstly, integrating activities whenever possible and whenever necessary want to have a European vision of the business. Secondly, we want to optimize all of our assets. Basically, this means is to have a one single source of managerial responsibility for all of the activities of trading, supply, portfolio management. Thirdly, flexibility because in Europe in the future the person or the company in fact has the greatest amount of flexibility, we'll certainly stand stronger than the others, so we have to do everything we can to get more value out of our assets, but being flexible.</p>
          <p>And of course, we also have to be innovative. The energy sector in Europe is changing a lot, especially when it comes to marketing and sales. So, our strategic priorities are very clear. We wanted to be the best-in-class when it comes to the integration of our energy management activities. We want to achieve operational excellence in the creation of value. We want to defend our positions in copper and to strengthen our position in Italy, Poland and Romania. We also want to give <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:16:30) for the development of electricity generation, and we want to strengthen our relationship with our clients.</p>
          <p>But our more short-term objectives are, first of all, to put into service our new assets in the particular the three power plants I just mentioned. We wanted to tap additional synergies to the tune of &#x20AC;200 million of the medium run. We also want to continue adjusting our long-term contracts that's what I was referring to you a few moments ago, as well as developing activities in renewables with major projects in the offshore France with wind power plants and also onshore wind farms in Romania, Poland and in France.</p>
          <p>So, the group has clearly decided to have a managerial structure that has a European vision, focusing on the three main business lines in our energy business, generation, energy management, marketing and sales, in order to be more effective and take advantage even more of the opportunities afforded to us by the European markets.</p>
          <p>So, I shall stop there and give the floor back to G&#xE9;rard.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. Well, you've seen how ambitious we are as we look at this new Europe sector that Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois has just taken over and is in charge of now. Now, before we answer your questions, I would just like to stress on a few key &#x2013; stress a few key issues.</p>
          <p>First of all, the excellent 2011 results, I think are very, very solid, despite several exogenous events which were really favorable to us that year. Secondly, although this will mean that we can offer maintained a dividend of &#x20AC;50 (sic) [&#x20AC;0.50] for shareholders stable compared to last year were prudent as you noticed regarding short-term 2012 guidance is prudence, because at the moment we find ourselves in the economic environment which is extremely uncertain, to say the least. Although, as you'd have seen for 2011, and in fact, you can see that next time this year, we are withstanding very well with the economic situation, thanks to some unique trump cards particularly compared to our competitors, what are those trump cards. Well, a very solid basis, a very resilient basis when it comes to recurrent product lines of solid positions on high growth markets. More than half of our electric capacity is outside of Europe, which means that we really can gain from the growth which comes from those countries, 80% of the growth in energy requirements throughout the world comes from these countries outside the OECD.</p>
          <p>Progress, we've also achieved when it comes to long-term supplies. We've renegotiated our contracts with pretty much all of our suppliers for 2012 and the following years. And in actual fact, as a result of that, we've considerably improved the competitiveness of our portfolio for gas supplies. And we, I think, we now &#x2013; given us all the possibility of opening up those negotiations again, if that competitivity or competitiveness would be called into question.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we really benefit from an extremely strong financial structure. We have one of the best ratings in the industry. The financial structure, of course, was beefed up even more this year thanks to our optimization program for our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, in order to weather the crisis, and as we continue to invest, the group is going to concentrate in the short term on the four main priorities that we've had. And that will allow us to improve even more our flexibility and our profitability. Our business lines, our development model, offer the group in the long-term huge potential for growth and our merchant activities will be making the most of that as soon as the economy recovers in those areas.</p>
          <p>Now, we will be relying on three strategic avenues as it were speeding up the developments we have in emerging countries. In Europe, we want to integrate, optimize and refocus and we want strengthen our positions on strong recurrent activities, gas, energy services, infrastructure and environmental services.</p>
          <p>So, now before I give you the floor, I'd just like to remind you what the two coming events are. We've got our AGM, Monday, 23rd of April and the next day, on the 24th of April, we have a Telephone Conference when we publish our quarterly results.</p>
          <p>Okay. Now, it's over to you. We'll be happy to answer your questions. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois and Isabelle and myself. Who would like to start?</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (81:41) from Paribas. There are three questions. First of all, the 2012 EBITDA, you've got an efficiency plan which should provide &#x20AC;600 million compared to 2011, and you said, talked about a lot of operational things which should improve things. But nevertheless, your EBITDA growth is only &#x20AC;500 million between the two years. Can you help us understand why that is the case? You're being very cautious there.</p>
          <p>Second question. This morning in the Belgian newspapers, it said that the Ministry of Energy for Walloonia area of Belgium has a project apparently to impose additional taxes on nuclear energy. Do you have anything to say on that, do you think it's credible, do you think it's legal?</p>
          <p>Third question. Could you tell us when it comes to renegotiating your contracts, whether the drop in the compulsory purchased share is important or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, we will deal with those questions, all three of us. Isabelle will answer the first, I'll take the second and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, the third.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you did note that we, in 2012, are continuing our efforts to bring down costs. We're stepping up speed compared to 2011. As I told you, the price situation for energy in Europe is going to remain stable or may slightly drop in 2012. In the guidance that we have provided, we've been cautious and we've &#x2013; we've considered that the prices are going to drop slightly, particularly the spark spread. We consider there to be a deterioration in the spark spread, which is why despite the &#x20AC;600 million &#x2013; I mean that is our target, well, despite that, I can't confirm the figures that have been provided earlier on today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. <mark type="ph" /> Kevin (83:38), coming to your second question, to be clear, we don't have any information regarding the statements that you've referred to. When it comes to one region in Belgium <mark type="indiscernible" /> (83:52) Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois has told this, what the situation is today. The federal government &#x2013; the new federal government, I should say, has decided to bring up to &#x20AC;550 million for the entire industry the proportion of nuclear energy in the country. And I'd like to remind you that we had an agreement &#x2013; a contractual agreement with the Belgian government that was signed with Mr. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (84:24) &#x2013; no, I'm sorry, Mr. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (84:27). And we consider that we still have the possibility &#x2013; the legal possibility of using all legal recourse that we might want to. If we want to challenge decisions, which might be counter to that agreement, that agreement, may I remind you, stipulates an extension of the life expectancy of nuclear power stations, 10 years more, but also contribution of &#x20AC;240 million at most.</p>
          <p>That being said, we're open to negotiation and we're willing to discuss things with the new Belgian government. We're happy to do that in the next few weeks and months, because some decisions still need to be taken. The government's given itself six years to come up with a plan for electricity supply. So, the question begs itself, what will be the role of former power stations, which will be reaching 40-year lifespan in 2015? What's going to happen to those three power stations when it comes to security and supply for the next few years? So, there is room for discussion, but for us, the &#x20AC;550 million amount was fixed by the government and there's no question of going beyond that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question. Yes, we have been able to look at our offtake commitment and take up. The obvious thing is that given the fact that we had the hottest year in many years in 2011, we haven't had to resort to take-or-pay. So, the situation, I think is, satisfactory. That being said, of course, we're not saying that we don't &#x2013; we would never resort to take-or-pay. I mean, if circumstances were to present themselves, then we'd have to see what we would do. But it's also one of the possibilities, which is open to us, thanks to the contracts. But for the moment, 2011, which is a very hot year, more than 10% drop in gas, no need or no obligation to resort to take-or-pay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just stress one thing? I'd like to come back to the question you asked me, sir, the relationship between the &#x20AC;600 million and the &#x20AC;500 millions and change in the EBITDA. I'd just like to recall that in our guidance, it does include the full-year effect of the spin-offs in 2011. So, &#x20AC;400 million of EBITDA and &#x20AC;200 million of recurrent net income group share. So, the guidance does include those effects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, if you don't mind. The first, guidance on the recurrent net results, you say a spread of (87:35) &#x20AC;3.5 billion to &#x20AC;4 billion in 2012, &#x20AC;5 billion for 2015. Is that a straight line between 2012 and 2015, or will there be a dip, for example, in 2013? Secondly, commenting on the &#x2013; what was asked by Benjamin, &#x20AC;600 million that you're hoping to earn in 2012, what's your net share, because some of your subsidiaries are consolidated and therefore have minority stakes? But secondly, out of the &#x20AC;600 million, what would still be there in 2015?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, we expect 2012, 2013 to see average growth, perhaps, a dip after that, or a change after that, as you say. That's unique to us. I mean, the 2012, 2013 years are probably going to be difficult years from a macroeconomic point of view. We are doing well because we're even planning on growing moderately, but despite the fact that the economic environment is difficult. But all of the accumulated assets that we're making coming online and services and the fact that we have in our portfolio two types of business, business which is extremely recurrent, be it infrastructure here in Europe, gas infrastructure picking up, but also contracted activities with major internationals, such in the Middle East, where everything is contracted, Brazil, Peru, most of it is contracted, Asia as well.</p>
          <p>So, we've got this very tough basis, which gives us enormous resistance, even when merchant activity suffers and shrinks, it's given us stability. And when &#x2013; in the second half of that period of time, there will be an improvement in the economic environment, in the specific parameters of our industry, well, then we'll be benefiting from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, the second question, synergies. The &#x20AC;600 million is the net effect. It's the impact on the EBITDA for the group of the cost reduction work. And I would even say, it's net-net. I mean, it's net as a result of some efforts. I mean, take purchasing, where we're renegotiating our agreements with our suppliers frequently and we also consider that we are sending back some of those savings to the customers. So, the &#x20AC;600 million really is the visible part when it comes to the changes in the group's EBITDA. And I should point out that, of course, these are sustainable savings, what we can see in 2012, we will be keeping in 2015. Other questions? In the second row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morgan Stanley. First question, if you don't mind. Now, your guidance recurrent net result 2012 is before Belgian nuclear contributions. Now, is it after taking on board the possible dilution of the spin-offs, the first two thirds, &#x20AC;200 million impact, I imagine, &#x20AC;100 million for the last third. Is that a reasonable assumption? Has it been factored into your guidance for 2012?</p>
          <p>Secondly, European electric <mark type="ph" /> plate (1:31:30), I have the impression that's why you're being most cautious when it comes to changes in commodity prices. In your slides, I think you provided percentages in volumes &#x2013; hedged volumes for 2012 and 2013, could you give us an idea of the hedged prices and how they compare to the prices achieved in 2011? You've commented one prudent hypothesis regarding this spark spread for 2012 and 2013. When we look at the market spreads you can see that they're already very, very low and it's difficult to imagine a drop unless we go into the red. I mean, perhaps you may be thinking here about the fact that you've got spreads achieved in 2011, which are taking the benefits from past hedging. So you're thinking perhaps of moving towards the market. Could you tell us something about this in terms of megawatt hours?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Isabelle, would you like to start?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your first question, it is indeed true that when we talk about recurrent net results group share, we're not including in that aggregate the nuclear contribution as a result of our business in Belgium for the next two years. We are, however, including, not only the impact of spin-offs, which already been concluded in 2011, but also the end of our spin-off program. I would suggest that we should take &#x2013; I think we should take a slightly lower rate compared to the rate we took in the first half of the plan.</p>
          <p>Prices now &#x2013; now, the assumptions on which we've been working are on cheap price assumptions, the prices at which &#x2013; the average prices at which we sell, particularly for stable base activities compared to 2011 and, however, the deterioration in the spark spread, it may drop even more. It's very volatile today, so we've taken a cautious assumption. But in terms of peaks, the forwards show a slight drop for 2012 compared to 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just coming back to this last issue, two comments. In 2011, it's true that we had income which included 2008, 2009 and 2010's businesses. So, those were years where the electricity prices were very high. 2012, we're talking about 2009, 2010, and 2011, so that's the crisis years, so price is lower. And as Isabelle has said, spark spreads, particularly for gas, are not good at the moment. So, the power stations are producing less than they might have been, if we had had another scenario, because the electricity prices remain generally low, whereas gas has gone up. So, this spark-spread effect is because of cautious &#x2013; caution. It's not necessarily the developments we might have had when it comes to electricity prices looking one year or 18 months down the road. Other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Deutsche Bank. Several questions. The first, I wanted to come back to the 2012 EBITDA. Okay. We understand the thrust. We're talking about &#x20AC;16.5 billion EBITDA in 2011, so for the major projects we're expecting &#x20AC;900 million growth in EBITDA. At least for this year, if you look at the assumption &#x2013; an assumption case, wiping out the weather effect, &#x20AC;400 million lease has been retrieved. And then you've got stabilized margins in France for gas. Another &#x20AC;300 million retrieved, so a little bit of growth. What you get then, &#x20AC;18 billion? Even if the spark spreads are lower, I don't think the impact is going to be that huge, perhaps several hundred million euros. So, why you're being cautious of the other areas of business?</p>
          <p>Second question, could you give us some information about the D&amp;A for 2012? I know the CapEx has stabilized, are those one-offs or is there something else, and in terms of the dilution for spin-offs? And then generally speaking, you've given us an update on guidance for global gas, LNG in terms of EBITDA, &#x20AC;2.5 billion. What's the breakdown of E&amp;P, procurements in LNG? And one &#x2013; might one think perhaps that with your exposure to oil-gas spreads, do you think &#x20AC;1 megawatt-hours &#x2013; well, tell us what you think about that in terms of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll tackle the first two questions. EBITDA 2012. Now, look, I <mark type="ph" /> can confirm whatever you said (1:36:45) and I won't comment on it again. One additional thing, though, our margins for the EBITDA in terms of gas supplies are positive for 2011 by &#x2013; for reasons of prudence, we've brought it down to breakeven in 2012. So, that's additional information that you can note down. G&amp;A will drop in 2012, partly &#x2013; well, mostly because of the one-off effect that I mentioned earlier on, linked to the acquisition of International Power, but also because we've had provisions on Melbourne, and that's being commented on considering I don't want to stress or comment on that anymore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You asked some questions about gas. E&amp;P, first of all, in 2012, there's a drop comes mostly from the scope effect, particularly the fact that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:37:51) has been spun off. As I remember, that represented 5 million barrels, so that can be felt. So, compared to 2011, which is around 58 million barrels, we kind of go down to 55 million barrels. And obviously, there will be the price effect which may have an effect as well. But we're not expecting an increase, a huge increase in E&amp;P in 2012 compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>Coming now to gas activities, I've given you supply figures for 2011. Excluding LNG, 2011 results were about &#x20AC;200 million, &#x20AC;300 million. For 2012, we're not expecting any improvement. So, roughly speaking, it's about the same levels. There are some small uncertainties regarding the real amounts of the trade-offs we might be doing over the year. But that's roughly where we think it's going to be. I don't think it's fair to say &#x20AC;1 equals &#x20AC;100 million. It's too simplistic. Again, &#x20AC;1 equalling &#x20AC;100 million, that's the idea when you're looking <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:39:04) portfolio. But at the end of the day, it's not really what you see in our accounts, because we are still in the black.</p>
          <p>So, yes, there is a drop because of the spread. What's going to happen to the spreads in 2012 and 2013? We'll see. But for 2012, we know. So, for 2012, I mean, we want to look at &#x2013; don't want to look at the financial results for 2011 and deduct &#x20AC;500 million, that would be wrong. So, we're talking about the same kind of difficulties in &#x2013; I mean, reduction in activities compared to the past. To simplify things, when there was no spread, that activity produced &#x20AC;700 million, &#x20AC;800 million. Since the spread, we're talking about &#x20AC;500 million less. We gave you the figures for last year, it's roughly that, perhaps a little bit more in terms of drop. So, the balance is, one we're trying to renew this year. Every year, we try and wipe out that impact, because of our &#x2013; through our negotiations, our portfolios, and that &#x20AC;500 million coming from a residual, probably about 1 terawatt hour, it will change depending on the closure of the spread.</p>
          <p>So, as long as the spread doesn't close, well, you have to think about that figure in terms of financial results. And as spread closes, I think that we will see an increase in our financial results. When? I don't know. But at the moment, we're being cautious, it's true.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Another question up here, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric Lopez from Merrill Lynch. Couple of questions. Firstly, could you tell us the relationship between your EBITDA guidance and net EBITDA, &#x20AC;500 million in net result, it's not the same thing as EBITDA. So, is it &#x20AC;17 billion or is it &#x20AC;4 billion plus &#x20AC;17 billion? Second question, E&amp;P, you've just said that you don't anticipate any improvement. We see a 3 billion &#x2013; a 3 million barrel reduction in production. 40% of LNG with a spot as <mark type="ph" /> $47 (101:30) and the dollar is much stronger than it was last year. So, I'm really having a difficult time trying to have proper guidance for E&amp;P. And then, third question, you've mentioned the accounting impacts of 2013 with the end of proportional integration permissions, what would the impact be in terms of your net debt and EBITDA for all of the things that are currently integrated proportionally in the group?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll try to come up with the answers to your questions. And on the last question, I'm not sure if we're going to be able to give you an answer off the cuff. But on the first point, I'll give the floor to Isabelle to talk about the relationship between EBITDA and -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the &#x20AC;17 billion in EBITDA is more or less in the middle of the range, &#x20AC;3.5 billion to &#x20AC;4 billion net recurring income group share. I think that those are the figures that you should be thinking about. When it comes to E&amp;P, yes, EBITDA will be going up next year less than in &#x2013; than it did in 2011. But that being said, it will be growing.</p>
          <p>And on the third question, what could we say at this stage? Regarding the future consequences of changes in accounting practices, I think that's what you meant in your question that is when there is no longer any possibility of having proportional integration and how that might impact different indicators.</p>
          <p>Well, the consolidated activities via proportional integration, it's a very small portion of our EBITDA. We are not one of those groups who will be impacted to a great extent by these changes, but they will have an impact on us. What you could just think about as an order of magnitude is that if either we take all of these businesses and have either fully consolidated figures or using equity method, there's a difference of about &#x20AC;3 billion in debt. Yes?</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:43:57) Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Good morning. Three questions on renegotiations of contracts. Have you given anything in exchange in drops in volumes or less flexibility, that's why we have less Russian gas hitting the market now? What would be the date of entering into force of these renegotiations? I think it was the 1st of January 2012, is there any retroactive effect for part of 2011? And will you be able to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:44:20) on the basis of what exist rights now or wholly oil index prices as they were <mark type="ph" /> in the asset (1:44:30)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking about renegotiations with Russia or in general? In general, okay, because the situation varies depending on which supplier we're talking about. The idea, of course, is not to have our portfolio become less flexible through these negotiations. In fact, we want to enhance flexibility. Of course, we don't want to disclose too much information on such as sensitive issues, you can clearly understand it. But it's in our interest to have as much flexibility as possible. So, it's not because there have been some failed Russian delivery either.</p>
          <p>And I think this cold snap has such a huge impact on all of Europe that we weren't able to supply all of Europe and that change things. So, basically, what you're seeing is that the system is robust even under conditions with a very strong demand. Now, the date of entry into floors &#x2013; the date of entries in the floors, well, again, it depends on the contract we're talking about, but we don't &#x2013; and I wouldn't advise you to anticipate very much of any retroactive effect for 2011. It would actually only have an effect on 2012 figures.</p>
          <p>In future renegotiations, are we going &#x2013; no we're going &#x2013; the baseline is the situation is the same as today, not previous contracts. What we forecast for 2013, in most cases, again, this is not something that applies across the board. But what is generally in the offing is that we'll take 2012 as the starting point and 2013 could be a continuation of that. Or if one of the parties doesn't agree, we could perhaps reopen discussions on it. That's how things work. So, we always as a starting point, where we currently stand, because the right to reopen discussions. And this is important for us, because for some of these contracts, we renegotiate things every two years. And so, we can renegotiate things for 2013, but we're only going to do that if we think it's favorable to us. Otherwise, we will just stick to the terms of the contract that was adopted for 2012 and carried over for 2013.</p>
          <p>Okay. This is true for some contracts. Now, for others, again, we have many different contracts, many different suppliers, but basically that's the situation.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions at the back. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Good morning. First question. I think for the last 16 years now you've tend to streamline the group and simplify things. Here you've done a lot of things to streamline the organization. Now, you have a nice &#x2013; for E&amp;P, for example, you're working with CIC, with International Power, it seems that you're really thinking in terms of large chunks of the business. Mr. Mestrallet, which are the chunks that you're most interested in and that you're going to hang on to over the next 18, 24 months? And what would be something that would trigger a further drive to simplify things within the group?</p>
          <p>And then, one question on Global Gas. Do you think that 18 &#x2013; a fleet of 18 tankers is enough? Do you think it's optimal regarding the different arrangements you have with sourcers? I think that your terminal in Montoir is also going to be able to take LNG and ship it abroad, so you have lots of different terminals around the world. Is this fleet adequate or do you think you'll have to increase the number of tankers you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, perhaps, we could ask Jean-Marie Dauger to say something about the optimization and the size of our fleet of tankers, especially taking into consideration the new large LNG contracts that we've signed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer your first question. Our structure is sound. We optimize it on a permanent basis. We have entered into some strategic partnerships to them in 2011. And from that standpoint, I think that, we'll give ourselves a break for the time being. The Caisse des D&#xE9;p&#xF4;ts and CNP in gas transport is a partnership that is very useful and holds great promise for us, gives us a strong basis for future growth.</p>
          <p>And secondly, indeed, with CIC, the same applies. We have no specific preference for any specific chunk. Our strategy is a whole. The strategy can be boiled down to some very simple things. First of all, we want to accelerate growth in emerging markets. We want to tap internal synergies through integration in Europe, and we want to strengthen our business lines in highly recurring businesses, for example, gas infrastructures, energy services, that is, energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is something that is part and parcel of all energy policies around the world, no matter what country we're talking about, not just in Europe and which is why we are developing these services elsewhere. And lastly, we're going to be growing our environmental services and other business as well. So, in rolling out this strategy, I mean these really are the points that we're focusing on. That's what managers is thinking about.</p>
          <p>And you can see that our top priority was acceleration of development in the emerging markets of the world. It's something that really kicked in with quite a sensation in fact in 2011. In February, we closed the deal with International Power and then with after-sales service. And what do I mean by that? First of all, the successful integration within less than one year, all the management teams are there, everything is working really well. The working relationship between the old players and the new ones, they're integrated together. In fact, we have some people coming from International Power and about twice as many people coming from GDF SUEZ. All of that is working smoothly.</p>
          <p>Also, in after-sales service, I'm referring to the continuation of developing electricity generation in these countries. I've seen clearly a long list of different projects that are in the pipeline. And also &#x2013; we're also going to be taking this enormous operation off of the balance sheet. In fact, this is the second largest merger and acquisition of all of those that we announced in 2010 closing &#x2013; to close in February last year. And during that same year, we practically eliminated the impact of that acquisition from all of the financial obligations of the group.</p>
          <p>But we're going to continue on the same road. We're going to continue to develop our businesses in the emerging markets. This is one of our prime concerns. Europe right now, in economic and financial terms, is encountering major hardships and I certainly hope that Europe can find the ways and means of getting out of this. But growth in the emerging markets is still there. And we're lucky to be able to tap this. Actually, it's not really luck. We've been preparing this for the last 15 years. And what this means is that we're in a financial position that enables us to continue tapping this growth potential and that really is what management is all about.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the structure, yes, we've simplified things in Europe this year. As of the 1 of January, the new Europe energy business line has kicked in and it is a major milestone in simplifying the group's organizational structure. Jean-Marie, can you answer that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The optimization of our fleet, it depends on whatever timing we're talking about. Generally speaking, we have a fleet of &#x2013; a long-term fleet of methane tankers that I would say is commensurate with our off-take commitments and our supply commitments. That's the baseline for optimizing it. But, of course, because of those, we can do lots of other things to optimize the fleet.</p>
          <p>But I would just answer in sum that our fleet is well-optimized and it continues to evolve on the basis of new projects and supply commitments. But for more short-term commitments, therefore the spot markets are one, two, three years down the road. We also avail ourselves of the flexibility of our long-term fleet, but we also access the market to find shorter-term transport arrangements. And in the very short run, if we had more takers in our fleet, we would be optimizing even further.</p>
          <p>So, we're always looking for short-term capacity on the market. Having said this, of course, the market is totally saturated now. What this means is there is no excess shipping capacity for the short run. And this is going to remain the case for a little while. Of course, the market will quickly bounce back because, as you know, in the next two years, there's going to be a large number of methane tankers coming out of the shipyards. But I would say that long-term, we're set. In short-term, we would like to have a little bit more capacity that we could tap into but the market is really tight right now. Within two years, the market should change.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Marie. Yes, another question. Over here, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Natixis. Just one point of clarification and then a question. The clarification on hedging prices for Germany and Belgium, can you compare this two last year? Electricity, yes, it's about electricity, I apologize. And the second question has to do with reviewing your overall strategy for nuclear power. Perhaps you were thinking about this throughout 2012 but could you just give us an inkling of what you mean by reviewing your overall nuclear power policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me take your second question, first, on nuclear power. Why did we set a deadline for coming up with a final tweak to our nuclear power policy and to update it by the middle of 2012? Well, by then three major events will have taken place. First of all, Fukushima. Fukushima impacted the entire nuclear power industry across the world. In fact, some countries made certain decisions as a result of this. Other countries made other decisions.</p>
          <p>The stress tests have been done. In fact, in passing, you can see that not all the countries have the same safety requirements throughout Europe, if you look at the investments that are now going to be required pursuant to the stress tests in order to have a consistent level of safety throughout Europe. So in some countries more investments will be required than others. Example, you could see that our power plants are particularly well-placed because most of the required equipment in the European power plants, for example, the second diesel back-up generators that's in a bunker, a second control room that's also protected, a second source of water-cooling, that's also a back-up security system in case the primary system fails. Well, all of our nuclear power plants in Belgium already have that because the federal authorities in that country imposes requirements, so we have that.</p>
          <p>So, the results of the stress tests will be fully understood and fully conclusive, because this process in fact, hasn't reached its conclusion yet. The operators have already submitted their reports. The national nuclear safety authorities have drawn their conclusions. And now, across European countries, between the national safety authorities, there's a round of consultations to make sure that we are dealing with a consistent playing field until we have to wait for that process to pan out over the next few months. And by the end of the first half of the year, we will have a very clear picture of where we stand.</p>
          <p>So, the first thing I can say is Fukushima. It's quite clear that internationally part of the potential growth for nuclear power globally has contracted, but there's still room for growth in Asia, in particular, Korea, China, India. These countries haven't reigned in their nuclear power programs. Rather it's in the western countries that these programs have been curbed. This is the case that applies in the United States. But, of course, in the United States, the nuclear power program has been reigned in. It's probably less due to Fukushima and the stress test but rather to the market conditions because power generation and gas are much more competitive than nuclear power in that country, especially in those states that have decided to get into the merchant business. So, that's a very important point. So, all of the consequences of Fukushima haven't yet manifested themselves.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Belgium. The government that was set up in December set a six-month deadline to come up with its refitting program in Belgium. And the government will be making a decision about these three oldest power plants. And we will be engaged in consultations with the Belgian government. Will all three of them have to be closed or decommissioned, maybe some of them will? We don't know yet. But we will know, in theory, at least by the middle of the year.</p>
          <p>And then one last point, in France. It's clear that elections will be behind us by then. We'll have a new government, a new President and perhaps the policy will remain unchanged. Perhaps it will change when it comes to nuclear power. And this is also something that might have an influence on what we're thinking about. So, Fukushima, Belgium and France, we will have more known knowns by the middle of the year. And it's at that time that we will be able to update our nuclear strategy.</p>
          <p>Just a couple of figures though. Nuclear power worldwide represents about 15% of all electricity production. For us, it's about 10% and the percentage is going down because you've seen all these other projects that are not nuclear-based. We're increasing our capacity year-in, year-out. And so mathematically, the proportion of nuclear power goes down. We're also the largest non-nuclear power producer worldwide. So, this is one of our assets, one our strengths. Most countries that have medium and long-term plans are trying to boost the amount of gas that they have in energy mix. And also with renewable, they're becoming more and more prevalent and so that gives us greater flexibility as back-up sources of energy, namely gas. And we have over 300 gas-fired plants around the world, the largest network of gas-fired plants anywhere.</p>
          <p>Now, of course, we will fine-tune our nuclear strategy. But, as you can see, most of the electricity that's generated in the world comes from other sources and for GDF SUEZ, the bulk of our growth potential is to be found in this highly diversified energy mix where we have developed very strong positions over the last few years. I have just been told that we have time for only one last question. Yeah, &#x20AC;55 is the <mark type="ph" /> chief (2:02:15) price for 2011. One last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'm from Barclays. I have two questions. First of all -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did say you can only ask one. Okay, well, go ahead with two then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My first question, coming back to the spread impact on oil and gas, you said that you've got some cuts in the index prices per barrel. Could you tell us what that represents in euros per megawatt hours? Second question, the auditors' reports on the cost of nuclear industry, they came out with economic cost of &#x20AC;49, if you factor in additional CapEx. Could you tell us what you think about &#x2013; what you think is going to happen regarding electricity prices in France as a result of this report? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first question &#x2013; the answer is no. Second question, a little bit harder to answer with a yes or no. The auditors' report, I would refer you on that to the press release &#x2013; sorry, the release published by the Energy Minister, Mr. Besson. He commented on that report when it was published. And, of course, the press only talks about the &#x20AC;49 price, whilst Mr. Besson is quite clear. And he highlights four prices. I mean, there are two &#x2013; the first two which really are in the report and which illustrate that depending on the concept, the two &#x2013; first two prices are &#x20AC;32, &#x20AC;33 and the third is about &#x20AC;40 and the last is &#x20AC;49. I have the impression that only the last figure, &#x20AC;49, was the one that the press picked up on perhaps because some thought that it might be a good argument for increasing prices. But we noted the first two prices more than anything else. I mean &#x20AC;30 around and that indeed does reflect the direct costs of French nuclear power generation. And that didn't surprise us. In fact, it confirmed what we've been saying.</p>
          <p>We had actually suggested a price of &#x20AC;35. But we've been quite generous there because the cost price is lower than that which &#x2013; the auditors have confirmed that that &#x20AC;35 is a price at which today EDF sells energy to households and probably so it's a simple reference figure. And I should say in passing that since it's the actual price in which energy is sold today and if you look at what the EBITDA of the dominant operator is today, I don't see how they could earn as much money in France if the cost price was really &#x20AC;49.</p>
          <p>But coming back to my &#x20AC;33 that I mentioned, in Belgium, our cost price is slightly lower than &#x20AC;30 which is in line with the prices provided by the auditors because our power stations have better availability rate than the power stations elsewhere in Europe, particularly the French power stations, 10% more. So, we're generating 10% more kilowatt hours with the same power station. So, our cost price is about 10% lower than it is amongst our competitors. So, in the auditors' report, we've found confirmation of the figures that we had provided but now there's debate going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I think we'll stop there. We have to apologize, but time's up. I'd like to, again, tell you how confident we are about the future of the group. But also, we remain cautious about the short-term. Thank you very much.</p>
