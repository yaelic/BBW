        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good evening, everybody. Thank you, Karen. I'll try and keep the presentation short. I am trying to give you as much additional color as I can on the financial numbers before Richard talks to you about his priorities for DBS Group going forward. I will headline net profit before the one-time items, for the second quarter is $668 million.</p>
          <p>First, the one-time items, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $34 million for our investment in TMB Bank. This is reflecting a further decline of its market value to $143 million, which is about 3.5 billion baht at end June 2008. Offsetting this was a one-time gain from the sale of properties in Hong Kong, which amounted to $18 million. So, these two items are below the line and are not reflected in the $668 million earnings number.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we also consolidated Bowa Bank. This was completed end of May. The consolidation had little impact on our profit and loss statement this quarter except for certain balance sheet items, which I'll highlight in later slides.</p>
          <p>The operating environment in the second quarter remains challenging. Lower interest rates did affect our margins and subdued capital markets did reduce our fee income. Nevertheless, we were able to maintain revenues and manage our costs pressures to sustain net profit at year ago levels and compared to the previous quarter, our earnings rose 11%. The improvement over the previous quarter was led by a recovery in trading income and a decline in provisions. We had been ahead of the curve in our provisioning charges and we remain comfortable with the coverage we have for our total loan exposures, I will elaborate further later on.</p>
          <p>These are our first half numbers. For the first half, net profit was little changed compared to a year ago. Net interest income growth of 6% was partially offset by a decline in non-interest income of 4%. We had unfavorable credit markets, which affected trading performance in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>But we have been disciplined in managing our expenses in the first half, keeping our cost increase to 2%, which is in line with revenue growth. Specific provision charges for loans were higher this first half, amounting to 16 basis points of loans, compared to 10 basis points a year ago.</p>
          <p>Now, compared to the second half of 2007, our net profit rose 5%. Revenue growth of 3% was contributed by higher gains from the sales of investment securities. Again, our cost increases were kept at the same pace as revenue increase and provisions was lower by 25%, because we took significant provisions in the second half of 2007 for our CDO exposures.</p>
          <p>Now our key ratios. Net interest margins and fee income ratio were lower than the previous quarter and a year ago, reflecting a lower interest rate environment and subdued capital markets. The cost income ratio was stable, despite revenue pressures. ROE improved from the previous quarter but was slightly lower than a year ago, when operating conditions were more favorable. The NPL rate increased from 1% in the previous quarter to 1.4% and this is largely due to the consolidation of Bowa.</p>
          <p>Although the $2.3 billion of loans which we brought onto our balance sheet were considered good loans under Taiwan GAAP, we classified 17% of these loans as NPLs based on DBS Group classification. Of the NPLs from Bowa, 32% of Bowa's loans are actually still current in their principal and interest payments. Excluding Bowa, our NPL rate rose slightly from 1% to 1.1%, which is the level six months ago at end 2007. While macroeconomic risks have risen, our asset quality remains healthy and our provision coverage of more than 100% remains strong.</p>
          <p>Net interest income was maintained at $1.06 billion for the third consecutive &#x2013; successive quarter despite continuing margin pressures from lower Sing dollar interest rates. Net interest margin narrowed five basis points to 2.04%. Sing dollar SIBOR fell from an average of 1.7% in the first quarter to 1.3%, which reduced loan and interbank asset yields in Singapore. By managing our liabilities to achieve lower funding costs, we were able to soften the impact of lower asset yields although we did not fully offset it.</p>
          <p>In Hong Kong, net interest margins rose slightly to 1.92% from 1.90% in the previous quarter. The fixed deposit costs, which adversely impacted our Hong Kong NIM in the last quarter, were repriced and this helped our NIM, even though prime HIBOR spreads from 3.75% to 3.47% this quarter. Low Sing interest &#x2013; low Sing dollar interest rates will always be a margin headwind that we will have to manage. There are offsets that are somewhat in our control, which we will manage to counter the impact of lower Sing dollar interest rates. These are higher credit spreads for our new corporate loans, relatively stable housing loan yields, better asset mix and more favorable deposit mix.</p>
          <p>Loans rose 4% during the quarter to $119 billion. This is including Bowa's loan portfolio of $2.1 billion. Of this, 60% are to consumers and 40% to SMEs. If we were to exclude Bowa's loans, loans grew 2% during the quarter and 18% for the year. This compares with industry loan growth in Singapore of 5% for the quarter and 25% for the year and loan growth in Hong Kong of 6% for the quarter and 17% for the year. Loan growth in Hong Kong is comparable to the industry, but we had lower loan growth in Singapore, reflecting our effort to pare down some of the lower-yielding loans.</p>
          <p>Our loan growth this quarter was led by SME loans in Hong Kong. Growth rates for the various segments are in local currency terms. Singapore housing loans were up 2% for the quarter and up 6% for the year. Singapore SME loans were up 5% for the quarter and up 8% for the year. Hong Kong housing loans, up 2% for the quarter and up 5% for the year. Hong Kong SME loans. up 12% for the quarter, up 19% for the year. Corporate loans. down 1% for the quarter and up 36% for the year. While we expect loans to continue growing. the pace will moderate in the coming quarters with greater focus on improving margins.</p>
          <p>Fee income continues to be affected by weak capital markets with stockbroking, investment banking and wealth management fees falling from the previous quarter. But corporate and consumer fee activities remain strong. Trade remittances, loan-related fees, credit card fees are all higher than last year.</p>
          <p>Trading income recovered from the previous quarter's loss. During the second quarter customer flows and trading gains in interest rates and foreign exchange instruments helped turn the quarter into a profitable trading quarter. We saw lower gains from the sale of investment securities, which declined from 211 million in the previous quarter to $49 million, but it was because in the first quarter, there was an exceptional quarter with gains from the VISA IPO.</p>
          <p>Overall, non-interest income of 541 million was better than the 506 million the previous quarter and 524 million a year ago. Expenses of 682 million was 5% higher than the previous quarter and 4% higher than a year ago. Staff expenses increased due to higher base salary adjustments, which kicked in end of March. Headcount grew by 5% from the previous quarter, due to an addition of 843 staff from Bowa and head count increases in Indonesia and China and this was offset by head count productivity decreases or improvements in head count &#x2013; or decreases in head count productivity improvement in Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>Computerization expenses rose 7% from the previous quarter to 109 million, but were comparable to amounts spent in recent periods. The cost income ratio of 43% was similar to a year ago and it's slightly higher than the previous quarter. We remained very disciplined in managing our cost and with a challenging revenue environment, we continue to seek productivity improvement in our core markets, as we continue our expansion in Indonesia, mainland China, Taiwan, and India.</p>
          <p>Now moving onto our Hong Kong and overseas operations. The figures on this slide are in Sing dollars, so this reflects a 3% appreciation of the Singapore dollars against Hong Kong dollars from the previous quarter and an 11% appreciation from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong's performance reflects a very challenging environment. Net profit was lower than both comparative periods, as revenues fell and provision charges increased. Compared to a year ago, the lower revenue was due to a 23% decline in net interest income, as interest margins fell from 2.34% to 1.92%, which more than offset a 15% increase in loans in Hong Kong dollar terms. Offsetting this decline somewhat was non-interest income, which rose on the back of higher Treasury product sales and trading gains. Now compared to the previous quarter, the revenue decline was due to a 22% fall in non-interest income, as stockbroking commissions and sale of Treasury products declined. Also in the previous quarter, Hong Kong had recorded a $26 million gain from the VISA IPO, which was not repeatable.</p>
          <p>Net interest income also fell by 5%, although customer loans rose 6% from the previous quarter in local currency terms and NIM improved, interbank assets were lower, contributing to a lower net interest income. Provisions rose to $40 million from 19 million in the previous quarter. The increase was due to specific provisions put aside for some private banking clients and some corporates.</p>
          <p>Our operations outside Singapore and Hong Kong have been growing. This chart shows the combined contributions of mainland China, Taiwan, South and Southeast Asia and the rest of the world for the first half. The improved performance has been driven by a 50% increase in revenues from a year ago, as net interest income rose 85% and non-interest income grew 24%.</p>
          <p>The cost to income ratio also improved from 47% to 40% and net profit has more than doubled to $212 million compared to a year ago. Our regional contributions to the group have increased. They now account for 17% of net profit, from 6% a year ago. The encouraging results reflect the success of our ongoing efforts in China, Indonesia, and India to grow loans and deposits as well as fee activities.</p>
          <p>Loans booked in these countries now account for 18% of the group, compared to 16% a year ago. We have also been steadily building up our physical presence in these countries. In Indonesia, we now have 25 branches at end June, compared to 10 branches a year ago, and we just opened four more branches in India, with an additional four branches due to be opened within the next few months.</p>
          <p>Now a brief review of asset quality and capital position. Our hit line NPL rate increased from 1% in the previous quarter to 1.4% after consolidating Bowa's NPLs as we had mentioned earlier. 42% of our NPLs are still current in their interest and principal repayments. Excluding Bowa's NPLs, the NPL rate was 1.1%, which is very similar to the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Our credit quality remains healthy. Excluding Bowa, most of the increase in NPLs was a result of lending to private banking individuals in the equity market. We have been very proactive and conservative in classifying our loans as NPLs and setting aside provisions for our loans over the past few years.</p>
          <p>Our adoption of BASEL II AIRB and FIRB standards for credit risks has given us further insights to our expected loan losses through the cycle. And given our increasing comfort with IFRS standards and provisioning, we are now comfortable with our current provisioning given the risk quality of our loan portfolio. With Bowa's NPL consolidation, our cumulative provisions stand at 116% of non-performing assets and 195% of unsecured non-performing assets, putting us in a very strong starting position to weather any increased risk in our operating environment in the future.</p>
          <p>This chart shows the movement of our non-performing assets during the quarter. Non-performing assets rose $514 million from the previous quarter to $1.98 billion. Bowa accounted for 395 million of the increase. Excluding Bowa, non-performing assets rose 129 million. 109 million of that was due to the equity margins account for private banking individuals.</p>
          <p>Non-performing large corporate and consumer loans each fell 5% from the previous quarter, while SME NPLs rose by a marginal 4%. On a combined basis, NPLs for corporate consumer and SME customers were little changed from the previous quarter. One point I would like to add is that we have included in our performance summary additional disclosures this quarter and going forward. This is information on our CDOs and CLOs, as well as any exposures we have in CMBS, LBOs and SPVs. These disclosures are in line with the recommendations made by the Financial Stability Forum and the request of the G7 Finance Minister and Central Bank Governors to financial institutions as part of its effort to enhance transparency and you will see that in the last few pages of the performance summary.</p>
          <p>Now, our CDO portfolio. Our CDO portfolio was unchanged during the quarter. The CDOs in our trading portfolio are mark-to-market through P&amp;L and their value actually rose from 303 million in the previous quarter to $341 million. The rest of the CDOs are either in our AFS books or in our loans and receivables books, because the underlying collateral are loans. I just want to clarify one thing about CDOs. They are not generic in nature. Every CDO is different, depending on the nature of the underlying collateral and depending on the tranches that you buy or that an investor buys. For our investment portfolio, the ABS CDOs, that means those that have some form of sub-prime mortgages, have already been 90% provided for in the provisions.</p>
          <p>For the non-ABS CDOs, our allowances totaled $50 million. The non-ABS CDOs in total account -amount to 859 million and with the exception of one CDO which amounted to $14 million, which was downgraded, all of these CDOs are rated A and above, and they are rated by either both rating agencies or at least by one of them. All these CDOs are still performing, other than that one which I mentioned earlier, and we hold no equity tranches held by the group except for one of the CLO, which is the SME credit assist CLO, which is actually done in conjunction with SPRING Singapore, where we actually hold the equity piece.</p>
          <p>Our capital position strengthened this quarter, our total CAR ratio rose from 13.4% in the previous quarter to 13.8%. The increase was due to a rise in our Tier 1 ratio from 9.2 to 10% due largely to the 1.5 billion hybrid preferred shares issue in May. We had amortization in our Tier 2 sub-debt and the depreciation of the U.S. dollars also impacted our capital amount in our Tier 2 sub-debt. Our capital ratios are comfortably above NES regulatory minimum of 10% and 6% for total and Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>We continue to pay dividend of $0.20 per share this quarter, bringing dividends to the first half to $0.40 per share. This amount is being paid on a one-tier tax-exempts basis, which means higher cash dividends for our shareholders compared to a year ago. Now based on yesterday's closing price of $18.74, DBS shares gives investors a gross annualized dividend yield of 4.3%. Now let me end here, I will hand you back to Richard, who will share with you his outlook and his priorities for DBS. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>I think &#x2013; why don't the Q&amp;A panel take their seats, Jeannette, Amy and Richard. At the same time, we are also joined in Hong Kong by our colleagues there. We've got Mr. T.K. Chan, who is our Deputy CEO of Hong Kong, as well as Mr. Chung Li Chu, who is the CFO of DBS Hong Kong. Richard, before we start the Q&amp;A, would you like share some of your thoughts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I will say a few things actually. It's nice to see you all. I have been rather quiet in my first 99 days on the job back in Singapore, new with DBS. My 100th day is tomorrow. I am very proud of that. Good to be here, actually I am quite pleased with the results. I am also pleased with our position &#x2013; positioning today. I think our portfolio is in good shape, going into what we expect to be a challenging environment but even with the challenges ahead, looking at what we have today and what we have in front of us in term of opportunities, I am very encouraged and very excited about our prospects.</p>
          <p>However, that's not to say that we &#x2013; there won't be turbulent times ahead. These are very difficult times in our industry, the worst that I can ever remember and that most people can ever remember. But again sitting here today after 99 days, I feel very good about our position.</p>
          <p>Now, what I have been doing for the first 99 days? The first one is getting to know my team. We have some of the senior management here on the dais here, in the audience. We have a great team. I am very proud of my team, and I have traveled to virtually every country in the DBS network to meet people. I have met at least 1,000 of our staff up and down on all levels. We had a wonderful town hall today with all 15,000 DBS people listening in and again, I am very encouraged with the excitement that people have about our future and I am very proud to be part of this team.</p>
          <p>A couple of priorities I am going to focus on in the coming days. It may be a surprise to hear this, but number one is to refocus in Singapore. We have a privileged position in this &#x2013; in our home market. It's a competitive market. It's a mature market. But I think we can do even better here, leveraging our strengths, our deposit base, our client base, our branch network, our brand recognition.</p>
          <p>Case in point I am very excited about what I am calling the re-launch of POSB. POSB, I've learned &#x2013; I know from my own personal experience has a special place in the hearts of Singaporeans and I want to read &#x2013; I want to celebrate it. I want to do more. So focus on Singapore and of course Hong Kong, Amy can talk about that later. So this is a not a case of me coming in from China and putting all my focus just on China and India and Indonesia, and Taiwan now. Actually, and it's a bit of a surprise to me coming in, a lot of my time is spent right here in Singapore and up in Hong Kong, our two core markets.</p>
          <p>Second priority is service and dealing with clients. I think we can do better in providing service to our clients in various businesses. I think we are in the service business, we can't forget that. And I think the key over the long term is how your clients value you and I think people &#x2013; clients will pay for service and will value our capability. So I am going to put some focus on the service aspect in all markets, but with this particular focus in Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, I think we can find some efficiencies. We still want to invest and I'm quite pleased to see and Jeannette said this that we've &#x2013; we're actually funding some of the growth in the emerging markets through some saves and efficiencies in our core markets. I think the key for us going forward to invest and continue to build branches and hire people in some of the growth markets and when I say, growth markets I mean the markets, the large markets outside Singapore and Hong Kong, as we need to find efficiencies in how we operate.</p>
          <p>We probably have a bit too many silos in the way we're organized and I think we can do a lot to improve our efficiency and fund &#x2013; hopefully fund some of our growth internally. So those are a couple of thoughts. I am sure you have some questions. We are happy to take it and again, it's good to be here, good to meet some of you and I look forward to meeting all of you in the coming weeks and months.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Richard. As we begin the Q&amp;A section, can I please ask that you introduce yourself before you ask a question and state which organization you are from. Thank you. Our first question, yes, Matthew. Surprise.</p>

          <p>To prevent them taking you from being hijacked from past decisions. You don't seem to have taken that opportunity with this result. How far through your due diligence are you? As you described earlier in the presentation, these are turbulent times. And if you could give us some thoughts on-?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have taken the opportunity. I have taken the new CEO sort of privilege or ticket, as you say, I can't remember the word you used, to look at our portfolio. In fact, I have looked at the CDO portfolio virtually line by line. I am comfortable with our provisions right now, that is not to say that in the coming months &#x2013; we don't know really what's going to happen. It is an uncertain time. But I am very comfortable with the provisioning today of our loan portfolio and the way we've covered our CLO, may I say, a non-ABS CDO portfolio.</p>
          <p>I think Jeannette gave us some color on what's in the portfolio. Not all CDOs and not all CLOs are created equal. I think when you look at it, you've got to sort of be realistic and I think we have and I can assure you that I've looked at it. Again, not to say that things could change in the future, we are watching every day.</p>
          <p>Another point to note on our CDO and CLOs is that the mark-to-market of this portfolio today is virtually &#x2013; is very close to the provision that we've already taken. So I have looked, and my team and I have been through cycles before. I fondly recall the Asian crisis 11 years ago and looking ahead we are going to be very watchful and careful on how we take risk. But we will take risk and we will use this opportunity to build our business, but I think we are in a pretty good position today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously the CDO and CLO issue looks pretty well understood. I am more meaning the basic loan book, it's grown at about 15% compound over the last three years. How far into the loan book have you got? You've gone into the loan files, have you done that sort of nitty-gritty sort of analysis to ensure that perhaps there is not a few borrowers out there that potentially could give you some concern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't say I've gone through every file. It's still only 99 days and we have quite a large portfolio. I've gone through some, actually, I have. We have a pretty good book. I mean, our concentration is pretty focused at the high end corporate in Singapore and Hong Kong. We're perhaps a bit different than some of our competitors.</p>
          <p>So, we have a pretty high grade portfolio and that is a good thing to have right now. I do want to broaden the client base. I do want to look further into enterprise banking, SME space. I want to do more in the consumer space, but I, yes &#x2013; I have looked. We have a good credit and risk team, which we're going to continue to strengthen going forward, but I'm pretty comfortable, Matthew.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Mr. Richard. Patricia?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patricia Dudgeon, Fees Williams. Can you comment a little bit on the expectations in terms of loan growth in net interest margins? Some of the others have pointed out that net interest margin was sort of a disappointment of the earnings this time. Where do you expect it is going and lowering &#x2013; and landing and is it growing &#x2013; single-digits or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our loan growth this year will be somewhere in the low double-digits, and as far as the net interest margin, Jen, we have a portfolio which is quite concentrated in the high end of the market. I do &#x2013; obviously credit spreads are widening, we are booking new business at wider spreads, but we do have a very large balance sheet and the large funding base which is not a loan, so that is to a certain degree subject to the Interbank market and such, as you know. So, again, I think low double-digit growth in loans, some widening of spreads of our loan book, but again given on our portfolio mix, we're, as you know, subject to other forces other than just the commercial loans price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Richard. Can I move over to Hong Kong to some insight? Can I move onto Hong Kong, a question from Hong Kong please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ena from South China Morning Post. I would like to raise a question about Hong Kong, before as we can we can see the first half profit, actually the net profit for about 9%. We want to know what's the reason behind and what strategy you want to make an improvement on that situation?</p>
          <p>And secondly, from your &#x2013; what you also said, the CAR increase in the allowance made for some individual relating to equity lending. Is it relating to any of the accumulator or any special equity product you made, and also because of that, will you &#x2013; will you also change your investment strategy or your business plan in Hong Kong to cope with that difficulties?</p>

      <speaker type="a">

          <p>Okay. I think the first question was relating to the 9% decline in the first half 2008 earnings. If you look at the slide that has been distributed here, the year-on-year decline has mainly come from the declining of net interest income. Our non-interest income actually grew by 34% year-on-year, and this is on the back of very strong sales of Treasury products to our corporate customers.</p>
          <p>Our expenses have grown by over 15%. This is mainly driven by increases in our staff costs, in terms of our occupancy costs as well as our investments in our infrastructure, computerization cost. We have seen an increase in our credit losses and some of that, as Jeannette has alluded to earlier, comes from our private banking customers, and some corporates. So that really is made up of the 9% drop in the net profit after-tax for Hong Kong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Cheng. Amy, would you like to take the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'd like to make a slight amendment in terms of, we're talking about provisions that are made. We've increased the provisions that have been made and the credit loss &#x2013; the credit quality of the loan book in Hong Kong remains quite stable and we've not seen the sort of deterioration in the credit quality that we were concerned about, given where we are in the credit cycle.</p>
          <p>If I may refer to the equity length loans that we've extended &#x2013; continue to extend to some of our private banking clients, as everybody knows, the China-themed stocks on the Hong Kong Exchange have fallen by &#x2013; some of them fallen by over 50%. The Hang Seng index has fallen by about one-third since &#x2013; from their heights since the beginning of the year. It is inevitable that some of our private clients who are invested in certain of these products have run into the leveraged products in certain workout situations with us. And in order to maintain &#x2013; in line with our conservative stands on making provisions, we have done so accordingly for the private banking portfolio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Estelle from Today Newspaper. Could you tell us what can the Singapore consumer look forward to with the relaunch of POSB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Rajan, do you want to take this question, let me take on to my colleague, Rajan Raju who runs our consumer banking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I guess we are very proud of the legacy of POSB. We believe that we have been serving generations in Singapore. What we really want to is to continue our support towards mass-market Singapore and POSB to make it more convenient, more accessible, and provide products that we think will be right for the Singaporeans.</p>
          <p>As a way it will show that we are more than just a bank, we are first neighbors. Today, we started off our POSB and More campaign, which actually offers in these uncertain times of high inflation in Singapore a token of our appreciation, therefore our customers, we are actually trying to find ways in which they can afford &#x2013; they can allow them to have the utilities, groceries, and petrol at slightly cheaper prices than what they pay and I think this is first of many that you will be seeing from POSB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rajan. Another question from Singapore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In the front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Sanjay . Oh sorry, Ladies first, Sanjay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Saijal Patel, CNBC. Actually, I have two questions and this is directed to either one of you. I'm sure you are following obviously your peers in the U.S. and the credit situation there. Can you give you some thoughts as to where you see that headed? Do you think the worst is over?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a tough question. I think we have a way to go to see the end of the crisis. I think I would have some concern and this is me speaking personally, so let me emphasize, I would have some concern about how the crisis will sort of pervade the real economy in the U.S. I think the U.S. government has taken some very strong measures to support the markets and that's encouraging, but I think that we have a way to go before we see the end of this. When you are seeing nearly $500 billion to date in capital or wealth being destroyed in financial institutions, that has to have a knock-on effect on the real economy and so I think there's some time to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question is, you talked about expanding your footprint in Asia, you are expanding in Indonesia and India. Mr. Stanley, you are coming from China and knowing the market there very well. How soon before we can see expansion there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are expanding there. We have &#x2013; currently we have five branches, a sixth will open up in Sh&#x113;nzh&#xE8;n very soon, a seventh will come after that. We have a fund management joint venture in China. So yes, we do have some inorganic activities in China. So, I think and our China business is performing very well, as Jeannette alluded to. Our growth rate is quite high, now albeit on a small base, but as you would expect, I believe in China &#x2013; I think China has will have a big role to play in our future success and on my hundredth day, I am going to China to the opening ceremony of the Olympics. So that's where I will celebrate my hundredth day.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see DBS expanding organically or would you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said before and people, I guess, are waiting to hear this, no. I mean, as I said, before our organic growth is key to our strategy. If a deal comes along with the right price, the right fit, sure, we will look at it. But I am not waking up every day looking for a deal. I wake up every day to work with my team, manage the processes, deal with clients, and that's how I spend my time. But there are people out there looking for deals, people bring us deals. If something comes along that's good for us, we'd love to do it.  But again, organic is the center of the plate for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Sanjay, and then after that, we'll move to Hong Kong. Go ahead, Sanjay. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple of housekeeping questions first. In terms of the CDOs you mentioned...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The CLOs too, by the way, CLOs and CDOs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's talk about CLOs then, and this question is not going away any time soon for DBS. You mentioned that it is close to the market value. Can you actually realize $0.94 to a dollar if you were to sell this portfolio now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's hard to say, because in fact, I mean obviously the amount of liquidity in the market is indeterminate at any given time. So, it's hard for me to say that, but what we've seen so far, it's fairly close, as I said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, you mentioned the credit rating of the CLOs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about &#x2013; I mean, have you done the credit rating of the underlying corporates? If you were to run that, how would it look?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our credit team has checked and double-checked the underlyings in this portfolio, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what would the rating distribution be like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're comfortable with the ratings that have been assigned by the rating agencies in this portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the ratings we give you here is as of June, not at inception of the CDO, the one that we gave in the performance summary. It was the most current rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was looking at the corporate level, underlying collateral level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's how they divide their ratings, by looking at the underlying collateral.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is bottoms up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the capital structure also comes into play.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And they give you a rating of the CLO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another &#x2013; in fact, this portfolio was actually &#x2013; it's quite a mature portfolio. Most of these were sort of originated in the early 2000s. So, it's a quite a seasoned portfolio relative to perhaps with some of our colleagues in the industry may have in other parts of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually the vintage was given only for the ABS portfolio. It was not provided for the non-ABS, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the vintage is based on this sub-prime origination &#x2013; the mortgage origination. These are the vintages we are giving. So, with loans, it's harder to give vintages, yes, so we didn't give.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But generally speaking, these are not very new securities assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful, thank you. On margins, the Hong Kong margins have not responded. I mean most of the Hong Kong banks, it is easy to see for the first half margins have gone up. Is there any reason? First quarter you said hurt because of the fixed deposits. What about the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if you look at the NIM, NIM has gone up slightly by a couple of basis points quarter-on-quarter due primarily to the repricing impact. The total net interest income has fallen relative to the previous quarter because of a shift in the mix of the loans. So, for example in the first quarter, there was a larger proportion of Interbank lending, placing of excess deposits in the Interbank market where the yields are relatively lower. As our loan portfolio grew we turned &#x2013; we funded those loans with those deposits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can we move over to Hong Kong, a question from Hong Kong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can I have...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay last one, Sanjay, yes, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It seems like your slowed loan growth in the first and second quarter of this year as compared to the last two years. Is it internally the case that capital constraint is now becoming a constraint for loan growth as well? Especially in the context also that you were seen as slightly desperate in raising the Tier 1, paying 5.75?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we're anything but desperate in doing the HIBOR Tier 1. Secondly our capital position is very strong. In fact, we are well positioned, as I said in my opening remarks, to take advantage of opportunities that will present themselves, we believe in the coming months and years. So, I think that there is a &#x2013; we're in good shape and looking for opportunities out there and we have the capital and we &#x2013; no, we are not desperate at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you are not looking at your market share at all? Because in the first half you have lost market share in Singapore as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're looking at booking good assets. Okay? I don't necessarily think that market share in loans is something that good banks focus a lot of time on. I think is the quality of your portfolio, how you cross sell against it and what you do with your capital, which I think matters to the shareholders and other stakeholders as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, two question if I may, and the first one Richard, I was very encouraged by what you said about refocusing on Singapore and you also mentioned about POSB. The simple question &#x2013; follow-on question on that is &#x2013; which is that, do you have any goals or aspirations in terms of improvement of underlying profitability for the Singapore core business? Where I'm coming from is very simple, you've got POSB, you've got most of the low cost deposits of consumer core deposits in Singapore, so theoretically or conceptually, you should be significantly more profitable than your peers in Singapore, so that's where I'm coming from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roy, that's a good- the answer is yes, Roy. As the part of our strategy to engage more in Singapore to leverage this privileged position, which I talked &#x2013; which I spoke about before. And yes, this will &#x2013; must lead to better profitability. I think we'd like to have a more diverse client base in Singapore and Hong Kong and elsewhere in due course, and so, yes, that's where we are trying to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask a follow on question on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which is where do you &#x2013; where do you see as the avenues for improving your profitability and are you at liberty to mention any kind of goals or quantitative targets at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have goals, we have internal goals and targets, which I will not disclose, but certainly as I &#x2013; in terms of expanding our client base, we have a pretty large position in the top-tier corporate market. I can see us doing more in the SME and the consumer lending space in Singapore and also in Hong Kong, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>I apologize for this question again on CLOs, but it's really become an issue for some Hong Kong, Singapore, and Korean banks that have taken out the provisioning to 50 or 67% of exposures. My question is, can I correctly assume that these are mezzanine tranches as opposed to super senior tranches? And can I ask what is your average level of subordination protection, in other words, what the level of junior tranches are beneath you? Is it like 5% or 10% that gets wiped out first before it starts to wipe out the tranche you are in? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I think the answer is none of the above. Yuan Wong, do you want to talk about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Non-ABS. The non-ABS.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. For the CLO portfolio, 100% of the portfolio are all A and above. So actually 50% of what we have is A and the other 50% AA and AAA, is one. Two, none of these are on &#x2013; even on negative watch. So, you have seen over the last six, nine months, you have massive downgrades, we have massive negative watch. None of our CLOs is on negative watch, so that speaks for the quality.</p>
          <p>Now it's hard to generalize how much &#x2013; how much protection they have. But normally the single A's, the underlying would be, depending on how the structures are done, anywhere from 7 to &#x2013; 6 to 9% as opposing the AAs that are higher. So, those are the underlying &#x2013; underlying subordination. We have the equity piece and the mezzanine pieces. So it's not easy to summarize, but I hope &#x2013; but individually are all different, yes.</p>
          <p>And don't forget, 85% of the collateral in the CLOs are senior subordinated loans. And I think the queue is subordinated. Because that means the recovery rate for Zambia in our stress testing we are using 50%, 60% stressed recovery rate, which is very, very low. Historically this &#x2013; this is &#x2013; the recovery rates are much, much higher than that. So don't forget, yes, senior subordinated loans in the underlying collateral line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Brian. A question from this side of the room.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will come back to you later, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chaupak Wong from Bloomberg News. Just two questions basically on the write-backs on your CDOs rate, is there any chance you could let us know what sort of underlying loans are backing them? Is there any chance of further write-backs that you see? And you are saying that the second question is for the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if this is trading. It is just mark-to-market, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, for full year loan growth, you are putting it at lower double-digit. So compared to 18% year-on-year, which areas in Singapore, Hong Kong, or SMEs or consumer lending are you kind of being more cautious about? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, the first question, this is a portfolio which is mark-to-market, so it's not a write back per se, it's a marking of the portfolio to market. Those have come up and yes, markets in general, markets go up and down and there is no law that says securities should go just down.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of where our growth will be, again we are putting, as I said, a lot of focus on the core markets, in particular Singapore, but we are also growing in the emerging markets. But understand that given the mix of our portfolio, our size and scale in Singapore is much larger. So, the percentage growth will probably be lower, whereas we have small portfolios in the other countries so the growth rates will be higher, but the absolute growth may be lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're saying that the loan growth <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are always &#x2013; I am trying to &#x2013; I don't know if I understand the question, but we want to grow our loan book. We will grow &#x2013; we are growing our loan book, we will grow our loan book. We are putting more focus then perhaps in the past on the core markets in Singapore and Hong Kong. It is a challenging environment, as we all know, around the world and so whatever we do, we are very vigilant, very careful and the actual loan growth will be quite frankly determined by a number of factors, including how we feel about the outlook at any given time, which is what banking is all about, to my view.</p>
          <p>Is there any questions on this side? I think this gentleman.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Michael Chang, Deutsche Bank. I have just got three questions, the first one is well, I very much agree with your POSB strategy. I think POSBs &#x2013; no, seriously I think you've got a significant market share of the youth segment, especially for POSB, and if you can translate that market share across the adult segment, you can &#x2013; there is much revenue potential on that front. But first, what's your perception of how the POSB brand and the POSB branch network has been utilized in the DBS Group thus far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer one by one. I think the answer to that question is, I think we have disappointed Singaporeans over the years and we aim to turn that around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Secondly then, I think it's a great disclosure for CDOs but like the typical analyst, we'd like a bit more. Would we be able to get maturity stats of the CLOs? In other words, when do they run off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, actually, Michael, you got to give us &#x2013; I think our disclosure is very, very wide and I am pretty proud of it. We will consider, we will consider. Certainly not today, I don't think we have the data with us today, but let us come back to you on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then on the Singapore loan portfolio then, in terms of &#x2013; I read notes basically on Page 12 of the performance summary. It seems there were some repayments of corporate loans. Can we get a sense for perhaps how are the new inflows coming about, maybe the loan disbursement, rather than looking an at on a balance outstanding basis. Is that slowing and you said a deliberate decision, if it is slowing, to pare back, like you said, lower-yielding loans and if so, why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, that's exactly what it is. It is to pay back some of our low margin loans. That's why we have been more cautious about growing it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that's more like getting repayment back, more so than reducing your inflows? Is it, or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you notice, I mean it's really only gone down 1%. So, we really haven't kept up with where the industry is growing. So, but there have been opportunities for us to continue to grow our loan books and we have, but if those opportunities turn out to be very low margin-yielding loans, sometimes we do give it a pass. That's basically what it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, as I said before, loan spreads are increasing in all sectors of the market and we are, like everybody else, repricing. But our balance sheet has a number of components beyond loans which have to be dealt with. But, yes, we are repricing our corporate loans and they have been widening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can, just one last question. There is a lot of concern out there about Hong Kong SMEs. Is the Hong Kong operations showing any sign of stress in that front and are you pulling back on the &#x2013; on the lending on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have &#x2013; I have also looked at that in my first 99 days, and there is a degree of stress, yes, in some of the SMEs in the South China region, which I think is no secret to the markets. But knock on wood, the clients that we have, have been I think less affected than I would have thought, quite frankly, looking at it for the first time. Do you agree?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I agree, I agree. We have &#x2013; we remain vigilant on the quality of the SME portfolio. We are growing that part of the business at a measured pace. As &#x2013; and as I said earlier on, the credit quality of the SME portfolio out of Hong Kong has remained very stable, despite the negative news surrounding that area &#x2013; the industries in that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can we will move over to Hong Kong now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen, these questions concentrate on Hong Kong business. In those as we &#x2013; as we have seen that the profit in Hong Kong fell 36% year-on-year and in regards of the slowdown economy in U.S. market, and what do you expect the performance of the Hong Kong business in the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is that, as we see that there is a 37 million provision in the Hong Kong business, as we said &#x2013; as we've seen there, it is a special allowance for loans. So, actually the market remain volatile in the &#x2013; remain volatile now and what do you expect? Is there any chance for additional provision in the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>And the last question is that the Fed rate remaining stable in the current meeting. So the primary at the banks in Hong Kong remains at the prime rate, at the market rate in Hong Kong remains stable in retrospect. So actually, will the DBS cut the mortgage, raise the mortgage rates or the prime rate in the future? And what do you expect the trend of the rate in Hong Kong? So, especially where you can &#x2013; can I get this sound byte in Cantonese of this question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. You would like the sound byte in Cantonese for the last question, right, for the mortgage rates? Would you like to answer this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>All the questions, is it? Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, T.K. &#x2013; T.K. , could you &#x2013; perhaps would you like to take the &#x2013; Amy, would you like to do the one on the Hong Kong business performance on the second half of the year and then perhaps T.K. can do questions two and three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yes. I think the outlook for the business environment &#x2013; somebody just said Cantonese. Okay. [Cantonese] Can I go back to English, please? Because, basically &#x2013; I am sorry, it's basically because I think the operating environment will remain challenging for the second half of the year in Hong Kong and I think in the Taiwan, Hong Kong triangle.</p>
          <p>And the reasons are a slowdown in the global economy, rising inflationary expectations, higher costs of doing business. I think most of us will agree that this is probably one of the most difficult periods we have ever experienced in our professional career. And the light is not yet at the end of the tunnel. So I think the second half of the year will remain challenging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Amy. T.K., perhaps might want to paraphrase that in Cantonese again and answer questions two and three, please?</p>

          <p>Okay. [Cantonese]</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, perhaps, we will take the last two questions from Singapore and then one more question from Hong Kong. Yes?</p>

          <p>Hi, I'm Bill from Straights Times.  Could you talk about capital mix going forward? Your competitor bank seems to think it's a pretty good time to take on more Tier 1 now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

          <p>Jeannette, would you like to take that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  I mean, I think we are very well capitalized at this time.  I mean, we did a $1.5 billion hybrid issue back in May and our total CAR at this point in time here, our Tier 1 is at 10%.  Our total CAR at this point is 13.8%.  I think we have more than adequately capitalized compared to the MES headline number six and ten.  So we are unlikely to do or to take on more leverage at this point.  But we are always looking for opportunities to make sure that we remain well capitalized and we intend to remain well capitalized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Jeannette.  Thank you, so sorry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Hari Smoli from JPMorgan.  I had a few questions.  First on NPL, the coverage write-down has gone down to 116%.  Do you see that going up, probably using GP or something?  Or do you have any target coverage ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think again, we don't know what is going to happen in the future.  The environment is uncertain and we do want to grow our book.  So I think it is conceivable that it could go up in due course, but again, it will be in line with how we view the conditions that will affect our portfolio in the future.  So I am not giving you a very clear answer, it could, maybe or maybe not.  But it depends on, again, how market conditions change.  We are watching very, very carefully.  We are trying to grow our business and taking advantage of opportunities.  But again, starting from today, we are pretty well positioned to pursue opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  On gapping profits, the margins came down more or less in line with the decline in spreads and loans &#x2013; loan deposit spreads.  Now, this is unlike other banks, peers who made quite a bit of margins on gapping profit. Any reason why the difference with DBS? With EBIT income steep, there was an expectation that per value, there would be a better gapping profit here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Part of the reason is because of our excess Sing dollar deposits, right?  So the excess Sing dollar deposits will inevitably be impacted by lower Sing interest rates.  And if the cut has deepened, you have really got to look at much more the shorter end of the curve, that means the overnight all the way to one year, as opposed to overnight to ten years, because it is very unlikely for us to put in our ELN to put a lot of our excess deposits in the ten-year sector, much more in the zero to one-year sector.  Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a final one, just to get this right, loan growth, right now we are looking at 18 to 20%.  You said full year, you are looking at low double digits.  So basically, it means second half of the year will go down to 7, 8%.  Am I reading it right or am I missing something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think right now, it's a possibility that loan growth &#x2013; well, loan growth, it is possible loan growth will slow.  Again, what we are doing is, it's &#x2013; there is a more challenging environment ahead.  So we are not going to forecast sort of growth numbers that necessarily equal what we have had in the last couple of quarters.  We are being vigilant, as I said, and so there is every possibility loan growth may slow.</p>
          <p>There is also the possibility that it may not, if we see opportunities and we feel more comfortable about the environment in the various markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  It is Sofer de Gassar from ABN Amro.  Just quickly returning to the strategic priorities that you gave us, thanks very much for those.  Two questions there, first of all, on the refocusing on Singapore again, could you just explain to us exactly what you mean by that?  Specifically what I want to know is, can your competitors expect a price war, given your low cost of funding?</p>
          <p>And then second point, on the third point you raised, efficiencies, can you quantify any of that?  Specifically, are you going to be launching, let's say, a major cost drive with some numbers attached to that?  Those are my two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is no, I don't think you can expect a price war in Singapore, no.  I think in terms of cost cutting, we do endeavor, as I said, to be more efficient.  But and I see that happening over time, through better management, through investments actually in technology, more technology and better processes.  So I don't expect a sort of one-time, sort of significant cut. It's going to be over time, through embedding better management practices and better technology into our day-to-day operations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Ena from South China Morning Post. I would like to ask on the case of the provision as we can see in the first half year is mainly from the private bank side on the stock-related lending. I want to ask, this is strategy wise, that in the year, maybe you will cut down your private bank business or maybe you will reduce your lending to your clients to stop exposure? And would that mean you will focus more on the corporate lending or the SME? And secondly, I would also ask, because you mentioned about you will cut down the costs in the second half, does it mean maybe you will have any layoff plan or if not layoff, what area you will cut down your cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me try to correct a conception that the addition in the specific provisions in Hong Kong were all attributed to the private banking loan book, far from it. I think there has been &#x2013; we made some provisions for clients who are leveraged in the Hong Kong equity market and that's a conservative approach. As a percentage of the total loan book, the number, the ratio of the specific provision is actually very healthy and quite low.</p>
          <p>Therefore, it does not &#x2013; is not an indication of a change of direction in the overall private banking business. We remain &#x2013; we remained well positioned to be the asset &#x2013; asset liability &#x2013; to engage in asset liability management together with our private banking clients. There may be a shift in the investment preferences of the private bank clients in line with the rest of the market, in view of the economic outlook, which has certain implications for the outlook of the equity market. So that &#x2013; those investor preferences are market-driven much more than sort of driven by our &#x2013; much more than a conscious decision on our part to direct the investments in any one direction or another. So in short, no, we are not cutting back on our private banking activities and as Richard pointed out just now, we are definitely not planning layoffs or cutbacks in staffing.</p>

          <p>Hi, Jonathan from Ruby Keegan. A question related to the Singapore &#x2013; Singapore business. You are significantly in the ACU market. I believe your ACU business group is up about 36% year-on-year in terms of loans. Can you help us understand why is the ACU market growing so much faster than the TBU market and going into the second half, do you expect growth of 30 to 40% to be sustainable within the second half?</p>

          <p>To the second part of the question, probably not. The first part of the question, I think in terms of either foreign currency or ACU, I think certainly around the markets, clients' demands have been to borrow foreign currency for reasons that relate to the &#x2013; perhaps to their view of where the currencies are going, so there is been demand in that regard.</p>
          <p>But I think one of the key priorities which I may not have mentioned before and I will mention it now as well beyond what I have said is to diversify our funding sources outside the Singapore dollar. We do want to have through various product initiatives over time to be rolled out, a better funding base in local currencies in some of the key markets and the U.S. dollar as well. So I think there has been &#x2013; there are some market reasons for it, but I think one of our priorities going forward will be to develop our transaction services business and as we roll out of consumer business and branches in these countries, we hope to achieve a more granular and diversified funding base.</p>
