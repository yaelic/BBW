          <p>Good evening ladies and gentlemen. My name is Luca Torchia, welcome to this Conference Call for Enel's Nine-Month Results. Before handing over to Luigi Ferraris our Chief Financial Officer let me excuse Mr. Fulvio Conti, our Chief Executive, who was supposed to be here addressing some question and some chart as well, but he is now traveling towards South Korea taking part to the G-20 Meetings. So excuse again Mr. Conti, let me hand over to Mr. Luigi Ferraris. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Luca and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our Nine-Month Results Presentation. Let me start by quickly reviewing the general micro-economic trends in the areas in which we operate. In March we gave a new average demand growth figure of 2.4% for the next five years. During first half 2010, we have already seen a recovery from the depressed level of 2009 and this positive trend has continued during the third quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>The first nine months of the year closed with an average demand growth of 3.7% confirming the positive trend of Italy, Spain, Russia and Slovakia among the others. The 4.2% average demand growth in Latin America due in the first half of 2010 was negatively affected by decline in demand in Chile caused by the earthquake in the first quarter 2010. During the third quarter, the positive recovery of demand in Chile, 6.7% up together with good economic trends in other Latin American countries drove total nine-months 2010 demand growth to 4.9%.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at what we have already achieved on the disposal program during the last two years on slide number three. During the third quarter of 2010 we have entered into agreement for the sale of the Endesa's power transmission networks and gas regulated activities totaling about &#x20AC;2.3 billion. Of this amount &#x20AC;1 billion has been already cashed in.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, the Group is continued to deliver on the disposal program. Following the successful flotation of Enel Green Power for a total amount of &#x20AC;2.6 billion the group will also complete the disposal of the Bulgarian coal plants and other possible minor non-core assets.</p>
          <p>And now, allow me to turn to the main financial results highlighted on slide number four. Group EBITDA increased by 5.3%, driven mainly by Iberia and Latin America, the international division and Enel Green Power among others.</p>
          <p>Net of non-recurring items, the increase was close to 8.5%. Group net ordinary income was in line versus last year totaling &#x20AC;3.45 billion. Let me highlight that our current dividend policy is to pay out 60% or the full-year group net ordinary income.</p>
          <p>Net debt was nearly flat versus last year excluding accounting translation effects on foreign currency debt, net debt has decreased by more than &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;49.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to slide number 5, EBIT was nearly in line versus last year due to higher EBITDA, which was offset by higher D&amp;A for changes in the consolidation of Endesa, and the purchase price allocation impacts among other items.</p>
          <p>Our net financial charges stand at &#x20AC;2.6 billion with an increase of &#x20AC;1.6 billion. This valuation is the net effect of the following: first, a decrease of &#x20AC;970 million in financial income due to Acciona put option recorded in 2009. Second, higher interest charges of &#x20AC;318 million, mainly due to the full consolidation of Endesa; third, an increase of &#x20AC;346 million of other interest charges, which have been almost flat versus the first half '10. But I will be more specific about this in the following slides.</p>
          <p>As far as the tax rate is concerned, the increase from 27% to 30% at the end of this quarter is mainly attributable to the positive contribution in nine months '09 of the valuation of Acciona put option, the capital gain from the Italiane Voltage Grid and the Russian gas upstream disposal. On a normalized basis, our annualized tax rate is equal to 32, 33%.</p>
          <p>I would now like to address your attention on our net financial charges in more detail on chart number 6. In addition to what I already said on the previous slides during nine months '10, net financial charges increased mainly as a result of the following: a one off regularization effect of the accrual in financial revenues from previous years, related to the Spanish direct deficit in 2010 of &#x20AC;248 million.</p>
          <p>A negative impact from the authorization of post-employment benefits and other provision of &#x20AC;111 million; a decrease of &#x20AC;13 million of other charges, which last year had been almost completely offset by higher financial income. Finally, let me remind you that our annual average costs of net debt is in the area of 5%.</p>
          <p>Let's continue with an update on forward sales activities on slide number 7. In Italy we have hedged 100% of our 2010 production and 65% of our 2011 production at an average base load price equal to about &#x20AC;75 per megawatt hour for 2010 and &#x20AC;70 to &#x20AC;73 per megawatt hour for 2011.</p>
          <p>In Spain, we are 100% hedged for 2010 and 70% to 75% for 2011 at an average price of about &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour for 2010 and higher than the Spanish forward curve for 2011.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we are 75% &#x2013; 80% hedged for 2010 and 70% -75% for 2011. In Slovakia both 2010 and 2011 production are fully hedged at an average base load price of about &#x20AC;52.40 per megawatt hour when it comes to 2010 and about &#x20AC;52.1 when it comes to 2011.</p>
          <p>Before illustrating our EBITDA evolution in detail, let me run through our main efficiency actions beginning with the Enel Endesa synergy program on slide number 8. As you can see we continue to deliver upon our targets. In the first nine months, we have already recorded about &#x20AC;545 million of synergies, improving the pace on the committed targets.</p>
          <p>Among the identified areas of improvements, I would like to mention: rationalization of investment in distribution, improvements in the availability of thermal plants and optimization of the fuel mixing generation, operational efficiency at IT level, improvements of the joint tendering process in procurements. All of this represents an outstanding example of how best practices are applied at a group level.</p>
          <p>On the operational excellence side, as you can see on slide Number 9, Enel is constantly progressing on each section aimed at optimizing cash flow. As of September 30th, we reduced our cumulative working capital in CapEx of &#x20AC;760 million or &#x20AC;160 million more versus the number posted at the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>Also, we have so far achieved a total EBITDA improvement of about &#x20AC;645 million of which about &#x20AC;270 million is recurring and the total amount by 2011 will be equal to &#x20AC;1.1 billion. Endesa is also developing its own Zenith program, which has delivered &#x20AC;62 million in nine months 2010 and will deliver about &#x20AC;240 million of available cash by the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>All of this will add to explain our EBITDA evolution on slide number 10, which provides an overview of all of our operations. I will now go through the EBITDA of each of our divisions in detail, starting with Generation and Energy Management Italy on slide number 11. The overall division EBITDA declined by &#x20AC;829 million, this was mainly the results of the following: a decline in the generation margin of &#x20AC;177 million, mainly caused by lower hydro production and lower prices partially compensated for by higher volumes on electricity sales; a reduction of &#x20AC;229 million in trading and gas margin, mainly due to favorable gas sourcing, which positively affected nine months 2009; a reduction of &#x20AC;200 million in the fair value of commodities; a &#x20AC;189 million decline, mainly due to the termination of Nigeria gas trended costs; and other minor items.</p>
          <p>Having said all of this, in light of our current hydro reserves, the recovery in electricity demand and the full availability of Torrevaldaliga Nord, we confirm full year EBITDA of this division to be in the region of &#x20AC;2.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the fuel cost evolution on slide number 12. Thanks to forward sales and commodity aging activities, the unit margin in the domestic thermo generation, natural ancillary services has been equal to &#x20AC;25 per megawatt hour in line with the previous year results without considering the contribution of the Nigerian trending cost in 2009.</p>
          <p>The overall generation unit margin, net of ancillary services is about &#x20AC;43.5 per megawatts hour in 2010 versus &#x20AC;48.6 per megawatts hour in 2009, mainly due to lower hydro production and lower prices.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the EBITDA evolution analysis for the market division on slide number 13. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;281 million versus &#x20AC;268 in nine months '09. This is the cumulative effect of the following: the increase in the contribution on the free market of &#x20AC;46 million, mainly thanks to a margin improvement in electricity, related with lower acquisition cost, partially compensated by lower volume sold.</p>
          <p>The decrease in the electricity regulated market of &#x20AC;33 million was mainly due to higher charges for services, which will be partially recovered through the tariff during the year and higher one off costs.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide number 14 on the domestic infrastructure and network division, EBITDA amounted to &#x20AC;2.8 billion. Bear in mind, the last year the infrastructure and network EBITDA included about &#x20AC;300 million capital gain on the disposal of the high voltage grid to Terna. Therefore, on a like-for-like basis, EBITDA increased by 11% versus last year. This is the net effect of the following:</p>
          <p>First, the improvement of &#x20AC;241 million in the energy margin, mainly thanks to positive price components on the tariff, higher volumes distributed and higher efficiencies. Second, lower connection fees of &#x20AC;14 million. Third, other changes of &#x20AC;244 million were mainly due to the above mentioned capital gain recorded in 2009.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 15, on international operations, EBITDA increased by &#x20AC;95 million versus last year. This is the cumulative effect of the following. In the central region, Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne recorded a reduction of &#x20AC;47 million, mainly due to lower unit margin where the decline in prices has been partially compensated for by an increasing volume effect.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, let me tell you that before year ends, we are completing the upgrade program of units three and four of the Bohunice plant. This will increase the current capacity by 140 megawatts to more than 1,000 megawatts. Romania and Bulgaria performed well with an increase of 18 million euro in the period. France recorded a reduction of 16 million euro due to lower prices, which were partially offset by higher volumes.</p>
          <p>Russia contributed with an increase of 79 million euro, well split between the generation and the supplying activities, which accounted for 79 million euro and 52 million euro respectively. This was partially compensated for by the extreme gas disposal recorded in the third quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>Before analyzing the remaining division, I will like to quickly focus on our Russian activities on slide number 16. OGK-5 reported nine months 2010 EBITDA of about 212 million euro or up about 47% versus last year on a like-for-like basis. This was a result of the following: an increase of 16% in total production, thanks to the general economy recovery and favorable weather condition; higher availability ratio of our plants and higher power sales and efficiency. All of this has been translated on a 26% increase in unitary prices, mainly driven by the day-ahead market prices.</p>
          <p>Let's now focus on Endesa results on slide number 17. First, let me remind you the numbers we report in this slide are the results of the application of Enel group's accounting principle which might be different than the Endesa principle due to the difference in local standards.</p>
          <p>The Iberian division has recorded an EBITDA increase of about 170 million euro. This has been achieved, thanks to an increase on margin or 100 million euro in the generation sales business, related to our currency policy of forward selling to final customers in a year in which the down trend input prices has been more than compensated for by higher volumes sold in the free markets and lower costs related with the CO2 clawback. An increase of 200 million euro in the distribution business mainly due to the implementation of the international accounting principle related to new connection fees for 200 million euro. Among others and all of this has more than compensated the negative impact on renewables of 130 million euro due to the change in the perimeter of the assets sold to Acciona last year and to Enel Green Power this year.</p>
          <p>The Latin American division has been positively impacted by the foreign exchange effect evolution, amounting in the first nine months of this year to about 250 million euro. Excluding this effect, the generation business recorded a decrease of 110 million euro as higher unitary margin in Brazil, Colombia were more than compensated for by lower unitary margin achieved in Chile. The distribution business has been very flat versus last year as the unitary margin increased in Brazil was balanced by a tariff adjustment and higher fixed costs in Chile among others. Finally, transmission EBITDA in Brazil has been effective by a positive one-off item of 60 million euro recorded in 2009.</p>
          <p>Let's now review energy and power on slide number 18. EBITDA totaled 966 million euro representing a 9.3% increase for nine months '09. Taking into account of the one-off effect of a tax partnership in North America for an amount of 31 million euro recorded in Enel's consolidated group numbers in 2009, EBITDA is up 5.6% versus last year. This is mainly due to the following: a decline of 36 million euro in Italy and Europe mainly driven by lower unitary margin partially compensated by better performance in the rest of the year. However, in Italy, we recorded an increase of 32 million euro in Enel.si, our franchise in business units thanks to higher volumes on sales of photovoltaic solar panels which is really booming. An increase of 52 million euro in Iberia and Latin America mainly attributable to the consolidation of this year in the second quarter 2010 which has offset the fall in Spanish power prices and the lower hydro production in Panama due to the El Ni&#xF1;o effects.</p>
          <p>The third quarter has shown anyhow that the situation in Panama is getting back to normal, and Spanish prices are recurring versus the average recorded in the first half 2010. Also thanks to our forward sales strategy. And finally, an increase of 34 million euro in North America mainly due to the above mentioned one-off tax partnership impact.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt is concerned, you see on chart number 19, our net debt excluding the foreign exchange effect is equal to 49.8 billion euro. As you can see in the chart, our cash flow from operation in the periods has enabled us to cover CapEx, debt service and taxes leaving us with a strong net operating cash flow before dividends. Bear in mind that taxes paid in 2010 and reported in these charts include last tranche of the substitute tax for an amount of about 0.5 billion euros.</p>
          <p>Next of such item, our cash flow from operations is positive even after dividend payments. Furthermore, we expect to continue to be cash flow positive after incurring dividend payment during the fourth quarter of this year. This jointly with the delivery on our disposal program as I have already outlined will allow us to achieve a net debt position at the year-end of about 45 billion euro excluding the foreign exchange effects and assuming to cash in all the announced disposals, which is a fair assumption. In addition, we expect to generate year-end 2010 EBITDA of at least 17 billion euro or about 2.7 times net-debt-to-EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and now we are pleased to answer any question you might have.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question is from Alberto Gandolfi of UBS. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I have a few questions if I may. First one is on non-recurring items. You went through your calculations on financial expenses, I counted something like less than 400 million, but if I'm not mistaken, when you were talking about H1, you were already talking about 370 then, and I think I've seen more now. So, can you just be very explicit please about non-recurring financial costs we've seen in the nine-months.</p>
          <p>And, in terms of other non-recurring items, these depreciation, amortization provisions, do you also have some non-recurring items, we know Endesa booked some of them. Just so I can work out the proper earnings power, which seems to me much higher than the one you reported.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of guidance, given all &#x2013; given the hedging policy you have in place, given the regulated nature of the rest of the business, would you be able to provide any guidance, at least at EBITDA level, could you at least specify if you do expect any sort of growth or not?</p>
          <p>And, last one, in terms of gas prices in Italy, we continued to be at premium to gas prices in rest of Europe &#x2013; let alone the United States, and we have seen what's happening with the transit gas, so we know that next year the ownership of the pipes will move from ENI to third parties. What is your outlook there from a structural point of view? What do you think we should be looking for in the next year when the ownership and the management, particularly the pipeline, moves away from ENI? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alberto. I will start from the first question that you raised about the non-recurring items in the net financial charges. Well, as I said, we have a one-off regularization effect of the accrual in financial revenues from previous years in Spain related to, let's say, the revenues coming on the so-called tariff deficit. So, there has been an adjustment in the first part of this year, and the total effect in terms of variation from this year versus last year is equal to &#x20AC;248 million.</p>
          <p>Then there is the second item, which is specific, which regards Spain, in particular regards some cost employment benefits for &#x20AC;111 million. This is basically a &#x2013; I would say an accounting issue because we have to actualize the value of our liability versus our employees. And, adding lower interest rate, the amount of course of accruing has been increased. We have anyway instigated an hedging policy, which will basically secure and eliminate any future impact on our profit and loss because of this. But, for the time being, this is affecting our net financial charges. So, if we sum these two items, we ended up at &#x20AC;360 million, and the other variation is driven by the full consolidation of Endesa, and this is it.</p>
          <p>When it comes to depreciation and amortization, well, first of all, let me tell you that, there are not any strange items but there is the full consolidation of Endesa, which of course increase the level of depreciation and amortization. There is the full implementation of the purchase price allocation; here I am referring to the goodwill allocated to the assets, which could be equal in the region of &#x20AC;90 million. And, I will not have any other item to report to you.</p>
          <p>The last, the third question, I don't know if I understood correctly what you said, if you're referring to the guidance with regards to the full year at the Enel level, as I said, we are committing here to deliver an EBITDA high than &#x20AC;17 billion.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the fourth item, which basically regards the gas price evolution in Italy, and the gas market in Italy in general, well, as you might recall, the first time we have to look at is the liquidity of the spot market in Italy. And, the liquidity of the spot market in Italy is still very low. We can say that, as of today, we don't see more than 5% of gas available on the spot market. Therefore, the vast majority of the supply is driven by long term contracts.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the pipeline or to the increase of the existing capacity, as far as we know we just foresee next year a decision regarding the Galsi project and next year there will be, let's say, the final investment decision to start with this project. Therefore, it will take very likely five year from next year, assuming that we take the decision to go ahead, which is not given, to see any impact on this type of market. And I think when it comes to the regasifier, you know very well that the only regasifier authorized is Porto Empedocle which is Enel's one. The other one is Rovigo which is already operating and when it comes to our final investment decision we'll be taking next year, we are basically completing and receiving all the final authorization.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Mr. Javier Suarez of UniCredit. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon to everyone. Three questions if I may. The first one is on the slide number 11, on the Generation and Energy Management business in Italy. We have seen a certain deceleration on the Generation market in Italy. I think that during the third quarter the deterioration has been &#x20AC;144 million. I was wondering if you can give us an explanation why this deterioration has happened during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Then the second question is on slide number 15, also on the CENTREL market. There has been a significant deterioration on the EBITDA contribution during the third quarter. You mentioned maybe an estimate on the lower margins. The question is could you be more specific and quantify the deterioration in the market during the third quarter please, and maybe your expectations by the year-end on the margins for the CENTREL market.</p>
          <p>And then the final question is on the evolution of the debt. The average cost of debt of the company, just now it stands at 5.4%. At the time of the debt reauthorization in March 2010 it was 5%. So, there has been a certain increase on the average cost of debt, could you give us an explanation on the reasons for that and maybe, more interestingly, your expectation for the next few years on your average cost of debt? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Javier. I will start from your first question. Third quarter results, when it come to Generation and Energy Management, Italy. Well, you are right, there has been a slow down in terms of EBITDA, but it is in line with our guidance of &#x20AC;2.4 billion for the entire year. The reason for that is due to fact that we had lower hydro production versus the previous quarters.</p>
          <p>As I said before, since we have, let's say, a level of &#x2013; or we have stored something in the region of 2.7 terawatt hours, we are confident that, given this level of hydro reserve, we'll be able to reach the target that we have committed to.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne, I think you are referring to Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne. The reduction in the margin in the EBITDA in the quarter, as I said, is due to a decline in prices, that were, by the way, expected and foreseen, partially balanced by additional volumes. What we do expect in the fourth quarter in terms of a recovery is we expect an additional contribution to the results of the Bohunice plant, which has been upgraded in terms of capacity. Therefore, we should be able to go back to an EBITDA of 800 million euro and 850 million euro by the end of the year, which is substantially in line versus last year with a slight decline. So, this is something that was expected, was foreseen.</p>
          <p>As you know in Slovakia, the price generally driven by the German markets and therefore that was in our projection. Having said that next year I gave the guidance we are fully secured in terms of &#x2013; of forward sales and we expect price which are good, are in the region of 52 euro per megawatt hour and thanks to the additional volumes we should be able to deliver results in line or slightly better than the current year.</p>
          <p>Well, when it comes to the cost of debt or the net financial charges, well, when we say &#x2013; as you said 5.4% you're basically using the net financial expenses versus the net financial debt. Now as you know in the net financial debt, we have also financial receivable that generates a return &#x2013; an interest return to us, which is &#x2013; basically is in line with the Euribor, and this is not exactly what we pay as a cost of debt. Therefore, the reason why at this stage we are slightly higher than what we committed to is because we have not yet cashed in the portion of tariff-deficit, which was supposed to take place in the previous months and which we do expect that is going to take place at least the first tranche by the end of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Couple of questions please. First question is, earlier you gave a guidance on EBITDA for 2010 and if I understood correctly, you are not expecting any more exceptionals on the net financial results. Could you give us a guidance also for the net ordinary income for 2010?</p>
          <p>Second question is for investors, EBITDA according to Enel accounting standards, if I remember correctly, in six-month results, you were indicating that there is &#x2013; there was likely to be a larger adjustment than previously expected for the full year results, however in the nine-month result, the adjustment between the Endesa reported EBITDA and Enel accounting standards is very similar to the first half results. Can you give us an update on the guidance, which should be the impact of the different accounting standards on Endesa's EBITDA in your accounts?</p>
          <p>And the third question is on your hedging policy in Italy. During the whole year, your forward selling in Italy has been locking into prices for a lower proportion of volumes than in previous years particularly than in 2009, you are still only at 65% forward selling, is there any particular reason, is this simply that you are waiting for a recovery in Italy on wholesale prices, and if that's the case why do you think that there actually be such a recovery? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Javier. Let's start from first of all from the guidance with regard EBITDA 2010. The guidance that I gave 17 billion euro is substantially ordinary income. So there are not any capital gain, because even the placement of Enel Green Power, which is going to generate the capital gain at a consolidated level that will not generate any capital gain. There will be just a capital gain at the holding company level.</p>
          <p>All of this type of capital gain now goes to the equity. So, are not reported as part of the profit and loss. Therefore, the 17 billion euro is let's say ordinary and if we go to the bottom of the profit and loss you are asking me something that I'm not so inclined to give you, but for sure what I can tell you is that we are going to definitely beat the 4 billion euro net ordinary income that we committed to. It is clearly there, and that amount will be fully subject to dividend payout, as you know.</p>
          <p>Endesa EBITDA at the end of September and full year; first of all, let me tell you how much is the impact at the end of the nine months of the so-called accountancy effect, which is basically the IFRIC 18, is in the region of substantially 300 million euro, that's the impact. But in terms of valuation, it's just because &#x2013; it's just little bit lower, because already last year we had an accountancy impact of few &#x2013; less than 50 million euro.</p>
          <p>Now if we look at the full year guidance, and if we assume that these effects could be in the region, as I said during the &#x2013; at the beginning of this year, 400 million euro and I confirmed it, we have to assume that then this could reach an EBITDA of 7.8 or something like that, very close to that 1 billion euro by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Hedging policies, when it comes to Italy; well, you're right, last year at this stage, we had already sold 94% at an average price of 75 euro per megawatt hour. What we are missing here is not the usual final customer base, just to be very clear and specific, the famous household or the small office, home office, what we are missing here is a single buyer. The single buyer has not yet entered into the market, has not yet bought any kilowatt hour for next year. We expect that this is going to take place by the end of the year. And we have to keep a certain amount of capacity available for the system.</p>
          <p>And therefore we expect that the single buyer is going to buy this electricity by the end of the year. And that would allow us to reach more or less the 100%. Coupled with the ongoing forward sales that we are continuing to do on a rolling basis, and price will be in line because if we look at our current portfolio, as we said, we are in the region of 72 euro, 73 euro per megawatt hour. The calendar today are in the region of 69, so we expect that when the single buyer is going to buy we should not have any major changes in our average base of price of our backlog.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening, everybody. My first question is on the Infrastructure and Network division, the organic growth of the EBITDA level has been in the nine months 10%. And if I have calculated correctly, even 20% in the third quarter. The question is, at what extent we can extrapolate this trend also in the fourth quarter that will bring the EBITDA for the full year close to 4 billion, if I'm correct?</p>
          <p>The second question is just a follow-up on the cost of debt, I understand that the increase from 5% to 5.4% is a consequence of the imbalance between the gross debt and net debt, but I don't know if the increase on the cash position from 7 billion at the beginning of the year to the current 15.7, is just a consequence of the tariff deficit, I don't think so. So I would like to, if you can elaborate on this?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on the tax rate. You maintained your indication for 32%, 33% normalized, as a matter of fact in the first nine months, the tax rate has been 30%. So probably for this year will be lower than the normalized tax rate. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's start from infrastructure and network first. Well, I think that infrastructure and network really delivered excellent results, they have absorbed the capital gain sold during the &#x2013; or the asset sold during the last year, the reason for that is due to the expected regulatory positive evolution which regards the equalization mechanism of the lost connection fees regarding 2009 in particular and also the current year. We also have on the positive side the increase in the connection fees, which is netted in the connection fees minus 14, but in reality we have a positive contribution of about 40 million to 50 million euro of connection fees to the small power generation &#x2013; generators. I'm referring to the so-called distributed generation, which refers to the solar photovoltaic. So there is a huge increase of demands of additional work in connection. This is, therefore, is contributing to our results and also the increase in the distribution activities because we haven't seen an increase in the electricity demand. So if we &#x2013; and last but not least the continuous efficiency improvement because let's not forget that when we talk about Zenith one of the key player in this project continues to be the distribution business in Italy.</p>
          <p>So this is going to continue because it's a structure, it's not a one-off and therefore if you want to see what is expected to be at the end of the year, well I would say that 3.8 billion euro will be a fair amount to assume could be even more it will very much depend also on some regulatory items regarding particular &#x2013; the final results of the service &#x2013; of the quality of the service rendered to the final customer, which as you know is normally fixed at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Cost of debt; cost of debt, as I said we normally represent net financial charges versus net financial debt. You might recall that we normally calculate our net financial debt deducting from our gross debt, the tariff deficit in Spain and this tariff deficit is not generating, let's say, or is not remunerated at a level in line with our cost effect. This spread, which is in the region of 1%, 2%, is what is basically influencing our net financial charges on a full-year basis. So this is, I would say, the vast majority of the change that we have reported at the end of this year. Anyway, 5.4% is this year, but if we look at the following year we still see 5% of leverage as I said and as we have given as a guidance.</p>
          <p>Tax rate; well, today we foresee 32%, 33%. You're right, it could be 30% at the end of the nine months, but normally when you close the books at the end of the year, there are many items that are considered that might change a little bit this final average, what we will report at the end of the nine months is a proxy, what we see at the end of the year is still in the region of 32%, 33%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Returning to the infrastructure and network division, if my numbers are correct, assuming 3.8 billion for the full-year would imply a decrease in the fourth quarter. So a significant change in the trend we have seen in the nine months, is that something I'm missing maybe something to restate on the fourth quarter '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is not like dividing by three and multiplying by four. It depends on the demand evolution, it depends region-by-region, what do we expect in terms of electricity transported, so what we have seen in the third quarter, we have seen a very positive seasonality effect in terms of transportation and in terms of increase in the connection to the power generator. And that's what we foresee now, so 3.8 I think is the guidance that I can give you today on the basis of what I see.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening, I have three questions to ask please. One is related to the CapEx, if I'm right it was flat more or less compared to last year, if you can give us an indication of the CapEx you assume for the full-year 2010, your 45 billion euro guidance for net debt at the end of the year. And also the dynamic of working capital that you are expecting in the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>Then I have a question related to Russia. I saw that the results from the supply business in Russia were quite strong. It offset the capital gain of 700 euro last year. Could you elaborate a bit on that, if the market conditions for this kind of business are getting more favorable in the past quarters? And third question very brief is again on distribution, if you can give us a figure on the cost efficiencies that you managed to create in nine months 2010 in network and infrastructure? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me start from your first question. CapEx at the end of the quarter, in line with last year. We confirm the guidance that I gave at the beginning of this year, which is in the region of 6.5 billion euro to 7 billion euro for the entire year. Therefore, we expect a recovery in the fourth quarter in terms of spending but anyway lower than what was originally planned during the March presentation. When it comes to working capital, well we are definitely improving our &#x2013; our receivable structure and days outstanding by reducing it, we put in place some strong action to improve our working capital.</p>
          <p>We expect to be at a level at the end of this year in terms of the net working capital in line with 2009 despite an increase in the sales in the revenues therefore, so I think it's positive. Basically this is one of the explanations why we believe that by the end of the year we should be in a position to generate positive cash flow to serve net debt reduction.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Russia, well, Russia is showing steady and growing results and a positive and stable regulatory framework. Let me try to address this statement. First of all, generally speaking, the regulatory framework is proceeding according to schedule. There is just a delay in the famous net back, which is expected to take place not anymore in 2011 as was originally stated because of the financial crisis, but it is expected to take place between 2013 and '14.</p>
          <p>And if you look at the wholesale price evolution, in particular, the day-ahead market prices you see increase in the region of 26% as I said. And this is quite positive, because means that the market start to really function as liberalized market, and the dark spread and the spark spread, which are the key indicator, are showing steady and constant growth whilst the capacity payment is still stable despite increase in the electricity price. So we don't see any major changes, we are exactly proceeding according to schedule and according to what we have originally &#x2013; we have originally assumed.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the supply activities, well, you're right, we are seeing higher tariffs than expected and higher prices than expected, whilst on the size of the commodity we are securing our supply with long-term contract with local coal producer and with &#x2013; even with &#x2013; when it comes to gas, we have secured our gas supply. Therefore we can count on a stable commodity cost benefiting of the increase of the electricity price.</p>
          <p>When it comes to distribution business, Italy, well, if we look at the Zenith project as a whole, and therefore if we look at the Zenith project referring to the charts that I have reported, the chart on number nine, the contribution to the, let's say, the already achieved results, both in terms of EBITDA improvements, in particular EBITDA improvements, on a cumulative basis, well 40% is coming from distribution business. If you want to know what is the impact on the current year, it is &#x20AC;60 million versus 2009, but of course it is higher if we compare versus 2008 to the previous cost structure. So what we see here in this division is constant and continued delivery in efficiency and quality improvements. We expect that by the end of the year, the contribution to this EBITDA improvement in the distribution business will be in the region of &#x20AC;100 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good evening. Two questions if I may, first, can we have an update on forward sales in Italy in 2012 in terms of percentage and price. And secondly, if you can just clarify on the 45 billion net debt target for the end of the year. Does that include only the deals announced &#x2013; the disposals announced so far, so the 8.4 billion, or all the disposal plan of 10 billion that you announced at the latest strategy presentation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start from your second question. The &#x20AC;45 billion net financial target is the result of the disposal already announced and listed in my second pages, plus the results of the finalization of the sale of the Bulgarian assets, plus some other minor assets by the end of the year. On top of this, and of course assuming to cash in all this transaction by the end of year, for the time being, we are confident that this is going to take place but of course we do not have the full control, in some cases it depends on some authority that might release the authorization with some delays.</p>
          <p>On top of this &#x2013; of this disposal plan, we are going to be cash flow positive as I said, and therefore thanks to the combination of the asset disposal that I have listed in chart number two, plus Bulgaria, plus some other minor assets, we should be able to reach this target also leveraging on strong cash flow in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the 2012, well there are two elements to highlight here. One element is that the price is not bad, the price that we see and we are selling, thanks to our rolling forward sales strategy, is in the region of &#x20AC;73, &#x20AC;74 per megawatt hour on average, which is slightly better than what we see next year. When it comes to the volume, we are at this stage in the region of 20, 25% without considering the automatic renewal that, as usual, we should expect, having built a portfolio of the magnitude that we have and without considering the single buyer, which still has to buy, as we said, in 2011. But it is expected to buy 2012 as well, like, by the way, it did basically last year.</p>
          <p>So on the positive side, we see the price which is recovering. On the other hand, I don't call it negative, I think it's effectual, the forward sales is continuing on the household, on the retail markets. We see this strange behavior of the single buyer, which sooner or later has, of course, to change, but altogether we see positive signs of recovering of the prices which I think is good.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. I just would like to come back on the CapEx, can you be specific on how much is the CapEx in 2010, which project has been delayed, where should we see more CapEx compared to the 6.6 billion you were expecting for 2011, because you have to recover the CapEx you haven't done this year, or if there is really a revision of the overall CapEx plan.</p>
          <p>The second question is if you can give us a little bit of your feeling on the timing of the securitization of the tariff deficit at Endesa, how things are going, which is your take on the regulatory changes in Spain. And yeah, the other thing is also on the location of the debt within the group, do you think it's optimal now you finished the procuring process, do you think you will reshuffle the debt within the group going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you Antonella. First let me start with the CapEx expected at the end of this year. There are some delays, but there are some savings as well, therefore when I said that we do expect to lend at &#x20AC;6.57 billion &#x2013; say &#x20AC;6.5 billion CapEx this year, we do not expect to have a particular increase in the next year with the only exception of a couple of hundred million euro which might come from the delay of two months in months three or four for &#x20AC;200 million to &#x20AC;300 million. So the savings that we have done versus the &#x20AC;7.5 billion target of 2010, can be considered structural, with the only exception of &#x20AC;300 million which will impact next year. But having said that we are also of course revisiting 2011 as well, because there are a couple of projects that of course are under analysis. I'm referring to Porto Empedocle for instance, that &#x2013; it is part of the plan, but we still have to finalize the starting of the project and therefore this might influence next year, as long as the real start of Porto Tolle, which is still pending of some final authorization, but I will be more specific anyway next year.</p>
          <p>Answering your question anyway, there are for sure &#x20AC;500 million at least of structural savings, this was what we had already planned previously. Second question, tariff deficit timing, well, our view and our position also taking into account what we understood and heard from the government is that the technical problem regarding the rating of this issuance should be solved by the end of this month. And we are still confident to cash in the first tranche as originally planned by the end of this year. And that will have an impact on the Enel group, on Endesa in particular, in the region of &#x20AC;1.5 billion at least.</p>
          <p>So we believe that this is going to take place. When it comes to the regulatory framework in Spain, well, there is clear and open discussion between the utility sector and the government. We don't see or we don't foresee, as an outcome, an agreement between the government and the opposition. We rather believe that the government has to take a decision with regards to the regulatory evolution, which, as you know, affects the coal production, the local coal, regards the renewal, in particular the solar photovoltaic sector and therefore, is not affecting our presence there, and regards also the tariff increase which has to be addressed.</p>
          <p>We are active. We are also confident that there will be an agreed end solution which will be satisfactory for both parties. We do not have to forget that the utility sector in Spain is one of the key sectors really investing in the local economy and involving thousands and thousands of employees. So we do not believe that the government is going to limit the capacity of spending of this industry.</p>
          <p>Allocation of debt. Well, as you might recall, we have already pushed down &#x20AC;18 billion in Spain through our subsidiary, which is the company controlling in the 92% of Endesa. Therefore, we are in some way optimized under this perspective. For the time being, we don't foresee any further action in that direction. But clearly, and this is something that will be addressed during the industrial plan, we are looking at the entire structure of the group in order to optimize the cash flow from our subsidiaries.</p>

And also, if you could repeat, if you already said it, which was the nine-month EBITDA for Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne? And also last question, you said that you expect the first tranche of the tariff deficit to be cashed in by year-end, could you give us an indication of the size of the first tranche? Thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>Well, let me start from the last question, the size, if I understood properly, of this tranche should be equal to &#x20AC;1.5 billion is our portion. As a whole, it should be in the region of &#x20AC;3 billion. We are entitled to receive 42% of that. So it could be between &#x20AC;3 billion and &#x20AC;4 billion for the 100%. That's what we do expect.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne nine months EBITDA, the reported result is equal to &#x20AC;623 million and, as I said, our projection for the end of the year will be higher than &#x20AC;800 million. When it comes to the level of foreign exchange effects full year 2010, I believe that you're referring to the net debt.</p>

          <p>The net debt reported at the end of September showed a foreign exchange effect of &#x20AC;1.1 billion. I mean, it is not very easy to predict what will be the level of the euro versus the dollar at the end of the year. But very rightly, we do not expect any major changes versus this &#x20AC;1 billion. It will be very close to that amount, the effect at the end of the year</p>
          <p>And last point, which was the first question, what is the impact of the Zenith project in terms of EBITDA improvement in the nine months 2010? It has been equal at &#x20AC;215 million. And when it comes to the working capital and to the cash improvement, we said we have already achieved something like &#x20AC;700 million of improvements on accumulated basis, out of which &#x20AC;200 million will impact the current year for it has been recorded at the end of September of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if I may add something, I was asking about the EBITDA contribution on a full year basis linked to the Zenith program, implied in your over 17 billion EBITDA target. So from the 215 million you booked in the nine months, are you expecting to add some more in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it will be very likely close to &#x20AC;300 million on a full year basis and including also the positive contribution in this Zenith project as well. So you can consider &#x20AC;300 million of EBITDA improvements for 2010.</p>
