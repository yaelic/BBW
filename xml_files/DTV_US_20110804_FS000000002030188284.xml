          <p>My name is Leah and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the DIRECTV second quarter 2011 conference call. All lines have been muted to prevent background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jonathan Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you operator and thank you everyone for joining us for our second quarter 2011 financial results and outlook conference call. With me today on the call are Mike White, our President and CEO; Pat Doyle, our CFO; Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America; and Larry Hunter, General Counsel. In a moment I'll hand the call over to Mike, Bruce and Pat for some introductory marks but first I'll read to you the following.</p>
          <p>On this call we make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ are described in the risk factors section and elsewhere in each of DIRECTV's and DIRECTV U.S.' annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC which are available at www.sec.gov. Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to statements we make related to our business strategy and regarding our outlook for 2011 financial results, liquidity and capital resources.</p>
          <p>Additionally in accordance with the SEC's Regulation G that requires companies reporting non-GAAP financial measures to reconcile these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure we provide reconciliation schedules for the non-GAAP measures which are attached to our earnings release and posted on our website at DIRECTV.com. So with that I'm pleased to introduce Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon and thank you, everyone for joining us today. From my perspective DIRECTV's diversified portfolio of businesses across all of the Americas delivered another strong quarter of industry leading growth. And parenthetically I might add that our momentum continues as we recently achieved another impressive milestone which we'll be announcing later on today after the call, reaching 30 million customers including Sky Mexico across the DTV platform. For those of you who don't have the numbers right in front of you, by the way, that works out to about 300,000 net adds for the month for DIRECTV across all of the Americas.</p>
          <p>We continue to extend our position as the world's largest pay television service by leveraging the strength of our brand as well as our best-in-class video experience with continued operating discipline across all of our disparate geographies, demographics and, I might add, macroeconomic conditions.</p>
          <p>As you saw in our release, the consolidated revenue and operating profit before depreciation and amortization both grew double digits at 13%, representing an even faster growth rate than last quarter's performance. This accelerating growth was driven by another quarter of exceptional performance at DIRECTV Latin America as well as by solid financial returns from DIRECTV U.S. that were entirely consistent with our expectations. Consolidated net income increased 29% in the second quarter and we repurchased over $1.5 billion of DIRECTV stock, fueling a 52% lift in earnings per share to $0.91.</p>
          <p>Now, before I turn the call over to Bruce and Pat for a more detailed review of our Latin American financials I'd like to offer just a few observations. Let me begin with DIRECTV U.S., where industry leading revenue growth of 7% and an OPBDA improvement of 4% are right in line with our guidance for the quarter and the full year. Now, at the top line we're continuing to see solid growth from advanced services and premium channels as well as double-digit growth in our commercial sales, although pay per view revenues were a little soft in the quarter mostly due to the timing of events.</p>
          <p>In terms of our net additions the lackluster economy and a tough competitive landscape drove our churn slightly higher than we initially forecast. The pickup in competitive intensity that we saw coming out of the first quarter has yet to abate, I would say, when I look at the marketplace in general. Triple play offers without contractual commitments and higher cash back incentives by both the cable operators and telco providers along with consumers who are increasingly under stress from an ongoing weak economy have resulted in more price-conscious consumers shopping for better deals.</p>
          <p>In response, we've significantly stepped up our efforts to closely manage churn in a more targeted fashion. For instance, we further refined our segmentation analysis to identify those customers that are most likely to churn as they get close to the end of their two-year contract and match them up with our best agents and best offers.</p>
          <p>We also increased our upgrade and retention spending for higher quality subscribers and raised credit score requirements for new customers in many of our sales distribution channels. Also enhancing our churn mitigation efforts are ongoing initiatives aimed at improving overall customer service levels. Recently our hard work in that area was recognized when DIRECTV was noted as the only company in the pay television industry to have a better American customer satisfaction index survey score compared with prior year. I might also note that Consumer Reports rated DIRECTV best among TV providers for both phone and online help this quarter.</p>
          <p>All in all, I think we've made excellent progress in addressing our churn issues and I'm cautiously optimistic that the worst is behind us. In fact, based on the favorable subscriber trends we've seen so far in the third quarter I think we've also regained some of our lost momentum. We're seeing a terrific response to our popular NFL Sunday Ticket offer and as I mentioned we're also seeing favorable voluntary churn trends. More importantly, we remain on track to meet all of our DIRECTV U.S. full year guidance for revenues, OPBDA and cash flow.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Latin America, where as you may have seen we recently achieved a major milestone surpassing 10 million total customers in Brazil, PanAmericana and Mexico. This accomplishment is a true testament to all of our employees' strong commitment to success, the strength of the DIRECTV and Sky brands, and our best-in-class video experience.</p>
          <p>Just one bit of evidence; last quarter the Brazilian Direct Marketing Association awarded Sky Best of the Best in the customer service category for our sky HDTV product. In addition, Telecenter which is our regional customer service operation in Colombia received two first-place awards for the best customer service strategy and best in-house.</p>
          <p>Latin America by any measure continues to demonstrate tremendous momentum. DIRECTV Latin America surpassed last quarter's historic customer growth to set another all-time high for net additions as we're continuing to see strong consumer demand for our products and services all across the continent, along with the underlying favorable demographic and macroeconomic trends.</p>
          <p>Once again, the significant subscriber growth was primarily driven by Brazil as the net adds in that country were more than double last year's level.</p>
          <p>Equally notable our post paid churn improved to 1.44% from 1.45% last year and remains lower than levels that we've seen in the U.S. business. Furthermore DIRECTV Latin America exceeded all of our key financial metrics recorded during the second quarter of 2010 which as you'll all recall benefited from the run up to the FIFA World Cup.</p>
          <p>Not only were revenues north of our expectations because of subscriber performance and robust ARPU growth, but the significant gain in market share and related acquisition costs did not come at the expense of our profitability. As I'm sure you noted our margins continued to expand and OPBDA growth accelerated to 60%. These growth rates coupled with favorable macroeconomic conditions in the region continue to give evidence that the DIRECTV Latin America business offers a terrific long-term growth opportunity. And as you'll hear from Bruce in a few minutes we're on pace to do even better than the increased guidance we provided for DTV LA on our last earnings call.</p>
          <p>In summary, our second quarter results reflect continued successful operational execution against all of the growth strategies we outlined at our Investor Day with you last December. In the U.S. we continue to navigate through tough market conditions by adhering to strict economic principles with regards to the credit quality of our subscriber base as we demonstrate our unique ability to match the increased value of our differentiated products and service enhancements to consumers' expanding needs.</p>
          <p>And in Latin America we continued to benefit from favorable market conditions by profitably increasing market share through a segmented approach that not only extends our leadership in the higher end markets with a focus on HD and DVR superiority but also penetrates the rapidly growing middle market segment with attractive lower priced packages.</p>
          <p>The combination of both our U.S. and Latin American businesses provide our shareholders with I think a unique investment opportunity that benefits from solid and steady returns in the more mature U.S. marketplace as well as from the tremendous growth potential in the still underpenetrated emerging Latin America marketplace.</p>
          <p>So with that I'll turn it over to Bruce Churchill to review our Latin America results and outlook in more detail, Bruce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mike. As Mike mentioned in his opening statement, our results in Latin America continue to exceed our expectations with yet another record quarter of both gross and net additions and all of our key metrics showing strong year-over-year improvement. Just as a reminder, unless otherwise noted our results exclude those of Sky Mexico, which we do not consolidate. For the quarter gross additions of 823,000 were 25% higher than last year. In Brazil gross additions increased approximately 85% compared to Q2 2010 to approximately 435,000. Sky Brazil continues to have great success with its middle market products, which grew 147% compared to Q2 2010 mostly reflecting the launch of the Sky Fit product late last year. For the quarter our middle market products represented 65% of Brazil's gross additions.</p>
          <p>In PanAmericana gross additions declined approximately 10% compared to the same period last year reflecting our controlled growth strategy in Venezuela and the beneficial effect that the 2010 FIFA World Cup had on last year's results. Excluding Venezuela PanAmericana gross additions were almost equal to last year as strong year-over-year growth in Argentina offset declines in Colombia and Chile.</p>
          <p>Prepaid gross additions represented 17% of our total gross additions in the quarter. Cumulatively prepaid subscribers make up nearly 10% of our 6.7 million subscribers and are predominantly in our PanAmericana region.</p>
          <p>Advanced products represented about 16% of new customers, down significantly from 30% last year. There are really two factors driving this. First, take rates of advance rates in PanAmericana decreased approximately 50% year-over-year which reflects the fact that in the run up to the 2010 World Cup we ran aggressive advance product promotions throughout PanAmericana achieving take rates achieving 50% in some countries. Second, as we continue to see sales growth in lower priced packages, by definition advanced products become a smaller part of the mix. For example, in Brazil, the number of advanced product sales more than doubled compared to last year but as a percent of total sales they are roughly flat because of the tremendous growth in other products.</p>
          <p>As I've mentioned in the past, although we're pleased with the success of our middle market products across the region we have not lost sight of the fact that our traditional A and B households are our most profitable customers and the ones we work hard to get and keep. Advanced products represented approximately 25% of our 6.7 million subscribers and are an important part of our product mix. As a result, we remain very focused on selling advanced products to both new customers as well as upgrading existing ones. In fact, in Brazil, where we now have more than 600,000 high-definition subscribers, approximately 60% of our new HD customers in the quarter came from our existing subscriber base.</p>
          <p>With respect to churn, our post-paid churn for the quarter of 1.44% is mostly unchanged from the same period last year, reflecting slightly lower churn in Brazil offset by slightly higher churn in PanAmericana. Post-paid churn in the PanAmericana region benefited from our controlled growth in Venezuela as lower sales typically result in lower churn but was negatively impact due to last year's benefit from the 2010 World Cup.</p>
          <p>In summary, we ended the quarter with 472,000 net additions that were relatively balanced both from a regional and product mix perspective.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our financial results, driven by strong subscriber growth revenues increased 46% compared to last year or approximately 40% if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange. In particular, excluding foreign exchange, more than 80% of our growth came from the increase in the subscriber base. The remaining growth came from higher ARPU, primarily reflecting higher pricing and increased penetration in advanced products and premium packages. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, ARPU increased around 8%. It is a testament to our success in attracting and retaining high value premium customers.</p>
          <p>In addition, the subscriber base in Brazil is a larger piece of the total pie today than it was a year ago and in general ARPUs are higher across the board in Brazil. This does have the effect of driving up the overall average for DTVLA. OPBDA cash flow before interest and taxes in the quarter were also stronger compared to last year. OPBDA increased $158 million or 60% over last year mostly due to the gross profit on the incremental revenues, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition costs related to the increased gross adds and increased retention and upgrade spending particularly in Brazil. The higher OPBDA flowed through to cash flow before interest and taxes, which was $141 million versus $69 million a year ago.</p>
          <p>Regarding Venezuela, the government continues to tightly regulate the repatriation of local products out of the country &#x2013; profits, excuse me, out of the country. This situation restricts our ability to repatriate dollars which explains the lower foreign currency exchange losses this year compared to last. In fact, we incurred no repatriation charges in Venezuela this quarter. The modest funds that did come out of Venezuela this quarter came out at official rates through the official Central Bank process. As of June 30 we had approximately $264 million of cash on hand in Venezuela, expressed using the official rates of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>I would like to also mention the results of Sky Mexico, which were released by Televisa a few weeks ago. Sky Mexico delivered another strong quarter adding 247,000 net subscribers compared to 251,000 a year ago. The financial results of Sky Mexico were equally strong as revenue and OPBDA grew 19% and 26% respectively.</p>
          <p>In total DTV LA's platforms combined including Sky Mexico now serve more than 10.3 million subscribers in the region.</p>
          <p>And finally, with more than half of 2011 behind us I thought I would provide you with some thoughts on how I see the rest of 2011 playing out. During our Q1 earnings call back in May I mentioned that barring any unforeseen change in the general macroeconomic environment in Latin America particularly in Brazil and barring any large swings in foreign exchange rates again, particularly in Brazil we expected both full year revenue and OPBDA to grow closer to 30% year-over-year with total net additions to the 1.25 to 1.5 range, and a modest increase in subscriber-related capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>Based on the continued momentum we're seeing in sales and our continued lower post-paid churn I feel confident that we will meet or exceed the high end of these estimates for the full year. In short we look forward to another exceptional year in Latin America. Let me now turn it over to Pat to discuss the U.S. Pat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bruce. Overall DIRECTV U.S. had a good second quarter highlighted by solid revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. As you heard from Mike earlier, we had some challenges with churn in the quarter but I believe we made excellent progress towards addressing that.</p>
          <p>Looking first at subscribers, as you saw, DIRECTV U.S. gained 26,000 net new customers in the quarter. Gross additions were up a touch on a year-over-year basis demonstrating the DIRECTV brand and service continues to resonate strongly in the marketplace. The increase in demand is notable particularly concerning the economic and competitive conditions within the pay TV industry. Specifically, we saw strong results this quarter in our consumer electronics and commercial channels, which more than offset continued declines from our telco partners.</p>
          <p>Second quarter churn of 1.59% was slightly higher than we initially forecast due mostly to an increase in voluntary churn. We attribute this increase primarily to more aggressive competitive offers we're seeing in the pay TV space, especially in the telco territories. Another contributing factor was the price increases we implemented earlier this year, for the first time on both programming packages and lease fees. And to a smaller degree, we saw a slight uptick in involuntary churn mostly related to the continued lackluster economy and its impact on higher risk customers rolling off their promotional offer periods.</p>
          <p>To address these challenges, we placed a tremendous focus on implementing strategies that would enhance our ability to actively manage the increases in churn and so far I'm pleased with the progress we've made. As you have heard us say before, the balance between our upgrade and retention spending and churn rate is heavily dependent on both macroeconomic and competitive conditions. As such, we spent modestly more this quarter than a year ago and prudently managed the economic trade-off towards our higher quality subscribers. In addition, we continue to step up the utilization of targeted segmentation analysis to better identify higher risk customers and match them with our best agents and offers. We also continue to refine and tighten up our credit policies to mitigate the impact of involuntary churn.</p>
          <p>Combining our subscriber growth with the higher ARPU yields and industry leading revenue growth of 7%, the ARPU growth was driven by increased penetration by both new and existing customers paying for advanced services as well as from strong commercial and paid premium channel sales. Approximately 70% of our customers now have advanced products and we're continuing to see about one-third of new customers sign up for our Whole-Home DVR.</p>
          <p>Commercial revenues grew again by almost 20% while the paid premium movie channel category posted the highest buy rates per subscriber in over two years. Partially offsetting these benefits were softer pay per view revenues related to weaker movie titles, lower adult buys and weaker event revenues compared to the prior period. In addition, higher acquisition and retention credits had an unfavorable impact on ARPU.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the bottom line, second quarter OPBDA growth of 4% was in line with our quarter and full-year expectations. OPBDA margin declined year-over-year to 27.4% as increases in programming expenses continue to place downward pressure on margins and this trend will continue for the remainder of the year. Also contributing to the decline and tying back to our earlier discussion about churn was our decision to increase upgrade and retention spending. The majority of the increase was targeted toward upgrading higher value subscribers with HD DVRs as well as our popular newer services such as Whole-Home DVR and broadband connectivity. Also in the quarter were higher costs associated with converting customers who were previously receiving programming from a third party satellite whose lease has expired.</p>
          <p>Looking quickly at our quarterly consolidated results, net income grew 29% to $701 million and diluted earnings per share accelerated 52% to $0.91 as solid operating profit growth and our share repurchase strategy provided a generous lift. Consolidated cash flow before interest and taxes also remained strong with double-digit growth to $1 billion this quarter. Free cash flow also improved albeit at a lower, slower rate as growth was impacted by an increase in cash tax payments, greater capital expenditure and higher working capital requirements. Please note this increase in tax payments is expected to continue throughout the year as earnings before taxes and our cash tax rate are both expected to be higher than the prior year periods.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the balance sheet, this quarter we repurchased 31 million shares of DIRECTV stock for $1.5 billion bringing cumulative repurchases to approximately $18 billion or nearly 50% of shares outstanding. Additionally we redeemed the remaining 66% of the $1 billion high yield notes that were issued in 2005. With these transactions, we ended the quarter with about $13.5 billion in total debt while bringing our total debt to trailing U.S. OPBDA leverage ratio targets to 2.5 times.</p>
          <p>Before wrapping up, I would like to make a few comments about our outlook which you heard, DIRECTV U.S. is on track to meet guidance for all of its key metrics and as Bruce described a few minutes ago, we are optimistic that DIRECTV Latin America is on a pace to exceed the increased guidance provided on our last earnings call. In addition our plan is to continue to return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. We expect to continue repurchasing shares in the same $100 million per week range that you've seen in recent quarters while maintaining our leverage target at current levels.</p>
          <p>During the second half of this year we expect to conclude our work related to bringing DIRECTV Latin America into the credit which will provide additional capacity for 2012. In the meantime, we have plenty of liquidity and free cash flow generation to continue to fund our current share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Summing it all up, we remain on target at the consolidated level to continue leading the industry in double-digit revenue and OPBDA growth as well as returning capital to shareholders. With that I'll turn the call back over to John.</p>

          <p>Thanks Pat. Before moving on to Q&amp;A, investors should note we have members of the media on this call in a listen-only mode. I would like to remind the media they are not authorized to quote any participants directly or in substance other than representatives of DIRECTV. In addition, we're webcasting this call live on the Internet and an archived copy will be kept on our website. Operator, we're ready &#x2013; I might add that we are having some technical problems on our webcast but hopefully we'll get those fixed shortly. Operator, we're ready for the first question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay thanks, good morning &#x2013; or good afternoon. Maybe just some comments on both the churn and the ARPU outlook; the churn is a little bit higher than we thought in the U.S, and you mentioned some efforts to lower churn, we were seeing some positive response. How do you expect it to trend in the second half and also we thought the ARPU in the U.S. looks like it's been decelerating, do you expect that trend to continue, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Do you want to start Pat, and then -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that the tactic that we talked about in our speech notes I think we're seeing really good traction; June was a good month on churn and particularly on voluntary churn. July's results have also been very good so we &#x2013; we're not claiming victory yet but we're optimistic that we've got the right formula and that voluntary churn should be much better in the third quarter. It probably ought to look a lot like last year's churn.</p>
          <p>On ARPU, yeah, I think the second quarter in particular we had a few headwinds with &#x2013; the pay per view was down. Ad sales wasn't &#x2013; year-over-year wasn't as good as we would like it to be and then we've got the impact of the free HD which came in last June so we're kind of comparing now a full year of free HD for those customers that qualify versus last year. We do, again &#x2013; we do think we're &#x2013; we're meeting our internal expectations. This is right online with what we expected and it's consistent with our full-year guidance that we gave of &#x2013; on revenue growth of mid to high single-digit growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, John, on the churn thing, as we kind of dove into it and kind of parsed it, analyzed it, we found that there were a number of customers going shopping at say plus or minus three months of the end of their two-year contract. We've been able to pretty surgically target those that are prone to do that and as Pat said, I feel pretty good. We've had an excellent month in July on churn. Still got a little bit of a tick-up on involuntary churn which I think is more the economy. But it's &#x2013; our improvements in voluntary have overwhelmed that so our total churn for July looks good. So I'm optimistic we'll be fine for the rest of the year and we're kind of fine-tuning some things out of that as well.</p>
          <p>On ARPU, I can't quite tell, everybody's movie business seems to be down; the pay per view even of our competitors I noticed a number of them highlighted and I don't know whether that's kind just kind of weak titles from the box office or what, but we've got a lot of good things going on the premium side, we've got tremendous strength. And frankly, our ARPU growth, as I look at it for third and fourth quarter, I expect it to be better than what you saw in Q3. So we're pretty much right in line where we thought we would for the full year, as I look for &#x2013; is kind of my outlook for Q3 and Q4.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just have a long-term question for Mr. White. If I looked at sort all of the capital that's been used by the industry over the last three years, it seems as though you have your dishes out there sort of trying to get wireless spectrum, you've got the cable guys investing in more Internet capacity; some companies buying content. And I look at the down VOD numbers for you guys and others in the industry; do you think that's a harbinger of things to come and do you feel comfortable where the firm is sort of looking out five years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I think we're very confident as we look out five years. We did a comprehensive strategy project last year; we just updated it for our board of directors. Frankly, as we look at the VOD opportunity I think we're just scratching the surface on the potential. We're going to add more titles next year. I &#x2013; honestly, I think if I look at kind of what happened in VOD in the quarter given it was kind of systemic across a lot of our competitors as well I think it's got more to do with kind of lousy titles that came out of Hollywood for the quarter that just didn't really work with consumers.</p>
          <p>But, frankly, I still think that's a tremendous opportunity for us as we look going forward. But we're still bullish on kind of the VOD and the TV Everywhere parts of our strategy and what we think those opportunities are and I think you'll see that come back in nicely in 3-Q4.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind just to size up this stuff, I mean, the premiums category, which had a fantastic quarter, is almost 10 times I think, the size of pay per view. So it's a relatively small piece of the total today. We still think it's got big growth opportunity and even with that we weren't down versus a year ago, we just weren't up the kind of 20% that we were in first quarter.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, this is Jeff Wlodarczak; Pat, can you confirm, is 1.5% for a churn for the year still a reasonable target? And then the level of retention and upgrade in the second quarter; is that a good level to think about for the back half of the year quarterly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, we haven't come off of our kind of 1.5% plus range as being our goal and we certainly think it's achievable. On upgrade and retention, as Mike said, I think we goosed it up a little bit as we tried to deal with customers that may be leaving us because of upgrade issues but, again, our higher quality customers &#x2013; subtly in there was about a $15 or $16 million year-over-year increase in upgrade and retention related to this satellite lease that we're coming to the end of which will drop off as the year goes on. So I think in the back half of the year you'll see upgrade and retention probably be again, slightly higher than prior years but probably not at the level we saw in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks and then one for Bruce. DIRECTV Latin America another great result; you raised your guidance at the high-end of your previous guidance which implies a bit of a slowdown in the second half, is that something we should be thinking about? Not that I'm giving you grief; it was obviously a fantastic number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly. You guys are never satisfied, honestly. I think we're very comfortable with how the business continues to go. I just don't want to get too far ahead of myself in any of these areas operating in emerging markets, it can be very volatile. A lot of it depends a bit on where our controlled growth strategy in Venezuela goes. If we're actually able to get &#x2013; able to pay for boxes out of funds coming out of Venezuela we'll take advantage of those opportunities but it's all a bit uncertain at that stage so &#x2013; at this stage, sorry. So I don't want to get too far over my skis as they say on that. But I'm not looking particularly for a big slowdown in the second half, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Jeff, look we're trying to manage guidance at a consolidated corporate level as it relates to guidance. I think when you're dealing with 50% growth rates in any business I think predictions are always difficult. But, frankly, as I announced, we just crossed 30 million subscribers so you can do the math on that. We're continuing to have a very strong performance out of both Latin America and we had nice performance in the U.S. in the month of July. So I think we'll continue to see good performance out of Latin America the balance of the year. But I wouldn't read into it anything other than what Bruce just said.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Just two briefly; could you provide more color on the leveraging of the Latin American business, perhaps both in terms of timing and maybe you could quantify a bit for us the size of the debt issuance that you're thinking of. And then also if you could provide perhaps a bit of color on the connected box strategy and where you are in terms of reaching some of the targets you laid out at your Investor Day in the fall. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the leveraging I think we have now designed a plan of how to incorporate it. We're working kind of the lawyers, tax people, financial reporting so I feel very comfortable that we've got a design of how to bring it into the credit that we're not ready to talk about today, but that's all been worked out.</p>
          <p>I think what our planning is to do is to get that done before year-end with our discussions with the rating agents, we just will see how their view is of the leverage opportunity that Latin America brings into the credit and then we'll go from there. I think it's kind of too early to get specific on those numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the connected box strategy, in fact we just did a deep dive review on it, I think first the good news is of the customers that get connected we are seeing the increase in ARPU that we expected. In fact we're beating it, we're seeing a $2.50 increase per subscriber once they get connected in terms of I think again being able to access the video on demand content which goes to the comment I made about VOD earlier. So we are seeing a nice lift in the ARPU.</p>
          <p>What we have seen is that we've run a little bit short of our goal in terms of the number of homes that we were going to connect this year. We've had some operational complexities we've been working our way through. We think we've kind of solved most of those, in some cases the consumer says they have Internet and maybe they only have a modem and not a router or they kind of go for the DIRECTV install but the Internet's not installed for two weeks later so there are a few kind of operational glitches that we're working our way through.</p>
          <p>But the connected home experience is a fantastic experience. It's going to get even better this fall with our new high definition user interface and I think as we add more VOD titles, it's just going to be more and more kind of pull from consumers I think for that experience. And as I said, the good news is we know it pays. It pays out because of the increased $2.50 in ARPU we get from it. We're just kind of working our way through some of the operational complexities of this plus I think we've got a wireless capability that we'll be launching this fall as well and I think we'll make it available to even more homes. So it absolutely continues to be a top strategic priority for us. And we're still very bullish on its potential for DIRECTV longer term.</p>

          <p>Thank you, our next question comes from James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning or afternoon, thanks for taking the question. Two, if I could. On the U.S, you've gotten more aggressive in the NFL Sunday Ticket promotion strategy. Can you talk about the trade-off between potentially cannibalizing existing customers &#x2013; excuse me, cannibalizing new customers versus potentially getting people who otherwise wouldn't pay for it upfront hooked on it? And secondly if you're looking at Latin America how much of the increase in gross ads you see in the first half of the year in Brazil do you attribute to just the fact that you have these new mass market products out there and how much do you think it's sustainable going forward, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, I'll take the U.S. one, Bruce, then you can kind of answer the question on the gross adds in Latin America. I think it's important on the NFL Sunday Ticket &#x2013; let me rewind a bit because I think we actually gave you a sense in December that we were going to think differently about NFL Sunday Ticket this year and we were doing that for a couple reasons. One, we had to have a promotion that if the strike was continuing, that we actually had an attractive enough promotion without NFL that would work in third quarter. So we had to design the promotion not knowing whether they were going to settle or not. That's point one.</p>
          <p>I think the second and more important strategic point was we had come to the conclusion that it was critically important for us given the long-term contract we have with the NFL at a higher cost and given that it's a fixed cost that we find a way to get more subscribers to sample or try NFL Sunday Ticket to try and get them to renew next year, so this would be in 2012, to build that franchise and that's really the reason that we went with this particular offer.</p>
          <p>I think we'll read it as it goes. We're quite pleased with its results so far through the month of July. But the real test will be when we do renewals next year. But it was kind of driven by a strategy of trying to change the economics of our NFL Sunday Ticket business and it's a bet on that and I still think it's going to be a good bet because the number of folks that come on we then have an opportunity to roll them to pay next year, 100% of our universe rather than the typical 20, 25% of our quarterly gross adds. So that's kind of the background on it. Bruce, do you want to talk on the second one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the question was sort of what percent of the total gross adds, the increase in gross adds came from middle market products, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, because actually we were down year-on-year with advanced products because of what I mentioned about in PanAmericana, obviously a very high percent of the growth came from the middle market products. I guess one way to think about it is if you looked at Brazil, as I mentioned, the middle market products were about 65% of the total gross adds and that was a very large increase compared to last year, about one and a half times. So I think they're a very important part of the overall story.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we still sell a lot of standard def packages in all the traditional and extended basic and those remain equally important as do advanced products. So certainly it's a very important part of the story now. I think it will remain an important part of the story for the foreseeable future, because certainly I would say the A and B classes are very largely penetrated in many countries so most of the growth is going to come from these middle market products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I'd add, though, Bruce, you guys have really got a very disciplined strategy to manage the mix and ensure that the profit mix ends up fine. And in fact, even to the point of having lower commissions, for instance, if you sell the middle market products. So actually, Bruce's team has really thought this through in a great amount of detail as to how to ensure that we get the right balance as we grow the business and that the margins are not impacted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in other words, it may affect ARPU but it won't affect profitability.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Thank you, our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks I have two questions. Mike, you mentioned that you spent some time on DIRECTV's long-term strategy. So does entering into content via a Hulu come into these conversations at all; that's the first question. Then secondly Charter mentioned on their call that they have some sort of relationship with DISH and that they are now offering a synthetic bundle. Are you having similar discussions with any of the cable operators?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Marcy, first on the long-term, look, I don't want to get into specific comments on an acquisition process but I think suffice it to say we have consistently said that we want to make sure that we can make DIRECTV anytime and anywhere our customers want it. You know the Hulu software has some nice aspects to it but you also have to kind of form a judgment about its business model and what you think that business model can generate. So we look at a lot of things here. And we'll see as we go through that process where we'll come out. But I think what we're looking for is, is there something there that would enable us to accelerate our TV Everywhere but obviously I'd say it's critically dependent on the distribution relationships that it has in the contracts that underpin that. So I think there's still more for us to learn and we really haven't made a final judgment on it.</p>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; I don't think it's kind of something we have to have frankly. I think it's an interesting idea and we are looking at it but, I mean, we are doing IP &#x2013; I mean our NFL Sunday Ticket To Go product is an IP protocol product. I mean, we know how to do the hybrid kind of if you think of it using the satellite and then using the Internet, kind of cloud Internet and then IP. So, I mean, we're -- our technical guys are quite comfortable with that world so I'm sure one way or the other we'll be able to do what we need to do for TV Everywhere but it's an interesting opportunity so we're taking a look at it.</p>
          <p>In terms of the comment on Charter, look, I've said consistently, I think, we're open to discussions with any cable company that wants to talk to us about bundles. Having said that, remember, I think we've got 97% of the U.S. covered with relationships with telcos that Dish does not have so perhaps they're looking at a different angle than we are in that regard. Our focus right now is to try and operationalize the two fiber bundles that we've got access to sell with both FIOS and U-Verse in the second half of this year and really make it a good customer experience. And we'll be kind of working more against that, I would say, in the second half of the year. But we're always open to &#x2013; to a good offer if anybody has an idea on a wholesale bundle, a wholesale broadband offering.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, question related to your key satellite peer in DISH. Charlie Ergen has had some pretty interesting maneuvers over the last six to nine months and beyond the big-picture comment of kind of not believing in the long-term future, having questions about the long-term future of linear programming between wireless and Sling and a host of things like Blockbuster, just curious kind of how you think about some of the competitive things he's doing vis-&#xE0;-vis your business, any that worry you or how you think there might be applications of what he's doing to how you're thinking about your business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey look Rich, I worry about all of our competitors and distant competitors, including Google, Apple, Amazon, you name it, everybody is kind of in the competitive spectrum and I don't think it would be productive for me to comment on it one way or the other. Charlie knows his strategies a lot better than I do.</p>
          <p>But suffice it to say we're comfortable with our strategies. And as I've said, I think you have to realize we have some things that they don't have and they have some things we don't have. Our strategies are designed for DIRECTV and I think we're quite comfortable with the direction that we're going.</p>
          <p>Now, we're always open to ideas, as I said, whether it's a wholesale bundle from a cable company that includes broadband or another way to get to a broadband service that has the price performance that's required to compete with DOCSIS. It's just up to this point our focus has been on number one the relationships we have with the telcos and trying to take that to another level with the fiber bundles that we've got access to but we're continuing to look for other ways to do bundles or other ways to provide a fixed broadband at the consumer but it has to have a price performance that I think will be competitive for us to pursue it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, let me ask the question another way then. How do you think &#x2013; do you think there's an opportunity for DIRECTV to provide an IP-based satellite service to consumers nationwide over the course of the next four to five years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, our TV Everywhere strategy I mean, Rich, by definition, is going to be &#x2013; I mean, we're strengthening our whole DIRECTV portal right now so you'll be able to access content there. We've signed up HBO Go, we've got NFL Sunday Ticket To Go, so by definition we're going to have some kind of a hybrid satellite, say, cloud or Internet-based kind of connection and that's really what the connected home strategy is all about as well. How far do you go, whether you kind of offer a kind of a flow TV idea, let's call it, but that's kind of through the Internet, what pricing, what content rights you get from the distributors, I think it's not about the technology, frankly, technology's not the challenge there. I'd say it's more about the content rights and how the owners of the programming decide to use those content rights.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at kind of our cost of programming all of us as distributors these days it's kind of hard to get to a meaningful group of channels for any price that's I would say less than even $30 at the rate we're going so I mean, it's kind of &#x2013; it's an interesting idea but it's &#x2013; I think it's a function of what kind of content rights you get more than technology. Technology's pretty easy; I mean, we're doing it already with NFL Sunday Ticket To Go.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. I know, Mike, you're trying not to get pinned down too much here. But I think at the Analyst Day you emphasized that U.S. sub growth should slow pretty dramatically this year and the first half has been flat year-over-year and now you're talking about churn back to improving a little bit in the second half. It seems like you're headed toward 500,000 or more net adds in the U.S. this year which isn't much of a slowdown. Am I thinking about that right? Given the visibility you have now would you take a little bit more aggressive stance than you took at the Analyst Day?</p>

          <p>Look, we had a tough quarter for churn and the good news is as Pat said we kind of saw it come back under control in June and July. Our gross adds are off to a terrific start. I'd rather not speculate other than I feel good about our expectations for both gross and net adds for the full year that we're going to be fine. The year isn't going to be a perfect kind of each quarter at the same ratable number, probably first quarter was a little stronger than we thought, second quarter a little softer. I'm optimistic third quarter's going to be a little stronger and we'll see about fourth quarter. But I don't see any trends in the business other than the macro economy, which is of concern. You do see, as I said, our involuntary churn, albeit it's a small part of the total churn calculation but it is credit problems, that's what it is. People can't pay their bill, when we contact them that is up a couple basis points. But &#x2013; so you do see some of the challenges that the consumer is facing.</p>
          <p>But other than that, I don't see anything competitively or otherwise. We &#x2013; as I look at our quarter, second quarter we had some challenges as Pat said in the telco geographies and then we had some challenges in rural areas where consumers were going to no TV. And I think that's the economy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And I wanted to squeeze one in for Bruce, you talked a little bit about drivers of Lat Am ARPU which was a positive surprise for us. I believe at the Analyst Day you indicated ARPU would be flattish for the next five years or so and again you about talked on this call as the middle market being the driver of a lot of sub growth. Is that still the trajectory for ARPU, flattish for next five years or is there potential for some ARPU improvements like we saw in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we would stick with our overall prediction. As I mentioned there, I've said before, the middle market expands and becomes a bigger part of the total base, it will create some downward pressure on ARPU. We expect that will be offset by our continued ability to upgrade existing customers as well as continuing to serve the A and B segments with more advanced products, more HD. So my sense is over the long haul that it will &#x2013; that's still the right way to look at it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And be careful of the forex, Doug. The Brazilian reais has been so strong, that's also running through the numbers but at some point that comes to a lapping probably in the fourth quarter this year that's a little different. So you have got to look at it ex-forex.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Pat I wanted to ask you about the SAC per add number and what you're thinking there as you move through the back end of this year into next. I know the connected box units are probably below where you thought but it seems like those numbers are coming in a little lighter. Maybe it's just because you're using more credits on the ARPU line so we sort of need to put those two together to analyze it appropriately. But how are you thinking about SAC per add and the typical sort of box savings on an apples-to-apples basis DIRECTV particularly realizes as they move through a production cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ben, I mean, I think we &#x2013; I mean, I see SAC kind of staying in the kind of range that we saw in the second quarter. Obviously, like you said there's countervailing things as we try to connect more people to broadband. There's some pressure there. But we continue to try to work down not only the box costs but the outdoor unit which gets to be a pretty expensive unit when you're dealing with HD and the SWM. So it ought to stay plus or minus in the same range you saw in the second quarter as we've got upward pressure on more technology in the home and then as we try to get obviously more efficient in &#x2013; and more productive on boxes and dishes and other things like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And maybe just one follow-up for Mike. You mentioned a number of product initiatives later this year, the guide and also your connected box strategy. The TV Everywhere product, the Nomad product and tablet products, can you update us there on your plans and when you think that's going to become fully deployed and what it looks like when it is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the Nomad product which is the ability to port your content from your DVR onto your iPad, I expect you'll see that in some geographies before the end of the year. We're probably going to do it in fewer geographies to make sure that it's working flawlessly before we'd roll it out fully. So rollout might be in 2012 but you'll see that before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>The high definition user interface comes in, in the fourth quarter. Also, I would expect to be streaming pay per view and premium channels on myDIRECTV.com probably in the fourth quarter I think we're expecting. We're going to launch the home media center which will have kind of high-end DVR for new subs in the fourth quarter as well. So we've got a lot of things that I feel pretty good about that will roll into the fourth quarter albeit I think you'll see more of the benefits of that probably in 2012 than in 2011 in terms of the acceleration and momentum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do any of these include sort of a robust on-demand and maybe even live linear streaming product to a tablet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the live linear stuff is all driven by content rights and those are a dog's breakfast, candidly. Every programmer has got a different point of view. So that's not been our focus. Our focus has been things we think we can monetize like VOD, pay per view, premium channels like HBO Go, NFL Sunday Ticket To Go &#x2013; that and then porting your DVR content is kind of our focus.</p>
          <p>Now, we're also working on the ability to stream to your iPad in the home and you may see something on that by the end of the year. But the actual kind of live streaming of content is still kind of a work in process but as I said it's really not the technology. My Chief Technology Officer showed me -- he streamed the NFL Super Bowl at the Super Bowl on his iPhone from our broadcast head end here in Marina del Rey so it's not a technology challenge, it's a rights issue.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. That will come from Tuna Amobi with Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess it's good to hear that the &#x2013; on the connected box that you saw an uplift in ARPU as a result but I wasn't sure if that was the same effect as far as churn is concerned. I'm trying to basically isolate the economics of that set of customers to figure out if you're getting the kind of overall upside that you expected. I know it's still early but any clarification there would be helpful. And separately, it's a philosophical question, Mike. So on the NFL Ticket, right, so there seems to be some concern, and I know that contract has still got another three, four years to run, but as you think about this contract being a loss leader, right, there's questions about whether, as the market becomes more competitive for these kinds of sports rights, when the contract is up for renewal there's almost an expectation that the costs are going to go up astronomically and I know you're trying to monetize that in various ways, the IP offering, whatnot. So the question is do you still feel that that having that contract as a loss leader over the long-term is the right way to go? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, Tuna. First on the connected box, you're right, it is a little premature to read churn because usually the churn problem even in the Q2 when we went and kind of dissected it, it was in certain geographies and it was plus or minus three months either before or after the end of their two-year contract that folks were going shopping and I think that's again, a function of the economy and the competitiveness that's out there. So it's a bit premature. I certainly believe it will have a positive impact on churn. We certainly know from history that advanced products in general we do see a lower churn rate on our advanced products than we do on basic or standard def customers. So if kind of history's any guide, I'm pretty confident &#x2013; and I also think that the quality of the experience and I think that's where we've got probably still some more work to do to fill in some more VOD content and really with the HD user interface really make that experience pop for the consumer. I think we're bringing Pandora into it, we're doing a bunch of things to make it just an absolutely knock your socks off experience for the customer. And as I said, we're already getting more than we had planned in ARPU lift out of those customers. So I feel great about the connected box strategy. I think we're just working through some of the operational things.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. And then on the NFL Sunday Ticket, look, it's -- it's way premature and I might say that the last contract the cost went up astronomically, I suppose. But we think NFL Sunday Ticket is a terrific product. We have an excellent partnership with the NFL. We're delighted to see football is back. Our customers are very interested in the product right now. We're trying to make sure we can grow that franchise to support it. But it's a very important part of our brand. But how would we look at it three years down the road? I think it all depends.</p>
          <p>Sports costs are clearly a problem for the entire industry. And not just football, all sports costs. And as an industry, we're all going to have to work hard on it because the consumers, I just don't think the consumer being willing to pay for every one of these new RSNs or six RSNs for one league or whatever &#x2013; one college league that wants six different channels, I mean, there are just some things that as a practical matter we're going to have to be pretty disciplined in what we do and what we don't do.</p>
