          <p>Thank you, Diane. Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of 2009. Today, we are joined by Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman, President and CEO, and David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and CFO.</p>
          <p>David will provide a few comments about the results that we released this morning. He will highlight some of EMC's activities this quarter and discuss some modeling assumptions for 2009. Joe will then spend some time discussing his view of what is happening in the market, EMC's execution of the strategy and how EMC is positioned. After the prepared remarks we will then open up the lines to take your questions.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation unless otherwise indicated. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure today in our press release, supplemental schedules and the slides that accompany our presentation. All of these are available for download within the Investor Relations section of emc.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial tables in our news release and on our corporate website. And with regard to details of VMware's results, we refer you to their financial release from last night.</p>
          <p>The call this morning will contain forward-looking statements and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. And lastly, I will note that an archive of today's presentation will be available following the call.</p>
          <p>With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce David Goulden. David?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tony. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to announce that EMC achieved solid Q2 results. Our focused execution this quarter resulted in EMC achieving revenues of $3.26 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 and free cash flow of $400 million.</p>
          <p>The sequential revenue growth, improving profitability and strong cash flow is encouraging given the continued economic environments. Within these results our EMC Information Infrastructure business achieved $2.8 billion in revenue, a little over $0.14 of non-GAAP EPS.</p>
          <p>And as you saw last night VMware also had a solid quarter coming in at the high end of their expected range. VMware's results contributed $455 million of revenue and 3.3 cents of non-GAAP EPS to EMC. This morning I'm going to make some comments about the Q2 spending environment, our business outlook for the second half of the year and some specific details from our Q2 results.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the financial results for EMC's information infrastructure business, we believe that overall IT spending levels in Q2 were relatively flat with Q1, however, Q2 spending seemed more stable and a little more predictable during the quarter. We attribute the stabilization to customers having more confidence in their IT budgets than they had at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>While the economic environment remains very tough and customers continue to scrutinize their spending very carefully, this stabilization is a positive sign. Within this IT spending environment, I am pleased that we achieved sequentially better revenue profitability in Q2.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we experienced more normal linearity compared with Q1 and the business delivered sequential revenue growth across all of our major geographies and in all of our business units. The area of our business that most exceeded our expectations was our Information Storage business within North America where revenues were up 5% sequentially. Part of this increase was due to the more stable budget environments and part was due to storage capacity upgrades that customers deferred in Q1.</p>
          <p>We also firmly believe the strength of our product portfolio was an advantage. While pressure on global IT spending is expected to continue, our results from the first half of the year give us more confidence that we have the right business model and the right product portfolio to do well under challenging conditions.</p>
          <p>So with that as a backdrop, I'll make some comments about our business outlook for remainder of the year. Our view that overall IT spending in 2009 will be down very high single to very low double-digits has not changed. Based on the more stable spending environment we saw in Q2, our first half performance and what we're seeing and hearing in the marketplace, we now have better visibility and more confidence in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>We are now planning for EMC to achieve revenues of approximately $13.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.82 for the year. These expectations include the acquisition of Data Domain. In the near term, we believe the seasonality of our revenues from Q2 to Q3 will be more normal i.e. up 2 to 3%, with the remainder of the business coming in Q4. However, EMC's reported revenues will probably be up 4 to 5% quarter-over-quarter due to the inclusion of Data Domain in Q3.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a closer look at some of the financial highlights from the quarter. EMC Information Infrastructure revenues were $2.8 billion up 5% sequentially, and down approximately 13% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, revenues were down about 9% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.14. Free cash flow was $213 million.</p>
          <p>Excluding a series of inter-company tax payments between EMC and VMware, EMC Information Infrastructure free cash flow was $298 million, which was higher than non-GAAP net income and about the same as Q2, 2008. In the quarter, Information Infrastructure product revenues were $1.8 billion and Information Infrastructure service revenues were $1 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking at the results for the business units within Information Infrastructure, Q2 storage &#x2013; Q2 information storage revenues were 2.5 billion, up 5% sequentially. At the high-end, Symmetrix revenues were down 3% sequentially reflecting the continued pressure on large ticket items within the enterprise.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to announce the introduction of our new Symmetrix V-Max system is going very well. And reception from customers has been phenomenal. Customers are putting the V-Max directly into production environments and these systems are achieving 6-9s of availability. To help you understand what 6-9s availability means, this equates to an average of approximately 30 seconds of unavailability per system per year, truly unprecedented performance. We are very confident the Symmetrix V-Max is a highly differentiated information storage platform that's going to strengthen and extend our leadership in the high-end of the storage market.</p>
          <p>In the mid-tier, EMC CLARiiON revenues bounced back nicely and were up 12% sequentially. North America and Asia-Pacific had strong performance here.</p>
          <p>One of the fastest growing opportunities in our storage business is flash technology. And we continue to see a high level of demand for this capability across our platforms. Year-to-date, we've shipped over one petabyte of solid state drives, and we expect to see even more utilization of flash on our systems going forward, particularly when our Fully Automated Storage Tiering [FAST] software comes out for Symmetrix V-Max later this year.</p>
          <p>EMC Celerra NAS business continues to do very well, and we achieved our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in Q2. The reliability and scalability of these unified storage systems are very important competitive differentiators within both commercial and large customers and we continue to gain market share. Importantly, we're encouraged to see more customers planning to add EMC as a new dual source in their previously NetApp only environments.</p>
          <p>EMC's backup and recovery software solutions had good double-digit sequential growth and I'm very pleased that EMC's Avamar de-duplication solutions grew at over 40% year-on- year. Next generation backup and recovery is a major focus of EMC and we are delighted to welcome Data Domain to our information storage business. Including Data Domain, EMC is clearly the leading provider of de-duplication technology with multiple ways for customers to utilize de-duplication to manage data growth and reduce costs.</p>
          <p>Although not included in EMC's results reported today, Data Domain achieved Q2 revenues of almost $86 million, up 8% sequentially, and up 40% year-on-year. Dell represented about 10% of EMC's total revenues, in Q2. Within this, Dell was approximately 29% of CLARiiON revenues, representing a higher percentage than in Q1.</p>
          <p>While the near-term economy is challenging, we have confidence that over the long-term we will gain share as EMC continues to have the best and also the broadest and the most integrated storage product portfolio. EMC's storage platforms span across the consumer, mid-tier and high-end markets and we continue to lead the market with cost-effective, energy-efficient solutions with the latest feature functionality.</p>
          <p>Information storage is a core strength of EMC's business and our growth and profitability has been strong over the last few years. Our gross margins in this business have consistently been around 50% over the last two years. In Q2, our storage margins bounced back a little, and were up 17 basis points sequentially to 48.5%. This is a nice improvement and looking ahead, we expect storage margins to be back around 51% for the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Information storage is a great business, and we are committed to investing in R&amp;D programs that will extend EMC's technology lead to deliver the best portfolio of information storage, products and solutions, specifically designed and optimized for virtual data centers and cloud computing environments.</p>
          <p>Our RSA security revenues in Q2 were up 3% sequentially, and up 2% year-over-year. The demand for RSA's Identity Protection and Verification products continues to be strong as customers look for ways to prevent fraud and reduce potential liabilities. We believe that our RSA IPV Suite is becoming the de facto choice for online and credit card banking authentication.</p>
          <p>Within RSA Security Information and Event Management offerings, the RSA enVision 4.0 platform had another quarter of strong double-digit growth. In June, we announced a partnership to embed data classification technology and policies from the RSA Data Loss Prevention Suite and sell it as part of Cisco's IronPort email security solutions. And just yesterday, we announced RSA Software Tokens for iPhones, providing a very convenient cost effective way to use two-factor authentication. Even in a tough environment, information security remains a top priority with customers.</p>
          <p>Revenues from our Content Management and Archiving division in Q2 were up 3% sequentially, and down 12% year-over-year. Managing unstructured data and compliance is a key challenge for companies of all sizes, we continue to focus on providing customers with content management solutions that deliver more immediate ROI. Toward this end, we're encouraged that our SourceOne information government solution for next generation email archiving saw good demand in Q2 and was a key offering in several large solution deals this quarter.</p>
          <p>In Q2, EMC's global service organization performed well and grew well and grew 6% sequentially. We are confident that EMC's services capabilities will continue to help customers meet their near term cost containment requirements while supporting their longer term objectives for re-architecting their data centers for the future. We believe our services organization will continue to be an important competitive differentiator in helping customers virtualize their data centers and plan for cloud computing environments.</p>
          <p>Turning to some highlight from the income statement, Q2 non-GAAP gross margins were 50.4%, up 80 basis points sequentially, mostly due to higher volumes. We also had nice improvements in our Q2 non-GAAP operating margin, which was up 220 basis points from Q1, to 13.5%. We have done very well executing our cost reduction plans, and you can see the benefits in our results. We've also maintained very disciplined expense control and had some extra benefit from currency and some one-time improvements. Netting it out this puts us ahead of our planned cost reductions for 2009 and we factored this into our outlook.</p>
          <p>For 2010, we still expect cost savings of $500 million, including the reversal of some of the cost savings such as the 2009 wage reduction. At this time we are also utilizing our financial strength to improve our operating structure and invest in future high growth market opportunities. We spent $20 million so far this year transitioning to a more cost effective operating structure and we've already executed a number of initiatives under this program.</p>
          <p>For example, we are making good progress on our planned global real estate consolidation. Over the next two years, we will increase the utilization of our company-owned space and improve the efficiencies of our manufacturing facilities, data centers and R&amp;D labs. As part of our restructuring announcement in January, we're incurring planned additional restructuring charges in 2009 and 2010 for ongoing cost containment initiatives. To date in 2009, we booked about 50 million in charges. And in terms of new market opportunities, we've invested about $40 million in our cloud infrastructure business this year. By effectively reducing costs, improving operating efficiencies, and continuing to invest in new market opportunities, we are reinforcing the resiliency of our business model for the long term. We believe the net effect of these operational improvements will position us well for the next really big opportunities in IT. Joe will expand on these in his remarks.</p>
          <p>Now turning to a few highlights from our consolidated results. Total Q2 consolidated revenues were approximately $3.26 billion, up 3.4% sequentially and down 11.3% for the year. On a constant currency basis revenues were down about 8% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.18, and free cash flow was $400 million, over $40 million better than Q2 non-GAAP net income. So far this year we generated almost $1.1 billion in free cash flow, this is $400 million more than first half non-GAAP net income and almost the same free cash flow as in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was approximately 20%. Q2 consolidated operating cash flow was $574 million. A few balance sheet items that impacted Q2 operating cash flow include deferred revenues, which were $3.3 billion, inventory turns which was 7.8, and DSO's which were 52 days, all very good, given the current economic climate.</p>
          <p>We ended Q2 with a record $10 billion in cash and investments, with 3.7 billion held overseas and 2.3 billion at VMware. This quarter we spent approximately $260 million on acquisitions and strategic investments. Financial flexibility is a critical strength and competitive advantage for EMC, particularly in this unpredictable economy. Our financial strength allows us to continue to invest in our business even during challenging economic cycles.</p>
          <p>In closing, we are clearly pleased with our Q2 results. The breadth and depth of our technology portfolio allows us to assist customers in achieving strong ROI for their current IT projects while helping them to effectively and efficiently move towards re-architecting their data centers for the future.</p>
          <p>Although the spending environment will remain tough, we are encouraged the environment has shown signs of stabilization. Our strategy and portfolio positions us exceptionally well in the market and we are pleased that we now have sufficient visibility to forecast our financial results for this year.</p>
          <p>Our execution this year has been very good and we are making a lot of headway on cost efficiencies on important investments for the future. We remain focused on meeting our near-term objectives while positioning ourselves competitively for longer term success.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn the call over to Joe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. I would like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's conference call. As always, we thank you for your interest in EMC. Overall, given the tough economic and tight capital spending environment in which we operate in, I am pleased with our Q2 results.</p>
          <p>EMC and VMware teams around the globe met and exceeded both their top and bottom line goals which our Boards of Directors set for us this quarter, and I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank each and every member of our team for their hard work and dedication.</p>
          <p>I would like to give you our view on IT spending, what we experienced in Q2, and what we expect to experience going forward for the second half of 2009. In Q2, we saw IT budgets firm up quite a bit, albeit at lower levels than in 2008.</p>
          <p>Customer approval processes and the timing of their spending appeared to be more normal. In fact, the calendarization of our order flows in Q2 was fairly close to what we experienced a year ago in Q2 of 2008. Simply put, our business felt more predictable and customers seemed to be more comfortable with their spending processes.</p>
          <p>We are also seeing a definite trend with our customers where they are significantly cutting back on the number of suppliers they want to deal with. They want their supplier relationships going forward to be more strategic, deeper, broader. In short, more partner-like, ensuring them a greater value proposition. We believe this trend will benefit EMC.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to the rest of 2009, we continue to believe that Q3 will show slight improvement over Q2 and that Q4 will be the strongest of the four quarters. These beliefs were included in the outlook that David just provided you for 2009. Additionally, we continue to believe that our results will benefit from our strong product cycle, and a really robust product portfolio.</p>
          <p>For 2009 in total, we still believe that overall IT spending is likely to decline year-over-year in the high single digits to very low double digit range, and we fully believe and expect EMC to gain market share this year.</p>
          <p>What gives us confidence in the second half of 2009 and well beyond is the fact that consolidated EMC is a major player in four of the hottest and fastest growing market opportunities in IT. Namely, next generation fully virtualized data centers, cloud computing, virtualized desktops and virtualized clients and the next generation of backup, recovery and archive solutions. Each of these high growth markets represents a multibillion dollar market opportunity for EMC, and they all require x86 virtualization software to help customers and service providers manage large pools of compute, network and storage, automatically applying the proper policies and service levels to govern workloads, in essence, a data center operating system.</p>
          <p>These four growth opportunities require storage that massively scales, has multi-site active backup capability, has built-in business continuity, is policy driven, and provides customers with the ability to automatically tier, de-dup and compress their information.</p>
          <p>These four growth markets require security aspects like identity protection and verification, data loss prevention, and assurance that governance risk and compliance metrics are being adhered to. And these four growth markets require an ecosystem of partners that can cooperate and execute seamlessly.</p>
          <p>In other words, to capitalize on these vast market opportunities requires innovative technology, go-to-market, the service capabilities and the partnerships that consolidated EMC has in place.</p>
          <p>I'm quite sure that as I talked about these market opportunities and delineated the aspects of technology that are necessary for success, it is now clearer to you just how strategic our recent acquisition of Data Domain is across all four of these markets. You heard from David, how Data Domain grew a remarkable 40% year-on-year despite a tough economic and IT spending environment. And you heard how we planned to continue this type of growth and exceed $1 billion in revenue next year in 2010, with just the Data Domain and Avamar product lines.</p>
          <p>I would once again like to publicly welcome Frank Slootman, and all the people of Data Domain across the globe into the EMC family. Congratulations on a stellar Q2. And thank you for all you do to delight our customers. Additionally and in conclusion to my formal remarks I would like to assure that we are balancing the need for today by reducing costs, while focusing on and investing in high growth market opportunities for tomorrow.</p>
          <p>We believe we have the vision and strategy in place for us to win and prosper, and as the IT markets resume a more normalized growth, our focus on the four robust growth opportunities I mentioned, coupled with excellence in execution, will allow us to obtain double-digit growth rates.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&amp;A portion of today's call.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a question on Data Domain if I could, please. I know you mentioned Avamar and Data Domain would add about incremental billion dollars. I was wondering if you could parse that out a little bit? And it has been some time since you had your conference call, if you could just tell us how you're thinking about, or revisit how you're thinking about the accretion potentials related to Data Domain, as you look out into calendar year '10. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, David gave you Data Domain's growth rate and revenue for Q2. We didn't give you Avamar. We did tell you that Avamar. I will tell you Avamar is slightly smaller than Data Domain and had a growth rate a little bit higher, in the mid-40s. So we got, you know, the duplication which Avamar excels at which is at the source where information is created and, of course, at the target is where Data Domain excels. And we feel that this market together, we will continue to grow at over 40% next year, and those two products alone, it's not an incremental billion, this market will grow to over a billion next year on those two products, Keith.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Joe. And in the past you've talked about accretion potential. Is there any color that you can give on the incremental opportunities with just Data Domain on how you're thinking about the accretion potentials?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Keith, this is Dave. Let me jump in and just kind of recap what we've said. So we gave you some information in the news release about 2009. We said that there is no impact on a non-GAAP basis.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little less than $0.02 on a GAAP basis this year. 2010, still be accretive to us on a non-GAAP basis, but we're not going to qualify that yet. We will give you more information on that as we get closer to year end.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks a lot. My question is on Symmetrix. I believe you said the product was down 3% sequentially but correct me if I'm wrong. What is the pent-up demand in that upgrade cycle heading into the back half? Is that part of the reason you have a better tone and a visibility? And just what do you kind of envision for the velocity of this product? Can a cycle last well into 2010? And what are customers telling you? Because it clearly seems like it hasn't gotten going yet. And just talking about the velocity of that product, please, you know, going out as far as you would like, would be helpful.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start and I will ask David to add some color. This is Joe. First of all, the V-Max, we're very pleased with. We set a plan for V-Max, and we slightly beat it and it's being well-received by customers. This is the biggest change we've had in Symmetrix since its inception, so obviously the customers are being careful. We're going to add one of the, I think, killer applications that customers have been asking for which is what we call FAST technology, which is Fully Automated Storage Tiering and that comes in the end of the year, and of course as that kicks in, we do expect that this cycle will carry us also into 2010 very robustly. You want to add to that, David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Joe, that's very good. Ben, are you right. Symmetrix is down 3% sequentially. Obviously, as Joe said, this is a huge transition, you know, some customers or many customers are going straight into production and others are still going through their test labs and the typical transition is three or four quarters to go through the transition to fully transition across then, and of course, you have still got the bow wave of it being a brand new technology.

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Yes, I think as we said before, at the system level there is not a lot of difference between Sym and CLARiiON per se, but of course, typically Symmetrix have more things wrapped around it in terms of more management software and more services. So the total margin, the solution margin tends to be a little richer on the Symmetrix sales.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for taking the question. It looks like total product gross margins were down about 100 basis points sequentially. Yet you mentioned storage gross margins were up 17 basis points sequentially. So my question is, what products were under a little bit of pressure to move that overall gross margin number down? And could you comment on the overall pricing environment as a factor to those gross margins? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, let me start here. Joe can maybe comment on the pricing environments. But I think we said that, overall EMC Information Infrastructure margins were up 80 basis points sequentially. If you kind of look at that product versus services, product margins were actually relatively flat quarter-on-quarter, so I'm not quite sure what you're getting your down from, we can maybe handle that offline later. But basically a couple of factors in that, we did get volume growth. We did get volume benefit in margins. Mainly on the services side, this quarter sequentially.</p>
          <p>Product margins, we actually did get some help from volume sequentially, but then that was kind of offset by some of the product transition costs associated with kind of running both the DMX-4 and the V-Max lines in parallel. So to answer your question, things were pretty stable from a product margin point of view.</p>
          <p>Pricing environment continues to be tough out there. But as you kind of look at kind of how our margins have basically fared, let's say you take last Q4 as a baseline, basically all of the change can be tied back to volume. Said differently, obviously there has been pricing pressure from customers. We've been able to offset that through efficiencies in our cost base and manufacturing benefits in the product line.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. And congrats on a great quarter. I guess my question, I want to dive back into the Data Domain assumptions that you're making. If we just take the expectations that are out there for Data Domain right now from Street estimates, it seems to be, given that you're recognizing maybe two months of revenue from that, you're implying a decent amount of relative upside to the Street expectations looking into Q4 for Data Domain.</p>
          <p>So I'd like to understand what you're seeing from a revenue synergy perspective already in the Q4 timeframe? And then if you could also help us understand how you look to position Data Domain, i.e., driving synergies out of the expense structure of Data Domain going forward. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. This is Joe. Let's just kind of break the mystery here. Baked into our second half plan, we have about $200 million of Data Domain revenue, okay? Across Q3 and Q4, okay? The Data Domain story is not about &#x2013; obviously, there are some cost synergies we can get, but that's not what this is about, and that's not really where we're going.</p>
          <p>We intend to increase investment in R&amp;D and obviously the big win here is to leverage EMC, go to market force through 85 countries, and thousands and thousands and thousands of people, and really kind of pop this product line and make sure that we actually increase their investment in R&amp;D. So that's going to be the winning story here. And then we do believe that by working in better harmony, what we call Avamar, source-based de-duplication with target-based de-duplication, we can really create a tremendous win. So this is all about revenue synergies, not cost synergies, not to say that there's not a few cost synergies.</p>

          <p>Thanks, guys. I say another gross margin question. I mean, when we look at the Information Infrastructure gross margins, why shouldn't that get better in 2H from 51%? In Q1 you had noted that the headwinds were from volume, to a smaller extent from pricing, but as you go through product refreshes and volumes improve as your revenue guidance would imply and you get benefits from cost savings that is flowing into COGS and you noted some product transition costs that you incurred in this quarter, why should we not expect the second half gross margins to trend significantly higher?</p>

I was talking from &#x2013; for our information storage gross margins; obviously, an important subset of Information Infrastructure. So just to clarify, our storage margins were 48.5% in Q2. They're up 70 basis points from Q1. And that margin rate is the number I was talking about going back up to 51%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, great. Thanks, guys. Actually I have a question on the information storage gross margins as well. If you look at it, the forecast &#x2013; well, you did about 64% incremental gross margins, in the June quarter. It looks like that's going to spike up quite a bit in September and then increase by my calculations in the 60% range in December. I was wondering if you could comment on, if we do expect calendar year 2010 to return to some sort of level of normalcy out there, would you expect that incremental gross margin on the information storage side of the business to kind of remain constant next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, let me take that. I think we said and recap what I said about the margin changes from the end of 2008, into this first off 2009, obviously we do have some fixed costs running through there and a lot of those fixed costs related to our warranty expenses in the business as well as some of the manufacturing overhead, so you do have a fixed versus variable equation and that's why we've kind of given you a hint as to what's going to happen with some variable increase in volume in the second half and you see that margin bounce back again. So I think I've given you the pieces of equation, and as we talk about 2010, we will be able to update you on what impact we might think volume could have at that point in time.</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I appreciate the commentary around the market and your belief that it's stabilized. I suppose if I would have looked at your results and your guidance, it actually wouldn't appear clear to me that things had stabilized. Your year-over-year growth rate at constant currency in Q1 was minus 5.7. It was minus 8 in Q2. And yes you had a tougher compare but that was only one point tougher.</p>
          <p>So the year-over-year growth rate actually hinted at incremental deceleration. And your sequential growth guidance of 2 to 3% is a bit lower than history. And you're going to get a 1 or 2 point currency benefit. So it's more like 0 to 1 or 0 to 2, which is below normal seasonality.</p>
          <p>So could you comment on the ostensible discrepancies between the deceleration in Q1 and Q2 and your perception of stabilization, and then your commentary around sequential guidance versus history, and how that's also consistent with things firming? Perhaps you can talk about your visibility, your pipeline, your backlog, or what else is contributing to your view, because the numbers in and of themselves don't jump out at me as being high conviction stabilization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First of all, Toni, maybe it's the way we presented it, for a while, we've been saying, and I still think we're going to be right, I said that Q2 is going to be the bottom, and then, I don't expect any kind of V-shape recovery. So as you know, and as you rightly point out, we grew 5% in Q4, we declined 8% in Q1, and we declined 11% in Q2, right, year-on-year, so you're right about your trend.</p>
          <p>But what we're kind of focusing on is the predictability. The forecast we had last quarter were tough and the business came in late. And just the visibility looking out the windshield was incredibly foggy. This quarter, our forecasts held up well, the calendarization, which is our term we use internally, it's not actually a real word, but what we use internally is how flow of orders every day of the quarter and then we compare that to the same time last year, the same time year before that, the same time last quarter &#x2013; last month, last quarter and we have all of these kind of metrics that we use and from all those perspectives it was a lot more predictable.</p>
          <p>When you talk to customers, customers are saying, hey, we &#x2013; I do have a budget now. Yes, it's less than last year by x% or whatever the case might be but I can now have a more normal approval process. So that's kind of what we're saying, Toni, and maybe we said it wrong the first time, but that kind of color, I think.</p>
          <p>Then of course, if you look at Q3, in our predictions, the year-on-year decline would reverse, right? It would now get a little bit better. So that's what we're saying in macro. And we had enough predictability that we actually could give you a forecast for the second half of the year, we did in terms of the year but since you have the first half, we gave you a second half forecast in essence, right? So I think those are the things that we're trying to point out today, Toni. Does that address that part of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just on the &#x2013; I hear you on the year-over-year growth getting better but your compare also gets a lot easier, so sequential is more valid, and with the currency tailwind, you should get &#x2013; the sequential growth feels a little bit less than normal seasonality, is that just some &#x2013; a little bit of conservatism in there, or is there anything else you can comment on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Toni, this is David. Let me jump in and try and add a little bit of flavor there. So as Joe said, we're talking about stabilization but from a much lower level of spending, and still in a very tight budget environment than we've seen, obviously in the last couple of years. So, yes, there should be potentially a little bit of tailwind from currency sequentially, but remember my comments about what happened in Q2, and where we really had the most upside to our internal expectations, was in the storage business in North America, where some of that was stabilization effect, and some of that was some kind of Q1 orders that just didn't get done in Q1 and came into Q2, so you have to understand the baseline is impacted a little bit by that.</p>
          <p>So taking all things into account, we are still looking for a sequentially stronger Q3 than Q2, and obviously with Q4 being our strongest quarter, I think there are pretty positive signs given the economic backdrop.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, you are right. We had &#x2013; we saw some nice increase in services margins, a couple of impacts there, one of course we had some volume effects, particularly on our customer services business, where the fixed costs are relatively &#x2013; where the costs are relatively fixed and obviously volume has a nice benefit. Also a number of the cost transformation programs that we've been driving have also gone through the services line, so you have the benefit of both of those.</p>
          <p>I've given you a very strong hint on kind of where the biggest piece of product margin is going to go for the second half of the year. I've kind of given you the full-year outlook, so you can kind of triangulate around that, but obviously we are expecting to see margins to continue to improve a little bit as we go through the second half, and that's factored into our overall guidance for the year.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. I kind of wanted to follow-up on an earlier question about this guidance. I guess, one comment notably missing this time around from David's prepared comments is, the thoughts about second half being a much stronger and that revenue will be more back-end loaded this year than perhaps it's been historically.</p>
          <p>And if you look at your guidance, you're suggesting about 53%, excluding Data Domain, to be generated in the second half. That's pretty much right in line with historical trends of 53 to 54%, so I'm just curious if you have an update as to why that wouldn't be more back-end loaded, especially if the budgets are getting stabilized? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bill, I think a couple factors here. One, when we were predicting Q2 to be roughly flat with Q1, then by definition, the second half was going to be that much stronger. We did see much better sequential growth in Q2 than we expected certainly back in April when we made the comments we made about what was happening to the market at that point in time.</p>
          <p>And then, I gave you some of the flavor and kind of what some of the drivers were around that Q2 growth, so what the year is now looking to be is to be a little bit more normal from a sequential point of view, clearly with the second half still being stronger than the first half, but the progressions throughout the quarters is being a little bit more normal.</p>
          <p>Obviously one of the things that's a big driver in the second half of a normal year is a fair degree of budget flush in Q4. And while we obviously predict a little bit of that, and we're predicting some pretty good sequential growth from Q3 to Q4, the budget flush is not going to be at normal levels. So that all adds into what we are telling you about the $13.8 billion or 13.6, without Data Domain for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And remember, too, if you looked at Q3, of '08, and that quarter was a pretty good quarter for us, actually. We grew 13% over Q3 of '07. So this is not yet one of those kind of really down compares. Where we fell off a little bit was in Q4 where we only grew &#x2013; of last year, we only grew 5%. So, this &#x2013; so I think when you look at all of that, I think that bodes well for our forecast.</p>

          <p>Yes, thank you. Good morning. David, I was wondering if you could talk a little more about the software revenue stream in the quarter as it relates to license and maintenance? Any insights if you could on the growth profile too, particularly with respect to renewals, trying to get a sense if you're seeing a greater level or focus of add-on software by some of your customers who aren't really wanting to deploy new systems yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark. Sure. I mean, as you know we're now looking at the business on a product versus services basis and we're giving you the kind of gross margin color for proxy to see what is going on. It wasn't really a whole lot of mix shift, in fact there was no mix shift during the quarter within product. Certainly for the storage business, hardware and software performed pretty similarly and you can see for content and security, the product is software. So you can see what's going on there.</p>
          <p>Maintenance renewal's doing very well and you saw good sequential growth in the customer services business and software maintenance was a big piece of that. So we certainly see customers wanting to get full value from the maintenance contracts from the upgrades that come with that and we view that as a very strong indicator.</p>

I wanted to ask about pent-up demand across both Symmetrix and CLARiiON, and assuming conditions continue to improve, is there any data that you guys have that suggests that utilization rates are perhaps reaching critical levels or that a normal portion of the installed base is up or past lease renewal points or any other data that would help us gauge the potential pace of a hardware recovery not just in the second half but also into 2010?</p>

          <p>Bill, what I can tell you, empirically for sure, that customers are driving utilization rates up and they are at, in our belief, an all time high. Whether that's critical, whether it's a critical level, and they have to buy, I mean -- certainly we are -- certainly there is only so far you can drive storage and you've got to do the next buy. So whether it's critical or not, I don't know. But it is certainly at an all time high in terms of utilization rates, that I can tell you.</p>

          <p>Yeah, quick question for Joe here. Industry consolidation, obviously last quarter, we saw a lot of it. Curious to know if you think it's going to continue, and is there any holes in EMC's product lines that need to be filled in the near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do think it's going to continue, Troy, as an industry trend for sure. As far as holes are concerned, there is nothing glaring but there are always &#x2013; we're always on the look for opportunities, and there are a couple of little areas that we would like to expand, and obviously, my policy has always been not to comment on those because I kind of work against myself when I do that, work against the company when I do that. So there is nothing major that we have to have, it would all be only in the case that it really could drive a lot of shareholder value.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. I was wondering if you could give us an idea of what percentage of your cost cuts have been completed so far, and when you expect to wrap those up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, David. We've told you that we do plan to exceed our original $450 million reductions for 2009, and that's factored into our guidance. To give you flavor, we've basically have done 2/3 of the head count reductions now &#x2013; 3/4 of the head count reductions are now complete. But some of the other programs like real estate, like some of the other infrastructure costs reductions, will basically come out during the second half of the year, and go into 2010. And so we are actually a little ahead of our original target, for the year, we'll beat the original target for 2009 and we're still confident about the 500 million for 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for sneaking me in here. So Joe, what kind of activity levels are you seeing between the enterprise and commercial groups in North America? And sort of how do you see that projecting through the rest of the year? And then underneath that, sort of, is the competitive landscape shifting at all and any comments around IBM and XIV would be helpful? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The competitive landscape isn't really changing all that much. Right now, we see a little more kind of action, I would say, in the commercial marketplace, than we do in the enterprise. The activity levels are quite high in both, but the actual buying patterns of the commercial is a little ahead right now. And basically, as far as the landscape is concerned, I don't really see any change. And that would include IBM and XIV. We have always had competition with IBM and it continues at about the same level.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, in closing, I would just like to remind you that we really do believe that our business model is serving us quite well and is working, as is evidenced that we're weathering this pretty tough economic storm fairly well. We have a strong product portfolio and cycle going for us right now. We are focused on what we think is going to be four very large, very high growth markets in IT, which will help power our future and gives us confidence. We continue to focus, as David has told you, on our cost structure. And I think the most important thing, which is a little bit of an intangible, that you could be inside of EMC and feel that the people of EMC are excited and VMware are excited about the future and pumped.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to, as always, thank you for being with us. It's great chatting with you. And we look forward to seeing you soon.</p>
