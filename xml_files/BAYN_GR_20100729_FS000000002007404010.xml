          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by.  Welcome to Bayer's Investor and Analyst Conference Call on the Second Quarter 2010 Results. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alexander Rosar, Head of Investor Relations of Bayer AG. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jason [38.0]. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you also on behalf of my colleagues to our conference call, during which we will review our second quarter figures with you. With me on the call are Werner Wenning, Marijn Dekkers, and Werner Baumann, from the Group Management Board. Marijn Dekkers today will also represent the HealthCare subgroup. It's usually reported by Kemal Malik, the Chief Medical Officer of our Pharma business. CropScience today will be represented by Friedrich Berschauer and MaterialScience by Patrick Thomas.</p>
          <p>As always, Mr. Wenning will start off our conference call with a brief summary of the developments in the quarter. We assume you have all received and reviewed our stockholders' newsletter, the briefing documents and the slides, so we will just run you through the main points. Before handing over to Mr. Wenning, I'd like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Mr. Wenning.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's also my pleasure to welcome you to our conference call. Let's start off with the overview. In the second quarter we further grew our sales and profits. This growth was mainly driven by our healthcare business, by our MaterialScience business. Healthcare expanded slightly. CropScience, after adjusting for currency movement, reported declining sales. Good working capital management resulted in a double-digit increase in net cash flow.</p>
          <p>We are increasing this years R&amp;D budget by 200 million to &#x20AC;3.1 billion. The significantly higher investment in R&amp;D underscores the confidence we have in our innovation pipeline. Based on the development so far and our expectations for the remainder of the year, the group financial outlook remains intact. We continue to target adjusted sales growth of more than 5% and underlying EBITDA of more than &#x20AC;7 billion.</p>
          <p>Let us now briefly look at the key data for the second quarter. In my comments, I will focus on the portfolio and currency-adjusted sales figures. Group sales advanced 9% in the quarter. This growth was mainly driven by higher volumes. Higher volumes added 8%, and higher selling prices 1% to the top line expansion. Underlying EBITDA at &#x20AC;1.9 billion also gained 9% due to the positive business trends, primarily at MaterialScience and Consumer Health, as well as to positive currency effect.</p>
          <p>Currency effect improved the underlying EBITDA by 160 million. Positive currency effects were, however, more than compensated by 80 million higher R&amp;D expenses, 50 million of idle costs at CropScience and 150 million impact from higher raw material and energy prices at MaterialScience. Core earnings per share at &#x20AC;1.15 were up 10% against the prior year quarter. Our measures to further optimize working capital management were successful. We are thus able to report a 10% in net cash flow.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, a closer look at the performance shows that the business expansion was broad-based. The majority of our portfolio performed quite well in the quarter. MaterialScience appears to have emerged from the crisis. Volumes of key products are again above pre-crisis levels. Subgroup achieved a record &#x20AC;2.7 billion in sales in the second quarter of 2010. Consumer Health demonstrated business strength in the quarter. We made significant gains at environmental science and at ag-BioScience. We expanded our pharmaceuticals business outside the United States.</p>
          <p>Declining sales, on the other side, were reported form the U.S. pharma business. Furthermore, our Crop Protection business failed to meet expectations of a significant catch-up growth in the second quarter. Business declined particularly in North America.</p>
          <p>From a regional perspective, the strongest growth was achieved in the emerging economies. Business in Western Europe gained 8%, while business in United States was down by 2%. The emerging countries, on this slide basically defined as world minus North America, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, accounted for more than a third of Group sales.</p>
          <p>In these markets, we expanded our sales by 18%, the strongest growth achieved in the American-Asian economies. Driven by higher sales in all business groups, sales in these countries increased by an impressive 33%. I believe these figures clearly demonstrate that we are well positioned in the emerging markets and that our significant investments in there are really paying off.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look more closely at the trend of our individual businesses, starting with HealthCare. Driven by the consumer health segment, sales of HealthCare grew by 2%. Business in the pharmaceutical segment narrowly remained level year-on-year, due to considerably lower sales in the United States.</p>
          <p>The weakness the U.S. business resulted mainly from lower sales of Yasmin/YAZ, Mirena and Betaferon. Outside United States, pharmaceutical business trended positively, with sales growth of almost 6%. Business with Yasmin/YAZ receded by 44% in the United States, due to the debate surrounding the risk of thrombosis and the market entry of a generic version of YAZ. Outside the United States, however, sales of that product group rose by 6%, yielding a decline of 15% overall.</p>
          <p>Sales of Betaferon fell by 11%. In view of the strong prior-year quarter, however, this decline was within our expectations. The decrease in sales of Mirena resulted from pre-buying ahead of a considerable selling price increase in the first quarter. By contrast, we have a gratifying improvement on Nexavar, Kogenate, and Avelox. Nexavar gained 20%, driven by the liver cancer indication. Kogenate, at plus 25%, benefited from higher shipments to our distribution partner. Avelox was up 21% on increased stocking by Japanese dealers and sales gains in China.</p>
          <p>The Consumer Health business trended positively, with sales up by 4%. Consumer Care registered a 6% increase in sales. Business with our most important products expanded significantly. Aspirin grew by 6%, Aleve by 14% and the One-A-Day line of vitamin products by 15%. This was attributable primarily to the recovery in consumption in the United States.</p>
          <p>Medical Care suffered from a weak U.S. market for blood glucose meters. Sales in that division moved back by 4%. By contrast, Animal Health saw its business expand by 10% thanks to sales growth in all regions. In North America, we benefited from initial stocking of a new distribution channel for our Advantage product line in U.S.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITDA of Healthcare almost matched last year's level. Earnings were negatively impacted by a variety of factors, including the launch of a generic YAZ in the United States and lower sales of Betaferon, higher R&amp;D as well as marketing and sales expenses, and the portfolio effects from selling the hematological oncology activities to Genzyme.</p>
          <p>These negative factors were nearly offset by positive effects resulting from business expansion in Consumer Health and favorable currency exchange rates. Following the unexpected market entry of a generic competitor YAZ in the United States, we have to adjust our 2010 Healthcare outlook. We now expect sales in the Pharmaceutical segment to remain level year-on-year on a currency and portfolio-adjusted basis. In Consumer Health however, we still expect to expand faster than the market. We thus anticipate only a slight increase in adjusted sales at Healthcare and believe that underlying EBITDA of Healthcare will at least reach the prior-year level.</p>
          <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, following the delayed start to the planting season in North America and many parts of Europe due to the cold and pro-longed winter, we anticipated that the second quarter would generate strong catch-up sales. These expectations were not met. On the contrary, unfavorable weather conditions persisted the second quarter, particularly in North America and Europe, and have contributed to poor demand for Crop Protection products. Additionally, unusually high inventory levels in the distribution channels and strong competition resulted in price and margin pressure in key markets. As a result, our Crop Protection sales declined by almost 9%.</p>
          <p>We saw the steepest decline in sales in North America, at 30%. Intensified competition resulted in price erosion and thus in lower sales of our herbicides and fungicides. Generic competition and lower insect infestation pressure led to a market decline in sales of our insecticide business. In Canada cultivation acreages for canola and wheat declined as a result of heavy precipitation.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we succeeded in limiting the decline in sales to 3%, despite unfavorable weather conditions in the key growing regions. Sales in Asia-Pacific grew by 7%. Gratifying business trends in Australia and China played a particularly important role here. Sales in Latin America were a little short versus the prior year. The decline of 2% was attributable to a somewhat weaker seed-treatment business in Brazil.</p>
          <p>By contrast, there was a gratifying expansion of business with products for professional users in non-agricultural applications. Sales of the Environmental Science business unit rose by 9%.  We also saw a substantial 11% increase in sales in the BioScience business unit. Underlying EBITDA of CropScience fell by 20%, due to a considerable decline in profitability in the Crop Protection segment.</p>
          <p>Lower selling prices and a drop in volumes diminished earnings significantly. Second quarter earnings were also diminished by a lack of fixed cost absorption as we continued to underproduce while selling down inventories. This was reflected in a 66% higher net cash flow.</p>
          <p>Earnings in the Environmental Science BioScience segment improved, due to the expansion of business. However, the figure contained one-time income of &#x20AC;19 million in connection with a License Agreement signed in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Against the background of unfavorable weather and market conditions in the first half of the year, we are lowering our sales and earnings forecast for 2010 in Crop Science. Provided market conditions return to normal in the second half of the year, we anticipate that sales in 2010 overall will be slightly lower than the prior-year level on the currency and portfolio-adjusted basis. We expect underlying EBITDA to decline significantly. Without doubt, the problems of our CropScience business during the first half is disappointing. Corrective actions, including further efficiency improvements, are now underway.</p>
          <p>The improvement of the business performance of our MaterialScience subgroup continued in the second quarter. Sales came in at nearly &#x20AC;2.7 billion, which was not only a 41% improvement year on year, but also the highest quarterly sales figure ever achieved at MaterialScience. The expansion of business was due above all to a considerable increase in demand in our key customer industries.</p>
          <p> We expect Avelox to significantly raise volumes in all product groups and regions. We registered the largest absolute volume gains in Europe and North America, which were hardest hit in to previous year by the economic downswing. There was also an increase in selling prices, particularly in Asia and Europe. MaterialScience significantly expanded sales compared to the first quarter of 2010, too, posting an increase of almost 16%. Hereto, all product groups contributed with substantial volume expansion and a slight increase in selling prices overall.</p>
          <p>The improved business situation was also reflected in earnings. EBITDA before special items at MaterialScience rose markedly in the second quarter of 2010 to &#x20AC;371 million. We are also optimistic about the second half of the year as regards our BMS business. We anticipate a continuing positive business trend in the subgroup.</p>
          <p>From today's viewpoint, we now consider as conservative our previous target of increasing sales by more than 20% and more than doubling underlying EBITDA. We expect to exceed these targets. In the third quarter, we anticipate that sales and underlying EBITDA will be in line with those of previous quarter.</p>
          <p>We are also pleased to report a substantial improvement in net cash flow in the second quarter. The significant reduction in cash tied up in working capital resulted in 10% increase in net cash flow and 15% growth in the free operating cash flow. Net debt at the end of the quarter was &#x20AC;10.7 billion, up 1 billion compared with the end of the first quarter. This result must be viewed against a high season of payouts in the second quarter for dividends, interest and bonuses and negative currency effects. In total, currency changes increased net debt by more than &#x20AC;600 million.</p>
          <p>So ladies and gentlemen, we remain confident for 2010 and anticipate that the slower pace of growth at Healthcare and CropScience will be offset by the dynamic business expansion at MaterialScience. Exchange rates have so far trended more favorably as well.</p>
          <p>We continue to target currency and portfolio-adjusted sales growth of more than 5% and to increase EBITDA before special items to more than &#x20AC;7 billion. Core earnings per share are expected to improve by more than 15%. Our estimates are based on the exchange rates at the end of second quarter.</p>
          <p>Before opening the Q&amp;A session, please allow me to summarize the key points. The majority of our businesses performed well in the quarter. Group sales and underlying EBITDA were both up 9%. Good working capital management resulted in a 10% increase in net cash flow. Our confidence in the innovation pipeline remains strong. This is reflected in significantly higher R&amp;D spending. We are looking forward to sharing new data on Xarelto with you during the next weeks and months. And as just mentioned, we confirm our group full year 2010 financial outlook.</p>
          <p>That concludes my remarks, we will now be happy to answer your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Miss. Walton.  Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jo Walton from Credit Suisse. A few questions, please, firstly on the R&amp;D increase, what's happened since the beginning of the year to think that you can make a good return on increased R&amp;D? And is the majority of that extra spending in the pharmaceutical division and have we already started to see it? And is that one of the elements to the margin squeeze in the division? Looking at the blood glucose monitors, you talk about a weak market, but having seen the Roche results, their blood glucose monitors, it looks as if it's not a weak market, but a loss of market share. What can you do to address that? And can you also tell us a little bit about the impact of foreign exchange on profit for the group as whole? If you had a 5.6% benefit from exchange to sales, can you help us on what that was at the profit level? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so I would like to give a first comment on our additional R&amp;D expenditure. Approximately 90% of the additional 200 million are directed to Pharma and Kemal Malik will develop a little bit more in detail, and around 10% to Crop BioScience. Kemal, would you please continue to &#x2013; with more details?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It's Kemal. I think the increased spends on our late-stage pipeline is really a confirmation of our confidence in the strength of that late-stage pipeline. As I've often said, we feel that we have got one of the strongest late-stage pipelines of any company of our size in the industry. And a demonstration of our commitment to that pipeline is the increased spend. We want to maximize the value of those late-stage assets, such as the, the VEGF Trap and so on and so forth our increased spend is a reflection of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and about our market share in glucose meters and the marketing gains of our competition in glucose meters, Marijn would you please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello. Just a quick comment on that situation. As you know, the market environment for diabetes monitoring in the United States is challenging at the moment, both from a price and a demand point of view. We had a particularly challenging quarter after the somewhat better first quarter. I would not go so far as to say &#x2013; as to conclude market share gains or losses based on this quarter, because the complexity and the timing of the product flow in that market is such that I would not, at this point, come to that conclusion. But we're definitely monitoring it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the impact of currency, Werner Baumann?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  This is Werner Baumann speaking. You mentioned the top line was a little bit more than 5% roughly, $0.5 billion in sales from translation perspective. And on clean EBITDA, the effect was roughly 160 million. That is about 8% of quarterly earnings.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Jain. Please go ahead. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Thanks for taking my questions, just a couple on the Pharma margin to start off with. I think you had the lowest pharma margin this quarter for roughly two years, flagging an increase in SG&amp;A and R&amp;D. I just wanted a bit more color as to how we should think about this from here. Are there any particular factors this quarter you'd focus on YAZ, or is this rebasing to a new level? And related, just wondering if you could update comments from the first quarter call, where I think you alluded to Pharma margins being broadly flat for the year. Is that still the case? And if it is, what is the FX uplift that's helping you maintain that? Secondly, just on crop, if you could just comment on your components for volume and pricing for the full year outlook. And then finally, a quick question for Kemal on ROCKET-AF, if he's willing to comment. Based on the event rates you're seeing within that study, are you still on track for year-end filing or is there any risk of slippage into next year, like seems to be being suggested by some in the medical community? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let's start the section with the Pharma-related question. Marijn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In terms of the margins in Pharma, clearly under pressure at the moment in this particular quarter, I think there are a few contributing factors here. First of all, there's a product mix issue at the moment. You're aware of the YAZ generic introduction in the United States, so that is a negative mix effect. I would also say that from a geographic mix, with more and more sales coming from Asia, where the margins tend to be somewhat lower, that that challenge is to margins as well. And particularly, sequentially Q1 to Q2, that is a contributor.</p>
          <p>Healthcare reform doesn't help margins of course either, came also more to a head in the second quarter than in the first quarter. And then, as Mr. Wenning commented on the increased investments in the second quarter in R&amp;D and commercial capability to support the late-stage pipeline, we think is a terrific investment, but of course, from a margin point of view in the quarter, negative. So these factors came together, all came to a head in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we think that now in the mid- to long-term, we will definitely be able to deliver on the committed margins, because there is enough good news in the pipeline &#x2013; and not just in the longer-term pipeline but also in the shorter-term pipeline &#x2013; in women's health, for instance, where we have plans with YAZ Plus and Natazia to regain market share, that I am confident that we can get back to the margins that we have committed to earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just clarify what margins have you committed to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in healthcare we basically said as guidance margins from 28 to 30%, clean EBITDA margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that was over what timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to say that with precision quarter by quarter, but I would say over the next 2011, 2012 timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then in the Crop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In CropScience, we recorded in Q2, a volume decline of 2.8% and a price decline of 2.7%. In the first half, volume was down by 6.6% and prices down by 1.3%. For the second half, we are expecting an increase in volumes. We are expecting a price decline also in the second half. The dimension is not of course clear. It depends on commodity prices. It depends on the weather situation, of course, specifically here in Latin America, but I believe that the price pressure in crop protection will continue in the second half. That's the best what I can say from today's perspective.</p>

          <p>Hi, Sachin. Let me tell you a little bit about Xarelto. I'm pleased to confirm that our Xarelto program remains totally on track. We've previously announced that we're presenting the results of the Einstein-DVT treatment study at the European Society of Cardiology meeting at the end of August. The results of the Rocket study in stroke prevention of atrial fibrillation are expected in the second half of this year and we can confirm our intention to file the submissions in stroke prevention of atrial fibrillation and DVT treatment by year-end.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. De Watteville. Pease state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, it's Jean De Watteville from Nomura speaking. A couple of questions on crop protection, please. First of all on prices, the price decline you have on this quarter &#x2013; that you have published for CropScience for this quarter is much lower than what your competitors are disclose us.  Agenta, excluding lifazed , they disclosed more than 8% price pressure. BASF this morning 4%, so can you &#x2013; probably one element is because you had that cheap, perhaps, price increases in Environment Science, BioScience. But can you please give the price decline in crop protection alone, without Environmental Science, BioScience? Maybe that could help us to understand the margin pressure that you experienced in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Second point also still about to understand the dynamics of profitability in second quarter, can you develop on the mix effects? We note that the seed treatments are very much down. Fungicide is slightly down. I understand these businesses are above average margins. Can you elaborate on that?</p>
          <p>Third question, still on crop protection is for the second half outlook. Should we, given the lower prices in crop protection, expect a similar range of margin pressure than you have experienced in the first half? Or you expect some elements to offset price pressure in your margin, basically to be closer to what you achieved in second half of last year?</p>
          <p>And if I can, a fourth question in MaterialScience, most of your competitors on the last days, and particularly today in plastics and in polymers, have mentioned evidence that volumes in Q2 were driven by very strong restocking in downstream demand. I haven't picked that up in your comments. Can you just elaborate on whether you believe that the current strength of volumes in MaterialScience is driven by restocking, particularly in the outdoor sector? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and let's start with crop protection, Herr Berschauer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming back to your question in terms of pricing, I need to make a somewhat important comment. You talked about Environmental Science, which is an agro-chemical business. And if you have look on our major competitors which also have a ES business, they report these numbers under agro-chemicals, or crop protection. So basically, you need to include the ES effect on agro-chemicals. It's important note, but still in ES, in professional as well as in consumers, we had no significant price increase prices. With prices, we have less than in BioScience, we had a small size increase but not for Medical. So the main impact is really coming from crop protection.</p>
          <p>Your second question in terms portfolio and the profitability of the portfolio, in the first half this year, we had a significant negative impact on our portfolio. We will have been affected significantly in our herbicides in Europe. And this portfolio has a significantly higher margin compared to our overall portfolio. In the second half &#x2013; and that was your question &#x2013; we do not expect major changes in the portfolio compared to 2009, the second half. That is answered now all your questions?</p>
          <p>Oh, pricing, pricing for the second half of the year, so we recorded a price decline in the first half of 1.3%, basically zero in the first quarter, then a stronger price in the second quarter. I believe that in the third and fourth quarter, this price level, as indicated before, will continue to some degree. So I'm expecting in second quarter some higher price decline compared to &#x2013; in the second half compared to the first half. But we expect, as indicated, volume increase. Why? Because it's obvious, very obvious that there is a significant reduction in terms of inventories on the distribution level. So there are a bit &#x2013; much better options now for the second half in terms of our sales to distribution.</p>
          <p>And also on the positive side, what we have seen in the past weeks that commodity price, some of important commodity prices increased. If we look on the development of wheat prices, there was a significant increase in the past weeks of 50 or even more percent. And this very weak wheat price was one of the major reasons why we had our rather poor performance in the first half of this year. So let's wait and see how commodity prices will perform or develop. I am hard optimistics that we will see a positive trend. Why? Because &#x2013; and this is also of the reason for our weak business &#x2013; we had this extremely hot May and June, which was important for the development of cereals. And there are now a lot reports around that the wheat production in Europe &#x2013; in for example, also in Russia and Ukraine &#x2013; will be significantly down. So logically, this should result in increased wheat prices and we have seen the effect already in the past weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Patrick, on MaterialScience, a little of the outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the restocking point, it's &#x2013; I think that's a really good question. I think what we're seeing is, particularly in the Automotive industry, a very strong demand from fleet car sales. So for example in the U.S., growth in fleet car is around about 25%, whereas private is probably up about 6%. And that reflects last year's reduction in orders caused by people delaying and extending leases. Now the good news about fleet cars is clearly, they drive the more luxury end of the market, particularly in Europe, and you see much higher levels in polyurethane and polycarbonate in the high end of the market compared to the Cash-for-Clunkers growth, which was very much at the smaller vehicle end.</p>
          <p>So I think that's a positive effect. As I talk car companies in Europe and the States, inventory levels for them are still low and typically we are currently discussing order entry and difficulties of meeting demand in October for this year. So I don't just see this as a quarter-to-short term effect. I think we will see demand sustained throughout quarter three and a slight drop in quarter four as we see the Christmas effect kick in.</p>
          <p>The other area which is of course a big driver for our business is the information technology computing arena, where we still see sustained demand, particularly with new electronic devices, for example tablet and small notebook devices. And that really is sustained and of course most of those products are pretty much made to order and there's very, very little stocking. So for our type of portfolio, I think the restocking effect is not as pronounced as for some of the products.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. It's Fabian Wenner from UBS. Two questions quickly, first one, could you elaborate a little bit about the changing landscape of the MF market and the fundamentals over the next few years, and specifically have the strategy with regard to your pricing of Betaferon with regard to that more intense competition from Nexavar, but also from new orals? That'd be very interesting. Thank you very much. And the second question, can you just confirm that you have not made any provisions for the losses regarding U.S. YAZ and Yasmin? And can you remind us whether there's any major multi-district litigation hearing scheduled yet? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Let's start, Marijn, with the MS markets there. You have a question on Betaferon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Betaferon, we have communicated in the past, I believe, that we are expecting some erosion in our Betaferon sales in 2010 as a result of new products being introduced by competitors. That erosion is indeed happening. It was 11% in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect it to be in the high single-digits, according to our originally communicated plans. I'm not really prepared to talk about competitive pricing scenarios at the movement, quite honestly. So I'm going to take rain check on that. But I would say this, though, that of course, you understand in MS, the new products are unproven in terms of their long-term effect and I think this is why the franchise like Betaferon has a high level of sustainability, as the patients are happy and reacting well to a product like that. There is a certain risk in changing medication and I think it's serving as well in maintaining the Betaferon franchise.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's Mike Leuchten at Barclays Capital. Three questions, please, one, just want to go back to healthcare margin. If I read your full year guidance correctly for healthcare, that does actually imply a nice recovery in pharmaceuticals for the second half. I just wondered whether that's really down to phasing of the R&amp;D and marketing and sales investment as you've just mentioned earlier, or whether you're actually looking at efficiency programs that are going to kick in already on the back of the YAZ generic launch.</p>
          <p>Second question please on CropScience, just the implications of the pricing environment. I think some people had been looking at this industry now as one where there was pricing pressure. Is that gone now? Are we back to a state where the industry can protect its margin, but it's going to be difficult to expand it as you're constantly try to work against the pricing pressure? And then a third question for Kemal, on VEGF trap in DME, are there any plans of going into the DME indication with a higher dose than what's being used in AMD or is it flat in terms of dosing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's start with your question about healthcare margin, Marijn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yah, Pharma amount was the question, I think and the conviction on your part seems that it's going to be going up for the second half of the year. I think it will depend on the development in some of our key products, the ones that had some issues in the second quarter and also on how much really do we need to continue to spend on R&amp;D and commercial resources at this level for the remainder of the year? And that's hard to say going all the way into the fourth quarter, because final spending also depends of course on the results of the various Phase III trials that we are getting. So I don't &#x2013; I would not conclude from this call, but we expect for the remainder of the year, significant pick-up in Pharma margins, but certainly for next year, that would be a reasonable expectation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me a make a general comment on prices. As you already know, we always tend to avoid competing on prices, because we are innovation leader in crop protection and so we offer really good solutions, excellent solutions to our customers. That's the first comment. And if you have a look on the reported price declines, three companies reported pricing, you can see and realize that we really have not been the most aggressive one, to put in simple words.</p>
          <p>We also need to reflect the wheat load differentiation. In the first half, we were able to keep pricing in Europe stable. We were able to increase prices in Asia Pacific slightly in crop protection. In U.S. there was a strong pressure on pricing, maybe driven by de-stocking as discussed. And in Latin America so far we feel rather comfortable, but there might be and I just, of course, don't know it, but there might be increased pressure on prices in the second half of the year. So again we need to see it differently and based on different situations in regions and we will continue to fight to get the return on our innovation.</p>

          <p>Yeah, hi Mike. It's Kemal. As you may know, we presented the 24-week data from our Phase II study in Diabetic Macular Edema at the Angiogenesis Meeting in Miami earlier this year. Pleased to say in that study that we showed that all four dosing groups showed a statistical significantly improved increase in visual acuity compared to patients receiving laser therapy. We're going to get the one-year results later this year on that study and at that stage, we'll decide which dose we're going to take forward in to Phase III. So just bear with us until that time and then we'll let you know.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. First a question on CropScience, it seems that your products could be underperforming competitors'. The market, beyond weather and acreage, doesn't seem to explain the volume that you've seen, especially in North America in the second quarter. Could you comment on how you can turn that around and how &#x2013; whether you think you are losing market share to competitors?</p>
          <p>Second question, on the animal health business, beyond the filling of the new distribution center, that seems to growing substantially and I was just wondering whether you're seeing any effects that you can exploit the industry consolidation, as I suppose your competitors take their eye off the ball? And wondering going forward, whether there are any signs that that is a competitive environment and animal health is getting more intense again? Secondly on animal health, just wanted to check whether you're still looking to access external opportunities to complement this business and your search for those and how the search for those is going? And then finally, just a follow-up on Sachin's question on Einstein and Rocket, just wondering whether I could confirm that you expect to release headline results for both those data points <mark type="inaudible" /> ahead of the data presentation at medical meetings, we obviously know one at &#x2013; in august for Einstein. Thanks very much for taking my questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CropScience, I really would disagree that our product would underperform. It's really not the case. It's correct that our invoices to the distribution in U.S. was down, as announced today. We have independent data in terms of application of our products on the farm level, not to the distribution. And this data demonstrate so far that we did not lose market share. So this makes me rather optimistical in terms of our opportunities we will have in the second half in United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And animal health, Marijn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just a few general comments on animal health to address your questions, first of all, animal health had a terrific quarter as you can see. Part of that is the year-over-year improvement as a result of the strengthening economy. Obviously pet owners are spending more money on their pets than they did in the same quarter last year. Then in addition to that, as you mentioned, we have introduced an additional incremental marketing channel, which handles specialty pet stores in the United Stores, and that is leading to some one-time stocking upside. That is going to continue forever, but maybe still spill over a little bit in the third quarter, but then it will be done. So we cannot continue to count on a contribution like that.</p>
          <p>With respect to external opportunities, we like our health, our animal health business and if there are external opportunities, we'll certainly take a look at them. It's too early to comment at this point, on whether are not there are opportunities for us to gain market share while other competitors would be distracted with integration. I don't think we would even be able to monitor it that closely, given the significant increase in sales year over year as a result of the economy, plus then our additional channel. So there's too many moving parts to really with precision, figure out how competitively we're gaining share right now.</p>

I've actually only got one question left concerning YAZ and this is not on the generic, but sort of on the issues you're having in the U.S. with claims that  YAZ, suddenly the active compound is increasing thrombosis. I'm just wondering &#x2013; because it keeps on coming up in the press in Europe as well &#x2013; are you not seeing any, well, pressure on YAZ in Europe? Or are we to expect any going forward?</p>

So basically, being able more or less keeping prices in the first quarter, then a price decline in the second quarter. But I would expect that there will be at least the same price pressure in North America, in Latin America in the second half. I don't believe that there will be lot of price pressure in Europe as well as in Asia-Pacific, so depending regions to region. It's -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Of course there is a effect on, as you know, there is an effect on herbicides in general, based to the very low glycosite prices and we had to adapt our glucosonate prices as well. So this is stable. I do not expect any further change.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, Florent Cespedes from Exane BNP Paribas. A few quick questions on healthcare, first of all, on Xarelto on Magellan, the pre-clinical trial to medically  ill patient, is it possible to have the, at least a line results by the end of this year? Could you also provide an update on the recruitment of the EINSTEIN-PE trial? And a last one on research beyond Xarelto, what are the meaningful communication that we should monitor in the coming month?</p>
          <p>Another one, on margin, we understand that 2010 healthcare margins will be under pressure due to Pharma. Do you confirm that the consumer margin will continue to improve? And regarding the Pharma margin, will you put in place some specific measure to preserve the margins? For example, what you're going to do in the U.S. on the marketing expenses on the contraceptive pill, for example. Will you decrease the budget or will you keep the same budget as you need to support a launch of new drugs? Could you elaborate on that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start with Xarelto and Kemal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> . Your first question was related to Magellan. No we won't see the results this year. We expect the results next year. Your second question was related to the recruitment in the Einstein-PE study. This is slightly behind in terms of the Einstein-DVT treatment and this will complete recruitment next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Margins, Herr Baumann?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The consumer margin, you asked do we expect a continuation of margin improvements in consumers. As you know, we had 110 basis points of margin improvement and clean EBITDA percent of 22.4 in consumer and we expect, with continued top line growth above market which is what we are expecting, we expect that we will get the corresponding margin expansion as a result of that as top line growth and margin expansion in consumer are very well balanced. So we expect to bring top line growth there. We're very good to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>With respect to the resources in the U.S. on YAZ, we're not sitting on our laurels and we are leveraging our resources in women's health very aggressively in a few areas. I think one, the first one, is the introduction of another birth control pill, which is Natazia, which was introduced a few months ago. And the sales force is promoting and selling the product and introducing it aggressively, so that's one. Secondly as you know, we're expecting to get approval from the FDA this year, before the end of the year, for our product goal to YAZ Plus, which is a folate combined with YAZ, and we are obviously counting on our sales force to introduce that product as soon as we are ready after the official approval. So those resources remain very actively in place and are very important to rebuild our women's health capability in the U.S.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if I understand correctly, you do not cut the marketing efforts behind contraceptive pills in the U.S.?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I said we felt very strongly <mark type="inaudible" /> pipeline. I think the one that I perhaps would point out is the VEGF trap, where we'll be getting the one-year results from the wet AMD studies, the two pivotal studies, at the second half of this year. And I think this will be an important data set, because this will then lead, hopefully, to a submission in the first half of the following year. But that would be something I would look out for.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentleman, Rim Bennani from Exane as well. I have four questions, fairly quick. First coming back on the pricing in Q2 versus peers, I was wondering if the right way to look at it is the fact that you raised prices by only 4% last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, on which business you are now speaking?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In which unit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Crop Protection, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I was just coming back to pricing in Q2 and looking at prices &#x2013; increases you implemented last year and last quarter you came out with 4% only, while peers were up 7%. So on your coming &#x2013; I assume with 3 to 4% decline in the quarter, so you raised price rises that were implemented in 2009 like the rest of the industry. Or is there anything else that differentiates your pricing strategy in Q2? Second question is you mentioned lower utilization rate in Crop Protection has affected margins in the quarter. And I was wondering where &#x2013; if utilization rates in H2 would be lower. To follow up on that, you commented on inventories as down versus start of the year. I was wondering if you had a clearer view now on  &#x2013; are inventories back to normal, below normal? And if you have any help on provision that would be great. And the last and final question is just &#x2013; is there a still a product standing in the U.S.? Are you &#x2013; or do competitors ship product from the U.S. to Latin America usually? Or it's something that you do not do? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your asking a &#x2013; your questions on the pricing, it's a very difficult one. If you compare pricing, our price increases last year versus modest price declines this year and so on, it's much more complicated, because obviously we have a very close look on the portfolio and I made a comment on herbicides where we have significantly higher margins. So it's &#x2013; I think it's very difficult to give you here a single and honest and correct and unimpeachable sentiment .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do you consider that with the price decline that you have in Q2, you have erased the price rises in last year across the portfolio, or not necessarily?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course. We increased prices last year and now we have the price declines this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you are back to before 2009 level in terms of pricing, if you were to take an index for the portfolio or not necessary?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be more or less a kind of a compensation, but again it's very difficult. We would need elaborate on product-by-product and region-by-region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well of course. And then you're also asking the activity of our competitors and of course we worked hard to increase prices, or keep the prices, based on our innovation potential of our portfolio, but of course we need to watch carefully what our competitors are doing. We watch it and if we need to react, we will do it accordingly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your second question was in terms of idle costs or utilization of our capacities, we had a significant negative impact in the first part and more and , as Mr. Wenning pointed out in the second quarter. We are creating no significant further idle costs for the second half of the year. Why? Because we believe that this agrochemical market will come back next year and we need to prepare of course our production for the year 2011. That's the best answer I can give you in this respect.</p>
          <p>Your other question was inventories at the distribution level. We have another &#x2013; in the year another good big term after the second quarter, in Europe as well as in North America. In Europe, the inventories at distribution levels are normal or even below normal, but at least normal. And in U.S., they are clearly behind the level of last year. This is very obvious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But not necessarily normalized in the U.S. or -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the U.S., they are now on a very low level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Significantly lower compared to last year. This is very, very clear. And the last question you had shipping products from one region to other regions and so on. We are not shipping products from one region to the other. We have our production network. We are producing, for example, fungicides in United States and these fungicides are shipped, of course, because they are produced in that space to Latin America and other regions of the world. So it just depends on our worldwide global production network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just on the inventory question, in Latin America how these inventories ahead of the start of the high season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I talked again today to my regional head and country head of Brazil. The answer is that the inventories at the distribution level are more or less normal. That's the best what we can say from today's perspective.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank. Thanks for taking my questions. Three I have, regarding different divisions and also regarding the financial side, starting off with healthcare and there the Pharma side. I was wondering whether you could provide an update regarding the approval and launch status of Qlaira, how do we stand there? Then one question regarding the MaterialScience division, your prices have increased quite nicely in Q2. With regards to the full year guidance for 2010, how do you see a prices &#x2013; or how have you factored in prices development going forward and if it's possible, if you can split that out also according to the different regions? And regarding the financial side, I saw that, is Mr. Werner, you already elaborated on the financial debt, that &#x2013; this increase. I was wondering how do you see the net financial debt situation towards the end of the year. Do we have to expect a further decrease and further decrease? And I also saw that your net pension liabilities have increased quite substantially, not only quarter on quarter, but year to date. And what was the reason for that, and is that a sustainable level now for the remainder of the year? That would be helpful. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Let's start with Qlaira and the status of Qlaira.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. Qlaira's been launched in Europe and it was launched in May 2009. In United States, it goes under a different name. It goes under the name Natazia and it was launched during the summer, so it's already been launched there as well. And Marijn referred to that when he was talking about the deployment of our women's health force in the United States.</p>

          <p>MaterialScience prices going forward, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Daniel. I mean the price situation, you're correct in quarter two has been a positive one and has pretty much covered all in all of the raw material increases and some more. Looking forward, it depends very strongly on which product line we're talking about in the supply and demand balance. I would say that at the moment in MDI, we're talking about relatively high utilization rates, much higher in TDI and in polycarbonate. And pricing will follow accordingly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the net debt and pension, Werner Baumann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on net debt, first of all, when you &#x2013; we are actually very pleased with the net debt development, even though it might not be all that different from quarter one into quarter two. As Mr. Wenning already elaborated on, we have improved our operational performance, mainly driven by very good working capital management and this has generated a free cash flow of roughly 0.5 billion, of course contributed to the dividend payments. And then we had roughly a 600 million impact quarter-over-quarter on negative FX translation.</p>
          <p>If you look at this for the first half-year, that negative FX effect came out to just about 1 billion. So you can really say that besides dividend payments and a few other payments we provisionally have in the second quarter, our net debt, or operation net debt position as of end of last year, has not yet deteriorated. To the contrary, we are on track for an operation improvement towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>So looking at what we expect for the remainder of the year, first of all we, continue to execute against the improvement target on our working capital program. So we will bring down our operational working capital in line with business activity. It goes on two sides. On one side, of course, where we have business expansion, primarily and mostly in BMS, we have a higher working capital block out before the long with the business expansion, but other than that, including healthcare and CropScience, we only expect minor increases if any for the remainder for the year.</p>
          <p>So on the operational side, we expect an improvement of our net debt position. That always goes before any changes in &#x2013; across portfolio or further exchange variances and these are the things that you can't very much comment on that in detail, because of the high volatility we see on the FX market.</p>
          <p>When it comes to pensions, our pension position and the <mark type="inaudible" /> is very much a function of the changed interest rates. We have seen a significant change of the interest rate primarily in the U.S., a 70-basis points reduction from quarter one to quarter two. We have had 20 basis points in reduction from quarter one to quarter two in the UK and in Europe and in Germany. Those three are the main countries of our pension liabilities we have on the balance sheet and these have been driving this increase in our net pension position in the balance sheet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Thanks. It's Ron K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst. The first question is actually on guidance. Obviously, you slightly downward adjusted your guidance in healthcare. You were &#x2013; significantly downward adjusted your guidance in crop science, but you didn't touch your group guidance. You clearly had some questions before I believe, but just can you a little bit elaborate on the group guidance, which I usually understand as a commitment? And I believe now, put it that way, precautions are used if something now would pop up that would risk the group guidance or how is your feeling on that?</p>
          <p>Second question is regarding on underutilization costs in crop science. Actually Mr. Berschauer, you were so kind and give us a figure in Q1 on that underutilization cost. Could you also name that perhaps for the half-year please? And the third question is on biomaterial science. Thomas, you elaborated on order book now going up to October. Is this the right understanding? So the visibility is up to October and meaning what is the impact, let's say of the summer dip? Is there a lower volume expected in Q3 or is volume sequentially relatively stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Herr K&#xF6;hler, I would like to start. Werner Wenning speaking with the group guidance. You are &#x2013; you know that we tried to be as transparent as possible in our mid- and long-term and short-term guidances. And I feel and we feel very comfortable with the group's guidance for 2010, also recognizing the circumstances of our business, actually. So here we feel very comfortable.</p>
          <p>About the underutilization in crop, Herr Berschauer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Herr K&#xF6;hler, thanks for your question. As Mr. Wenning pointed out, we had idle costs in Q2 of 50 million, in Q1 of 28 which adds to 78 in half-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And order book in BMS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Ronald. The sector I was referring to earlier in terms of the visibility after October was the automotive sector, where certainly in the major high-end brands, people are suffering delivery times of three months or more. So we get very clear visibility in terms of order pipeline in the automotive industry. Clearly it's less visible in other sectors.</p>
          <p>In terms of your question about seasonality, I think summer is going to be a little strange this year. Certainly in the construction industry, there will the normal summer breaks. We don't see any difference from the normal seasonal effect in the construction industry. However in certain sectors and with certain car producers, they have cancelled their normal summer breaks and they are actually running right away through summer. So that suggests and supports the statement I made earlier about the strength of the automotive industry order book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And an additional question if I may. Yantai, in my view would start up their MDI facility somewhere in Q3, end of Q3, 300,000 kilotonnes. And would you see any impact on that on the MDE pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have no idea when Yantai will successfully start up their facility, but clearly when they start up their capacity, that's targeted primarily at the domestic Chinese market. Our unit in China is completely sold out and is actually just setting a production record in June. So I suspect the demand levels in China are extremely high. And looking at the growth rate in China, the new capacity will be absorbed fairly quickly.</p>

          <p>Andreas Heine from UniCredit. I'd like to follow up on MaterialScience. The TDI prices were rather weak in Asia and I've heard that also some softer prices in polycarbonate come from Asia. Could you elaborate a little bit more on what's going on in Asia? You had said already something on MDI, which was pretty tight, but how it is to other products. And then one question again on the Crop Science area, or more Crop Protection, there is now a huge margin difference between what BASF reported and Bayer. And that cannot only be explained by environmental science, which is put into a different reporting line. What do you think are the reasons that there is this big difference? Is it that are more affected by generic competition? You have a higher cost base, not that successful with success of this new product, because that difference is too high to just put it on market trends. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Okay. On pricing in Asia, DMS, Friedrich?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andreas. You are correct on the TDI pricing in Asia. We have seen some volatility, albeit at a relatively high level in terms of absolute pricing. If you look at what's going on, there's quite a lot of disruption in the supply chain in Asia, particularly in China, because of the Chinese Expo. TDI is classified as a product that cannot be transported during daylight time or during Expo time in Shanghai. And as all the TDI facilities are pretty much in the region of Shanghai, that is imposing some quite difficult logistics on people's operations.</p>
          <p>Our TDI facility in China is on track for mechanical completion towards the end of this year and will start up during the first half of next year. And clearly, then we will have got beyond this problem with the Expo, which has been &#x2013; meaning there's been a transportation ban. So what you are seeing in TDI pricing is a high level of volatility, rather than any particular trend.</p>
          <p>When you talk about Polycarbonate, you mentioned again some softening in price. I just don't &#x2013; doesn't see that. Looking quarter one, quarter two towards expectations in quarter three, at worst, the prices are flat and my expectation is they'll increase further.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Answering your questions in terms of our crop protection, comparing our margin with our major competitors, your observation is right. But allow &#x2013; let's &#x2013; I would like to make some, two important comments. The first one is, as discussed we had significant idle costs, underutilization of our capacity of 78 million in the first half. Of course I don't know the decisions of our major competitors, but this impacted clearly of course, <mark type="inaudible" /> .</p>
          <p>Secondly, as you know our data, last year &#x2013; of course we are comparing with last year. Last year, we in CropScience as well as in crop protection, we had the best top line in Q1 and Q2, as well as the highest profitability in our history, even higher numbers compared to our record year in 2008.</p>
          <p>Last year, we added in the second half of the year only 30 million clean EBIT to our clean EBIT numbers of the first half. So we had a rather weak performance last year in Q &#x2013; for the full year. That's why in the second half, we performed all the years at least with our major competitors. So I believe &#x2013; I firmly believe that we can close the gap and that we can catch up in the second half based on the activities we discussed before. Jason?</p>

          <p>I really did my best to answer it, but I'll give the absolute numbers. 47 million in the U.S., 75 million in Europe, 46 million in APEC, of which Japan is 26, China 12, for a total global revenue of 186 million.</p>

          <p>We are coming to an end, ladies and gentlemen, and also my career comes to an end. So that was my last conference call as CEO of Bayer. At the end of September, I will handing over responsibility for the company to my successor, Marijn Dekkers. I've been holding these calls with you for almost 14 years, the last eight and a half as CEO. I have always greatly valued our constructive debates, from which I have gained many ideas for my work. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, particularly for the confidence you have shown in me and this company, and to wish you all the best for the future. Thank you very much.</p>
