      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning everyone. Welcome to FEMSA's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. As always, Juan Fonseca and Alfredo Fern&#xE1;ndez are joining me here today. Let me begin by saying that overall, we're encouraged by our results for the first quarter, particularly in light of the challenging backdrop. The business environment across the market is not getting any better yet. Just yesterday, we saw Banco de Mexico update expected range of GDP growth for this year, lowering to between negative 3.8 and negative 4.8% for the year. And we know the demand for Mexican goods and services from the U.S. continue depressed as evidenced by the fact that U.S. GDP contracted over 6% in the first quarter, likely signaling a severe contraction in Mexican GDP for the period that could easily reach the high single digits.</p>
          <p>We continue to face foreign exchange headwinds across most operations and we again had the deal with high prices for many important raw materials, as we work through our hedges particularly in our beer business. However, the vast pricing and tight spending across our businesses allow us to deliver a set of results that represents a step in the right direction, as we move through this challenging 2009.</p>
          <p>In terms of business highlights for the quarter, Coca-Cola FEMSA's integration of REMIL and Jugos del Valle continues to drive growth and exceed expectations. Meanwhile, FEMSA Comercio opened 168 net new stores across Mexico to reach 6,542 stores; well on its way to surpass the 7000 store milestone before the end of the year, while once again delivering strong earnings growth.</p>
          <p>At FEMSA Cerveza, we highlight the resilient volume trends in Mexico in spite of very solid pricing, a contracting economy particularly in our key Northern Mexican strongholds and tough comparisons exacerbated by an adverse calendar effect. We are also encouraged by the fact that the aggressive expense containing initiatives deployed across our organization in recent months are bearing fruit. Our selling expenses were almost flat, while total revenues grew just over 10%.</p>
          <p>In terms of FEMSA's consolidated numbers, we saw similar dynamics to those of the fourth quarter of 2008. Only the FX hit was less traumatic this time around due to the smaller depreciation of our main currencies, as well as to the lower dollar exposure in our liability position relative to the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our operating income grew 20% for the first quarter, yet below the operating line, our net majority income fell 39% mainly reflecting the effect of the appreciation of the dollar on our dollar liabilities and to a lesser extent to the mark-to-market valuation of certain financial instruments. As you know, FX markets continue to be volatile and these may not change for some time.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet front, our position remains very solid. As of March 31, 2009, our net debt-to-EBITDA coverage remains at 1.1 times with 80% of our debt denominated in local currencies mostly, Mexican pesos. Given that Coca-Cola FEMSA has converted a meaningful portion of their cash position into dollars ahead of the repayment of dollar debt coming due later this year, our consolidated exposure to the dollar in our debt position is now of only 7% of our gross debt or roughly $200 million. We are also glad to report that we have already refinanced all of our 2009 maturities.</p>
          <p>Now let me elaborate a little bit on results of FEMSA Cerveza. As was the case in the preceding quarter, softening consumer trends across markets were partially compensated by strong pricing. In terms of volumes, we again face tough comparisons versus the comparable period, particularly in Mexico and the U.S. &#x2013; accentuated this time around by having one fewer calendar day in February and then an unfavorable effect from the timing of Holy Week.</p>
          <p>Amidst such severe headwinds, in Mexico we saw volumes contract by 3% during the quarter, lapping a comparison of 7% growth in the same quarter of 2008 and setting the stage for beer revenue growth of 3% given our strong pricing in this key market. In Brazil, volumes increased 1.9% despite average unit prices rising significantly in local currency. And in our exports, volumes increased 2.2% in spite of very tough comparisons of over 12% growth in both the previous year and quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of pricing we achieved gains in local currency across our markets. Beginning with Mexico, pricing was up 6.2% in the quarter and between late March and April we were rolling out a new round of pricing that should position us well to upset expected inflation for this year, still in the context of a rational competitive environment.</p>
          <p>We should note that the remaining effect of incremental direct distribution acquired in the past 12 months was minor during the first quarter with a majority of the increase in Mexico being driven by actual pricing actions taken in the market place. In Brazil, pricing in local currency was up over 18% as we continued to increase prices selectively, while capitalizing on the positive mix shift driven by the Heineken and Xingu brands in the super premium segment.</p>
          <p>Late last year we began selective price increases ahead of the industry. Anticipated that some competitors would raise their price umbrellas to adjust to the new tax structure. Furthermore, we believe the equity of some of our brands in certain territories has improved to the point where we can narrow some of our price gaps versus the competition. And in the U.S. average price in dollars increased by almost 5% following price increases in Tecate and the sustained mix improvement driven by the fast growth of Dos Equis.</p>
          <p>All in all, pricing continued to be a bright spot for us and we are well positioned on that front, as we continue to trade in this tough environment. In the end, for the quarter, total revenue increased 10.4% in beer.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, the raw materials pressure continued unabated as we anticipated in the previous conference calls. Cost of sales increased 19.1%, well ahead of the 10.4% revenue growth. COGS per hectoliter increased 20% reflecting significant rent pressure experienced across our brewing operations, combined with higher aluminum prices under depreciation of the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real against the dollar supplied to our dollar denominated costs.</p>
          <p>However, we were able to partially mitigate the impact of the depreciation through dollar forwards we contracted at attractive levels for a significant portion of our dollar requirements. Gross profit increased 4.6% for the quarter, but gross margin contracted by 370 basis points. At the operating expense level, we saw an encouraging change in trend driven by the selling expense line.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we had only minor expense effects from incremental direct distribution in Mexico as compared with the past quarters. More importantly, a combination of aggressive expense rationalization and the back loading of some marketing initiatives in Mexico and Brazil to the second half of the year, allowed selling expenses to grow by only 1.9% significantly below revenue growth.</p>
          <p>As a result, income from operations of FEMSA Cerveza increased 13.8% and operating margin expanded by 20 basis points in the first quarter. However, while we are very encouraged by the profitability dynamics achieved in the quarter, we must remember that the first quarter is a light quarter relative to the rest of the year and we must be cautious and redouble efforts going forward in order to minimize the damage to our margins given the challenging outlook for our cost structure and the overall economic activity in our markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to our soft drink business, Coca-Cola FEMSA delivered another quarter of double-digit revenue and EBIT growth. Approximately 40% of revenue growth was organic, driven by price increases deployed in recent months and by the continued success of Jugo del Valle and the rest of the non-carbonated beverage portfolio. REMIL contributed with 25% of the growth, while positive FX translation drove the rest.</p>
          <p>Operating income increased 17.3% &#x2013; 17 but operating margin contracted by 160 basis points, reflecting cost pressure driven by higher sweetener costs and the depreciation of local currencies in key markets, as well as higher operating expenses from REMIL and Jugo del Valle. If you were unable to participate in Coca-Cola FEMSA's conference call last Wednesday, you can access a replay of their webcasts for additional details on the results. And finally at FEMSA Comercio, during the quarter we observed signs of consumer activities decelerating. Same-store sales were down by 1.8%, reflecting slightly higher traffic and lower average ticket.</p>
          <p>Even though we already lapsed in production prepaid electronic air time, consumers that used to purchase physical air time cards continues to shift to electronic purchases. Such that we still see the distortion that has been present in our numbers for several quarters now, although the impact is lower as the months go by. As a result, for comparability purposes, we booked the full amount of the electronic recharge as opposed to just the margins, average ticket would have grown in the mid-single digits.</p>
          <p>In terms of store base expansion, our long-standing efforts to flatten the COG of store openings more evenly throughout the year allowed us to add 168 net new stores during the first quarter, almost a 100 more new stores than the 73 we opened in the first quarter of 2008. It is important to note that this does not mean that we are raising our target for the year above the 800 mark that we have mentioned before, but rather that the base of openings will be smoother as the year goes on and therefore less concentrated in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Revenues increased 10.4% during the quarter, aided by the services category, reflecting its defensive nature. Gross margin improved 205 from 50 basis points, driven by the change in the way we book prepaid cellular air-time as we have described in the past as well as by more effective collaboration and execution with our key supplier partners in the key categories.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increased 19.3% in line with previous trends and driven by the large number of store openings in the past 12 months, that more than offset efficiencies achieved at the store level. Operating margin expanded by 60 basis points to reach 4.1% of revenues.</p>
          <p>And before opening the call for your questions, let me make some final comments on our results and try to set the tone for the months ahead. Clearly we believe we have delivered strong quarter that was driven by many different elements of our platform and our strategy. Our ability to offset cost pressures with solid revenue management, the flexibility of our packaging mix, the defensive nature of our products, our increasingly strong brand portfolios and the robust competitive position of our operations.</p>
          <p>All those things come into play every day and we are encouraged by the scorecard we are sharing with you for the first quarter. However, as I mentioned before, we must be cautious in our outlook. There are parts of the equation that we do not control and there is no question that the macro slowdown is still out there. The manufacturing activity is contracting in Northern Mexico, that exchange rates are volatile and definitely that we're not out of the woods by any stretch.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Javier. The question and answer session will begin at this time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  First question comes from Lauren Torres with HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. In the quarter, your beer volume in Mexico was down 3%, I was just curious if you concluded the calendar effects, that one less day in the Easter shift. Would volume have been flat or maybe even up and also second part of that question with respect to the beer business, you mentioned taking some pricing in late March and early April, I'm curious if you could talk about the magnitude of those increases and also, was that more or less in the plans or some of the pressures that you're saying a bit tougher and that's why you felt you needed to put through those increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Lauren. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first one, I would say that, let me just by doing the math of seeing well, one day out of a little bit more than 90, that should beat you, may be a little bit more about 1%, which would explain a third of the 3% reduction we had. I would say that the Holy Week effect is, I would say at least similar to that, if not bigger than that. It all depends, of course, on how good the weather for the Holy Week was last year and how it would turn out to be or it turned out to be in April this year. So all in all, I would say that volumes would be more close to flat than just looking at the 3%.</p>
          <p>And the second part of your question the price increase was &#x2013; since the beginning of the year contemplated in the plant, but we &#x2013; maybe took some decisions to advance a little bit back a bit, because of, again the circumstances both in the economy and in the FX front, but our pricing was pretty much driven by the expecting inflation for the year and that's kind of the magnitude of the price increases we are looking at, which should be in the range of between 4 and 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as the cost environment is concerned, I think you said before that, expecting some relief for what happened until the very end of this year, even next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you're right. Not this year, but basically beginning, maybe next year, part of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Robert Ford with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning everybody and congratulations on the quarter, Javier. I was very impressed by the reduction in the expenses and you mentioned that there is a shift in the marketing, I was just &#x2013; it begs the question, how much of this decline is attributable to that shift in marketing spend and why are you doing it?  And then with respect to Brazil, the pricing there too is also very impressive and I was curious as to how much Sol shot impacts that performance year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi Bob. The first one I would say that the marketing has a couple of components. One is the rationalization, which I would say the reasonable &#x2013; to a level which we think is a reasonable one considering the circumstances, and there's a second component which is the way the plan for the U.S. is structured is a little bit different from the one we executed in 2008. So in 2008, we had a little bit more front loading of the plan and <mark type="inaudible" /> in this year where because we would like to be more cautious because of the &#x2013; again environment, we have a plan which is a little bit more back loading. So those two components, we are not doing and I said that in the past, we are not doing anything that we feel is not appropriate for the long-term sustained improvement of the brand equity of our portfolio in the three regions. We are making decisions considering the environment and the competitive dynamics also. We don't think we are doing these on our own. We are looking to &#x2013; I mean all of the players out there taking decisions, because again the environment. So we are very, very, I would say pleased that again we have still a good momentum on our brands, and we have still good numbers in our volume growth considering the circumstances so that's a little bit for the marketing reduction, quite simple.</p>
          <p>And the second one, yes I think this is a quarter in which again because of decisions we made at the end of last year, driven by the two reasons, which is mentioned or three I should add expected inflation going forward, and volume pressure. But again this and I would like to be very clear on this. This doesn't really make a profound change in terms of our attitude towards pricing in Brazil in the sense that we have been doing a lot of fine-tuning on position, our price points for the different brands and SKUs in the different regions in Brazil, in the past I would say maybe 12 months.</p>
          <p>The quarter now reflects pricing in anticipation of some of the movements of some of the players, taking advantage of, again, what we feel is going to be some of the price adjustments that the leader in the market is executing and is going to continue to execute in the marketplace due to the effects of the new tax structure and at the same time in some, I would say pockets, we have seen the opportunities to reduce slightly the gaps between our brands and either competing brands or leading brands.</p>
          <p>So all in all, I would say that it turned out to be a spectacular quarter for pricing in Brazil and we feel confident again that volumes are performing well and also brand equity indicators are telling us that we have good and solid grounds for doing what we're doing down there.</p>
          <p>So in short, it's really not a factor in terms of how big the impact on the top line because of the mix. So it's maybe helping a little bit, but it doesn't really, I mean, amount to an important component of the price increase book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And then we will hear from Celso Sanchez with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good morning. I guess you spoke to us a little bit, but maybe I can get a little bit more color. The selling expense that you kind of back-end loaded, &#x2013; I'm not sure if I missed it, but to what extent would you say that that could be expensed that if the economy really turns a lot more difficult that we are seeing obviously what people come out with revised downward forecast. Do you think that that selling expense could actually just be deferred to another year or how much would you think it's really imperative for the brands just a question of timing within 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I will answer it Celso. I will answer it in maybe &#x2013; through a couple of ideas. One is, we will still need to see how things evolve, but as I mentioned, our basic assumption calls for a huge reduction in GDP, in the neighborhood of maybe 4%, around that number. But again if you look at the first quarter performance of our products, we still feel comfortable that even with good pricing and our products have some resiliency in terms of facing this tough environment. So, the first thing we will need to look at is the overall performance of the economy and how well our volumes are holding up with the new round of pricing we're putting in place into the market. So, that will be a key signal for us.</p>
          <p>The second part is, again we have a very aggressive program in place for cost containment. I wouldn't say that when a &#x2013; even though a good part of this is due to I would say discretionary spending behind the brands, it's not the biggest component. I mean it's not the &#x2013; it's not even one of the most biggest components of the brand. Most of the brand is, I would say, structure regarding efficiency programs, rationalization, simplification of the structure and dealing with terms and conditions, with certain segments of customers which we feel we can now extract a little bit more value than we were able in the past due to a number of reasons. Because of having that much more say in on the way those outlets do their work or because we feel that we have stronger brands in some markets in which we can again I would say either lower, a little bit margin, or exercising of some also rationalization on some other components of the support we give to some of those retailers.</p>
          <p>So all in all, I would say that we are prepared for a very tough 2009. We have a number of initiatives to manage the cost base. Some of that is related to marketing, some of the marketing is back loaded, but we will still need to see the evolution of the economy and most importantly the evolution of our volumes to make decisions so it &#x2013; executing our plan the way it is structured or if we will need to make some changes to it as time goes by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to, thank you. And just to clarify so not talking about the discretionary marketing spend necessarily, but just all these structural changes you're referring to, would you &#x2013; you clearly have a plan for them, would you say that you've kind of picked the low hanging fruit already in the first quarter or you're beginning that plan and from a modeling standpoint, we should assume that there would be further leverage as you go through that plan over the course of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Celso it's Juan. I think definitely there is a plan in place for the full year with a very aggressive number as a target and what we've done in the first quarter will be continued. So I wouldn't think in terms of low hanging fruit. Obviously, there are some one-offs such as reducing the number of regional offices that the brewery uses across Mexico from five to four, right. So already there is a number of people that had to be &#x2013; have to be let go. And every quarter until we lap that thing, we are going to see the benefit of that. So I think there is &#x2013; some of them are one-offs that continue to flow throughout the year, some of them are activities that will be initiated in the next nine months.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, congratulations on the results. Also on this G&amp;A, the beer business, you mentioned in the last quarter some adjustments on your pre-selling strategy. I want to see if you could give us some update on how is that doing. And also if you already have an idea of what's the amount of savings you could reach on a yearly basis after this whole program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Antonio. Good morning. We are making progress basically in line with the plan. This is again not something that started for the quarter. I mean we have been working. What we have done for the year is that we have put much more speed into the plan and much more aggressiveness in some components of how we go to market. And I spoke about that kind of sale and different techniques that we are now rolling out. But what I can mention is that we're basically on the plan. I would take the opportunity to say that, again, as I said there is a number of initiatives, close to 100 different initiatives, only in the beer business to deal with this environment. And I would say that relative to market, we have maybe about 15 different initiatives I believe, with just this component of the cost structure. And instead of sharing numbers, specific numbers on what should be the amount of, I would say savings coming from these basic initiatives on growth-to-market. I would just reinforce the message is that we have a very aggressive cost containment program in place. It's working. We are pretty much based on &#x2013; I mean really it is pretty much in line with the plan and we are going to continue, as Juan just said, we'll continue to execute the plans as the year progresses. So we think this is going to be a key factor for us to manage this complex environment. So we are pleased with the progress we have been making, and as you see, some of that is being already shown in the quarter on the operating expenses line.</p>

          <p>Hi, Javier. Hi, Juan. My question has to do &#x2013; trying to understand what happened below the operating line. I know maybe you could expand number one, what's in other expenses? I know that two-thirds of that is coming from Coca-Cola FEMSA, but we're still getting about one-third of the increase in other expenses coming from either Cerveza or OXXO. The second question would have to do in a similar way with the derivative instruments, Javier. I mean, we're still seeing there a loss. If you could expand in terms of what's in there, I think I assume that that's related to Cerveza. And finally, also below the operating line, just trying to understand the higher taxes, the effective tax that you're paying right now, it's about 37%. And I would like to understand what's behind this spike, the hike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Alan. The other expenses line is, as you know, it's basically &#x2013; it includes the profit sharing component of the way we in Mexico are obliged to pay to workers a portion of the profit. And basically I would say any other non-recurrent items and I would say that the big increases for the quarter have mostly to do with &#x2013; in the mitigations to personnel, which are being laid-off, that's the basic explanation regarding the increase for the quarter, when you compare '09 against '08. In the case of the reworked instruments, I would say, it's basically if you look at the numbers we're strong for the quarter and compared to those for the fourth quarter of 2008 are basically pretty much in line with what they were driven, I would say the vast majority of it by foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>So that's basically it and in terms of higher taxes for the quarter, we have some, we'll have recognize some effects of some transactions both in FEMSA and in these are series, which are not Coca-Cola FEMSA, adding Coca-Cola FEMSA as opposed to last year. But this is a number that shouldn't stay there for the coming quarters. So going to the next second and third quarter you will see the number coming down to the more stable level, which is slightly below 30%. So that is just one-off for the quarter in terms of taxes.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from David Belaunde with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Just wanted to come back to pricing in Brazil. You all received a high figure. I wanted to see to what extent this is, I mean, is this whole market pricing at double-digit this quarter or what portion of that was you repositioning the pricing of certain brands, which should be a very company-specific factor and then the second thing I wanted to ask you about is the &#x2013; perhaps some update on the volume trends in April in Mexico, just if you would, the impact of the shifting time for Easter would have been on the positive side in April? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David. Pricing for Brazil, as I said, we are not repositioning our brand portfolio price architecture in Brazil at all. We are basically being very consistent with the course we have taken in terms of occupying what we consider were wide spaces or open spaces for brands such as Sol. We have continued to reinforce the, I would say price message that the Kaiser brand delivers to those markets in which the brand has a significant role and that we have stayed the course of being very disciplined in managing the value segment with the Bavaria brand, as well as growing the super-premium segment with Heineken, Xingu and Bavaria premium.</p>
          <p>So as I said, the quarter shows a big increase driven by the fact that we moved ahead of the competitors in some regions, mostly all of them. That we are again moving price in advance of what we feel is going to be the behavior of the competitors going forward due to the &#x2013; I would say economic performance of the &#x2013; of popular competitors and of course the pressure that the least player in that market is going to face going forward also and has been facing in the past as well.</p>
          <p>So the main message is we have been helped by the mix of the super-premium growing in the better fashion. We have been also benefiting because of the mix in geographic terms being helpful and what we are doing is basically just fine-tuning price gaps in those places in which we feel we have a better result of managing the pricing and volume, if we increased pricing in some of our products in  &#x2013; in certain channels. So that's basically for the pricing in Brazil question.</p>
          <p>And the second one, what I could see mainly is in April, we were looking at very good trends. When you look at the numbers in April that we were experiencing until the third week of the month before all this virus thing came out, I think that we were looking at trends which are consistent with the first quarter, once you take into account the difference in the calendar day and the Holy Week timings.</p>
          <p>So all in all, I would say were growing our volumes, but normalizing those because of these effects. I would say we were pretty much looking at the performance, which have worked consistently for the first quarter, which is in a sense good because it doesn't really reflect a continuous diminishing in the economic activity or in the consumption of our volumes. So it's kind of a decline to a certain platform as far as we can say for the first four months of the year. Still a lot of things to come ahead of us, but so far that's what we're seeing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to clarify, on &#x2013; in Brazil, you mentioned pressures that our competitors will be facing, you mean in terms of volumes, do you see a big deceleration in volumes for example in the month of March in Brazil or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say again looking at the first quarter in Brazil, if you look at the industry is going to be, I would say the very estimate we have is going to be flat or slightly negative, considering the trend of the market use to have.  I mean, that's a significant change. And still players are going to face also foreign exchange pressures and raw material pressures. So we think that pricing for the rest of the players is going to have to come a little bit, falling some of the numbers we have been showing, not reaching maybe the levels that we have been able to reach because again, we are executing the strategy and we have taken advantage of some of the works that have been than in the past years.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wanted to ask about volumes in Brazil, I mean in Mexico rather. As you've talked about the volume trends in the beginning part of the year has been I think remarkably strong given the economy and given the pricing that's been in place. So if you think through or if you could help us explain what you think drives the stronger volumes, I mean, has it been the way you've implemented some of the pricing? Has it been related to weather and what gives you the confidence that despite the deteriorating economic picture that you're describing that the industry can take another round of 3, 4, 5% price increases without a volume impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm not assuming that we may be impacted in volumes, Lore. But I would say that that may be the case. I'm just saying that the trends for the first 3, 4 months are pretty good, considering the environment and considering that I mean quarter-on-quarter in real terms, we have, I would say basically flat pricing in real terms again. But, my guess and this is again when you look at the models, which has taken to account the elasticity, and elasticity to income, and to pricing I shouldn't say we're amazed or highly surprised, but again the numbers that we are looking in terms of volumes that they are holding well. Yes, your question I would say, it's part of the answer. I think that the way we have been instrumental in the price increases basically channel and packaging are helping. So we have been presenting to, I would say consumers, which are highly affected either by unemployment or some sorts of phenomenas caused by the crisis. I think we have found ways to try to, I mean to moderate the impact of that.</p>
          <p>At the same time, I would say that again people in these times move very rapidly in terms of changing the decision-making. So if you look at the rest of the elements on the retail that I mentioned in Mexico, durable goods have been basically come down very, very significantly. So at least part of the, I would say disposable income of people, some of it has been changed to immediate consumption of some of our products. And so that should be helping out for the short-term. Even though unemployment or I mean, the lay offs in the manufacturing sector have been coming, I mean basically 7 to 8% of the people which have been employed in the manufacturing sector basically have been laid off. This has not happened, I mean since &#x2013; I mean, at the beginning of the year. It has been happening during the quarter. So I would say there is a number of reasons. Some of those, I think because we have been doing a good job, but some of those just because consumer behavior is helping us in keeping our volumes up there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could just ask the question about OXXO &#x2013; if you see a slowdown in same-stores sales trends, can you contain the selling expenses better there? I mean maybe you could help us understand what's driving that 20% increase in selling expenses in the quarter? And then also just related to that, in terms of the slowdown that you're seeing now, and I understand that it's temporary but as a result of the flu situation, what are your businesses do you expect to be impacted most currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the first one, growth of selling expenses if you look at the trend on OXXO, the 20%, it's pretty much the numbers that we have, I would say maintained for the past quarters and basically what's driving that, basically store openings. And I would say that in the first quarter, the number is extremely good, because we have been making, as you're saying, cost containment efforts in terms of reducing the costs on a per store basis. And in '09, we are now catching the benefit of electricity not coming up as it was coming out in the past two, three years. So that's helping a lot. But at the same time, we are implementing very, very aggressive efficiency measures in how we will manage the cost on a per store basis. But the overall numbers that you are see in the P&amp;L is pretty much driven by just the new store openings. And again if you do the math &#x2013; it also includes a good number of both efficiency on a per store basis, and, of course, the dilution of the fixed cost on the central office and regional offices, on the bigger number of stores. So I would say that that we are confident that yes., we have some room to maneuver in terms of getting or driving more efficiency from OXXO through the cost base, if we see some same store sales deceleration for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>The other question on the I mean, I would say the impact of this phenomena, I would say, it's been a week almost, basically a week since these things started to get into media and people had started to behave in different ways. So of course in the very very short-term, basically the last three, four days, we are seeing different phenomenas taking place, but I would say it will be very, aggressive for me to say this is the way it's going to evolve. I think that what I can share maybe is that we are still confident by looking just at the measures that the government is taking, and not only that, by the &#x2013; I would say the attitude of the society is taking in dealing with this issue. We are both hoping and thinking that we're going to come out of this shorter than longer. But there is no doubt that there is going to be an impact in the business in the next maybe weeks or months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm sorry, but just in terms of the impact that you're seeing right now, is it stronger in the retail business or in the beer or soft drink business, the negative impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I would say it's a little bit more stronger in the beer, but that may have to do a lot with that we carry higher inventory levels of the store level with beer than we do with soft drinks. So we don't have a clearer picture, if this is going to be kind of the standout behavior going forward or if it's just a very short term observation. So that's why I wouldn't like to give you a sense of what's going on because it's really too early to tell.</p>

          <p>Next question will come from Alex Robarts with Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Yeah, I'm sorry. I wanted to go back to the selling expense issue in beer. You mentioned before the part of the effort to reduce and I guess part of our commitment to have your selling expenses this year come in lower than the 11.9% increase that you saw in calendar year '08, is kind of discretionary reduction in some of the regional beer marketing campaign. And I wanted to understand if that had happened and were there any other kind of secular absolute reductions in Brazil or the US. Just trying to get a sense of the piece of this SG&amp;A &#x2013; of the selling expense deceleration coming &#x2013; not coming from the back loading. And I guess just the second question is really on the packaging side. Though in Mexico we're hearing a lot of the Coke bottlers as well as your beer competitor really implementing various forms of upsizing. And I wanted to get a sense of &#x2013; sense of here, do you feel comfortable with the upsizing that you did last year, particularly at the 1 liter to 1.2 liter shift? And would you contemplate doing some upsizing in the beer this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure Alex. Again the selling expenses, you're right. If you look at the trend we were basically double-digit growing in the past couple of years, the beer business. We explained there were &#x2013; I would say a number of reasons behind that. Some of those have diminished a lot, such as acquiring that body of distributors or the incremental spending in the selected retailers in which we were gaining higher degrees of control and things like that. And at the same time we were, I would say, in the three market sites talked about this, in the stages in which we were investing behind the brands in a significant way. So even though we are still increasing the amounts of resources that we're putting for example in the U.S. market in absolute terms, the increase as a percentage is lower because of what we have been able to accumulate a certain amount of spending behind the brands and, of course, we're now benefiting from the gross margin, which is being derived from volume growth.</p>
          <p>So I would say that selling expenses, there is a quarter, it's being helped by some of those factors that I just mentioned but at the same time it's being impacted and we said these from the October conference call that looking at the environment we were going to act very rapidly and very defensively.</p>
          <p>So it's a combination of things that are helping the number to look much better. I mean that's close to 10 full points of swing but at the same time it's also reflecting a lot of the efforts we are doing in terms of cost containment efforts within the company to start with.</p>
          <p>The second part of the question is, I would say that all in one &#x2013; and I wouldn't just like to refer to the up sizing decisions both on our size on our competitors but I would say that, all in all, the level of activity of innovation, brand extensions, line packaging extensions, segmentation in the Mexican beer market is also part of the answer to the Lore's question. Why we are performing better and I should need to attribute also part of it to &#x2013; I would say in the quarter to the up sizing decisions our competitor made it the second part of last year which is helping their, I would say volume performance this quarter. And the question is, do you think that's good for the industry in overall? I would say yes, because again, we're providing price points to consumers which in these times are very, very helpful to sustain capacity utilization and people interacting with our brands. So all in all I would say we're comfortable with the level of activity.</p>
          <p>Some of the decisions that we have taken and the way we have been instrumenting them differ from those of our competitor and I wouldn't go deep into that because I think that's a sensitive matter and because people think differently. So that's the only comment that I should make, I think that in an overall sentence I would say, the activity of the Mexican industry innovating and operating different therapies to customers in different dimensions to liquid price points, packaging, occasion of consumption, that is a very good thing for the industry, I'm very very sure of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. I mean, and I guess I just maybe to confirm so you'd rather not because of sensitivity issues tell us if you have completed a 1 to 1.2 liter upsizing program or whether that could be still kind of a work-in-progress?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I can tell you that most of what we think in terms of I would say, making decisions and putting products out in the marketplace, I think we're basically, I would say, at the end of the cycle, that's a different thing than saying that the way we're going to manage those SKUs there is nothing else to do. So there is a lot of still fine-tuning in the way we're executing the strategy. And, of course, competition is very dynamic, so we'll need to take into account that in order to keep making the right decision going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And have you actually reduced this, some of the marketing spend on the regional beer brands in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been shifting resources from regional brands to national brands and we think we have been very successful in things like that and of course as I said &#x2013; we're rationalizing marketing expenses in the year considering the environment. So we've been doing a lot of that, yes, Alex.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My first question was answered, but I just have a quick one on OXXO. You mentioned that the fact that the distortion at the top line from the switch, well, the distortion from the accounting change that you made is no longer an issue but that there is still a switch going on in the consumers, that is leading to a distortion in the whole phone air time issue. And I was just trying to get an idea of, when it is going to be over, when is the shift from cards to airtime going to be over, so that this is no longer part of the conversational on OXXO?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Jos&#xE9;, hi. I would say it's going to take basically 12 months after the mix of prepaid and cards stabilizes which hasn't happened yet. Even though we're lapping the quarters since late last year in which we already had airtime, there is a steep migration from consumers from electronic airtime to prepaid cards. So it's going to take a while. The comment I made is, it's still a factor, but it's diminishing on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So there may be a time in which the effect is no &#x2013; important that we'll tell you that that is already the case. But it's still, it has an effect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the effect in the first quarter, if you had put on a number of percentage points on it, what it had been, had there been no switch or what would be the revenue growth have been?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jos&#xE9;, I don't think we &#x2013; I mean had that been no switch, I think it's &#x2013; we haven't really cut the data that way. I mean, the comments we've made are, a year ago we were talking about, if we booked everything as it were pre-paid cards, the same-store sales number would have been well into the double-digit. I mean, well in the teens maybe, high teens. Today we're seeing mid-singles. Of course that has a component that is the economy and everything, it's not just this phenomenon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just a couple of very quick follow-ups. On the beer side, when we look at your cost of goods sold in the quarter, is this now sort of the worst point in terms of the raw materials cycle in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>If you remember, Lore, I mean a lot of this comes because of the hedges, right, so it's not that prices are moving around. It's that we already know what the price is going to be for a lot of raw materials and we already know &#x2013; we already know what we are paying for the dollars for a good portion of that. So I guess the one variable that is still moving out there is the FX for the peso and the real.</p>

          <p>Okay. And just one follow-up on this issue, the selling expenses. One of the things you cited as the reason for tighter expenses in the quarter was sort of more streamlined or tighter commercial agreements. But when I look at the income statement for the brewery, amortization went up almost 14%. I think a lot of that is client agreement. So can you just reconcile?</p>

          <p>Sure, sure. When I said commercial agreements, it's not only driven by that, I mean, it's a lot of the things we are doing, have a lot to do with margin only. So not all of the things we are doing reflects in the amortization. The amortization is pretty much shows the resultant of the segment of cost on which we have special agreements in terms of financing future earnings and things like that. So I should say commercial agreements is basically that it's a lot of all other things, it's support to some customers to pay some payments, to manage margin in different way that is translating to stronger pricing it on our behalf so it should encourage you look at same thing, looking at that line and commercial agreements.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for your participation today and have a good week. Just before we go, one quick comment on my part. As many of you know, but some of you don't, Julieta Naranjo is moving on to greener pastures. Literally, she has been invited by John Santa Maria to join him at strategic planning at Coke FEMSA, so she's going back to her roots, I suppose. And I just wanted to thank her for a job well done. Thank you Julieta. Thank you guys. Bye.</p>
