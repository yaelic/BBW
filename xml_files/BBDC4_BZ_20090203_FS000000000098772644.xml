          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. 2008 will be remembered for the massive change in the macroeconomic scenario, which gained force in the second half. As a result, assets lost value, corporate revenue fell, and investors saw their savings shrinking. The crisis is spread on an unprecedented scale in terms of both speed and expansion. Brazil was also affected although considerably lesser thanks to its solid fundamentals.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we observed there's a slight increase in delinquency level. Thanks to this and in order to maintain our coverage ratios at 155% for loans overdue by more than 90 days and 130% for loans overdue by more than 60 days, in the fourth quarter, we opted to record additional non-recurring provision for loan losses of around 600 million reais. As a result, Bradesco organization recorded a net income of 7.62 billion reais in 2008.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, order growth exceeded 1.6 billion reais. It's worth noting that these additional non-recurring provisions did not affect the calculation basis for dividends, which were declared excluding these provisions net of their tax effect.</p>
          <p>Similarly, they had no impact on our profit sharing payments, which were calculated in line with maximum value established by the bank employees' collective convention. Grupo Bradesco de Seguros e Previd&#xEA;ncia accounted for 35% of the net income of the year, posting a result of approximately 2.65 billion reais.</p>
          <p>Our assets grew by more than 33% over the last 12 months, led by the expanding loan portfolio, which moved up by 33.4% in the same period and 9.2% in the fourth quarter. The upturn was chiefly due to corporate demand, especially from large corporates, comprising groups with annual revenues exceeding 350 million reais.</p>
          <p>On the liability side, the quarter had its increase of 67.3% since December 2007 and 18.2% in the fourth quarter. As for the main ratios, the capital adequacy ratio reached 16%, well above the minimum requirement of 11%. The ratio of loans overdue by more than 90 days closed the year at 3.6%. The combined ratio of the private pension plans segment improved from 86% to 85.8%. And finally, the efficiency ratio came to 42%, very close to last year, easing with the solid expansion of our distribution network. Just to give you an idea, we expanded our network by 27%, adding more than 8,200 proprietary and third-party outlets. By inaugurating 196th new branch, we increased our market share by 0.4% to the current 17.7%.</p>
          <p>We also exceeded the 20 million mark in the number of account holders, recording an organically client growth of around 1.7 million reais. On the revenue front, in the last 12 months, we were able to expand our net interest income by 19.3% due to the growth of the loan portfolio, and to increase our fee income mainly due to the performance of credit cards consortium and assets managed, which offset the reduction in fees from checking accounts and loan operations in view of fee adjustment.</p>
          <p>We also recorded increased revenues from insurance, private pension plans, and saving bonds, especially in the health, life, and private pension plans segment. Personnel expenses increased due to the collective bargaining agreement and the addition of more than 3,800 employees,</p>
          <p> launching from the expansion of our distribution network, consolidating Bradesco as the largest private sector employer in Brazil. Administrative expenses moved up because of the extension of activities and high business volume. I would particularly draw your attention to the solid investments in infrastructure and information technology that reached 2.7 billion reais.</p>
          <p>2009 will be a year of challenges and we are projecting a GDP growth of around 1.5%, almost five times the estimate for the global economy. We believe there will be opportunities and we shall continue to invest and expand our activities in 2009. We estimate infrastructure and IT investment of 3.6 billion reais, 35% more than in 2008. We also intend to open another 170 branch and add more than 1.3 million new account holders. Once again, I would like to close by thanking our employees for their dedication and commitment to our goals.</p>
          <p>I will now pass the word to Jean and I will be at your disposal again during the question-and-answer session. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Our presentation will be accompanied by 34 slides, most of which will already be familiar to you. Let's begin with our fourth quarter net income, which totaled 1.6 billion reais. The highlights were the mark-to-market of the investments in Visa International of 454 million reais and the additional provision for loan losses of close to 600 million reais with 429 million reais being classified as excess provision, as already mentioned by Milton.</p>
          <p>We contributed several provisions for economic plans of 68 million reais, above the average for the previous quarters. We also recorded a non-recurring expense of 88 million reais to bring our financial statements into line with the requirement of the law 11,638. Taking all these adjustments into consideration, we reported recurring or adjusted net income of 1.8 billion reais for the quarter. And please note that all the comparative analysis on the following slides refer to the adjusted net income, permitting a better comparison with the previous quarters.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the slide number four. In the slide number four, we showed the quarterly evolution of Bradesco's net income. The decline over the previous quarter was largely due to the increase in the claims ratio of the insurance group, pushed up by the natural disasters in Santa Catarina state by approximately 40 million reais; health claims; basically seasonal factors; and the increase of the dollar, because several materials are cost on dollar; and the effect of the claims and increase of the IBNR tail from five to seven years in the life insurance segment, which expanded by approximately 100 million reais, 99.8 to be more precise.</p>
          <p>The efficiency ratio remains unchanged at 42% and we believe there is room for improvement in the coming quarters. We would also like to reiterate our belief that investments we are making in IT and the overhaul of our internal processes will be crucial in reducing this ratio and improving the quality of our services going forward. The network expansion and the IT improvement usually have a negative impact on the efficiency ratio to begin with, but will definitely result in future benefit.</p>
          <p>Slide number five. We closed the fourth quarter with total assets of 454 billion reais and shareholders' equity of 34.2 billion. The capital adequacy ratio, in line with the Basel II concept, closed at 16.1% at the end of the year, allowing us to grow in comfort without depending of new additional funding. But this leverage is exceptionally low, especially when compared to the national bank.</p>
          <p>Just to give you an idea, our total credit according to the Brazilian Central Bank concept of 173 billion reais is only five times equivalent to our equity of 34 billion. It is also worth noting that Bradesco has sufficient room to double its long-term Tier II funding, a subordinated debt whose limit is 50% of the Tier I. If this margin &#x2013; if this effect was to be adopted, the ratio would go up to 18.5%.</p>
          <p>Slide number six. The mark-to-market effect on investments in the shares was chiefly responsible for the decline in the quarter's unrealized gain. This gain excludes the potential gains from the sale of VisaNet and/or Serasa, expected gains from the comparison between the market value of the guaranteeing assets and the real estate of 4.3% used to calculate the technical reserves of fixed benefits plans. And last but not least, the potential gains from the prefixed interest rate in loan operations and the expected effective interest rate during the life of the prefixed portfolio.</p>
          <p>Slide number seven. This slide gives a breakdown of Bradesco's net income. The annual reduction of the share of fee income was due to the realignment of fees for individuals and the elimination of the loan operation fee. The annual increase in the share of insurance was basically due to the evolution of operation and the return of provisions in the individual health segments to normal levels. The quarterly reduction in the share of insurance was caused by the seasonal upturn in claims. We expect these percentages to be maintained for the year of 2009.</p>
          <p>Slide number eight, giving a summary of our income statement with the main variations, which will be discussed in more detail shortly.</p>
          <p>Slide number nine. Our net interest income grew by 15%, led by the more stable interest-earning portion, which increased by 19.3%. The volatility impact was chiefly felt in the mark-to-market of the fee assets, resulting in a 16% reduction in the non-interest portion. The growth in loans and funding volume was mainly responsible for the upturn in interest-earning operation, offsetting the reduction in spreads both annually and quarterly.</p>
          <p>The negative impact of the spreads was in turn caused by the higher growth of corporate vis-&#xE0;-vis individual operations whose spreads are higher. The 63 million reais rise in the non-interest line in the fourth quarter was due to Treasury efficiency despite a negative impact of the mark-to-market of derivatives indicate the CDS of the Brazilian foreign debt &#x2013; sovereign debt.</p>
          <p>Slide number 10. On this slide, we show our interest earnings in grey and the non-interest earnings in red, results since 2005. It is worth noting that although very important in absolute terms, the non-interest portion is relatively insignificant in comparison to the interest-earning portion, underlining the potential stability of Bradesco's results.</p>
          <p>Slide number 11. This slide shows the nominal evolution of the net interest margin from interest-earning operation and its ratio in relation to total assets adjusted for the exclusion of fixed assets that are not remunerated and delinquent. In the quarter, the reduction in the average rates from 7.8% to 7.3% was due to the higher increase in corporate operation whose spreads are as mentioned far lower.</p>
          <p>Slide number 12 gives a breakdown of net interest income from interest-earning operation in both the annual and quarterly comparison. You can see that the biggest increases came from loan and funding operation thanks to volume growth.</p>
          <p>Slide number 13 gives a summary of loan operation and the blue line first, gross margin, basically the spread and the red line to provision for loan losses and recovery. The net margin, the black line, recorded a 19% growth in 2008, underlining the good performance of loan operation. It is worth highlighting the ratio of the provision, net of recovery to the total spread, which came to 40% in 2008 vis-&#xE0;-vis 37.5% in 2007. Note that we are not excluding the additional provision in the 2008 data. In fact, as you can see, delinquencies moved up.</p>
          <p>Slide number 14, showing our funding, led by demand in savings deposits and CDs and certificate of deposits. The hefty increase in time deposits was due to a higher demand for credit, especially in the corporate segment. Bradesco's liquidity remained high even when the crisis was at its worst.</p>
          <p>The investment fund industry was affected by the decline in the price of the equity, the stock price of the equity, remembering that the Bovespa Index &#x2013; the Ibovespa Index fell by 41.2% in the year and by 24.2% just in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, our fund portfolio managed by Bryan reported a 5.4% upturn in the year. Stock market volatility triggered the regrouping of funds to more conservative assets such as savings accounts and CDs, partially explains the substantial 96.8% in time deposits.</p>
          <p>Slide number 15. Bradesco's loan portfolio closed 2008 at 215 billion reais, a consistent 9.2% increase in the quarter, and 33.4% high on a year-over-year basis, outpacing the private banks and the market as a whole. New borrowers accounted for 20% of the loan portfolio growth in 2008 or by some 26.8 billion reais in absolute terms. The shrinkage of the capital market and viscosity of external credit line explained a 15% upturn in fourth quarter corporate loans. In 2009, we expect our loan portfolio to grow by 15%.</p>
          <p>Slide number 16. Moving to the analysis of the individual loan portfolio, as you can see, the highest annual increases came from leasing, mortgage, and rural loans. The strong growth in leasing was due to the increasing focus in this product, which is not subject to financial operation, attacks the IOF and is therefore more competitive.</p>
          <p>On slide number 17, we are looking at the consumer finance book, which totaled 57.9 billion reais by the end of the year, 20.4% up in the year and 3.1% up in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, however, there was a reduction in demand due to a lack of consumer confidence.</p>
          <p>Auto financing and payroll deductible loans account for two-thirds of the consumer financing portfolio. Thanks to a particular characteristics and associated guarantees, these operations have a lower credit risk than other consumer financing operations.</p>
          <p>Slide number 18, looking at the portfolio of the corporate, the best performance in this segment were working capital for large corporations and export financing, which was impacted by the exchange variation and an increase in demand, reflecting Bradesco's commitment to this country &#x2013; to Brazil's foreign trade.</p>
          <p>Slide number 19 shows our vehicle portfolio. Bradesco has a 23% market share in this segment. In 2008, as I have already mentioned, we began focusing on leasing as a means of financing new vehicles, which explains the substantial growth of this product.</p>
          <p>Slide 20. Moving to mortgage, the origination during the year reached six billion reais, a 47% increase on a year-over-year basis. Our market share in November '08 was 20.5%. We financed more than 49,000 properties during the year or approximately 17% of the total number of homes financed in Brazil by banks. These are information as of November 2008.</p>
          <p>Our 2009 origination target is five billion reais, slightly below the 2008 figure although we believe this market will maintain its upward trend despite the expected economic slowdown and there will be no shortage of funds due to the savings account requirements to be met.</p>
          <p>Slide number 21, looking at the provisioning, we basically are showing a graph where you can phase the provisions vis-&#xE0;-vis the expected losses. The first line represents total provisions as a percentage of the loan book divided by the book while the second line corresponds to the Brazilian Central Bank's reserve requirement.</p>
          <p>Note that we have an excess provision of 1.6 billion reais, the difference between the first two lines. The line in purple representing the percentage of effective losses or charge-offs and is converging with the green line, which would prevent non-performing loans. Based on these historic trends, we can safely say that we have a provisioning cushion of 3.2 billion reais, allowing us to comfortably overcome any eventual difficulties.</p>
          <p>Slide number 22, moving to the delinquency of more than 90 days, we can see that there was a little bit of an increase in this ratio because of the downturn of the macroeconomic scenario. Thanks to this increase in both individual and corporate segments, we decided to record additional provision of 600 million reais in order to maintain our coverage ratio at close to 165% comparing provisions vis-&#xE0;-vis loans overdue by more than 90 days and by 130% if we were to compare the provisions vis-&#xE0;-vis the loans overdue by more than 60 days.</p>
          <p>We expect delinquency to increase further in 2009 although the precise magnitude of the upturn will depend on the employment levels in the case of individuals and the payment capacity of certain corporate in the corporate sector. Nevertheless, it would remain at reasonable levels since we firmly believe a country like Brazil can emerge from the expected slowdown in the coming months.</p>
          <p>In addition, companies are already aware of the immediate future trend and will be careful to make sure they get through the current difficulties without losing competitiveness when those eventually recalls.</p>
          <p>Slide 23, looking at fees, that's increased on a year-over-year basis by 3.8%. Higher income from credit cards, assets, and consortium management, collection and custody, due to the growth in volume and expansion in the client base offset the declined fees from loan operation and checking account arising from the regulatory changes.</p>
          <p>On slide 24, looking at the operating expenses, you can see that the structural components of personnel expenses in the fourth quarter was impacted by 34 million reais due to the wage increase and vis-&#xE0;-vis 62 million reais in the fourth quarter of '08 and 96 million reais in the fourth of quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Also in the fourth quarter, we hired more than 1,000 new employees due to the expansion plan with the opening of 124 full-sized branches and a 130 advanced service branches, which have a 31 million reais impact on our expenses. Clearly every new outlet is being monitored to confirm compliance with the planned results.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, looking at the operational expenses, in 2008, a number of Bradesco's outlets moved up by 27% or by 8,200 new spots including our own approximately 1,462 and third parties by more than 6,700.</p>
          <p>New network expansion investments in IT, mainly the IT improvement project and business expansion were also reflected in the administrative expense. Higher expenses in the quarter can be explained by the seasonal expenses related to advertising and the accumulated opening of new branches and advanced service branches in the period.</p>
          <p>Slide number 26, the coverage ratio comparing fees and administrative expenses has been falling due to the impact of organic growth and the regulatory measures that affected fee. However, we believe that higher business volume and the increase in client base will move the ratio back to its previous levels as of the second quarter of 2009 when the new fee income criteria will have been in place for a year.</p>
          <p>Slide 27, it is a summary of our Insurance Group income statement. The 12% increase in the annual result reflects production growth and the return of technical provision in the Individual Health Insurance segment to normal levels. The fourth quarter results was affected the growth in the health claims ratio reflecting the impact of the U.S. dollar appreciation on laboratory, prosthesis, and medicine costs.</p>
          <p>In addition the floods in the South and Southeast of the country impacting to claims ratio in the auto and residential property segments impacting by 40 million reais and the expansion of the IBNR tail in the life insurance segment in the amount of close to 100 million reais, to be more precise 99.8 million reais.</p>
          <p>Net income from the Insurance Group accounted for 37.7% of the Brazilian insurance market's total net income and these are data as of November 2008.</p>
          <p>On slide 28, looking at the revenues from insurance premiums, private pension plans and savings bonds reaching 23.1 billion reais in 2008, a 9.2% increase on an annual basis, equivalent to 24% of the insurance market's total sales. These again are information as of November '08. As a result, Bradesco maintains its leadership in the property and life insurance segments, as well as in private pension plan.</p>
          <p>Looking at the slides of number 29 and number 30, basically we show our own financial assets and technical provisions guarantees, which results &#x2013; which reached 71 billion reais, equivalent to 34.5% of the market through November '08. It is worth mentioning that nearly 80% of these assets correspond to pension plans and VGBL investment portfolios.</p>
          <p>Total assets grew by 5.3% on a year-over-year comparison. Technical provisions reached 65 billion, a 34.3% of the insurance market participation, again through November '08 data. The 2008 health segment's provision moved up more than 200 million reais ending the year above 3.4 billion reais.</p>
          <p>Slide number 31 represents the efficiency ratio of the insurance segment. The highlight was the annual combined ratio that has been improving consistently, indicating operational efficiency of the Insurance Group. The fourth quarter growth of the index was seasonal and was impacted by the increase in the claims ratio that we have already mentioned before.</p>
          <p>On slide 32, looking at the guidance we have given by the middle of last year, looking at 2008 and comparing with what we accomplished during the year. In line with our commitment to accountability, this slide compares our 2008 guidance and we believe our guidance for individuals and corporate loan segments, operating expense, and mortgages was met. In some cases, even exceeding the forecast figures despite the adverse conditions. We have not reached the estimated guidance for fees, which was affected by the fees adjustments and loans operation fees, the TAC no longer collected and also a decline in vehicle financing.</p>
          <p>The net interest income was affected by market volatility and insurance premium, especially in the private pension plan segment due to the option of more competitive investment product and conservative like a CD. However, as you saw in slide nine, the net interest income posted annual growth of 19.3%.</p>
          <p>On slide 33, we are looking at the macroeconomic outlook for '09 and 2010 our chief economist has been giving, where basically you can see that we are expecting a 1.5% GDP growth, which should be five times higher than the world's GDP expectation for this year.</p>
          <p>In slide number 34, we are looking the guidance for this year of '09. And I would particularly like to draw your attention to our net interest income and fees growth estimated as well as our new mortgage funds.</p>
          <p>Slide 35, we are looking at the next APIMEC <mark type="inaudible" /> INI events that we are going to host in Brazil. And as a matter of conclusion, we would like to just say that the global economy as a whole and the banking sector in particular suffered one of its worst ever years in 2008, reflected massive write-offs that forced governments to bail out ailing companies and banks, especially in the developed economy.</p>
          <p>I would just like to emphasize that Bradesco's balance sheet is exceptionally healthy. This will enable us not only to overcome the expected slowdown in the coming months and with ease, but will also allow us to continually grow very strongly the expansion of our operations and distribution network in order to be even better positioned to when the growth will return over time.</p>
          <p>I'm particularly referring to; one, our comfortable level of provision for loan losses, labor, tax and fewer provisions as well as our technical provisions in the insurance and pension plans segments; two, the undoubtful recovery of the mark-to-market of CDS, whose provision mature in the next 20 months and other efforts as well; three, the potential gains in our fixed portfolio from expected fall in interest rates; and four, the improvement in our efficiency and quality ratios over the next two to three years due to the conclusion of the IT improvement project and the review of internal processes in progress.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Mr. Jason Mollin with Goldman Sachs.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. My question is related to your guidance for 2009, looking at your net interest income or what you might call net financial income growing 18 to 22% while you have your loan book growing 13 to 17%. And of the top of my head I believe your loan book is probably around 40% of your assets. So I'm just curious about what your expectations are for securities in this environment going forward. And how we should think about your net interest income growing so much faster than your loan base? It seems as if you're implying that spreads should go up. And if we look on page, I think it's 82 of your large report for the quarter, we see that 55% of your assets mature in less than 30 days, another 11% in less than 180 days. So if you can give us a sense of what's driving this guidance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jason. Actually, it's always a big discussion that we have, because we have an inflow of new operations with better spreads and we have a stock of operations that has been over time normally moving down. So you'd see the net interest margin moving down when you look at the stock, but we see in the new operations an inflow of higher margins in the operations.</p>
          <p>We are expecting this process actually to increase the net interest income on a very sound basis in 2009. You also notice the relative participation of operations like large corporation, I believe that half of the loan book growth in 2008 have been originated by large corporation. So definitely, I believe, when you have these effect and you know that the spread that we charge, even though they are much higher now than before, on large corporations, this affects definitively the margin itself.</p>
          <p>We have an expectation of the decrease in the cost of our funding, because we have very important decline industrially during the year. And at the end, we have a provision on our portfolio, which basically says because of the size of the prefixed portfolio that when we have a decline in the interest rate industrially, actually it's more positive for us because of the size of our prefixed book.</p>
          <p>So at the end, taking all of this into consideration, thinking also that we were very affected this year, for example, in the effect of the mark-to-market from securities like the CDF, which we believe should not be so much affected in 2009. We basically make the calculation that we should be, even though we have a loan book growth of 13 to 17%, we should have a higher growth in the net interest income. So these expectations, relatively the opposite as what we have last year where the loan book growth was very solid, but we have a net interest income growing by half.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it &#x2013; could it also be &#x2013; I mean is Bradesco talking about positioning themselves to benefit from interest rates declining, whether it be through derivatives or buying longer-term securities? But I guess we're really looking for short-term rates coming down. That's why, I think, with such a large security book, what kind of forecast, what kind of expectation should we have for the securities portfolio? Should loans continue to represent around 40% of assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I believe that is, around 40% would be &#x2013; to be expected for 2009. Definitely we try to be matched between assets and liabilities. But we have a slight component of higher prefixed portfolio, which is actually a little bit more positive. But we are not taking into account in our analysis a drastic change in our way of positioning the portfolios. The loan book will continue to be growing on a very sound basis and we marginally could have a gain because of the position of the prefixed rate. But we should not change so much the stance of being very conservative and trying to be matched as much as we can between assets and liabilities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are in a number of a little bit less than 8% looking at 2008 and the expectation for 2009 should be close to 9%. So we have a relative worsening in the employment numbers, but again the number that we have are the best over the last 10 years. So even though the GDP grows by 1.5%, one, it's growth and second, what we have is basically a process of we will have less new job creation than companies firing people.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez, JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everybody. I have two questions. First, on your expectations for asset quality, if I look at page 21, Jean, from the second, during the last asset quality worsening cycle, more or less the second quarter of '05 through the end of 2006, we see <mark type="inaudible" /> past due loans increase by about 150 basis points &#x2013; or 140 basis points from 3.2% to 4.6%. We're, obviously, as you guys mentioned, entering into another worsening cycle where you've seen a pretty abrupt downturn in economic activity. Can you kind of give us a sense for whether you think this worsening cycle would be similar, worse or better than the previous worsening cycle in terms of the increases in past due loans and if you can give us a sense for why you think that as well?</p>
          <p>My second question is a follow-up to Jason's on the spreads. Obviously, you're 18 to 22% net interest income growth guidance as assuming that lending spreads remain very elevated. Are you worried though at all about political pressure and the discontent out there about lending spreads being as high as they are and obviously we've seen a lot of topmost politicians and a lot of talk in the press about banks reducing rates on loans? And how do you think about that when you think about your ability to sustain 18 to 22% net interest income growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So first question about asset quality, I would say, it's very difficult to compare cycles as it is also very difficult for us to compare our company with our company over the last cycles, we have been <mark type="inaudible" />. The fact is that we have been seeing actually a very big change in the portfolio of a plan. To give an idea, back in 2003, 27% of the portfolio was with individuals; now it's like 40%. And the credit lines are definitely very different. We have a major growth when you look at the operation in what we consider safe operations like payroll deductible loans and also vehicles that are also good in our understanding.</p>
          <p>So fact is that cycles, I would say the worst scenario was &#x2013; the worst cycle was in 2001 and 2002. The cycle that we are seeing now is very difficult for us to measure, but we don't believe that we could see something very drastic over time. We're always going to see what is going in terms of the numbers of unemployment, in terms of the numbers of the companies and basically we decided to basically increase a little bit our provisioning as you note in our numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the cycle was different, because Bradesco is different than what it was before. The credit lines are different and we have been investing very, very much in improving our credit scores, the training of our employees. And also one thing that is important to mention is that the cycle that we are passing through right now, the companies are leveraged than they before.</p>
          <p>A lot of companies issued capital. They are more professional in the way that they are managing the companies. So on the side of the corporate, we believe that things should not so deteriorate so much in the side of the individuals as well. In terms of the spreads and about the rates, we don't believe that there will be a political issue of the government trying to force or change a thing. Basically the spread, the interest rates, they depend on different variables, but the market is open and we don't see the government affecting our operations by putting caps or changing the status quo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up, Jean, on the first question on asset quality, what segments are you most concerned about or you think there is more potential for worsening, is it credit card, is it unsecured personal lending, is it SME lending, where obviously, we have started to see some uptick in what we are still well below historical levels? But just kind of what segment do you think are more vulnerable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe those are segments that are more affected by a slowdown in international trade. So companies that are large exporters or are in sectors that are in the process of consolidation, although consolidation in our view is very positive. We don't see particular sectors that we are so much worried about. We should have a deceleration basically across the border, maybe some segments like companies that are focused on supplying to the auto industry, because the auto industry is expected to sell less, some companies that are importing goods or some focused on shoes or wood, but nothing so much worries. You can see also in the footnote that we have of the credit portfolio, that we have a very diversified loan book. We are not so concentrated in any particular sector and this is definitively a safe thing to have in an environment, which is very volatile.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Daniel Abut with Citibank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Jean, a couple of questions, one, as a follow-up on the asset quality question, you are entering this period of uncertainty, which you correctly described as very difficult to predict what will happen with delinquencies and therefore provisioning needs and a lot depends on employment and other things that are very difficult to call. But you are entering it quite on purpose with much higher excess reserve, you upped them this quarter, they are now at 1.6 billion above the minimum required by the Central Bank.</p>
          <p>Should we understand that you are prepared to then consume part of that excess cushion as you go along in case delinquencies surprise on the downside scenario and increase more than expected? Or do you endeavor to try to keep the excess reserve of 1.6 and any negative or surprising increase in delinquency will all flow through your provisioning needs in the P&amp;L? That will be question one.</p>
          <p>And question two will be, if you can elaborate on how we should understand your operating expense guidance, which is nine to 14% for '09, quite a wide guidance. Should we understand that in case the outlook for revenues and provisioning needs becomes more challenging that, and you are going to adjust and your plans are flexible so that it will end up being closer to the lower end of the range? What does this range depend on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are quick in your questions. Let me try to explain. I would say, basically, what we have is a scenario where the data that we received from the market and we have a very solid economic team, we have a lot of information that we can capture much more than the market. To give an idea, 20% of the collection of the companies in Brazil passes through our system. So we can definitively, I would say, analyze a little bit better than the market what is the expectation of losses.</p>
          <p>We noticed that there should be a deterioration in asset quality and this is the reason why we build some excess provision. We have 3.2 billion reais of excessive provision, they might be used but or not this depends on the evolution. We have been seeing actually numbers of November and December of the entrepreneurs are becoming a little bit better than what they were in September and October. So it doesn't mean that we are changing from being relatively cautious to relatively more optimistic, but the fact is that we are going to see what is going on in terms of the unemployment rate, the health of the corporation, and based on that, we might be doing some more provisions or not.</p>
          <p>Definitively, the balance sheet that we have is extremely solid, extremely solid. So we built some provisions, they might be used or not. This depends a little bit of the expectations that we have nowadays being met over time.</p>
          <p>In terms of the costs that we have, I would say we have some costs that are investments, some costs that are linked with IT expansion in the number of distribution. You noticed, I believe, that our distribution market share grew by 0.4% in one year, because we have been opening more branches. We believe that the opening of branches is key for us to being larger and better in terms of efficiency. So if we are going to meet the lower end or the higher end of these option to sell, I would say, usually around the middle is the expectation and we have a lot of cost that are investments. And at the end, we are going to see and what we have in the year of 2008 was actually a guidance in expenses that was met. You see that we had 11 to 17% and we were almost right in the middle, and so maybe, considering more right in the middle is more to be expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a follow-up, Jean. I mean I understand that the midpoint is probably kind of the base-case scenario. What I was trying to get into was that if let's say &#x2013; as one assumption, asset quality proves to be under pressure than we think, because you said, you're expecting only a mild deterioration, let's say that is worse than that. How flexible are your plans so that you could move to end up closer to a lower end of the range or &#x2013; because it's IT, another thing that I already comprised, there is not much flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Daniel. I would say we have a plan. We should be opening 170-plus branches during the year. We have more investments in IT, some 3.6 billion, which is a 35% increase vis-&#xE0;-vis last year. And these are plans that we are, I would say, very comfortable to be following. We are extremely positive about the long-term of Brazil. So maybe we have a year or a little bit more than a year of slowdown in the economy, you see the GDP moving from almost &#x2013; from 5.5, let's say, to 1.5%, but over time a four to 5% GDP growth is a running expectation of the GDP growth.</p>
          <p>And we are expecting this to happen, and we should be benefiting because we are investing now, and you see, we have like 25, 30 months of return on the investments of the branches that we are opening. We've opened a lot of branches. We grew the opening of branches in 2007. So we should be, from next year on, beginning to benefit from that. And this I believe should be one of the components of earnings growth over time and even the process of IT, that improvement should be concluded by the beginning of 2010. So these are additional cost that we have of opening branch,  start investing more in IT that we are not going to occur going forward. And this benefits the earnings for our company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I also have two questions. The first one, I don't know how much you're going to be able to answer, but I'm going to ask anyway. We have seen a lot of consolidation in the sector recently; there has also been a lot of speculation in the press that there might be some other banks for sale in Brazil. So I would like to hear from management what is your appetite for consolidation for acquisitions, let's say in the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>The second question has to do with your auto insurance business. We saw that auto and real state had negative net income this quarter. I think, it was explained that some of that had to do with the floods in South of Brazil. But I was wondering what is the outlook for the segment? How do you see premium growth? How do you see prices going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario, we are focused on organic growth and I believe you, this plan of opening 500 branches in three years that we're so firm and committed to continue, is important to be re-emphasized again. Consolidation has been very strong in 2008, definitively, and we were and we are always a very large player because we are very focused and our focus is with you. We are always obliged to analyze opportunities, but the numbers of opportunities, they are very limited. So let's say, focus on organic growth is the number one priority for us. We do have scale. So we don't need to buy anyone. We are a very large one-stop-shop company. So we don't need to buy any particular bank in any particular field, because we are very well positioned everywhere. But we're obliged to analyze if something comes up, but definitively you should be considering that our focus is organic growth. Samuel?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mario, talking about insurance business in terms of Bradesco, you know our perspective. No line of business will be registered in our case. We don't talk about the market; of course, the market would be effect of all the crisis. But in terms of just with I think to lose, you have to put in so much in the bank client's penetration. Because in terms of, for instance, the P&amp;C, our penetration in client &#x2013; base client basis is lower. We have to increase so much about this kind of penetration, the same as relates to the health because health we have about 60% or 70% of the penetration in the bank client bases. We have to increase so much above this.</p>
          <p>In terms of dental, for instance, we have today a 38% as our client of health has a dental. We have a huge opportunity to increase so much of this kind of business. And in our perspective, I would say to you when in our guidance lines, it puts that as between seven and 9% of the increase of our revenues in insurance, which &#x2013; and then maintain our contribution in terms of profit of the organization in total. I think it would be very, very huge opportunity to increase so much of our client bases today in terms of our insurance business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>According &#x2013; in our view, in terms of auto will be a little bit increase in next months in terms of price. Of course, the competition would be very aggressive, as this still continues aggressive. I have been in insurance market for 40 years. These 40 years are very huge competition in terms of ours very competitive business. I think it would be &#x2013; in terms of market would be a little bit increase in the next months in the price.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Hi, Jean. Just one question, coming back to the question about excess reserves, I see that this now counts as part of Tier-I capital. So obviously, if you do need to dip into that, would you dip into that excess reserve or would you increase your provision charges so as to maintain your capital adequacy ratio and not deduct from that?</p>
          <p>That's my first question. My second question is can you give us some guidance in terms of what we can expect in terms of provisioning for loan losses as a percentage of average loans. What you expect to charge against the P&amp;L in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Victor, look we have a very solid BIS ratio in Tier-I and in Tier-II and we also have a very solid level of provision. One thing is different from the other. The excess of provision is based on maybe the future expectation of losses. We have more than 16% BIS ratio. That is, we have a very large possibility to expand the Tier-II capital base. So the idea if we actually need capital, which is not the case, we, I would say, depending on the conditions of the market we would be tapping more Tier-II capital. We are very comfortable with Tier-I and we are very comfortable with our provisioning level. So the idea is basically to expand on this way.</p>
          <p>In terms of the provision, the loan loss provision, it's very difficult to give you a number because it's very difficult for us to forecast more precisely what is going to happen in Brazil this year as in the world. I believe it was never so difficult for anyone. So the idea, I would say, is to have an increase in the need of provisions as a percentage, but difficult for me to be guaranteeing by how much percentage.</p>
          <p>The idea is actually more to expand the loan book, it's easier for us to forecast the expansion in the portfolio than forecast the need of provision. In the expectation of the need provisions, we increase a little bit of provisions because we should be having a little bit higher needs of provisions as the unemployment rate should be increasing a little bit and some companies might be needing operations, but it's difficult for me to precise a percentage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but, I mean given that we've seen a big increase in your NPL formation in the fourth quarter '08, I mean, would you say it's likely to be higher than it was in '08, in '09, or would you have to set aside that 500 million extraordinary provision that you &#x2013; would you have to deduct that from your '08 to get to an increase in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we should be growing the portfolio and we should be growing more the allowance for loan losses in 2009 vis-&#xE0;-vis at least the loan book as a percentage. We increased in the fourth quarter as a precaution for the very difficult expectation for this year, it's difficult for us to forecast. So the idea is to expand the &#x2013; to increase the expenses. And we believe that the lack of provisions would be in excess last quarter and fourth quarter was in line to the expectation of the asset quality deterioration. More than that, we believe that the 3.2 billion reais are totally comfortable. When we compare, we saw that the level of losses also moved down. And so the excess is very solid and we are very comfortable with that.</p>

          <p>Hi, just a follow-up on the insurance question for Samuel. I understand that 7 to 9% guidance for insurance premiums, but can you kind of give us a sense for how the economic condition impact your underwriting margin or your loss ratios in different businesses? In other words, should we expect loss ratios in auto insurance to go up or down? Does fraud and crime tend to increase or does auto usage tend to decrease on the economic activity decline? In the health insurance business, should &#x2013; do people use more &#x2013; or is there more claims activities when the economy is in more difficult condition as you see in some countries? I mean, should we expect your loss ratios to be negatively or positively impacted by the economic conditions is I guess, my basic question? Hello?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are talking about this, simply with you. But I would like to repeat again my answer about this. Of course, the crisis would be &#x2013; affect the insurance business in general, but in our case specifically, I would say to you that the crisis is for everybody, it's for insurance companies, it's for stakeholders, for labs, for hospitals, for dealers, for everybody. In this case what I have to do, of course, there are a lot of movement to reduce the amount of the people will be covered by health in the companies with &#x2013; as it relates to the unemployment.</p>
          <p>And in this case what I have to do, do not take question about the costs in the hospitals and in doctor, and any stakeholders in general, to maintain our margin, maintain our combined ratio. Was it insurance on health? We have four million of insured, is a very huge portfolio to put pressure in and above the costs. The same answer in terms of cards. Our portfolio today is around 1,300,000 cards issued by us. But of course, it would be reduced in terms of revenues because the question would be affected in our industry. In this case what I have to do, the same answer, in health and it puts pressure on the costs because the claims, which relate to the premiums, which I sold in the last year are the competitive provision. The prices would be calculated in that &#x2013; what's happening in terms of fraud. I don't think it would be &#x2013; increase the frauds because most part of our clients are clients of the banking, which have a lot of products with us.</p>
          <p>In terms of life, I think it would be &#x2013; they increase a little bit lower than in 2008. I would say to you in terms of general, of course, the price will be affected in the insurance industry, but this has a huge opportunity to increase the penetration in our client base because it's lower today in terms of P&amp;C, in terms of health, we can increase a little bit more.</p>

          <p>So you think that your loss ratios or your combined ratios, should they be similar overall to what you had in 2008?</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Ian Smith with Nevsky Capital.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just wanted to ask for some guidance on three areas where we don't tend to get formal guidance or at least just a sense of where you think things are going. Firstly, on tax, whether you think the underlying tax rate will be similar in 2009 to 2008? I sort of also whether you will be able to continue to create tax credits for the additional social contributions through the year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on deposit growth, where do you think that could lie and what kind of mix do you think next year? Is it likely that we'll have lower cost deposits growing faster again as rates comes off? And then finally, just on other operating expenses, through the year and also through the last quarter, the growth was quite considerable. Is there a likelihood that the growth rate will moderate significantly going forward? And can you give us a sense of what happened in the fourth quarter, why that number was quite high? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you repeat quickly, Ian, the question number two and three. I just got the first one. The second was the mix of what? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the first question on tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question on deposit growth, but also deposit mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the third question was on other operating expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Look, in terms of the tax rates, probably we should see a tax rate closer to 30% as a guidance that I believe would be &#x2013; interest would be after tax for you. In terms of the deposit mix, there was a very huge deposit mix change because the crisis was so strong that it affected the equities and some multi-market funds, but as people moved to deposits, fall to savings deposits. I believe it will be difficult to have further changes so strong in terms of the mix because most of the prices are at least in the expectation of most of the price was already affected. So we should not see so much changes in the deposit mix over time.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the rates of other operating expenses and revenues, if we look at what happened over these last periods, you can see that the net effect of other operating revenues minus expenses has been over the last, I would say, four quarters, around the one even reais negative mark, a little bit less in the third quarter of '08, and a little bit more in the second quarter of '08. But relatively speaking, this has been close to one billion. So you can basically continue to have this minus one billion over the coming quarters as a guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just on deposits, would you be happy to give us a sense of how deposits might grow? Are they likely to grow in line with loan growth next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. Definitively more demand for loans will impact on more need of funding and then they're very linked, those two things, less effect. Although we have a very large liquidity, a very large working capital, but no money, what happens is that the more demand for loans the more funding needs. They should be relatively in line with those two aspects.</p>
