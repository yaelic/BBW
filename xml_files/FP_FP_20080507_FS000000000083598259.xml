          <p>Ladies and gentlemen welcome to TOTAL's First Quarter 2008 Results Conference Call.  I now hand over to Mr. Robert Castaigne, Chief Financial Officer.  Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Hello and thank you for calling in.  I met with most of you a few months ago in February.  And since then it has been a very busy and interesting time.  The evolution of the macro environment has been noteworthy.  This is quite an understatement.</p>
          <p>Operationally, many of you may have noticed the acceleration of activity around our major company operated growth projects with Dalia and Rosa on stream. Block 17 in Angola is producing more than 530,000 barrels per day.  Dolphin has reached its plateau of 2 billion cubic feet per day of 500,000 barrel of oil equivalent per day including the decrease at the end of March, a few months ahead of schedule.  Moho-Bilondo has started up one month ahead of schedule and we expect Jura to start up on time within a few weeks.</p>
          <p>In terms of our track record in project management we have been very successful.  It is, of course, frustrating that we had a technical shutdown at Elgin-Franklin that has obscured some of this performance.  Clearly we are very focused on delivering our projects in line with targets.</p>
          <p>In addition to the operational news, I am sure that you have seen our first quarter results.  We had yet another very good quarter.  Compared to the first year last year &#x2013; to the first quarter last year, adjusted net income increased by 24% to $4.9 billion. Adjusted EPS set a new record at $2.16 per share, an increase of 26%; and the business segments ROACE for the first 12 months was very strong at 28%.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash flow compared to last year, adjusted cash flow increased by 20% to $6.5 billion while net investment was $3.7 billion in the first quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>These results show that the upstream is well leveraged to high crude oil prices, particularly due to the strong underlying growth and the quality of the portfolio.  Cyclical weakness in the downstream and chemicals had a moderate impact, thanks mainly to the resilience of our marketing and specialties businesses.  It is important to keep in mind the order of magnitude of this segment.</p>
          <p>The adjusted net operating income from the upstream segment increased by $1.5 billion year-on-year and this far outweighs the $0.5 billion decrease in the downstream segment and the $0.1 billion decrease in the chemicals.</p>
          <p>Now, I will briefly comment this segment of activity. In the upstream, the most important story here is level of activity and the implications for future goals.  I've already mentioned Dolphin, Moho-Bilondo and Jura.  The Yemen LNG and Akpo are both on track to start up in the coming winter.  In terms of future projects, we made the final investment decision to launch two giant company operated offshore feeds over the past few months, Pazflor in Angola and Usan in Nigeria.</p>
          <p>We launched the redevelopment of Anguille in Gabon.  We've launched the FEED for Shtokman and for the upgrader in Canada.  And we're studying a second, very substantial development on the same permit as Moho-Bilondo, called <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>In addition, we launched a targeted acquisition in Canada to strengthen our position among the key players in the heavy oil business.  This is a pace of development activity that is unmatched by our peers.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the quarter, production was 2.43 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is comparable to year ago.  The first quarter 2008 was affected by an unscheduled shutdown of Elgin-Franklin that lasted for close to one month in February and had an impact of about 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.</p>
          <p>There were also elements that affected our reported production, mainly some price effect had an impact of about minus 2% and this demonstrates that as the oil price increases, the sensitivity of OPEC volumes decreases.  This price effect was mostly offset by the absence of OPEC reductions. And there were also some changes in the portfolio, notably the termination of the concession in Dubai and the asset swap in Angola.  Adjusting for these items, the underlying growth was close to 3% year-over-year, driven mainly by higher production that started up in 2007.</p>
          <p>On the subject of Sincor, this is now a mixed company called PetroCedeno.  Our 47% interest in Sincor was deconsolidated at the end of 2007 and our 30.3% share of PetroCedeno has been treated as an equity affiliate since January 1.  As a compensation for the 17% dilution, we have recorded the receivable and we receive additional production to offset the receivable. Depending on oil prices we expect to receive these additional productions for all of 2008 and part of 2009.</p>
          <p>Overall, as we have indicated in the past, the net impact on the first quarter production was more or less neutral with the compensation received in kind offsetting the impact of the 17% dilution.</p>
          <p>As a general comment on production, our major projects are performing globally as expected.  In the second quarter, we should enjoy the benefit of Dolphin at plateau, the start-up of Moho-Bilondo and the first production from Jura.</p>
          <p>Maintenance and technical shutdowns are expected to be comparable to last year including the impact of the Al Jurf's shutdown in Libya.  So we are confident of our ability to grow this year and the years ahead.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of oil prices, TOTAL was one of the first major oil companies to take the position that energy prices have moved into a structurally higher range and, while a certain amount of volatility in either of the direction would not surprise us, we continue to believe that the supply of oil will remain tight relative to demand.  The Brent price averaged about $97 per barrel, an increase of 67% compared to the first quarter 2007. For the same period our average realized price or liquids increased by 65% nearly to $91 per barrel.</p>
          <p>Our average realized gas prices in the first quarter was $6.7 per billion Btu, an increase of 17%, which reflects some improvement in the North Sea as well as higher Asian LNG prices.  But in contrast, this also includes the impact of low price guidance from Dolphin.  Our average realized, hydrocarbon price increased by 49% in the first quarter.  Adjusted net operating income from the upstream segment increased by 59% to $4.1 billion, thanks to the higher realized prices, and the underlying production growth.  On a per barrel basis, adjusted net operating income for the upstream segment increased by 58% to close to $19 per barrel.  This is a large increase, and it reflects the growing strength, and sensitivity of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>You may have noticed that the equity affiliates line increased by about $0.2 billion to more than $0.4 billion in the first quarter of 2008. This increase is partially due to the addition of PetroCedeno, and also to the growth of our LNG affiliates. The upstream ROACE was 38%, and continues to be among the highest in the peer group.  By the way, we recently benchmarked TOTAL against the other supermajors using the 2007 FAS 69 data.</p>
          <p>We found that TOTAL continues to rank as best in class for technical growth with $5 per barrel of oil equivalent, competitive advantage, compared to the average of our peers in 2007.  So, looking ahead, to what appears to be an even stronger environment in 2008, we are confident that we are pursuing the right strategy and that we have the best teams to execute it.  Don't say, no.  When we look at the evolution of refining margins, it is clear that we began the first quarter at low level and build up from there. January averaged about $15 per ton and by March we were up to $52 per ton.  In April, refining margins were quite good an average $43 per ton.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the first quarter, on one hand gasoline margins were very low due to the combination of high inventory levels and weak demand in the U.S.  On the other hand, diesel margins increased strongly during the quarter and reached record levels in April.  In fact, the diesel margins have been largely responsible for the recovery in global refining margins.</p>
          <p>Refining throughput in the first quarter was close to 2.4 million barrel per day, two refineries were affected by scheduled turnarounds and this also reflects this impact of the Milford Haven Refinery sale late last year.  Marketing performed reasonably well.  We saw some signs of weakening at the end of the quarter, which could be a demand response to higher prices but it is a bit early, too early to say.  Adjusted net operating income from the downstream were close to $0.4 billion compared to 0.8 in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Some of you may have noticed the very low level of income from equity affiliate this quarter.  This is due to weaker results from our affiliate in Europe and Asia.</p>
          <p>The downstream actually was 19% for the first 12-months, which is good.  We've been very busy in the downstream for the new developments.  We have approved $2.2 billion modernization program for the Port Arthur refinery in the Gulf of Mexico, which includes a new coker and this work has already started.</p>
          <p>Construction is also in progress for the new decentralization unit at the Lindsey refinery in the U.K. and the Leuna refinery in Germany.  And together with our partner Saudi Aramco, we expect to approve the Jubail refinery project very soon.</p>
          <p>Our equity share of the operating cash flow from these four projects could reach about $900 million per year into the next decade, when they are all operating at full capacity.  In the second quarter, refinery throughput was affected by the completion of two scheduled partial turnarounds at the Normandy and Grandpuits refineries.</p>
          <p>In addition, there is a scheduled turnaround at Leuna refinery starting this month that will last for about seven weeks.  And overall, as I've said for the second quarter we have reasons to expect refining margins to be stronger.</p>
          <p>Into the Chemicals now. Adjusted net operating income from the Chemical segment was about $277 million in the first quarter of 2008, compared to 126 in the first quarter of 2007 and 366 in the first quarter of 2007.  More than 60% of the first quarter result was held by the specialty chemicals, which was essentially flat.  So, the improvement comes from Base Chemicals.</p>
          <p>In line with the trend in petrochemicals margin, the Base Chemicals bounced back from very poor first quarter that remained well below the level of the first quarter.  Demand level have been less than strong and naphtha prices have remained high with the combined effect been continued pressure on cracker and polymer margins.</p>
          <p>Specialties have shown good resilience in the phase of weakening dollar and slowing economies goes in to the U.S. and more recently in Europe.  Even in this environment our chemicals held up reasonably well, but it is difficult to be very enthusiastic.</p>
          <p>Corporate now. The remaining &#x20AC;1.07 per share of the 2007 dividend should be approved at the May 16th AGM and paid out on May 23.  This would represent a return to shareholders of about $3.7 billion.  Our full year dividend would have increased by about 27% in dollars.  We have expressed a clear preference for dividends, order buybacks and we believe that increasing the dividend is clearly the strongest signal we can send to show our confidence in the company's future.  Having said that, through the first four months of this year we bought back about 10 million shares for close to $0.8 billion.  So giving was 21% at the end of the first quarter.  This should increase a little after we pay the final dividend in May and we will continue to use our buyback as a tool to further adjust the giving as we did.</p>
          <p>On the investment side, we are in line with our full year estimate of $19 billion.  Our operated developments are on talk and this is a key to our growth profile for the coming years.</p>
          <p>So I'm confident that TOTAL will perform very well because of this strong portfolio and also because of this very strong cut share that we are here which is evident in the disciplined approach to investment decisions and also in the excellent track record that we are for project managements.</p>
          <p>As a last word before we go to your questions, I would like to take this opportunity to let all of you know that I will be retiring from TOTAL by the end of May, after the shareholder meeting.  So next conference call in August will be managed by Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re, who is currently the Deputy CFO and will become CFO the 1st of June. For myself, it has been an honor to play a role in the transformation of TOTAL into one of the world's largest major oil companies and it has been a pleasure to work with many of you over the years.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, I have a great deal of confidence in the company heading to new teams that we lead it.  Naturally I plan to remain a large shareholder of the company. That is also one of my skill.  So I plan to follow the stock price very closely and will therefore continue reading your research reports for many years to come.</p>
          <p>And with that, let's go to the Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>[Operator Instruction]</p>
          <p>We have the first question from Mr. Neil McMahon [Sanford C. Bernstein].  Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi and good luck, Robert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Neil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions really.  Well, the first is in the refining site in Europe.  You did mention that European margins on the oil block, especially with your planned turnarounds, look reasonably good in the second quarter.  Is there any specific demand you could highlight in terms of diesel looking at the European sales data for both diesel and gasoline, it's not looking that great, but is there something very specific to diesel demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  I think traditionally, we have an increase &#x2013; seasonable increase of the diesel demand in the second and third quarter of the year in Europe.  And I think that this should be at the origin of the recovery of the European refining margins.  In addition to that, one reason of the relatively low level of the refining margin in Europe for the first quarter was also due to the low level of the gasoline demand in the U.S.  And finally, in addition to that, you know that in the refining margin, there is also a convergent element, which is correlated, which is linked to the level of the oil price, which is now higher than it was before, so I think it's all these three elements that make us relatively confident about good level of the refining margins for the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question really in terms of other companies who have seen significant share price movements associated with exploration wells and can you highlight the key exploration wells you see this year that TOTAL is drilling that you would feel could be very influential to the future portfolio of the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's always difficult to speak it on our future results, especially as we are still at the relatively beginning of the year and first I can say that we have a few interesting news in the pipe, but we have to wait a little before seeing something more and as to the area where we should have interesting results there is especially, I would say as usual Angola and Nigeria, but also we shouldn't forget the North Sea, in the UK especially.  To say that if this could have an impact on the share price quite frankly, I would be more cautious, but again the policy of the company, as you know is to continue to have &#x2013; to be very active in exploration with expenses for 2007 that should amount to 1.7 of '08, $1.8 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a really last quick one from me, is there an update on Synenco in Canada?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Synenco in Canada, you know that we have launched the takeover on the company.  This is clearly a good prospect for the &#x2013; it's a good prospect, no it's good reserves for the future.  We think that if we are successful with this operation, it should be an interesting way for us to enlarge our regional base of the oil in Canada.  So I think it's for the preparation of the future, we think that it was a good opportunity to try to catch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will refer to a reasonable price and we are now to wait till the end of the operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Jason Kenney from ING.  Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Robert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>May I also wish you all the best for your retirement after you have had such a remarkable career.  I've got two short questions.  Firstly, are you able to quantify the compensation in kind from Venezuela in the first quarter?  And then secondly, I am not sure &#x2013; are you able to separate out the return on capital employed for the LNG contribution from the E&amp;P division, that's more just to give us a steer on how profitable that LNG business is for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as to &#x2013; for the, you know that the compensation globally should amount to little above $800 million which means that we should receive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, hello...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, concerning -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What happened?  Hello, do you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>I do yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so I continue.  Concerning the compensation that we've received time for the first, I don't think that it would have closed finally by the end of the quarter.  Frankly speaking it should be 8, but I don't think that we've had something for the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>And second question, on LNG activity, we do not distinguish our LNG operation as a separate segment of activity.  I'd say that the type of profitability that we've now is more or less comparable average upstream or achieve, because I think that this LNG project have now a strong advantage as most of them were negotiated before we launched when the cost were lower.  So, on average, the profitability is about the same, and if I look at the new project that we have launched over the last one or two years, I think the profitability were totally in line with the best of our same project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thanks, and all the best.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Robert.  Two questions, one on Canada, one on your downstream.  On Canada, on Synenco, I think, can you just give us a little bit of color on the sort of timing towards likely completion of that transaction?  And then also maybe a little bit of insight into how you see it fitting into your existing portfolio?  Would you sort of develop it concurrently with the wood-jumping prospect or sort of in line so you are moving people backwards and forwards from the two projects?  And then, the second is on the downstream. It's my impression and you can correct me if I'm wrong, is that &#x2013; I take the points about China and Cepsa is that the downstream earnings were a little light against what your traditional sort of relationship with the TLCV margin would be.  Is there anything in the businesses that we can't see and the business &#x2013; a little bit weaker in the quarter, the trading perhaps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, trading &#x2013; the results of the trading was at the first quarter of 2008 little lower than the &#x2013; than what it was one year before when we had the result of operating where that was particularly good.  In addition to that few foreign exchange losses traditionally in the upstream.  We try to cover everything but we're having that traditionally a little long in dollars and I speak of the commercial position and we had a small foreign exchange losses.  So it's a mix of several things. Clearly, the performance of our Spanish operation, we're back in China trading and small foreign exchange loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As a full element, this have to be mentioned, we could have imagined to have also a higher performance in some of our refineries, but it's life and it's also that we have had some certain small technical issues, but nothing specific to say about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On Synenco just some of your comments...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>The timing of the closing is 35 to 60 days after the opening of the offer, and in fact it's difficult to be more precise because this depends on some administrative approvals. Having said that, it cannot be over 60 days, because I think that after a certain period of time, if we have not received the approval, we have to consider that it is given.  So, I think the maximum is 60 days. The only point is that I don't know &#x2013; I don't remember, when it should open. In fact, it should open at the end of this week.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, Robert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of quick questions on volumes. If you could just clarify perhaps the impact of any loss of volumes from Nigeria in the quarter? And then secondly, for &#x2013; in terms of Q2, could you just sort of quantify perhaps what you think the relative delta will be in terms of maintenance versus Q1?  And finally, I know you've been quite adamant in terms of not giving an explicit number in terms of volume growth for this year, but I want to know whether you could perhaps confirm it sort of $100 oil or even today's prices whether you expect absolute growth from the portfolio?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Concerning the volumes in Nigeria if you refer especially to the shutdowns that we had with SPDC, in fact I think that we had a very small recovery; something like 4,000 barrel of oil equivalent for our share, that we had in the first quarter 2008 compared to the first quarter 2007.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, I think that we continue with Shell to recover part of the production that was shut down, but this is a process which is relatively long, especially to the safety difficulties that we continue to have in the region.  Having said that, on the political side, I understood that some progress were made between the government and representatives of the region.  And we can be reasonably optimistic; I think that that is still a difficult area.</p>
          <p>The second question concerning more specifically the production and the turnarounds that we could have, globally speaking, I think that if we take into account in 2008, the shutdown of Elgin/Franklin in Alg&#xE9;rie that of course, we are not scheduled, including the maintenance, I think we should have a global effect for 2008, comparable that the one we had in 2007.  And as to the sensitivity of our production to the oil price, I think, it is something like &#x2013; it is now relatively small; something between 1 and 2,000 barrel of oil equivalent per day, per dollar per barrel.</p>
          <p>And finally, just to give you a flavor of what we think our production should grow in 2008, clearly, our production should grow even if we remain with 100, $120 per barrel and if we take into account the shutdowns that we mentioned with Elgin, with Al Jurf and in fact, this will &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> growth, the production from Dalia, Rosa, and Dolphin.  Dolphin that has already reached the plateau; Moho Bilondo in Congo has just started up; and we are also about to start-up production on Jura.</p>
          <p>So, I think globally speaking, our production should grow. It's difficult to be more specific now, given some uncertainty and I must say that in the past, we have missed some of our targets.  We are now extremely cautious but I remain optimistic, especially with the global trend of our production and this target that we are fixed between 2006 and '10 assuming $60 per barrel, that is to say 4%.  And if we move from 60 to 100, it should be something of a round figure <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon.  Just a follow on question perhaps on the volume sort of issue. You said the sensitivity is becoming less pronounced in a high oil price environment. What happens to the acceleration perhaps of the cost recovery, on things like Dalia and Rosa in a high price environment?  Are we still looking at a 2010 sort of timeline in terms of those step changes in entitlement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes. In fact, the point is that the <mark type="inaudible" /> for example, we have already reached the highest threshold.  So even if it moves to $200 per barrel, it will change nothing.  And by the way, this is why as part of our PSC productions are becoming now relatively old compared to some of our peers that we have no sensitivity, which is lower than it is, if I understand well from some of our peers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what about the other sort of flower fields within Angola and when do they move out of cost recovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rosa and Dalia, I think we are now at &#x2013; in terms of shareholder profit, at the highest level.  So, I think it's 80%. And the reduction of interest in the profit oil will decline very progressively, and I think that we should move from 80 to 40. 40, that should be reached something in 2010 assuming that we remain with the type of oil price that we have now.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Colin Smith from Dresdner Kleinwort.  Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Robert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Colin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a couple of questions.  Just on the $900 million you mentioned for I think profits Jubail and Port Arthur. Can you just sort of confirm that's what it was and whether that's pre- or post-tax and also maybe just comment on where you think Jubail costs have got to &#x2013; sort of the technical presses talking about sort of $12 billion and after for that unit.  That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second thing was just on Yemen LNG, can you just clarify how the <mark type="inaudible" /> part of that works since, as I understand it, TOTAL doesn't have an interest position in the acreage from which the gas will come for the feet supply.</p>
          <p>And the third question was just on Synenco again, I just wondered whether the partnership with Sinopec played any role in your desire to become involved in that project in terms of improving your relationship with them perhaps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, I will start with the last question.  We have good relationships with Sinopec, and I think that if we are successful with the takeover, we should be able to develop together a good and fruitful joint venture.  So I think Sinopec is clearly aware of our expertise with the production of the oil and also with the upgrading.  And I think &#x2013; I do not anticipate any difficulty with our partner &#x2013; potential partner in this joint venture.</p>
          <p>After that, you asked a question concerning the origin of the $900 million cash flow after tax; that we expect for the long-term from our project <mark type="inaudible" />, Jubail, Leuna and into oil refineries; HDS in these two refinery.  I think clearly, the bulk, especially if we refer to the level of the CapEx, will be &#x2013; will come from Port Arthur where we have 100%, and from Jubail where we have 37% in the bulk. For us to give the breakdown between Port Arthur and Jubail, I think you will accept that I do not enter into too much detail.</p>
          <p>And then U.S. production &#x2013; the involvement, if I understood well, of the supply of gas of Yemen LNG, may I suggest, I think that we have taken some participations in exploration permits with review there that seemed to be very attractive for potential production of gas and it is clear that if these successes are confirmed, that this additional productions, of course, could be good for our Yemen LNG project, but may I suggest that you call our Investor Relations team in order to have a bit more detail especially on the positions that we have acquired in the Yemen to increase our production of gas especially.</p>

          <p>Could you clarify because there was some technical interruption the comment you made regarding the compensation received in volume terms in the first quarter pursuant to the Sincor divestiture and whether that is included in your equity production number in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the quarter in fact I think, I have the precise figure here. The impact for the first quarter was 18,000 barrel per day.  I mean for the production that we received in kind no, no, no, the dilution.  The compensation that we received represented 18,000 barrels per day for the first quarter.  So, I'd say that it was extremely low &#x2013; it is in fact 18,000 barrel per day.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, it's just cheaper pay &#x2013; we have reserved the capacity and it is &#x2013; delivery of pay obligations that we have locked in, yes.  And we've not given any additional support and this obligation represent about 1 billion cubic feet per day approximately, and all that's all. We've not given any additional support and we think that we shouldn't have any difficulty to saturate this commitment that we've taken for the long time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is an issue and we've some discussions in order to see how we could have access to part of this production especially in order to supply our networks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My final question relates to Indonesia, I believe that you have recently made a commitment to increase your production and fee to the Bontang facility there.  I wonder if you could quantify the extent to which your supply will be increasing as a result of recent decisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't see what you mean.  What I can say is that it's true that in the past we have had the possibility to supply the Bontang plant.  In addition to our own theoretical share in order to offset part of the volumes that our partners we are not able to supply to the plant, but I think that's all. I don't think that we have taken as far as we are concerned additional commitments for the future.</p>
          <p>Well, what I can say for the future is that we are totally comfortable to take out share of the different packages that we'll have for us in the coming years, but I think that the issue is not for our supply.  It is more for the part of the supply of the plant, that should come from some of their company.  So in the past not only we are comfortable, but we were able to supply above our own share, but for the future we are comfortable for our own share to supply more I think that we will have to see.  But I don't think that we have taken any additional obligation recently.</p>

          <p>I have a number of questions.  First of all on EMPS. Affiliates obviously the profit is up very substantially over 100 million year-on-year as this is the first quarter of the consolidating Sincor, could you give us an idea of how much of that increase was...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are right, in fact the increase is due first to Sincor which is now an equity affiliate.  And then to the increase of share especially in our LNG project in Nigeria and Qatargas, what is the breakdown in the increase, I wouldn't want to enter into too much detail but from the <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; this is the expedition.</p>

          <p>Okay.  My second question concerns corporate charges.  The corporate operating charges, the corporate operating charge in the quarter 142 million, its up 40% year-on-year which seems unusual, was there something unusual in that number this quarter?</p>

Irene, I wouldn't want to lose too much time because it is extremely difficult especially sequentially &#x2013; I lost my paper.  But especially a decrease &#x2013; well this reduction it comes for the first quarter 2008 essentially from an increase in fiscal debts that was pretty high and that was partly compensated by the increase of payable due to higher prices.</p>

          <p>When &#x2013; It's clear that when there is an increase in oil price usually there is also an increase of the debt that we've on average, I know it varies a lot from one quarter to another to the tax authorities.  But in front of that of course the payable of our customers' increases also and the net of that explains the working capital decrease by &#x20AC;600 billion in the first quarter 2008.  What is also difficult is part of the working capital is due to the CapEx and especially last year we had strong reduction of the working capital that was linked to the strong increase of the CapEx in E&amp;P.  So, I think if we want it's a bit difficult to be all that detailed but globally speaking for the first quarter keep in mind that this is a result of the increase of fiscal debt minus the impact of higher prices with our customers.</p>
