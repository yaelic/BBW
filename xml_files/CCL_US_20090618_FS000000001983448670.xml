          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by. And welcome to the Carnival Corporation second quarter earnings conference call. During this presentation, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded on Thursday, June 18th, 2009.</p>
          <p>It's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Howard Frank, Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer at Carnival Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. This is Howard Frank speaking and I, together with Micky Arison, are here in Genoa, Italy, having just taken delivery of the new Seabourn Odyssey a few hours ago and I'm at Costa's offices &#x2013; Costa Cruise Lines offices and Pier Luigi Foschi, the Chairman and CEO of Costa and our European &#x2013; Continental European companies &#x2013; cruise companies is here on the call with us. In Miami, David Bernstein, our CFO is there together with Beth Roberts, our VP of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>I will turn the call over to David to give you the color on the second quarter financial results and then David will toss it back to me, and I will give you some comments on what the outlook looks like. David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Howard. I will begin the conference call by reading the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will make certain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties or other factors which may cause the actual results, performances or achievements of Carnival to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied, by such forward-looking statements. For further information, please see Carnival's earnings press release and its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, our earnings per share were $0.33 versus $0.49 for the prior year. The second quarter came in above the mid-point of our March guidance by $0.02 a share. This was driven by a variety of cost-saving measures, timing of certain SG&amp;A expenses and reduced fuel consumption which benefited us to the tune of $0.05 as a result of tight cost controls and cost-saving initiatives. While better than expected pricing on close-in bookings benefited us to the tune of $0.03.</p>
          <p>All of this was partially offset by higher fuel prices costing $0.02, the impact from disruption of our Mexican cruises in response to the CDC's recommendation against non-essential travel to Mexico due to the flu, which cost us $0.03 and a shortfall from expectations in net onboard and other revenue yields that cost us about a penny.</p>
          <p>Overall for the second quarter, our total revenue yields came in toward the lower end of the range, down 9.8% in constant dollars versus March guidance of down 8 to 10%, driven primarily by the impact of the flu. Given the uncertain times and the flu disruption, I think our operating companies did an excellent job beating our guidance.</p>
          <p>Looking at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year: our capacity increased 5.9% for the second quarter of 2009 with the majority of the increase, once again, going to our European brands. Our European brands grew 8% while our North American brands grew 4.2%. Also during the second quarter, Costa Asia doubled in size as Costa Classica joined Costa Allegra in China.</p>
          <p>As I previously mentioned, overall net revenue yields in local currency declined 9.8% in the second quarter versus the prior year. Now let's look at the two components of net revenue yields. For net ticket yields, we saw a yield decline of 10% in local currency. Our North American brands were down 14%, driven primarily by declines in Alaska, Europe and not surprisingly Mexico due in large part to the CDC travel restrictions relating to the flu. However, yields in the Caribbean and other exotic itineraries held up somewhat better in the second quarter compared to the prior year. Our European brands experienced 6% lower local currency ticket yields on higher capacity driven by declines in all itineraries.</p>
          <p>For net onboard and other yields, we reported a yield decline of 9.4% in local currency. We saw declines in most of our brands around the world, a trend which we had anticipated. Net onboard and other yields and our European brands were down less than our North American brands, similar to our experience in net ticket revenue yields. Net onboard yields in all major categories: bar, casino, shore ex [excursions], shops, photo and spa were down in the second quarter versus the prior year.</p>
          <p>In summary, you should note that while the second quarter net revenue yields were down almost 10%, they still benefited from some strong pricing on bookings taken prior to the start of the financial crisis last fall. As we look forward to the back half of 2009, all of which was essentially booked after the start of the financial crisis, you can expect to see slightly larger yield declines as the back half of the year feels the full brunt of the recession and is impacted by the seasonal deployments in Alaska and Europe.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, our cruise cost per available lower berth day excluding fuel and in local currency for the second quarter were up 1% driven by the $24 million increase in dry-dock expense this year versus the prior year which was due to more vessels being in dry-dock. However, the best measure of cruise costs are on an annual basis, and I will touch upon that in a moment.</p>
          <p>Fuel prices this quarter were 43% lower, saving us $180 million, or $0.22 per share. Our fuel consumption per available lower berth day this quarter declined 6%, saving us $27 million, or $0.03 per share. As a result of numerous conservation measures, we've been seeing two to 3% fuel efficiencies per year for a number of years now. The stepped-up focus in this area has benefited us through the whole first half of 2009 with an even larger decline in fuel consumption.</p>
          <p>While currency movements have reduced our costs for the second quarter, overall currency was a negative drag on our earnings of approximately $55 million, or $0.07 per share, as the dollar strengthened versus the euro and the sterling.</p>
          <p>Before I turn to the outlook, I'd like to say a few words about liquidity. At the end of the second quarter pro-forma for the recent loan signing, we had $4.8 billion of liquidity. This included 1.7 available on our revolver, 232 million of cash excluding cash on hand, 200 million of committed bank term loans, &#x20AC;550 million of commitments from the European Investment Bank and 1.9 billion of export credits, two export credits remaining for 2009 and one per year for '10, '11 and '12.</p>
          <p>Since the March conference call, we've completed six financings worth 1.7 billion. Two Italian export credits for 2009 worth 570 million, one for Costa Pacifica and one for the Seabourn Odyssey which we drew this morning upon delivery. We also had the European Investment Bank loan which was mentioned in the press release for &#x20AC;550 million and we did three bank facilities worth $350 million. As I mentioned on our last conference call, the Italian export credits for Costa Pacifica and Seabourn Odyssey completed our financing needs for 2009, and we are now on target to complete the rest of our financing needs by the end of September for 2010.</p>
          <p>I will skip the net revenue outlook as Howard will discuss that in a few moments, and I just wanted to touch on our cruise cost outlook for the year. Cruise costs per available lower berth day for the full year, excluding fuel and in local currency are projected to be in line with the prior year, up just about 0.3%.</p>
          <p>During the March conference call, I said that while we were happy that we were expecting to have another year of essentially flat costs, we would not rest there and we didn't. Our operating companies managed to find additional opportunities worth $33 million in lower costs excluding fuel price and currency, bringing the total savings since the December guidance to $150 million. Based on the current spot price for fuel, fuel prices for the full year are projected to be $353 per metric ton for 2009 versus $558 per metric ton in 2008, saving us $660 million.</p>
          <p>In addition, FX rates have moved from a 2008 average of euro 1.49 and GBP 1.90 to 2009 guidance of euro 1.37 to GBP 1.54. In the end, fuel and currency are driving our costs down. So in current dollars and including fuel, our costs are expected to be down 12 to 14%. While the FX rate movement reduces our costs, it also reduces our revenue. Given these FX rates, the year-over-year profit impact from currency is expected to be a reduction in the bottom line of $175 million, or $0.22 per share.</p>
          <p>As fuel and currency are big factors affecting our 2009 results, I wanted to share with you some of the current rules of thumb about the impact of exchange rates and fuel prices on our 2009 results. To start with, a 10% change in price of fuel represents approximately 110 million, or $0.14 per impact for the full year on our P&amp;L. The 10% impact in fuel obviously moves along with the price of fuel.</p>
          <p>With respect to FX movement, a 10% change in all currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&amp;L by approximately $130 million, or $0.16 per share. Fortunately for us, FX and fuel items have generally moved in opposite directions acting to some extent as natural hedges of each other.</p>
          <p>At this point, I will turn the call back over to Howard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. To start this morning, I would like to mention that given the challenges during 2009, it's been gratifying to see the Carnival business model holding up so well during perhaps what is the most significant slowdown in the world economy in our lifetimes. The positive take-away for us during this historically significant period is that the strategy of attractively pricing our cruise vacations in order to maintain our high levels of occupancy has continued to enable us to attract new customers and to achieve solid profit and margins.</p>
          <p>Also during 2009, we have further steps to reduce operating and shoreside costs, which David discussed, which will continue to benefit us into future periods. So as we emerge from this global economic slowdown, we believe we will be a far stronger and more profitable business than before.</p>
          <p>Before I move on to my quarterly comments, I'd also like to touch upon our strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet with high levels of liquidity. This has enabled us to successfully navigate through this very difficult economic environment which, as you know, also included the bank liquidity crisis and the freezing of the credit markets. Our low leverage ratios and solid investment grade rating provides us with the ability access credit facilities at costs considerably below current capital market rates as David talked about the various financings that we have accomplished during the last several months, and that gives us maximum flexibility also as we emerge from the recession.</p>
          <p>Now to the booking environment. Since the beginning of this year, our booking volumes for the back half of the year have been running approximately 16% ahead of 2008 volumes and as we indicated in our press release, since March the booking volumes are running 26% ahead of last year. Of course these bookings have been at lower price points which I will comment on later. So despite the soft economy and rising rates of unemployment in North America and Europe, we seem to have found a price point that incentivizes the consumer to book a cruise vacation. With these strong bookings, prices are beginning to show signs of improvement for certain of our itineraries which is encouraging.</p>
          <p>Looking separately at our North American cruise brands we are seeing a modest improvement in pricing for our premium products, however, pricing for contemporary cruises have suffered because of the flu-related travel restrictions to Mexico. In that regard, we have restarted our sailings to Mexico this month and except for initial disruptions, Mexican itinerary booking volumes continue to be strong and we expect that pricing for Mexican cruises will strengthen over time. As to our European brands, pricing has held steady and there appears to have been very little fallout from the flu issue in Europe.</p>
          <p>As we indicated in the press release, the main factors affecting our earnings guidance for the year include fuel which is now forecasted at $353 per ton versus $279 a ton in our prior guidance. This higher than previously forecasted fuel cost amounts to $0.29 a share and the strengthening of the euro and sterling kind of offset that by a favorable $0.06 per share. While the impact of the flu on our Mexican deployments was a negative $0.10 a share on yields, it was largely offset by better than expected revenue yields for other deployments which was $0.14 a share, and we expect a further $0.04 savings on costs for the year.</p>
          <p>So the sum of total on these items, if you can follow all that, nets out to $0.15 per share and a new guidance range for 2009 of $2.00 to $2.10 a share which is down from our previous guidance of $2.10 to $2.30.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the next three quarters: for our third quarter, our fleetwide capacity is 5.6% higher than a year ago. 3.8% in North America and 7.4% in Europe. At this time, fleetwide occupancy for the third quarter is running behind a year ago with pricing substantially lower.</p>
          <p>For our North American brands, third quarter capacity breaks down as follows. Alaska is 28% of our capacity with Europe at 19%, the Caribbean at 36%, and the balance in various other itineraries. Pricing for our North American brands is lower across all itineraries with the steepest decline in our Alaska programs. Mexican Riviera cruise pricing is also considerably lower because of the impact of the flu on Mexican itineraries. European itinerary pricing for North American brands is lower, but not as low as originally anticipated as a result of recently stronger booking demand for European cruises. And Caribbean pricing is lower also in part affected by those Caribbean itineraries which call on Mexican ports.</p>
          <p>Occupancy through our North American brands at this stage are lower year-over-year for our Caribbean, Mexican Riviera and Alaska itineraries and slightly higher at this point for our European itineraries. We expect that North American brand revenue yield will be lower in the double digit range by the time the third quarter closes.</p>
          <p>For our European brands in the third quarter, pricing is lower year-over-year but our European brands have not suffered the steep pricing declines we've experienced in North America. Our continental European brands, Costa and AIDA, have lower pricing with yields expected to be down in the single digit range by the time the quarter closes. Our U.K. brand yields are expected to be only slightly lower at the quarter close. Our Spanish brand, Ibero Cruises, has suffered the steepest decline in yield because of the very weak Spanish economy. But fortunately, this is a small part of our European brand portfolio. Overall, we expect European brand pricing to be lower in the single digit range, by the time third quarter closes. As we indicated in the press release, we expect overall revenue yields for the third quarter, on a local currency basis, to be 14 to 16% lower year-over-year and earnings per share for the quarter is expected to be in the $1.15 to $1.19 range.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Spanish brand, let me just comment on the Spanish brand, Ibero Cruises. Despite the currently weak Spanish economy, we do believe in the long term future of the Spanish brand. In fact, we've entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 25% minority interest in Ibero for &#x20AC;23 million and have made a number of changes &#x2013; recently made a number of changes in the organization in order to further integrate Ibero into the Costa group in Europe.</p>
          <p>We have also recently moved a senior Costa executive to Madrid to manage the company and have brought in several new executives to Ibero to support his efforts which is already beginning to yield very positive results. So long term, we are going to be in Spain and we think it's going to be a very good business for us.</p>
          <p>Turning to the fourth quarter, fourth quarter fleetwide capacity is up 7.6%, 5.7% in North America and 9.4% for our European brands. Fleetwide occupancies are running behind year-ago numbers and year-over-year pricing is lower, but on a relative basis, better than third quarter pricing.</p>
          <p>For North American brands capacity breaks down as follows: 45% is in the Caribbean, so the Caribbean, Alaska and Europe combined is 17% and long and exotic cruises are 12% with the balance in various other itineraries. North American brands, Caribbean pricing is lower but fourth quarter booking momentum versus the 2008 period has been strong. Similar to the third quarter, pricing for Alaska cruises during the shoulder period are considerably lower but Europe itinerary pricing, although lower, is holding up better than Alaska. Long and exotic cruises with the higher price points are also considerably lower than a year ago. While occupancies for North American brands fourth quarter are still lower, as a result of the strong booking volumes during the last several months we have caught up considerably and are now modestly behind in occupancies.</p>
          <p>European brand itineraries are 78% in Europe and 11% in long and exotic cruises in the fourth quarter. European brand pricing during the fourth quarter continues to be better than our U.S. brands. Although pricing for European and long and exotic cruises are lower year-over-year, the declines are not as steep as with the U.S. brands. Similar to the North American booking pattern, fourth quarter bookings in Europe continue be strong and occupancy levels, although lower than a year ago, have caught up considerably as a result of the recently strong booking patterns. Overall by the time the quarter closes, we expect fourth quarter pricing to be lower year-over-year but improving from the third quarter expected price declines.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the first quarter of 2010, this will be the first time we comment on the booking trends in the first quarter of 2010. Fleetwide capacity in the first quarter is expected to be higher by approximately 9.2%, 5.2% of that is for North American brands and 13.3% is for European brands.</p>
          <p>Booking information for the first quarter of 2010 is still in its early stages of development so I caution not to read too much into this information. Having said that, at this time we do expect to have yield declines in the first quarter of 2010. This results from year-over-year comparisons being very difficult since a good percentage of 2009 first quarter business was booked before the economy began entering into the steep recession in the third and fourth quarters of last year.</p>
          <p>From a fleetwide standpoint, while bookings at this time are below last year's levels as a result of the strong booking volumes in recent weeks we are currently tracking last year's booking levels even with the 9.2% increase in capacity in the first quarter. North American capacity for the first quarter of 2010 breaks down as follows: Caribbean is 62%' Mexican Riviera, 11%; long and exotics, approximately 16%. And all of those are approximately the same percentages as we had in last year's first quarter.</p>
          <p>North American brand occupancy and pricing across all itineraries are lower than last year. However, current pricing on booked visits is still ahead of the pricing we finished with for the first quarter of 2009. So if the strong booking momentum continues, it's possible that we could see a narrowing of the current year-over-year pricing declines.</p>
          <p>European brand pricing has, at least at this point, held up quite well and is running at approximately the same levels as last year. Although occupancies are lower than a year ago, booking momentum has been strong which is quite encouraging, but as I said earlier, it is still early in the booking window for the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>So that is the outlook for the first quarter of 2010. We'll be able to provide with you more color on the first quarter revenue picture at our next call this September.</p>
          <p>With that, operator, I will turn it back to you for questions from our callers. Thank you.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Gentlemen, our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, guys. David, I have a question for you on the EIB [European Investment Bank] loan. I was wondering if you could walk us through the structure of that: the rate, the terms, were there any guarantees? And I'm just wondering, is there any significance to starting to be able to borrow from the EIB? Will we see that again in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, the EIB loan is actually a loan that will be taken out by Costa Crociere. It actually finances a couple of their ships. The loan is &#x20AC;550 million. &#x20AC;200 million will be drawn this year, &#x20AC;200 million in 2010 for Costa's next ship, and then &#x20AC;150 million in 2011. The loans are guaranteed, of course, by the parent companies, both Carnival Corp. and Carnival Plc. It's a 15-year structure. The rate is very favorable, and as we've been achieving on all of our loans, it's very competitive and very favorable compared to the type of financing we would get in the capital markets today.</p>
          <p>This was a great opportunity. Actually this opportunity was something that came up as a result of Pier Foschi, who is there in Genoa with Micky and Howard. As a result of the credit crisis last year, we started thinking and scratching our heads about what to do as the credit markets became more difficult, and Pier came up with the idea of approaching the EIB. We have been working on this since last September.</p>
          <p>It's a very unique opportunity because, remember, the EIB is looking for projects to stimulate growth in the European economy and these ships are going to be sailing in the Med as part of the European economy. So we've been working with them since last September and we were able to finalize the loan earlier this month. Whether there are more opportunities in the future is, you know, something that we will always continue to look at as the rates are very favorable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What allowed us to do is the fact that the company is Italian owned, Italian based with Italian flags operating in the Mediterranean, so obviously the economic benefits all flow to Italy and the Mediterranean area. So it was a unique set of circumstances that may or may not be able to be repeated in the future, we don't know. But again, it was very creatively put together and with the help of Costa and Fincantieri and the EIB, we were able to get it done, and the Italian representative to the EIB was very &#x2013; played a very important role.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then just my second and final question is, Micky, on capacity, now we're halfway through '09 and we haven't seen orders really in the industry for obvious reasons. Definitely bodes well for 2012, but I'm wondering as you think about your strategy over the next few years, I'm wondering if you envision, you know, continued growth of your fleet or if you think we will see a lull on new ship orders over the next year or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do think we have been saying that we expect capacity growth beyond what's known now to slow down, but I don't expect it to stop. I mean, clearly, we have brands that have needs and in recent years or two, we've had issues both with the dollar with commodity prices, meaning new building prices skyrocketed and while some of our competitors ordered under those circumstances, we held back and we haven't ordered in quite some time.</p>
          <p>With everything that's happened over the last nine, ten months, a lot of the commodity prices and other prices have come down significantly and pricing is starting to resemble pricing this we had when we did order. So we continue to talk to yards, we continue to look at opportunities and if we had the right opportunity for the right brand that needs the capacity and the pricing is right, we'll definitely consider it. But I do expect that the capacity growth will slow but it won't stop.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>Thank you for having taken the question, and our next question comes from the line of Steve Kent from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Maybe just a couple questions. You know, when I look at your results, third quarter net yield came in toward the bottom end or toward the worse end of your guidance. Third quarter looks a little bit more difficult and then in the fourth quarter, it looks like you are forecasting a pretty big rebound, and I was just trying to figure out why that would happen given, Howard, all the things that you just mentioned?</p>
          <p>And then could you also just talk about what you see day to day on the swine flu impact? It seems like it goes through lulls of publicity and then gets a flash of publicity, and does that affect your bookings almost day to day when a ship is being quarantined off of Venezuela today and sort of how that impacts things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, remember, that the guidance was given before we had the Mexico travel advisory. So the fact that we're able to be within guidance despite the Mexico travel advisory, I think is a pretty good sign that everything else was booking better than we had anticipated. That's true for the second and to some degree a little bit of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>As far as the impact, it's interesting. During the time of the advisory, clearly, it was a huge amount of disruption caused by that CDC advisory because of the itinerary changes, and people didn't know &#x2013; Carnival Cruise Lines basically changed itineraries through mid-June and people didn't know what they would do beyond mid-June. So basically, for three, four weeks, everything into those vessels stopped. Now we're digging ourselves out of that hole. There's been little resistance, actually, to going back to Mexico. We didn't see a lot of cancellations during that period. We just saw the uncertainty of the itineraries caused this disruption and volumes now are very good, much higher than last year, but we're digging ourselves out of a hole and we're having to do it with lower pricing.</p>
          <p>As far as these isolated occurrences, it's tough to explain. We have now been in touch with 23 Caribbean governments. We've gotten confirmation back from 20 of them that they will not behave in the way that they have behaved with Pullmantur. I can't explain &#x2013; you'd have to ask Pullmantur what's going on over there.</p>
          <p>The reality is that when a ship arrives in a port with a few flu cases, confirmed or unconfirmed, those cases have been isolated and the passengers have been onboard for a number of days and so symptoms would have come out and we have isolated the passengers with symptoms. If those passengers had arrived by air after a four or five hour flight, they would not be symptomatic and would be in the population. So it's clearly much safer as long as you operate under the protocols that we, CDC, with CLIA [Cruise Lines International Association] have put together, much safer to accept a ship even if it has some cases.</p>
          <p>And by the way, we're talking about a flu that is no worse and it appears to be symptoms even milder than seasonal flu. So this overreaction in some locations has been a problem. We had a particular problem in Australia, but we're trying to deal with it port by port, government by government, and I think over time people are understanding that this is not any different than seasonal flu and shouldn't be treated as such.</p>
          <p>We also have to remember that WHO from the very beginning said that there should be no restrictions on travel and yet some governments, lower-level people have panicked and done some of the things that you just described and so hopefully, over time, as everybody gets educated, we work hard to educate people and we work hard with the CDC to educate people, this becomes less and less of an issue and it will be treated more and more like seasonal flu.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve this is Howard. Just let me clarify a few things on the yield information. I think it's fair to say that without the impact of the flu in the second quarter, we would have come in at the midpoint of the range, the yield forecast range we had given for the second quarter. So it really was more driven by the flu effect.</p>
          <p>And while the third quarter will be down, it's clear that some of these &#x2013; the seasonal Alaska programs took a big hit in the third quarter and some other long and exotics took a big hit. So I think we suffered more in the third quarter and third quarter typically because it is seasonally our strongest quarter has the highest price points. So I think we felt more of the impact of the yield erosion in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>And while I think the fourth quarter will be better than &#x2013; it will be better than the third quarter, but I don't think it's going to be &#x2013; I wouldn't say it's going to be remarkably better but it's certainly going to be improved from the third quarter. And also I think because we're seeing some evidence and we have been able to pick up some &#x2013; we have been able to pick up some additional yield, we're seeing some evidence of hopefully maybe coming out of this situation or at least stabilizing the situation, but hopefully coming up with some pricing improvements in some itineraries as we go forward, and I think we're starting to see that for the fourth quarter. Third quarter is, you know, really basically done. Just not a whole lot left to sell. I don't know if that helps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It does, Howard. To the first quarter, it sounds like things would still be negative. With the amount of supply coming on, does that suggest that the negatives will continue throughout 2010? Just given what you are seeing so far, it feels that way and again, with the amount of supply coming into 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Really too early to know yet. There's so many factors that can play in. The one thing we do know is that our occupancies or our capacity is up over 9% in the first quarter and at least over the last several weeks, we've been starting to track the same type of booking volumes in the first quarter on a capacity adjusted basis as we did last year. So that's a positive. How long that lasts, whether that's sustainable, what other hits we are going to take in the economy, who knows yet. We really don't have a good yield &#x2013; we won't have a really good yield forecast. Even then, I'm never sure how good they are until the end of the year</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. A couple clarifications I guess. One is just you were talking about the swine flu. There are a lot of different viewpoints out there about how big of an impact that may have on yields and I think your commentary is a little more upbeat than what some people might have expected. When you look out to Q1 of 2010, at that point, are you still seeing the Mexican itinerary bookings behaving a little worse than other Caribbean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try this one more time. The only time we saw an impact was during the travel advisory. If you understand the volumes of bookings we're talking about over a three or four-week period, we basically stopped. Now, what percentage of that was based on the flu and what was based on the fact that the consumer didn't know where we were going to cruise to, is very hard to know, but it was very disruptive.</p>
          <p>As soon as we announced we're going back, volumes not only went back to normal but exceeded normal. So volumes were fine. However, our yield management people obviously had to react to the hole that was created and so the pricing was lower. But clearly that pricing will be moved up as that hole gets filled. But the volumes were there the moment we were able to confirm what the itineraries were.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Then in terms of Q1 just overall now, companywide bookings, would you say that even though it's still early that the level of decline in Q1 is going to be at least better than, say, Q3 decline this year or is it early enough to at least say that, put a worst case cap on it? All else, assuming no big changes from what's gone on say in the travel environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be honest with you, Robin, I don't know the answer to that question. We haven't even tried to formulate what yields are going to look like in the first quarter. Intuitively, I think that our sense is that it won't be as bad but I really don't have an exact answer for you right now. I really don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What is very encouraging is that since the end of March, everything is trending upward despite the travel advisory. Right through the travel advisory, everything is trending upward, both volumes and yields. So we're encouraged by that. Whether that will be sustainable, time will tell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we're still running behind in the fourth quarter and the first quarter in terms of occupancy, and we have been catching up, as I indicated, by a considerable amount given the recent surge in booking volumes. When you get to the point where you have caught up or you are closing, you can start to tweak pricing in various itineraries where there's more demand and we're starting to be able to do that selectively. Different brands are doing it for different itineraries and we're starting to see that happen. So it's certainly a positive indicator, but my guess is comparisons &#x2013; when we get into 2010, comparisons for the first quarter will be the toughest, for the second quarter not as tough and for the third quarter we'll probably have already fully cycled this downturn in pricing and it should start to normalize and look better in the third and fourth quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Foschi. My second question, after significant price declines in May for the short Caribbean including voyages that were supposed to call Mexico, it seems that there is a pickup in pricing for Q3 since the beginning of June. Can that impact the quarter relative to today's guidance, or is there too little inventory left to really move the needle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would have to answer that, that it is in our guidance. Our guidance is based on the bookings we see and the pricing we're charging and what we believe, so hopefully it's in our values. We do our best to obviously do that. There isn't a lot of inventory left, but clearly, there's more in Mexico only because of that hole that I just described that needs to be dug out of and yes, because volumes are high, they will tweak prices up.</p>

          <p>Yes, good morning, guys. I guess just first on the fuel question, with fuel now trending close to where you said you could put the fuel supplements back in place, any thoughts in terms of putting those back in? And then, you know, any change in terms of hedging strategies?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've got it here. We had put out a statement that it said that, you know, at the time we suspended the fuel supplement for our six North American brands, we reserved the right to reinstate them if the price of light sweet crude oil according to NYMEX should increase above $70 a barrel. Then we went on to say that while we've now exceeded that threshold, in light of the economic crisis and resulting consumer weakness, we presently have no plans to institute a fuel supplement and that we'll continue to monitor the situation in the markets and review our position as the situation warrants.</p>

It has bounced around quarter to quarter a little bit, but it is has been somewhat stable through most of the months of 2009 to date so I'm not sure which numbers you're looking at, but it is overall for the year within our guidance and the actuals we have seen some improvement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a clarification on the residual effects of the flu. You expected a nickel in the second quarter. You only took 3 cents but in your commentary on the full year EPS, it sounds like you're still expecting the full 10 cents that you outlined in the original press release. Can you reconcile what appears to be the differences?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>No. That's exactly it. It was the ten cents was essentially three in the second and we're anticipating the other seven to be the in the third. Two of the existing cruises and five for the rest of the impact.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. That helps, gentlemen. And then, David, in your opening commentary, you talked about the good history that you had and the company has had here on getting ongoing fuel efficiency. How do you see that playing as you look into 2010? What type of pace do you think is sustainable from that perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult to estimate the exact pace, but what I can say is that we are working on an awful lot of initiatives. The brands have really come together. We have got an internal intranet site where we share ideas, test things, prove things out and implement them, which is really paying &#x2013; which is really improving our overall fuel consumption.</p>
          <p>The other thing that's also key is that 2010 to a great extent is really the first year where the itineraries will have been planned in a high fuel environment. It wasn't that long ago when we planned 2009 itineraries. They weren't planned in the extremely high fuel environment that we saw in 2008 because we locked those in in advance. So we should get some benefit from that as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the key point is that when we had 147 fuel, I mean, we took the attitude that we're going to do whatever we can to save, obviously, and when fuel went down to 35, we encouraged all our brands to think of fuel as 147 fuel and not to behave like it's 35 and to maintain the momentum that we've gotten on saving fuel, and you can see in the second quarter that they have taken that to heart, and continue to work very hard at it.</p>

          <p>We just sent the second ship in Asia in April. The ship we operate now short cruises for the Asian market together with the other ship that was there. We see this summer season, although we have more than doubled the capacity in terms of occupancy as good as what it was last year. The ship we operate at full capacity where they're serving the Chinese market and is encouraging, very encouraging.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, it's very difficult to say because, again, there is a little bit of concern about flu also there and more importantly, in the winter season the demand for the local market will slow down and so we will have to supply more worldwide customers, mainly from Europe and Australia to fill up the ships. But so far, we are very encouraged by the demand of the second ships.</p>

          <p>Could you tell us a little bit about your itineraries for the Chinese ships and where they're going and how long they are on average?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The average is about five days, varying from four to six days. The itineraries, they sail out of Shanghai and Tianjin to serve the Beijing market and Shanghai also to serve the larger Shanghai area and they typically go to Japan and South Korea. It's typically four to six days cruise out of Shanghai, Tianjin visiting South Korea and Japan. Japan normally at two ports and one port in South Korea.</p>

          <p>Thank you. If I could just ask one more question about Europe. You know, in the hotel industry, the RevPar declines has been more significant in Europe than the U.S. and they seem to be lagging behind, meaning they're trending down further and abating slower. If you are not seeing those same trends with your booking patterns in Europe, why do you suppose not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe that, I mean, if you compare the demand of cruises in Europe versus North America, I mean, you can see the same pattern, look at ten years ago in North America. Cruising is still at the very infancy of development here in Europe and so it's a very attractive proposition and it actually, particularly this year and last year, although of course this economic crisis is affecting everybody, but cruising is in the front page of every single paper in Europe as attractive as a proposition for holidays. It has never been before. That is the reason why. It's a demanded product within the holiday market, higher than ever been.</p>

          <p>I just wanted to ask, when you eliminated or suspended the dividend earlier, you had mentioned liquidity clearly as one of the important factors in that. It sounds as though liquidity is improving substantially. I'm curious where you are currently on thinking about reinstating the dividend and what other factors may play into that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we said at the time that it's an issue that is a board issue that we will take up quarterly with our board and so I don't want to preempt the board in any way, but I would say that clearly we'd like to see a turn in earnings and cash flow before we would recommend to the board a change in policy, but again, I don't want to preempt the board. I would rather leave it to say that the board will look at it every quarter and we'll gauge it based on the circumstances at that time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Clearly &#x2013; this is Howard &#x2013; I also think that the rating agencies' views of the dividend will play a role in doing our analysis because we like our strong investment grade credit rating and want to maintain it. It's really helped us considerably during this very, very difficult period. So we'll have to work &#x2013; we'll have to work with the credit rating &#x2013; the rating agencies as well to make sure that whatever we decide to do, if and when we do reintroduce the dividend, that they're going to comfortable with it and not take us down.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The close down of Ocean Village, what happened to that segment of the market that you were so optimistic about a few years ago? Is this something you are going to service through P&amp;O, or it is just going to go away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think to some degree, you know, I wish I had David Dingle here now. To some degree, the larger ships that P&amp;O are bringing in, Ventura and Azura, will service a younger clientele and so some of that clientele can be picked up by the larger, more contemporary new P&amp;O ships. The rest will probably go to Thomson which is operating basically similar itineraries and other international operators. Clearly, while we were able to fill those ships, we weren't able to fill them at reasonable returns and so we didn't feel that we could grow the brand and if you can't grow the brand, there's no point in just endlessly maintaining it. We felt that Australia was doing extremely well. We had a great, enthusiastic management team in Australia, and we feel like that is an area we can grow and grow more aggressively and that's why we made the decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also. You mentioned briefly you are in Italy to take possession of the new Odyssey. Can you talk to us about Seabourn? Obviously this is a huge step with two more vessels to follow. Are you going to keep the three that you already have? And what does this spell out for the luxury market as you perceive it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the time we signed the contract, the luxury market was booming, as you know. Since September, the luxury market isn't quite as strong, to say the least, so the timing may not have been the best, but the reality is these assets are 30-year assets and if you believe long term that the demographics work well for the luxury market down the road, these will be very good investments.</p>
          <p>The ship is absolutely magnificent. Very much fitting within the Seabourn brand and the Seabourn style and I think she will be very, very well received by the marketplace and do very, very well. Time will tell whether this segment can absorb this and other competitive capacity that's coming in. It may take some time, especially with the present economic situation, but long term, we're very, very comfortable. We think these are great ships that will bring us very good returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I should add, David, I think the size of these ships, which are two-and-a-half times the size of the existing ships, give you tremendous cost metrics that we didn't have on the smaller ships that really should enhance profitability of Seabourn even during these tough periods.</p>
          <p>So we're happy that we're doing it and we'll see how it goes over time. The ship is absolutely stunning. So we're very excited about it. I think the reaction to our customers, our Seabourn customers will be very positive and she is very well booked despite the slowing economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Lastly, Ibero, now that you own 100%, can you share with us some of the changes you hope to make there and whether you might be adding capacity, etcetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just say this. I just want to correct you. We have an agreement to acquire the other 25%, but we do have to go through Spanish antitrust regulation, which we're doing right now. So we haven't closed on that transaction. I will let Pier react to what we're doing as far as structurally to change that operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So currently we have now presented the file to the antitrust authority in Spain. We're waiting for the comments and the decision. Ibero Cruceros was part of a development that we had in Spain as a consequence of the Costa position in Spain. Costa position in Spain was seen and still is regarded as a premium brand with high yield and we thought that to exploit better the market, we would have needed ever to lower the price of Costa, but we didn't aim to do so, or to start a new brand.</p>
          <p>The opportunity was in the market to acquire an existing two ships company. We got the first ships last year. Unfortunately, Spain is the most hit country in this economic downturn. There's a high unemployment rate in Spain. It went up very quickly, faster than anybody had to anticipate. So we are now working in different market condition while building a new company and new brand. Capacity's up this year versus last year because we introduced the former Carnival Celebration ship in June last year but despite of that, our occupancy rate are the same versus last year.</p>
          <p>So under difficult economic circumstances, the brand is now positioning well in the market. In terms of what we have introduced since last November, we have taken full control basically of the company, managing in a different way as what was managed in the past. We sent a very senior, talented person from Italy to restructure the company, which is now completed. There were a number of cost actions be taken.</p>
          <p>For instance, the office of Costa and the office of Ibero Cruceros are in the same &#x2013; physically in the same place. We merge the call center of Ibero Cruceros with the call center of Costa in Barcelona so there are a number of synergies have been already introduced in order to reduce cost and waiting for better opportunity the marketplace given the economy that we expect before or later to develop again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Thank you for having taken those questions. Gentlemen, we now have a question from the line of Jamie Rollo from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. How much of the fourth quarter and the first quarter have you sold now please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we ever provide that information. I know you always ask those kinds of questions, Jamie, but I don't think we actually give the precise numbers. But we're well advanced in the fourth quarter and we've got quite a bit of inventory sold for the first quarter, but still considerable amounts to go for the first quarter. That's about all I'm going to say</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very early for the first quarter, Jamie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just thinking about the strong comps that you mentioned in Q1 next year, how much of Q1 '09 was therefore sold before the September economic meltdown you referred to, and how much of that was subsequently re-fared? I'm just trying to get a feeling for how much of your bookings were done at that artificially high price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, remember, we're still dealing with two booking curves now. The problem was that until September, we were dealing with a much longer booking curve. So we were pretty well along for the first quarter by September last year. If we are in the same position this year in September, we will be in very good shape. I would not expect that that would be the case because of the movement in the booking curve. So the reality is that by September last year, we were very well booked for the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; we still have this close-in booking pattern that although we have been driving a lot of volumes it has tended to fill in the closer-in occupancies. But as we &#x2013; if we can get to, you know, kind of get to last year's levels in terms of occupancy versus a year ago, that's when you start to see pricing going up a little bit. And we have the ability to move pricing and also the curve will start to move out a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on what Howard said earlier, we're booking &#x2013; we have been booking since March at a rate of around 26% for the rest of the year and we've been booking at about the same pace capacity adjusted for the first quarter which is up 9%. That immediately shows you the booking window, that you've got this huge increase of booking within the year and basically it's encouraging at this point that it's capacity adjusted equal at this point for the first quarter at 9%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one other question, just on that point, you have clearly found the pricing level to stimulate volumes pretty significantly. Would you go so far to say that you think cruise prices might have bottomed right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we said earlier on the call, we have started tweaking prices on a variety of brands, variety of positions. Pricing is being taken up, yes. And as I also said earlier on the call, since March, end of March we have seen both volumes increasing and yields starting to turn and start to improve.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Barry from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just very briefly, Howard, maybe you can comment, other than the magnitude of the yield degradation, are your brands or the revenue management folks at the brand level seeing any major differences with respect to this cycle versus prior cycles we've experienced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that they probably never experienced a cycle like this before. We've never experienced the slackening of demand in the marketplace which causes the degradation of the yield in our history. I mean, to be down 14, 12, 14, 16%, we've never had that before. The worst I can recall is in the 3% range or something like that.</p>
          <p>I think when that happens, I think the reaction by the revenue management people is typically to get the business first and even if they leave something on the table, they want to be able to fill up the ships. That's been the model. And if you leave something on the table, you'll get it the following year, but they want to fill up the ships. I think there's a tendency to try to play the price as hard as they can until they're comfortable that they can fill the ship up.</p>
          <p>But once you've full cycled this thing as we get into, let's say a year from now, I think we should start to come out of it even if the economy doesn't strengthen a whole lot from where it is. If it is just a stable economy, and I think we may start to see some growth and that will be a real positive for us. But if it's a stable economy, we should run full cycle on the pricing, I would hope, by the end of the second quarter of 2010, the pricing declines. But that's my guess right now but it is really still early to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following up on that, I know it's maybe a bit hypothetical, but if you assumed the same trajectory of volume growth that you have seen off the March lows, when would you expect that book load factor would be positive year-over-year for say 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It wouldn't take long.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It wouldn't take long. But remember, a lot of the volume we're seeing is close-in volume. We're basically pacing &#x2013; we're behind in the first quarter of 2010, just to be clear. We're behind, and in the last three or four weeks, we've been able to sustain booking volumes for the first quarter that are pacing now a year ago levels in the first quarter. We're not gaining on it. We're still behind. We're not gaining on it, and this is with the nine plus percent type of capacity increase we have in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So it's a positive. What we're seeing is a positive trend but it's still not enough to get us to the same levels of occupancy. We will have to further increase it and as we get out of the third quarter toward the fourth quarter, we will start to see it happen. We will start to pick up the volumes again for the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Understand that 26% is not sustainable because at some point, you run out of space. The net result is we sail full. So at the point that they are comfortable that they're filling the ship they start tweaking prices up, which is what we're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the volumes will come down as a result.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, just two questions on pricing again. Can you give us an idea of different prices being achieved in your European and North American brands? I know at Q1, the range was down between 10 to 40%. And also if you are starting to be able to push the prices up, I was just wondering why this has not led to an improvement in your guidance for the full year for your net revenue yield?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I'm going to answer the second part of your question, Rosie. I think we have increased guidance on yield for the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>We have two factors that played into it, that are playing here. One is, we took a hit on the swine flu which amounted to some 10 cents a share or $80 million. On the other side, we've been able to recapture that when I said we will be up 14 cents as a result of increases in yields from our previous guidance and that's something like, I don't know, $110 million. So we actually have tweaked up pricing and we will have...</p>

          <p>Yes, but with the numbers we're talking about, it's hard to move the percentages. As Micky says, it's still within the range. We have seen some of that. I'm not quite sure I understood the first part of your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in Q1 for example, you are saying in your North American brands, the itineraries to Alaska and Europe were down 30 to 40% whereas your Caribbean trips were more down like 10% and in Europe prices were down 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anecdotally, Europe bounced back pretty good and Alaska did not, and you know, we talked on the last call that there's no question that the referendum had a significant impact on what's going on in Alaska although the referendum, you know, supporters say it hasn't, but the reality is now every brand, both ours and our competitors are withdrawing capacity for 2010.</p>
          <p>So capacity will be down significantly in Alaska in 2010 while capacity in the Caribbean and Europe will be up in 2010, across the board. So the only explanation to me is the referendum and while we tried everything we can to get leadership in Alaska to address the issue in the best interest of our industry and tourism in general to Alaska, we've been unsuccessful. And in the end we may have to litigate. We believe that the referendum was illegal and we &#x2013; there was a recent Exxon case that kind of reinforced that, that it was illegal. So the Supreme Court found in favor of Exxon on a similar situation.</p>
          <p>So we didn't want to litigate. We wanted to hopefully find some leadership that would agree with us to do what's in the best interest of the industry and tourism to Alaska and employment in Alaska, but we've not been successful in doing that yet.</p>
          <p>Europe bounced back pretty well and the North American, and I would say though that the North American brands are carrying more non-North Americans in Europe than before and one of our competitors I think openly said that 75% of their capacity in their North American brand was non-American. So that is the case. While there hasn't been a change in nationality for our European brands, there has been some for our North American brands.</p>

          <p>And thank you, Ms. Edwards. Gentlemen, we now have a follow-up question from Robin Farley from UBS. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I just wanted to clarify: you made comments earlier about commodity prices regarding new ship orders. Prices are getting down to where they were when you last ordered ships. Over the last couple years or going back a couple of years, your new ship orders were primarily for European brands so currency wasn't as much a factor. Are your comments maybe warming up to the idea of new ship orders, would that apply to North American brands as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I should have been more specific because when I made that comment, I should have said that it was on a euro-to-euro basis pricing similar to when we ordered. Not necessarily dollar-to-dollar basis. Obviously, the yards quote on euros and when I look at new building prices we look in euros and pricing right now that the yards are quoting are quite similar to the euro pricing that we ordered for both European and North American brands.</p>
          <p>Whether we would or would not would depend on returns and whether we could reach agreement with yards at prices &#x2013; dollar prices that make sense for the U.S. brands or U.K. brands or European brands. So I wouldn't take anything off the table at this stage. We continue to talk, but as I said, I think capacity growth will be slower in the 12, 14 area but it won't be zero.</p>

          <p>And, Ms. Farley, thank you for your question. Gentlemen, our final question is a follow-up from Tim Conder from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, gentlemen, to look at the booking curve, I guess, you know, when you went into Europe, you said that the Europeans generally had booked in much closer than the North Americans and your goal was to push that out and you were having some success in doing that, but since last September, can you kind of compare and contrast the shrinkage in the booking window for the passengers versus North American passengers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally speaking, our European occupancies are &#x2013; run a little bit &#x2013; slightly stronger than our U.S. occupancy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very brand specific. So for example, our U.K. brands tend to book longer out than our Italian brands or the German brand tends to book a little further out than the Italian brand. It's very, very brand specific, but overall, when you look at it I will tell you if you took the U.K. out, it's quite similar to North America. The U.K. kind of moves it a little bit further out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a significant difference between both and today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Once we got into similar kinds of yield management, similar kinds of mentality about filling ships for all these brands, the booking curve started to be very, very similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So would you say that, again, post-September here, that you have seen &#x2013; and based on the occupancies and the pricing commentary it's fair to assume that booking curve is not condensed as much on your European sourced passengers versus the North American?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe not as much, but it has condensed so that the difference is still not significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
