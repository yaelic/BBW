          <p>Thank you. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on the call this morning are Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner and Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast, and podcast.</p>
          <p>Before I turn it over to Jim, I wanted to remind everyone that as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn it over to Jim.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our business growth continued in the fourth quarter, contributing to another strong year for McDonald's brand. Global comparable sales were up 2.3% for the quarter and 3.8% for the year. Constant currencies, operating income grew 14% for the quarter and 10% for the year.</p>
          <p>2009 marked our sixth consecutive year of positive comp sales in every area of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevancy of our Plan to Win business strategy. In January, we expect to post another month of positive global comparable sales, with both Europe and Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa positive, and the U.S. relatively flat. In this challenging economic environment, we feel very good about our trends.</p>
          <p>And we continue to grow by adapting to our customers' needs and elevating the key drivers of our Plan to Win. Those being more menu variety and choice, better restaurant operations, greater convenience and daypart expansion, everyday predictable low prices, and ongoing restaurant investment. In all of these areas we're innovative and improving and pushing ourselves to stay in step with consumers in order to give them the most outstanding dining experience in every way. This strategy and alignment helped us achieve strong results across the system in 2009.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., comp sales increased slightly for the quarter and up 2.6 for the year, contributing to an operating income growth of 5% and 6% respectively. We're proud of these results, especially given the high unemployment and its impact on consumer spending. In the U.S. last year, our comp sales gap against the industry was positive every week of the year. And despite an overall decline in the informal eating-out category, we increased our market share and strengthened our leadership position. We drove results by delivering exceptional value, menu choice and convenience. U.S. maintained a strong focus on value at every level, from the Dollar Menu to mid-tier and premium offerings. This continues to make us a compelling choice for customers in this uncertain time.</p>
          <p>And we continue to win through menu choice, with a balance of familiar and popular core products, as well as new items to keep us relevant. Our McCafe specialty coffees and our line of premium Angus Burgers were new offerings in 2009, and they helped us make McDonald's a more clear destination for outstanding quality at the best value.</p>
          <p>We're pushing ahead with more choices, including the national launch this month of our Mac Snack Wrap and Breakfast Dollar Menu. The Mac Snack Wrap is a snack version of our Big Mac. It's a fourth-tier product with a good margin, and it fits well into our growing snack daypart or as an add-on to a meal and certainly could be eaten on the go. The Breakfast Dollar Menu, introduced in collaboration with our franchisees, gives us a national voice on value at breakfast. Both of these highlight our commitment to keep modernizing our menu and provide the products that our customers are looking for.</p>
          <p>And this month we're also launching free wireless Internet access at nearly all of our U.S. restaurants. This will make us the largest provider of free Internet in the country and make our restaurant experience even more valuable.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Europe, comparable sales were up 4.8% for the quarter and 5.2% for the year. In constant currencies, operating income grew 10% for the quarter and 8% for the year. Europe's guiding strategies of upgrading the customer and employee experience, building brand transparency, and enhancing local relevance continues to drive results. In the fourth quarter, we grew our market share in the informal eating-out category across Europe, including the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. A key to this growth was the continued focus on our three-tier menu platform &#x2013; everyday low price, core, and premium &#x2013; delivering choice and value across the menu.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue to enhance our fourth-tier menu platform by delivering a category of smaller premium affordable products. We expanded our line of popular Petit Plaisirs in France and our Little Taster offerings in the U.K., and we've introduced fourth-tier products to other markets such as Germany with the Snack Deluxe. All of this is building greater relevancy for our brand and stronger results for our bottom line.</p>
          <p>Europe also saw success from an increased emphasis on daypart expansion, particularly breakfast. In Germany, we expanded our breakfast lineup with classic and new offerings as part of our Easy Morning breakfast launch, and it's yielding solid results. And in the U.K., our number one breakfast market in Europe, strong media support helped generate some of our highest breakfast sales to-date. In addition, Europe's ongoing coffee strategy, including the stand-alone McCafe concept, is resonating with European consumers, with McDonald's now being the number one seller of coffee in Germany. Many of these opportunities are enhanced by Europe's leading role in the reimaging, where by the end of 2011, 85% of Europe's 6,800 restaurants will be reimaged.</p>
          <p>Let's shift to Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, or APMEA, which delivered $1 billion in operating income in 2009. This is a long way from the $345 million they delivered in 2005. For the quarter and year, comp sales were up 1.5% and 3.4% respectively. Operating income also continued to grow, up 28% for the quarter and 23% for the year in constant currencies. Our growth across the region continues to come from strong execution in convenience, value, core menu, and breakfast.</p>
          <p>Australia remains one of the top-performing markets in our system. They've reimaged their entire asset base, setting the stage to drive strong results with premium offerings like the popular Angus line and the M Burger selections. They also launched the next version of their Value Picks Menu as well as enhanced the drive-through experience, leading to better operations and service times.</p>
          <p>Now China, although their economy is improving, and we delivered an increase in comp sales and guest counts in December, we expect it will still be some time before consumers regain confidence and are willing to spend more. In the meantime, we're making the right moves to grow our business and strengthen our connection with our Chinese consumers. We're improving operations, which is differentiating our brand on service and helping build capacity during peak hours. We also launched a highly popular Value Lunch initiative that has had helped drive guest counts and incremental sales. And as we announced recently, we're adding to our footprint by planning to open 150 to 175 restaurants in China in 2010. So we remain excited about our potential growth and expansion in this region.</p>
          <p>McDonald's Japan made solid progress last year in the face of significant economic headwinds, delivering positive comp sales across the majority of months. Our results were driven largely by the introduction of the Quarter Pounder, the launch of Premium Roast Coffee and a strong focus on affordability, highlighted by our popular Value Lunch. Additionally in the fourth quarter, we made gains through a focus on drive-through, the relaunch of McChicken, and the continued success of our premium coffee products.</p>
          <p>So those are some of the recent highlights from around the world. As we turn to the year ahead, I want to say a few words on our continued commitment to financial discipline and enhancing shareholder value. In 2009, we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends, for a three-year total of $16.6 billion in our 15 to $17 billion three-year target. Going forward, our philosophy regarding the use of our cash flow remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in the business. After that, we expect to return all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Our reinvestment strategies, our financial discipline, and especially our Plan to Win are the mainstays of our success and the blueprint we will continue to follow to drive future growth.</p>
          <p>We're pleased with 2009's results. We remain confident in and committed to our Plan to Win and our customer focus strategies. And as always, we feel we have the very best leadership team in place to help us achieve our goals. As you all know, Don Thompson recently became our new President and Chief Operating Officer. Don has a deep knowledge of the business and has done an outstanding job leading our U.S. business, and Don will continue to drive value for the brand in his new role.</p>
          <p>At McDonald's we pride ourselves on our commitment to talent management and leadership development and always having a deep bench of strong, capable leaders. We have a great management team in place that is highly talented, well aligned, and ready to deliver results.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, we're all focused on the appropriate business drivers to be more relevant for our customers every day. From the best-tasting food and beverage offerings, to the greatest value and convenience, to an unparalleled restaurant experience. With our franchisees, suppliers, and employees all working together, I'm certain we will continue to succeed on all these front. And I'm confident we will keep delivering positive results for our system and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn things over to Pete Bensen, our CFO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Every day, more than 60 million customers around the world count on McDonald's for convenience, variety, and value, while our investors count on us to drive growth, cash flow, and returns. I'm proud to say that we delivered for customers and investors alike in 2009, with sales, operations, profitability, and returns all improving amid a historic economic downturn. For the fourth quarter and the year, we delivered double-digit constant currency earnings-per-share growth. Even after adjusting 2008 results for the gain on sale of Pret A Manger and 2009 results for the income related to the Redbox transactions and the resolution of certain Latin America liabilities, earning per share rose 10% in the quarter and 13% for the year in constant currencies.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, primarily due to the resolution of certain Latin America retained liabilities, we recorded $65 million of pre-tax income, as well as a $22 million benefit in tax expense, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance. In total, this resulted in an $0.08 benefit to earnings per share and a 240-basis-point benefit to the effective tax rate for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Combined operating margin improved significantly in 2009. At about 30%, our combined operating margin is significantly higher than that of many global consumer companies. This combined operating margin performance reflects our ability to drive strong franchise and company-operated margins while controlling G&amp;A spending. Total margin dollars for McDonald's restaurants reached a record $8.8 billion in 2009, up about 6% in constant currencies.</p>
          <p>Franchise margin dollars, which represents nearly 6 billion of the total, grew at a faster pace as we continue to execute our refranchising strategy. As a percent of revenues, franchise margins were strong at 82.1% for both the quarter and the year. Over the last two years, we've refranchised more than 1,100 restaurants in connection with our refranchising strategy. And today, more than 80% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide are franchised. We expect to refranchise a couple hundred more restaurants in 2010.</p>
          <p>Company-operated margins were up 160 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18.8%, driven by positive comparable sales, lower commodity costs, and refranchising. For the year, company-operated margins increased 60 basis points to 18.2%, the highest level in a decade.</p>
          <p>Throughout 2009, our U.S. business outperformed the overall informal eating-out industry, and the fourth quarter was no exception. Easing commodity costs benefited margins in the fourth quarter, as our grocery bill declined about 4%. Refranchising also enhanced the margin increase. As a result, our U.S. business delivered outstanding company-operated margins of 20.3% for the quarter and 19.4% for the year. Strong company-operated margins are a key indicator of our business health and restaurant level cash flow.</p>
          <p>In 2009, average restaurant cash flow growth for our owner/operators was the strongest in 15 years. We closed the year with average annual pre-debt cash flow approaching $320,000 per restaurant. This strong owner/operator cash flow helps enable future reinvestments in the business, like support for Breakfast Dollar Menu or reimaging.</p>
          <p>In Europe, company-operated margins increased 130 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor and utility costs. The U.K., France and many other countries drove this improvement, as our menu, variety, and value continued to appeal to customers. While Europe's local currency grocery bill declined 3% in the quarter, currency rates continued to pressure commodity costs in Russia and other Eastern European countries, making the net impact of food and paper costs slightly negative. For the year, company-operated margins rose 40 basis points in Europe, reaching a 10-year high of 18.4%.</p>
          <p>In Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa, company-operated margins increased 260 basis points in the fourth quarter. And for the year, company-operated margins rose 90 basis points to a very healthy 16.8%. Our sustained strong performance in Australia, and operating efficiencies and lower commodity costs throughout the segment drove the improvement for both periods.</p>
          <p>We are confident we can deliver strong company-operated margins going forward, as we continue to execute our strategies related to price, product mix, and promotion, while driving efficiencies and managing costs. As it relates to food and paper costs, our initial outlook for 2010 is for our basket of goods to be relatively flat in the U.S. and Europe, with easier comparisons in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to G&amp;A, in constant currencies, G&amp;A was up slightly for the quarter and down for the year. 2009 marks the fifth consecutive year that G&amp;A declined as a percent of both sales and revenues. And we expect G&amp;A as a percent of sales and revenues will continue to decline in 2010. While total G&amp;A dollars will be up slightly on a reported basis at today's exchange rates, G&amp;A should be relatively flat in constant currency. The timing of the Vancouver Winter Olympics and our biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention will impact the quarterly comparisons.</p>
          <p>Our proven ability to drive sales, deliver strong margins, and control spending, along with our franchise business model, all have positive implications for our cash flow. As we continue to be disciplined in how we use this cash, our philosophy has not changed. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business, as Jim said. We have the financial capacity and the local talent to invest capital back into our business, when many others cannot. This is a competitive advantage that we intend to leverage to further differentiate the McDonald's experience.</p>
          <p>In 2010 we will invest about $2.4 billion in capital expenditures. Our goal is to elevate our brand to drive sustainable growth while continuing to earn strong returns. Approximately half of our capital expenditures will be used to open about 1,000 new restaurants around the world, including roughly 500 in Asia Pacific, 250 in Europe, and 150 in the U.S. The other half of our capital expenditures will be allocated toward reimaging over 2,000 existing locations. Nearly half of these remodels will be in Europe, 600 in Asia Pacific, and 500 in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Reimaging has a direct positive impact on sales and market share, as our experience in the U.S., France, and Australia demonstrates. In 2010, our reimaging efforts will be focused on both the interior and exterior of our restaurants. As we've done in the past, we will co-invest with our owner/operators in these high-impact reimaging efforts. It's important to remember that as we make these investments, we are also upgrading our asset base. This is because we own the land and buildings or hold long term leases on the property underlying our restaurants. In addition, by sharing in the investment, we can accelerate initiatives, reach scale faster and positively impact our business sooner.</p>
          <p>On a final note, as you know for most of 2009, currency translation was a significant headwind, negatively impacting full-year earnings per share by $0.15. However, this headwind became a tailwind in the fourth quarter, a benefit we expect will continue for the next couple of quarters. Based on current rates, we estimate that currency translation will positively impact first quarter earnings by about 0.05 or $0.06 per share. And the full-year benefit is estimated to be approximately 0.06 to $0.08 per share.</p>
          <p>We have a brand advantage in convenience, menu variety, and value; a strong balance sheet and cash flow; and owner/operators and suppliers who are aligned and focused. As we move forward in 2010, we will continue to leverage our competitive strengths to extend our lead in the marketplace and drive value for our shareholders and global system.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Thanks, Pete. I'll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. Please press *1 if you have a question, and *2 to remove yourself from the queue. To give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We'll come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Pete. I'll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> To give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We'll come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. The first question is from David Palmer at UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Could you comment &#x2013; I guess this is a simple question, but could you comment on your traffic trends per restaurant and how your same-store sales trends have trended versus the industry? I remember during your Analysts Day, you showed a wider gap at the end of the year versus the competition, and that's obviously U.S.-specific, but perhaps you can comment as whether that gap has remained as wide recently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, thanks for the question. This is Jim. Our trends have remained the same. And fortunately, we had traffic growth or guest count growth in every segment of the business last year. And much of that was because we were capable of sort of keeping the average check in place. We didn't take as many price increases. We don't have the pricing elasticity, and of course, our consumers today around the world deserve a break, if you will, relative to pricing around food away from home. And we've kept the line on that very well. And we have therefore been the recipients of this guest count growth, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. The next question is from Matt DiFrisco of Oppenheimer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just tell us where in the 2010 plans do you expect to do the refranchising? And then also if you could just give us some commentary or greater detail as far as looking at the contraction on the franchise margin, especially in the U.S. What is behind that? Or &#x2013; just so we can have better modeling purposes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, I'll let Pete talk about the franchise numbers relative to the financials. But you're not going to see the same kind of wholesale activity we've had in the past relative to refranchising. We've done the bulk of it already. But it will continue to be done in the same markets that we've done it in over the past. We had stated we were going to refranchise about 1,500. We're well past the 1,100, almost 1,200 mark now. And so it's across the markets, and it's not significant really in the scheme of things. So the relationship's going to remain about the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Matt, regarding the franchise margins in the U.S., the comp was a little bit lower in the quarter, and there's a lot of fixed costs in that margin. So we had a little less leverage on that. But also, we've had, with the investments in the beverage initiative, we've had a little higher depreciation and amortization. But we also saw a little bit less impact from owner/operator incentives. So hopefully that helps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question is from Sara Senatore at Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question about comps, because you gave us an update in January. First, just generally speaking in the U.S., it got a little better in December, then it looks like you were saying it's sort of flattish in January. Is that just calendar shifts and overall trends have been pretty stable, or are we seeing something different December to January? Because I know it's sort of a choppy environment out there. And jumping over to the other side of the world with China, you said traffic was up, and it looks to me like deflation is trending down. So should we expect to see pricing get a little better there, too? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that was two questions. First on the United States &#x2013; and then I'll let Pete talk a little bit about the pricing and the relationship with China. But I think in the U.S., the trends are actually better in January when you factor out weather. Weather has been &#x2013; had a tremendous impact on our trends here in January. We don't normally like to talk about weather, but we can't avoid it when you look at the first 14 or 15 days of the month and the severity of the weather. I think it was impacting us probably around 3% a day in the sales, because whenever we had the weather that was normalized, we saw much better results. And so if anything, I would say that the trends are a little bit better than they were in December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Sara, regarding China, a couple of things. One, yes, we did report positive sales and guest count movement in December. You won't see that in January, though, because we have the shift of the Chinese New Year. So last year that was in January, and this year it'll be in February. So by comparison, that will be a little bit choppy. But we're optimistic in what we're seeing with the trends. We've talked about China in the south and the central and the north. So we saw all three of those areas improving in December and are kind of cautiously optimistic as the consumer starts to spend a little more money there that we will then be able to get a little bit more out of price and get a little more traffic moving there. So that's a perspective for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. The next question is from David Tarantino at Robert Baird.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Another follow-up question on the U.S. comp trend. It looked like traffic might have picked up fairly considerably when you adjust for pricing rolling off in December and the weather comment you just made. What do you think is driving that better trend? Is it the industry trends are getting better? Or do you think that it's some of your initiatives, such as maybe more marketing allocation towards the Dollar Menu?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's &#x2013; as you know, David, we launched the Dollar Menu at breakfast nationally. We have a very strong national voice against breakfast right now. All of our franchisees are on board, and we have a lot of messaging out there about the Dollar Menu. Not only all day, but now breakfast, and then the Mac Snack Wrap that we've talked about. So I think it's more about our initiatives and the communication around the menu.</p>
          <p>And because really when you look at trends in the industry, and you look at the spending of our consumers and the consumer confidence, even though it's edged up over the last couple of months, with the unemployment where it is, until we start to see job creation and we start to see people get comfortable with the fact that they have a place to go to work and have a steady income, we're not going to see, in my opinion, enormous pickups or a big change relative to the trends in consumer spending.</p>

And we're well on our way with the frappes; the smoothies are a little bit behind that. But we expect to be ready to go in the summertime.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Just one quick follow-up on the breakfast menu, the value menu. Can you tell us what you expect that that will mix as far as contribution revenues and what the economics of the product are? And then on the U.S. margin side for the quarter, 20.3% company-operating margin, I think that's the best quarterly margin you've put up, at least as far back as my model goes. I recognize commodity costs are a big driver of that, but in anticipation of maybe the environment getting worse, did you guys get more aggressive in other &#x2013; and pull over levers to control the margin side of things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Steve. I'll let Pete talk about the margin in a minute. But the mix on the Dollar Menu and the contribution of that and the Mac Snack Wrap, for example, now it's too soon to tell. We just started. We really don't have a good feel for how it's going to shake out over time. But we are very pleased with the economics around it. Otherwise we probably wouldn't have done it, one. Number two, with the support of our franchisees and everybody being all the way in on this, we think that it gives us the opportunity to deliver fairly well around that Dollar Menu. But it's too early to really tell you exactly what the details of that are because we don't have the data.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Steven, on that, before I get into the total margin question. It was a relatively low increase we needed in transactions in the U.S. from the Dollar Menu breakfasts to be margin dollar neutral. And so we feel pretty confident we'll be able to hit that.</p>
          <p>But in terms of the total margin in the U.S., for the fourth quarter, the 20.3%, it was &#x2013; 75% of that was driven by the commodities. And then the rest basically the refranchising. You saw comps were relatively flat. So we really didn't get anything out of the sales line. So it was really the costs and the refranchising benefit. There were no other special levers or anything like that, which gives us confidence in the environment moving forward with the commodity costs remaining benign, as we can move that top line a little bit more, that we'll be in pretty good shape.</p>

          <p>&#x2013; year about growing share in a declining in the market in the U.S., but your system sales grew 3%, so you clearly actually were more than sort of neutral there. So can you talk about how much share you think you took in 2009 and how much you think the informal eating-out market contracted this past year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it varies by market, John. But we grew our informal eating-out market share really in every segment of the world. So if you look at the U.S., for example, we were up about 0.2 or 0.3% to about 11.3%. And when you really look at &#x2013; that's a pretty big number when you really think about the size of the informal eating-out market. And it varies around the world, but we had increases in every market.</p>
          <p>And I can't tell you how much informal eating out declined in every market around the world, because it certainly varies. But it has either been stagnant or shrinking in most markets. And most of our growth in 2009 came from share growth around the world.</p>

          <p>&#x2013; further into sales trends dynamics in China. The sense I'm getting is that lower-price chains like McDonald's, KFC, are generally struggling but higher-price chains might be struggling even worse. A fair amount of discounting going on in the quick service environment. If you could talk about some of those details, that would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think on an overall basis, the pricing relationships in China in the quick-service restaurant industry are an interesting dilemma because of who you're competing against, which is a very low-priced menu on the street, from the non sort of chain of restaurants and food available. And we are not necessarily discounting, but what we are doing is getting our pricing right in the relationship for the economic time that we find ourselves in, which is an ongoing pricing relationship as compared to a discounting of our food. And it moves up and down the scale depending on where we find ourselves in the consumer spending. And as we've said, I think the environment in China, which basically fell off a cliff after the 2008 Beijing Olympics, we've adjusted accordingly along the way to be relevant with our consumers, and it's worked well for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I was just wondering if you could talk to the strategies that you're pursuing to support check, just given the step-up both in the breadth of value offerings and as well your marketing support of those efforts. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Jeff, specifically I'll talk a little bit about the U.S., but these kind of comments apply around the world. As you know, it's a market share battle out there, so focusing on driving customer counts is important. But we need some other elements to help keep the average check from falling off a cliff. So things like in the U.S. the Mac Snack Wrap, which is both a transaction driver and also something that can either trade people up from the Dollar Menu or add on to an extra value meal as a margin enhancer. You think about the next phase of the beverages rolling out in the U.S., the frappes and the smoothies. Those are very nice margin and average check enhancers, if you will.</p>
          <p>We're seeing &#x2013; and it's early in these tests, but we're seeing a nice trade between the espresso-based coffees, which are over 50% in the morning, and these smoothies and frappes are a much smaller percent in the morning and a much greater percent in that kind of snack daypart, which should help fill in there. And in the U.S. also, you think about the Angus Burger, that wasn't necessarily a traffic driver, but it was a trade-up mechanism that delivered more in the margins.</p>
          <p>So taking that and summarizing for the rest of the world, kind of that focus on some premium products, the focus on beverages, the focus on fourth-tier menus are some of the things that we're doing that are helping balance that check and traffic part of the equation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Jeff, if I could, I think a number of these frappe, smoothie, and even in McCafe have generated some new visits, and those new visits have also generated food sales, and so that's been helpful. But at the same time, the Dollar Menu experience and the trading against that has remained about the same. So all of these other items that are on the menu have picked up our opportunity relative to average check.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks. Just a follow-up on some of the commodity questions. It looks like your consolidated food and paper costs fell by about 180 bips in the fourth quarter. So how should we think about that number in 2010, given the outlook for relatively flat commodity costs this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, we don't provide that kind of forward-looking guidance with &#x2013; there's so many moving parts, how much our price is going to increase, that are going to impact the base that we're measuring that food and paper change off of. So &#x2013; product mix also impact that. So we're not really forecasting that. But we are optimistic obviously with the commodity costs at the levels that we're seeing them.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a question on the European company margins. Pete, you shared with us that because of the importing of food into Russian and some of the Eastern European markets that the food costs were slightly negative. You mentioned labor and utilities being negative. Yet you got a big bump, positive bump, in the company margin. I'm wondering what else was left there that you leveraged?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We did &#x2013; Joe, while the food and paper costs had a slight negative impact for the quarter, compared to the previous quarter, if you're looking sequentially, they were over 100 basis points better, the food and paper impact. So a lot of the impact is coming from more benign food and paper costs, and the strong comp we had there in the quarter, and refranchising. So that's really the items.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just a little more color on the outlook for food costs and pricing. We've seen some of the commodities starting to lap the more favorable trends from 2009, particularly cheese and ground beef. Just wondering how high your confidence level is in that flat number. I mean, you guys had some of the big items pretty much locked in for the year, and just your thoughts on pricing. If you were to see some movement in some of these items against you, do you feel like you could take some price at this point? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jason. As we look at how we finished 2009, I would say generally around the world, we probably had about a percent less in price on average between the U.S. and all the major markets. And as we head into 2010, it's probably going to be even a little bit less compared to 2009, probably at where we are or down a little bit.</p>
          <p>You appropriately point out that we looked for opportunities to lock in our costs when we can. We're able to do a little bit more of that in the U.S. versus Europe and APMEA, but we're becoming more active in those markets as well. And we're constantly looking at the marketplace to see do we have opportunities to raise price without negatively impacting the traffic?</p>
          <p>It's quite interesting when you look at the difference a year makes. A year ago, we had all our teams around the world doing scenario planning for what's going to happen if the environment gets a lot worse. Well, today, those scenario planning discussions are around making sure we're able to catch the upswing when it comes and how are we going to be able to take advantage of that? So we are really focused on being able to maximize that top line when we do see the rebound.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. A couple questions on beverages. Pete, I believe in the third quarter in the U.S., company margins were up about 110 bips and then up 150 bips in the fourth quarter. Is there any way to pull out what the increasing beverage mix contributed to that margin expansion? And with the smoothies and frappes coming out, is that in fact a margin enhancer, a percent margin enhancer, as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mitch, no is the short answer to the first part. But it was &#x2013; that sequential change, it was definitely an improvement in all commodity costs that helped the margin in the fourth quarter, offset by less sales in the fourth quarter. And as we look at the impact of the frappes and smoothies going forward, we are optimistic that on a per-unit basis that it is accretive to margins on a percentage basis. And in tests, while it's early, we aren't going to give unit movements, but if you think about those two products, they are a lot closer in to the core McDonald's customer and the core McDonald's menu compared to the espresso-based coffees. So we are starting to see some pretty nice movement in the test markets. So we're optimistic on the impact that can have later on in the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Obviously remodels are increasing in importance in fiscal '10, and they'll be a multi-year process for you. As you begin to finish Europe, I presume that the U.S. will receive more of the attention longer term. Is it possible for you to talk about what your remodel cash contribution is in the U.S., what the franchisees are, and what kind of sales lift that you're seeing from that expense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John, thanks for the question. Let me just start, and then I'll let Pete talk a little bit about the contribution mechanism that we've used over the years. It varies by market, of course. We're still wrestling with it here in the U.S., but he might be able to add some more texture to that.</p>
          <p>But we're reinvesting more in reimaging and remodelings across the board. We don't wait for Europe to be finished and then give more allocation to the United States. Everybody has their own plan. We've accelerated the plan across the board, and so it's not about waiting for one segment to get done so we can start the other. We have plenty of wherewithal to do it on a consistent basis in every segment.</p>
          <p>And Pete, do you want to talk about the contribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We know, John, that reinvesting with our operators is the right thing to do to help accelerate these initiatives and give them the scale more quickly. And we know from our test markets that there's plenty of cash flow and return for both us and the owner/operators.</p>
          <p>On this specific U.S. initiative that's going to move forward, we do not have a final decision on what that contribution is going to be. So once we get that figured out, we will be able to communicate that. But I wouldn't expect it to be dramatically different from what we've done in the past or dramatically different from what we've done with something like the beverage initiative. But until we get that worked out, and finalized, we don't want to share that. But definitely it is focused on allocating returns at appropriate levels for us and the owner/operators.</p>
          <p>And when we do the full reimage, we don't have a whole lot of them done in the U.S., but we do know from other markets that generally we see a 6 to 7% sales lift relative to the overall &#x2013; to the rest of the marketplace. When we do the holistic reimage, meaning a really nice blowout job on the dining room and the inside, along with the exterior of the building and the landscaping and everything.</p>

          <p>Well, Greg, thanks for the question. We expect to keep the pedal to the metal, if you will, relative to value everywhere in the world. Because I don't see much changing. More importantly, we've had a fairly steady contribution relative to value messaging over the past few years, in recessionary and nonrecessionary times, because it's extraordinarily important for our customers to understand everyday affordability at McDonald's exists in the good times and bad times, which why it was fairly easy for us to continue to support the Dollar Menu across the United States, and then of course our everyday affordability in other segments of the business. Because that's the way we've structured our menu and the understanding of the consumer expectation.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just one follow-up question on kind of the approach to promotional activity and pricing. We've talked about unemployment. We've talked a little about commodities. When you think about what the determining factors will be that are going to influence your approach, are those the primary things? Does a return to inflation in the at-home food markets, does that help? How do you rank the determining factors that influence your approach to pricing and promotional activities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just say, in some cases, we would like to say it's that scientific. It's really as much an art as it is a science, because we do take all of those things into consideration to factor it. But on a wholesale basis, it's intuitive to understand our pricing, relative to the consumer. So when we talk about not having as much pricing elasticity that Pete had talked about earlier, because of commodities and other kinds of things in the past, or certainly the inflationary environment and more importantly the consumer confidence and the unemployment, we don't have as much pricing power as we might have had.</p>
          <p>And so we really don't even talk about how we're able to pass on any costs that we might have to absorb when we do our pricing models and how we communicate with our consumers around value. We decide that it's important for us to continue to have everyday affordability, present to our consumers a value proposition that makes us a compelling choice relative to eating out when they choose to eat out. And all those factors are considered. But we do that on a regular basis, not just during recessionary times. And of course, since we've been in this situation now, some would argue, for more than two years, it continues to be the consumer insight that we use and make our decisions around. And it doesn't necessarily leverage any movement back and forth, determining the strength around our messaging except to say that it's been fairly consistent.</p>

          <p>Great. Thank you very much. On breakfast, can you give us a sense of where it stands today as far as mix of sales in the U.S.? Is it still at 25%? And then you talked about January, you're going to roll it out, the Dollar Menu, systemwide across the U.S. Can you give us a sense, at the start of the fourth quarter and end of the fourth quarter, what percent of your system already had the Dollar Menu in place at breakfast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a small percentage at the end of the fourth &#x2013; or the beginning of the end of the fourth quarter on the Dollar Menu at breakfast. The breakfast percentage does remain the same as a big piece of our business if you look at it that way. And the Dollar Menu and the voice around Dollar Menu will certainly help our growth. And by the way, we grew breakfast in '09 not only in the fourth quarter but year-to-date December, which was not an easy feat considering the fact that we were faced with the unemployment we were. And second of all, we had a very strong '08 with the McSkillet and the Chicken Biscuit introduction. And so we had some numbers to overcome there, and we're very proud of our results. And our consumers have rewarded us because they know the great value there is to breakfast in our restaurants.</p>

          <p>Great. Thank you. I guess my question specifically is if you can give us some more color on the return on capital trends you're seeing in Eastern Europe, and Russian in particular, and what other kind of real-world impacts I guess you're seeing on those returns from these &#x2013; the cross-border transaction issues. And perhaps if you'd maybe give us updates on the supply chain efforts you're doing to help mitigate these impacts.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Paul, it's Pete. Listen, obviously what you're seeing on the impact on the commodities in our Eastern and Central European markets is having a little bit of a hit to the profitability there. So just by doing the math, our returns are down a little bit. But the reality is, we're still getting good returns in those parts in the world. And there's still great opportunity to grow there. So we're going to continue to invest capital there. When we look at opportunities to mitigate the impact, we do have to make some of these cost-benefit type trade-off decisions around, can we hedge at an effective cost or are we comfortable just kind of letting it ride?</p>
          <p>We were a little surprised to see the ruble still down against the dollar in the fourth quarter. We thought it might snap back a little bit by that. But Russia in December was strong. We saw good sales for the year in Russia, and it continues to be a highly profitable and great long-term market for us. So there's really no concerns in the returns perspective there, and we're going to continue to do our best to mitigate the impact of the currencies but not overpay for any protection.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Back in &#x2013; just since this last year and going into the summer, it felt like the consumer environment was getting tougher. In retrospect, did you reallocate marketing dollars and attention a little bit away from some of the things that might have been more incremental, the premium stuff, the beverages, and towards value in a very meaningful way in terms of dollars? And conversely, when things change, and if indeed the consumer comes back and things become a little bit more receptive to those incremental sales, will that get a disproportionate amount of the dollars in the future?</p>

          <p>Well, we'll make that call when the time comes. I'll be anxious to make that decision, the U.S. will. I think the interesting thing to point out around media is that we're a 52-week communicator on media in every segment of the business. We did not pull back on communication with our consumers in the media spend in any respect. If anything, we got more efficiencies during this downturn because of our buys. And yes, the answer is yes, that we did put a little more effort against breakfast and value in the U.S. in terms of dollars spend against media.</p>

          <p>Thank very much. Do you think the shift in the Dollar Menu at breakfast is permanent? Meaning, is this something that will help you get through 2010, and if the economy gets better you'll remove it, or &#x2013; ?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I wanted to follow up my first question. Because either you didn't understand the question or I didn't understand the answer. And then I had another question. The second question is did the McCafe sales mix build as the cold weather took place? Is the product a little bit more seasonal than perhaps you expected, or is it &#x2013; discuss the seasonality of that product. And then Pete, back to Europe for a moment. The European company margin was up 130 basis points?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I understood your answer or some of your comments in the call, food costs sounded like they were up, labor costs were up, and utilities up as a percent of sales. And I'm just not understanding how you get 130 basis points of improvement if you got the major cost items like that all negative?</p>

          <p>The coffee did spike up some. The McCafe products spike up some during the colder weather, and some of that was a really a shift away from some of the iced tea and some of the other beverage initiatives as the weather cooled off, if you will.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Joe, regarding the margin in Europe. So if I look at the progression, the 130 basis point improvement for the quarter, we got pricing, and traffic gave us a lot of growth there. And relatively flat food and paper, so slightly negative, 30 basis points. And a similar benefit from refranchising as we had going forward. So nothing else really unusual. It was really top-line driven, with modest cost increases and the benefit from refranchising.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much. And just in the U.S., more of a bigger-picture question. Labor has been somewhat of an ongoing pressure. I don't know if you mentioned it in the fourth quarter. There is no minimum wage increase, obviously the unemployment rate is up. Do you think relative labor expense could work in your favor in 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Mitch, in terms of labor rates, I think maybe we saw about a 3% increase in the average wage throughout the year. Probably something very similar to that going forward, maybe a little bit less. But really on the labor side, we're focused more on driving more productivity so more transactions per crew hour. And that's where we're able to mitigate and have some benefits actually on the labor line as we focus on those efficiencies.</p>

          <p>Yes. Thank you. In regards to your future CapEx of $2.2 billion, should we expect that investment to generate a higher return on existing equity? Or could it be capping out at these levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, we continue to operate under our targets of getting returns on &#x2013; and incremental invested capital in the high teens. And so our expectations on these increases are that we will continue to see returns in that level or better as we move forward. So we're not lowering our standard in an effort to increase the CapEx.</p>
