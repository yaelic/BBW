          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. A special welcome to those of us joining on the phone and the webcast today. This morning we'll be presenting the results for the Commonwealth Bank for the six month ended 31 December, 2009. Process is as we would only do it. Ralph will first present followed by David, then we'll throw the floor open to question and answers. I understand there are some media on the phone. Prefer media to keep their questions until the media conference this afternoon at 2:00.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, I'll hand off to Ralph. Thank you. Ralph?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Warwick, and good morning to you all. As you're aware, the Commonwealth Bank has today reported a strong operating result in an improving but still challenging trading environment. As we played to the market some weeks ago, cash earnings for the six months to December were $2.9 billion, an increase of 54% on the prior corresponding period. Return on equity was up 500 basis points to 18.5%. Tier 1 capital strengthened to 9.1% and cash earnings per share were up 42% to $1.91.</p>
          <p>This is a strong result built on good income growth and continuing cost discipline. Relevant to the position 12 months ago, the result also benefited from a reduction in an impairment expense as the worst of the bad debt cycle appears to have passed, and improving equity markets, which drove a strong turnaround in investment experienced in this period.</p>
          <p>Whilst we're clearly operating in a more favorable economic environment, risks and uncertainties do remain and I will talk a little more about those later. Given this degree of uncertainty, the Group has retained its conservative business settings including strong provisioning, capital and liquidity levels.</p>
          <p>I'd like to make the point that today's result is not by &#x2013; it is by design, it's not by luck. All of our businesses are performing strongly and there is good momentum across the entire Group. Our ability to weather the worst of the financial crisis and emerge in a position of relative strength is testimony to a consistent, clearly defined, and well executed strategy which the team has put in place over the past three years.</p>
          <p>The interim dividend increased $0.07 to $1.20, restoring the payout ratio for the interim dividend to pre GFC levels of 63%. Since early 2006 the Commonwealth Bank has consistently pursued a simple, clear strategic plan with the objective of becoming Australia's finest financial services organization through excelling in customer service. To achieve this goal, we've focus our energies on delivering our five core strategic priorities.</p>
          <p>Improving customer satisfaction has consistently appeared at the top of our agenda. With many successful examples, including the adding of over 1,000 customers facing staff across the Group, the continual refining of our market leading customer system CommSee, and the ongoing upgrade of our Retail branch network, utilizing new and innovative concepts to drive branch performance. Readdressing our underweight position in business banking has seen us invest in new technology like CommBiz, widen our distribution platform with the addition of more Business Banking Centres, improving our back office processing, and introducing new and innovative product offerings for our customers.</p>
          <p>Technology and operational excellence has been extremely important in building competitive advantage and our investment in this area has seen us cement our position as the leader in online banking in this country with our NetBank, CommSec, CommBiz and FirstChoice platforms. The profitable growth leg has seen us strengthen our domestic franchise with the value enhancing acquisitions like Aussie and Bankwest, as well as increasing our presence in Asia, particularly in Indonesia.</p>
          <p>Our people are our most valuable resource and much of our recent success can be attributed to the significant cultural transformation which has occurred right across the Group, as we have focused on delivering our Trust and Team Spirit initiatives. The result is that today the Commonwealth Bank is a significantly stronger and more dynamic organization than it was three years ago. In many respects, the degree of change has been transformational. And this slide lists just a few of our achievements.</p>
          <p>In terms of customer satisfaction, from a position of being a clear last some three years ago, we are now seeing consistent improvement across every sector of our business. Improved customer satisfaction is translating into stronger market shares in all of our key markets. In home lending, three years ago our market share was in long-term decline. Today, driven by the revamp of our branch network, the embedding of a strong sales and service ethic, and continual improvements in our back office processing capabilities, we are consistently growing well ahead of system.</p>
          <p>In business lending, the acquisition of Bankwest has boosted our underweight position and there remains significant upside potential in this part of our business. In deposits, we have further strengthened our market leading position with our entire suite of Retail deposits and transaction accounts now rated five star by CANNEX.</p>
          <p>Concurrent with these gains in customer satisfaction and market share, we've grown our products per customers at a rate well ahead of our peers. Given the size of our customer base, this uplift in products per customers translates into significant revenue benefit for us. On the technology front, our systems are significantly more customer friendly, have much greater functionality, and are materially more reliable than they were three years ago.</p>
          <p>By way of example, the number of Severity 1 incidents has reduced from around 65 per annum to just five in the first half of this year. Investment in our back office processing has yielded significant improvements in processing times, productivity levels and customer service rates. The extent of this transformation is testimony to the drive, energy and engagement of our people. And it is most pleasing to me that we've been able to improve our level of employee engagement to the point where we are now rated in the top 20% of all companies in the Gallup worldwide database, and one of the highest of the banks.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have delivered for our shareholders, ranking number one in total shareholder returns relative to our domestic peers over the last one, two, three, four and five years. So while our progress to date is pleasing, we recognize that there's still a lot of potential left and one of the most important keys to unlocking these opportunities is our commitment to being number one in customer satisfaction. This is the Group's top priority.</p>
          <p>I also have high expectations of our Core Banking Modernisation project which will transform our Retail and Business and Private Banking operations. Core Banking Modernisation represents the next key phase in the evolution of our technology capability, something which will deliver a clear and distinct strategic advantage over coming years.</p>
          <p>Two years into this four-year project, Michael Harte, Dave Curran and their team are making excellent progress, and have already delivered real customer capability. They have a successful implementation of three products on the new system, a first time saver account, the CFS term deposit account, and our Online Saver account. Yes, the system is live.</p>
          <p>In addition, we recently achieved an important milestone with the seamless migration of 20 million customer records on to the system. Our next major initiative is the migration of all of our term deposit products which is scheduled to occur later this month. This will be followed later in the calendar year by all of our Retail deposit and transaction accounts, and our Business and Private Banking customers. Lending products are scheduled to migrate across next year. Once completed, this comprehensive overhaul of our core banking systems will see a significant reduction in our cost of doing business. And more importantly, we'll improve the way we interact with our customers.</p>
          <p>Looking at our individual business units, all have full strategic and operational agendas for the balance of the year. In our Australian Retail Banking business, which has very strong momentum, we're still looking to improve performance of our distribution channels and we'll continue to invest in the branch network, particularly in areas where we see potential for strong volume and share growth. Continuing to drive our sales and service and productivity programs will remain a priority for Ross McEwan and the Retail Banking team as they seek to harness the significant opportunities that core banking will provide to consolidate our position as Australia's leading retail bank.</p>
          <p>Under the leadership of Ian Narev, Business and Private Banking has identified a number of opportunities to improve their performance. Like the Retail bank, productivity and customer service are key ingredients in building this business. They also recognise the importance of distribution and are looking for further leverage of our network of business banking centres and the branch network.</p>
          <p>At Institutional Banking and Markets, improving economic conditions coupled with the investments in new technology and initiatives to build capabilities to offer corporate clients a wider range of products and services will provide Ian Saines and his team with growth opportunities in the medium term.</p>
          <p>Similarly, in the Wealth Management space, our combination of our scale, our market leading and low cost distribution platforms, and recent initiatives with CFS GAM to build capability and capacity particularly in our offshore businesses, place Grahame Petersen and his team in a great position to leverage improvements in both domestic and global investment markets.</p>
          <p>Overlaying these organic growth opportunities, we remain interested and prudent on strategy acquisitions, but only where we can see a compelling value proposition for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Before turning to the outlook, I want to comment briefly on the issue of regulatory reform of the global banking system. As you know, there are initiatives covering a number of areas including capital, liquidity and provisioning. David Craig in his presentation will talk about these in greater detail. However, those advocating the need for change have expressed the view that they are necessary to address a major failure in the global banking system.</p>
          <p>In reality, that failure was primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, and parts of Continental Europe. Outside of these markets, most banks performed reasonably well, although few were able to avoid the impacts of the liquidity crunch. The follow-on is likely to be felt for some time to come. While liquidity has improved, the cost at which banks can access wholesale funding does remain at elevated levels.</p>
          <p>As I observed earlier, Australia largely avoided the impacts of the global financial crisis with all of the major banks coming through this period in a strong financial position. This can be attributed to a range of factors including the fact that our banks were well managed with more conservative business models, which discouraged high risk lending and widespread exposure to toxic subprime assets. The Australian government introduced guarantees to support the financial system. But it should be noted that not $1 of taxpayer money has gone to our banks. In fact, the Australian taxpayer will benefit to the tune of $5.5 billion from the wholesale funding guarantee over its life.</p>
          <p>As you're aware, last weekend the government announced the removal of the funding guarantee from 31 March this year. This decision will not impact on our ability to continue to raise sufficient funding through offshore markets. So while I accept there is need for regulatory reform, we must be careful that Australia, which has a healthy banking system and an effective and well managed regulatory regime, is not materially disadvantaged by changes driven by poor practices in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
          <p>As I've said before, one of the reasons why the Australian economy performed so well over the last 18 months was because the banks were able to support their customers. Strong economies and banking systems are not mutually exclusive, and I don't know of any strong economy which has a weak banking system. In this respect, I believe that the Australian government and our regulators recognise the risks associated with regulatory change.</p>
          <p>I'm hopeful based on recent interactions I've had with them, that at the conclusion of this review of banking regulation, we will end up with a regime which addresses the reasonable concerns of regulators without imposing requirements which have significant negative consequence for our customers and ultimately the broader Australian economy through constraining the growth of credit and at significantly higher costs.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the outlook, over the last six months the outlook for the global and domestic economy has improved to the extent that Australia now appears to be on the road to a sustainable economic recovery. That is likely to bring with it a gradual improvement in demand for credit in the 2010 calendar year, accompanied by continued upward pressure on funding costs.</p>
          <p>While it appears loan payment impairment expense has peaked, many of our customers are still finding conditions challenging, which means that further reductions in the loan and payment expense this year are expected to be gradual rather than dramatic. I'm optimistic about the medium-term outlook for the Australian economy and for the Group, but there are still some risks from international volatility which could impact on short-term performance.</p>
          <p>Clearly there is still some uncertainty about the speed of recovery for the global economy and perhaps more importantly for Australia, in the performance of our major trading partners, notably China and the United States. As a result of these macroeconomic factors and the uncertainty surrounding the impact of initiatives by global regulators on the banking sector in capital requirements and liquidity, the Group plans to retain its current conservative capital and liquidity settings for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I'll now hand over to David Craig, who will go through the results in greater detail. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, everybody, and welcome to our new corporate headquarters in Darling Park. I hope that you're finding the setting comfortable. It's my pleasure to talk to you about our strong operating performance, which really reflects a consistent performance across all parts of our business. Just to help you understand the result little better, we've restated the comparatives for December '08 to include Bankwest for the six months from June to December '08 so that you get a like-for-like comparative on a pro forma basis.</p>
          <p>So on a pro forma basis, our operating income is up 10% on this time last year while expenses have grown 6%, leading to 14% growth in operating performance. If we look at expenses just on the six month basis, in fact they've only grown 1%. So they're very much under control. As Ralph has highlighted and as you'd expect at this time of the cycle, we are seeing some improvement in impairment expense, with that dropping to 1.383 billion for this half year.</p>
          <p>The other significant factor that we highlighted at the time we made the announcement is that the investment experience has turned around. So this is &#x2013; at this time last year unrealized losses in marking-to-market positions in the Wealth business have not recurred, and so we've seen a return to a more normal situation with that. And those things have combined to see our cash net profit after tax up 54%.</p>
          <p>If we look at this on a business by business basis, firstly the Retail bank has very strong momentum, and in particular significant volume growth has driven the annual improvement of 20% and I'll go into that in little bit more detail in a few moments.</p>
          <p>In the Institutional Banking and Markets space, it's been a story of margin growth as well as significant growth in the new equities business and in our debt capital markets business as we return more towards the traditional Institutional Banking and Markets business and away from just straight balance sheet lending.</p>
          <p>Ian Narev's appointment to Business and Private Banking has seen a real focus in this area and attention and it's fantastic to see that every one of the businesses in that sub area have delivered double-digit growth. And in particular and I guess as you would expect at this time of the cycle, our CommSec has come back with a charge.</p>
          <p>In the Wealth Management business, we've seen a significant uptick in funds under management and good inflows into the Wealth business. However, as you would expect at this time of the cycle, there's a bit of a lag, and performance fees are down year-on-year, although very pleasingly, the profit for the last six months is up significantly on the prior period.</p>
          <p>Bankwest of course is a great success story, our newest part of our business, and you can see here a doubling of profitability from last year at the operating expense level. This is driven by volume, by margin improvement, and by customer gains, so a good story all around.</p>
          <p>South Pacific is fundamentally our New Zealand business, and unfortunately six quarters of negative growth in New Zealand have taken their toll, with increasing loan impairment expense and particularly higher retail funding costs. However, again more recently it's pleasing to see some abatement in that.</p>
          <p>And finally the other expenses include &#x2013; I'm going to talk about in a bit more detail, the defined benefits superannuation fund and the beginning of amortization of our new core banking system.</p>
          <p>So if we look at this on an income versus expense basis, as you know we try to manage to positive jaws across the Group and that's what the ten and six represents. And this has driven our cost to income ratio down to 44.6% this period. You can see here in the Retail bank 12% growth in revenue with only a 2% growth in cost.</p>
          <p>In the Institutional Banking and Markets space a 24% growth on the corresponding period last year. Now that's because this time last year with all the loan impairment expenses we didn't actually have a profit and therefore we didn't accrue any bonuses, whereas this time around there's much stronger performance and the corresponding improvement in bonuses in that area. As well as that, we're investing in this business in our new equities business and that's contributive. You'll see that on a six-monthly basis the costs in this business are only up 6%.</p>
          <p>Business and Private Banking have got very positive jaws, 13% revenue growth, 2% cost growth. The Wealth Management business year-on-year down, but interestingly on a six-monthly basis, a 17% increase in revenue and only 1% increase in costs. South Pacific's the New Zealand issue I referred to. And then of course you can see the stellar result in Bankwest with a 38% growth in revenue and a 4% growth in costs.</p>
          <p>Turning to operating income which is up 10% across the board, underwritten by 13% growth in banking income. I think the real things I want to highlight for you here though are that trading income is flat period-on-period, having come down &#x2013; it's a kind of cyclical business as we know, has come down from the height of the GFC and it's now returning to a more moderated level that we would expect to see on an ongoing basis. Pleasingly, after a dip in the June half, Funds Management and Insurance income is bouncing back.</p>
          <p>If we look at Group net interest margin, it's up two basis points on the last half. Now interestingly, it's now finally recovered to its June '06 level. So it's taken us three and a half years to get our Group net interest margin back to what you might say is a normal level. In terms of this period, the key drivers were a slight increase in pricing of two basis points offset by increased funding costs in transaction accounts and saving deposits.</p>
          <p>You'll see that this period we had an improvement of three basis points on investment deposits. That's because we chose to stand one step back from the very intense competition going on in the retail deposit share. We've let I guess the hot money flee and that's lost us some market share. We're now standing firm on that so you'll notice that more recently we've been re-engaging particularly, so I think that unfortunately we're not going to see any improvements in margin in this area. Funding is going to be a very expensive business going forward. And as we've held slightly fewer liquids, the liquids have added two basis points.</p>
          <p>Now if we just talk about funding, because I think there's been some confusion and misconception about this, when the GFC started, the first part of the story, the volatility in funding led to a significant gapping between the cash rare and the 90-day bill rate, and the 90-day bill rate is what we price off. And so we suffered a significant uptick in funding costs as a result of that, which you can see have moderated somewhat.</p>
          <p>But of course it's then the long-term funding costs, the fact that we are replacing long-term debt that was previously put on say, five-year debt at 17 basis points. We've new five-year debt at 140 basis points. As we roll over our long-term debt, there is a continuing increasing in underlying funding costs. And in aggregate, the two of those, the basis risk and the long-term wholesale funding, have added 104 basis points to our cost basis since they &#x2013; since the beginning of the GFC.</p>
          <p>But of course the other factor that is starting to be recognized is this fight for retail funding and the consequent increase in funding there. And again, this is one of these things that builds up over time, because if you take on a term deposit, you roll over a cheap deposit with a more expensive term deposit. And in the last period since the GFC started, that's added 118 basis points to the cost of retail funding.</p>
          <p>So then if you look at the blended cost for us, we're 58% retail funded, 42% wholesale funded, our aggregate funding costs have increased by 112 basis points for the Group since the GFC started. And unfortunately, both those retail funding costs and the long-term wholesale funding costs are only going to go in one direction because we are going to continue to see competition in both areas, and we're going to continue to see cheaper old funding replaced by more expensive new funding.</p>
          <p>If we look at expenses, it's pleasing firstly to note that although we've kept our expenses down 6% for the last year, 1% for the last six months, we are continuing to invest. And in the last 12 months we've invested over $1 billion in the business. So we're determined to make this a better business in the future.</p>
          <p>In terms of the increase in the last six months, really the main factor has been our defined benefit superannuation fund, because of lower returns and lower forecast returns going forward off our lower asset base in our superannuation fund, we've had to chip in more. That's had a P&amp;L impact of $64 million and really that's the prime reason for the 1% growth in costs.</p>
          <p>Turning now to impairment expense and as you can see, this is starting to moderate and as Ralph has said, we expect this to continue to moderate, but not in a dramatic fashion in the near term. You can see it from this time last year, we had to pick with single line exposures at 85 basis points. This time we're down to 55 basis points.</p>
          <p>If there's a disappointing factor in this result for me, it's that our Bankwest loan impairment continues at 313 million and this is working our way through that legacy book that we purchased at the time of the acquisition. And we're still working through that. We think we are well provisioned. And we've got &#x2013; we've really gotten near the bottom of it but frankly some of the East Coast and Queensland properties that were lent on by Bankwest have proved to be quite difficult to move.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the balance sheet provisions and you can see that we're continuing to remain very conservative in our aggregate provisions, having increased them to 3.45 billion. And in particular, we have further increased our management overlay to 1.4 billion. Now part of this increase in collective provision is just sheer volume. I mean this is a provision against a much higher loan base than we had this time last year.</p>
          <p>But of course as the impact of the downturn flows through, you'll see collective provisions moving into specific provisions and then in due course, specific provisions being written off. And so hence the increase in those specific provisions. Just giving you an overview though, we &#x2013; as you would know, the bank with its very large home loan portfolio has a relatively safer portfolio than most of its peers. But nonetheless, we've chosen to maintain a very high level of provisioning.</p>
          <p>And I guess most particularly, total provisions to credit risk weighted assets which takes account of that relative riskiness you can see that we're carrying a 2% provision against that, so the most conservative in our group.</p>
          <p>Having a look at credit quality, it's pleasing to see that arrears are dropping in some parts of our book, most noticeably across the Tasmania and New Zealand, but also in Bankwest. At the same time, we're seeing a slight uptick in the CBA arrears. This is primarily due &#x2013; as I have mentioned this time six months ago, primarily due to our customer assistance program.</p>
          <p>Fully one third of the arrears that you see here are due to the number of accounts that we've put on deferred terms. We still count them in arrears. I think technically some banks would take them out of arrears once they've really negotiated the term, but to be conservative we count them in there and we've given you both numbers to help you.</p>
          <p>As that position of collective rolls through to specific accounts, we're seeing impaired assets continue to rise. They've grown 600 million in the last six months. About half of that is to do with the range of Storm accounts that have now been classified as impaired. Pleasingly though, troublesome accounts which are one step further back in the line, have started to decline. And we're also seeing in the middle tier of our corporate accounts that upgrades are now starting to outnumber downgrades. So certainly in the corporate part of the book, good signs of improvement while still seeing that lagging impact on consumers of some increase in arrears.</p>
          <p>Now I thought because our Retail bank is such a significant part of the business, it was worth just explaining to you where its growth in profit has come from. And on a 12-month basis there's $126 million more profit. And the answer to the question is it's come from volume. Volume had an efficient cost delivery. So $371 million more volume, but only $29 million of cost to deliver that higher volume. The important message here is that while we've seen some recovery on home loan margins, this has been more than offset by fee cuts and by competition for deposits where we're passing on much better margins to our customers in the deposit base. And as you can see, in total in the last year we've passed on $396 million of benefit in our Retail bank to our customers.</p>
          <p>Now there is an enormous amount of confusion, debate, and possible changes in regulation and other changes as a result of the GFC. And clearly Australia is but one part of the world. I thought &#x2013; we have provided in the notes to the information that you've got handed out, some detailed impact statements on what each of these different things are likely to do to us. Some of them are positive, some of them are totally unknown, and some of them could be negative. But I thought I'd just highlight two or three of them to give you a sense of what's going on.</p>
          <p>On the capital side, although our current hybrids are likely to be grandfathered, it would appear that there'll be a move towards more ordinary capital over time and less reliance on hybrids, certainly as they've been structured. And we can see that potentially there'll be more deductions from Tier 1 capital. Doesn't appear as though those things are going to happen till the end of 2012, but certainly there's a lot of debate going on in that space. Our belief is that these are likely to have less of an impact on Australian banks because of the tighter rules that we've been using under APRA than under the international &#x2013; for the international banks.</p>
          <p>On liquidity, I think there's been quite a lot of coverage of APRA's proposed increase in liquidity from seven days of liquidity or one week to one month. For this bank, that would mean something like doubling the amount of minimum liquid assets that we would have to hold.</p>
          <p>One of the areas that hasn't been commented on very much is the international proposal of introducing a net stable funding ratio. Now what's proposed here is that for any assets on your balance sheet, so in our case of course that's loans, if they're not readily turnable into cash, then you have to fund them out of long-term debt, debt greater than 12 months, rather than out of short-term debt.</p>
          <p>Now if you think about Australian banks' balance sheets, and obviously particularly Commonwealth Bank's balance sheet, we have a very large home loan portfolio, which certainly in the current market you wouldn't describe as instantly liquefiable. So the theory is that we would have to fund the majority of our home loan portfolio out of long-term debt. Now obviously at the moment we use a blend of debt and that would mean that we'd have to substantially increase long-term funding.</p>
          <p>The combination of doubling liquid assets and increasing long-term debt would significantly reduce the capability of Australian banks to lend and would significantly increase interest rates, and obviously therefore have a very detrimental impact on the Australian economy. Now our regulators and the government are very aware of this. We have been in very constructive discussions with them. They're aware of this impact and I don't see any panic happening in Australia. But clearly this is something that we've got to work our way through to ensure that the Australian economy is not adversely impacted by global regulation.</p>
          <p>The other area I'd just like to highlight for you is proposed changes in accounting standards and particularly around provisioning. So the proposal here and again it has a very long lead time, is that we move from charging the profit and loss with loan impairment expense as incurred to an expected loss basis. And indeed the proposal is that you charge against interest income a fraction of the likely loss you might have over the whole life of the loan each and every period.</p>
          <p>Now we've done some preliminary modeling on this and we don't expect that this would lead to any particular change in our aggregate capital requirements, because there are already additional capital imposed on lending to ensure that &#x2013; or on provisioning to ensure that it's well provisioned. But it will, if it comes in its current form, certainly require a hell of a lot of work in modeling and some confusion, I'm sure. So this is all work in progress. I don't think anything's going to happen in the very near term, but obviously it is causing a lot of work and I suspect a lot of confusion in the markets.</p>
          <p>Now just turning very briefly to dividend per share and I think that if I was looking at market consensus, this is the one area that the analysts and ourselves have differed. From our point of view this is a dividend entirely consistent with the way we paid dividends in prior periods. That is we have always paid a much lower interim dividend, holding it back for the year end. In this case as you can see, at 63% payout ratio, we're right at the &#x2013; not only is it a record interim dividend, but it's right at the top end of payout of what we've done in the pre GFC period.</p>
          <p>Now having a look at our funding and of course with the announcement by the Treasurer over the weekend of the withdrawal of the government guarantee, it's timely to remember that in our case with 58% retail funding, only 5% of our total funding is actually government guaranteed. And in more recent times we've really not been doing very much government guaranteed funding at all. In the last quarter only 9% of our long-term funding was government guaranteed, and none of the short-term funding was guaranteed. So from our point of view, the transition will be of no consequence.</p>
          <p>Pleasing though and obviously important to see that we are continuing to extend the maturity of our long-term debt. It's now sitting at 3.7 years, up from 3.6 at June and 3.5 at December last year. And of course we're continuing to hold very significant liquid asset reserves.</p>
          <p>You can see that we've built up a very strong capital position, with 9.1% Tier 1 ratio. And on a U.K. basis so it can be compared to the European banks, that's a 12.4% capital ratio, which compares extremely favorably to our European colleagues or European competitors. Importantly with a 9.1% capital ratio we're holding a $6 billion buffer above our current Board minimum limit.</p>
          <p>So as Ralph has said, this result has come as a result of a long-term, clear focused strategy, which is delivering results. You'll see on the front of the presentations and the profit announcement, the tag line "Determined to be better than we have ever were" and that is what we're working on. This is a long-term journey that we're on. We have very good momentum in the business and clearly with the economy improving, and with loan and payment expense starting to reduce, and with our Wealth business obviously geared to an improvement in the capital markets, there's some good signs for the next half.</p>
          <p>However, there are a few headwinds which I should point out to you. I've obviously talked at length about long-term and wholesale funding costs and retail funding costs. Funding costs are going to continue to increase. I've also talked about the investment experience. We've had a bit of a one-off benefit on the corresponding period last year on that, but it's not likely to continue at that level going forward. We've managed to keep our costs under control, partly because we've had a wage freeze in place. However, because we're now doing better and because the economy is improved, we've passed on a 2% wage increase to our staff with effect from 1 January.</p>
          <p>There are three fewer working days in the second half. And finally as you know, we've passed on some benefits to our customers in the form of reduced fees. That's cost us between 50 and $60 million in the first half, and that will be doubled that in the second half.</p>
          <p>So returning to this result, which I think is a very good result and a quality result, we've seen strong income growth, up 10%, careful cost management with our costs only up 1% over the last half, a strong balance sheet with Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.1%, and still very conservative settings when it comes to our provisions with $1.4 billion of management overlay. These things though have combined to produce what's most important for me, which is a strong return to our shareholders of 18.5%.</p>
          <p>Ralph and I would now be delighted to answer any questions you have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Jon Mott from UBS. Just a question tying together a bit of the guidance you provided, that you expect demand for credit to accelerate but also then when you look at the funding side of it, you're seeing retail deposit competition continuing, wholesale funding process continuing to go up. So you look at the two together and obviously that means that there's going to be substantial pressure on your funding.</p>
          <p>And you're going to have to continue to pass through a lot of that to the customers, otherwise your margin's going to come under substantial pressure over the next 12 months, 24 months. Given the current political environment, do you actually expect to be able to do that and to be able to maintain margins or are we going to be in a period of margin decline again going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if you look at the history of margin compression over the last several years, we've traditionally worked on the basis of a 10 basis point contraction in margin. So we're now in the situation where the margin is back to where it was around June 2006. So I think it's fair to say that there are a couple of factors that are going to play into this. Obviously in parts of our business we're going to see some margin contraction as we go forward.</p>
          <p>It's also worthy to note in some parts of our business, we have a situation where the average margin will continue to climb. And that is really repricing for risk in areas of the business portfolio where there's still a reasonably significant proportion of loans which have not been repriced since the beginning of the crisis. So there is going to be a balancing situation here between on one side, contraction in some parts of the book, and some expansion in other parts of the book. But I would suspect that we've probably not too far off a high water mark as far as overall margin is concerned.</p>

        <plist>

          <p>Thanks, Warwick. David, can you help us reconcile the movement in the management overlay? I think the balance sheet overlay increased by about 50 million. There was a $189 million overlay through the P&amp;L. So where is the overlay sitting now between &#x2013; I think Bankwest was at 483 or 480 thereabouts in the last period, and how much of it can remain for economic uncertainty or when do we see some of that released?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we've ever given huge detail about the make up of all the different bits in the overlay, but in terms of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us some detail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But in terms of where it's going, clearly, Tom, you can only &#x2013; there will always be some overlay. I think we've said clearly the main part of that or a big chunk of it is we tend to carry about 20% for model and data error &#x2013; potential data error. So it's just an overlay that sort of applies across the whole balance sheet and that below will be there.</p>
          <p>But a range of the other overlays, be they for Bankwest for &#x2013; because we're dealing with an uncertain book and we're working away through it, be it because of economic &#x2013; like for example for bad times, those things are each individually justifiable based on the circumstances at the time and so inevitably will start to come down. But when will depend a little bit on obviously our confidence about the economy and our confidence about the different factors that we're providing against.</p>

          <p>David, James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. I just wanted to actually sort of chat about those headwinds that you just mentioned, sort of the margin, your wage increase and so forth coming through in the second half. Are you flagging to us that the underlying levels &#x2013; before the bad debts and tax, that the underlying result could actually be down in the second half relative to the first half?</p>
          <p>And just a follow-on question, I just wanted to get idea as to how much growth you guys think you can fund in terms of about both wholesale deposits and also in terms of the deposit growth going forward? I mean how much absolute growth can you guys fund over the next 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two difficult questions. Look, on the first one, no, we're not flagging. We're not &#x2013; and you know we don't, we're not flagging an increase or a decrease first half versus second half. What we're doing is giving you the same sort of information that we have. We're dealing in uncertain times obviously. Just to sort of &#x2013; before we get over exuberant, just to let you know that while there's some good things, there's also some one-off sort or things that won't necessarily recur in the second half, so really just to be as transparent as possible.</p>
          <p>As far as the question on funding is concerned, we're confident we can fund a steady increase in our balance sheet. But I think you've seen other banks talk about the relative imbalance where some banks have been funding growth and funding their customers and others haven't. Clearly there needs to be a bit of a return to balance, and particularly if funding costs keep going up, and particularly if we have problems in passing those costs on to our customers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In that respect and sort of consistent with James's line of questioning, does a return to a credit growth of 8 to 10%, which is some sort of multiple of normal GDP of perhaps 1.5 to 2 times, it actually makes sense going forward given the funding challenges which would seem to be presented to the Australian banks on liquidity and set a funding index targets that are sort of being set for banks globally?</p>

          <p>Oh, right. Well, the comment I'd make and obviously on page 14 of this pack, we have Michael Blythe's &#x2013; not only the statistics on what has happened in the past but Michael Blythe's forecast for the future. And I guess the comment I'd have to make most specifically is I think Michael Blythe has proved over the last 12 months at any rate, in fact through the GFC, to be the most accurate predictor.</p>
          <p>And so I wouldn't &#x2013; I don't pretend to be an economist and his system growth figures are certainly numbers that we think have some creditability. But look, as we all know, you can make cases for worse and better, but from our point of view, they're as good a guide as we can give because Michael's proved to be pretty good so far.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Matt Davison, Merrill Lynch. A question just on the current environment in deposits and the impact on overall growth rate margins, Ralph, you've talked about not willing to let any more deposit share go, and you're out there with a six month 3% rate TD this week. just wondering if that type of pricing environment continues, how the top section of slide 29 is going to track going forward in terms of that retail funding cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's no doubt that, Matt, that there is pressure on retail deposits. And certainly we're seeing a situation where a lot of the banks are obviously trying to rebalancing their portfolios between wholesale offshore funding and obviously local and retail funding. And so I don't think you'll see that situation diminishing anytime soon.</p>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that we would expect to probably see some reduction in the deposit margin, not significant. But I mean I also add the point that we have had and will continue to have the benefit of the flow on effect from our replicating portfolio, which did have a obviously possible impact in the first half so we see that continuing into the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just in terms of order of magnitude, if we did see the current pricing continue, that blue section of that chart, could we see that rise another 50 bips overall? And obviously that...?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard Wiles, Morgan Stanley. Ralph, just in relation to the dividend, you've been pretty specific in saying that the payout ratio in the first half was in line with the pre GFC levels. Is that suggesting that in the second half, you'd like to get into the high 80s so that the full year payout ratio is consistent with pre GFC levels? And more broadly, does the potential changes to capital requirements pose a threat to dividend payout ratios in the remaining term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly, Richard, as far as payout ratios are concerned, we have obviously for the interim returned to what has been our pre GFC stance. We obviously don't make a decision on dividend payout until we've reached the end of the financial year and know exactly what our position is. But I think it's fair to say that all things being equal, we would like to see ourselves get back to something closer to what we were doing prior to the GFC.</p>
          <p>But you are right, there are issues on around capital. We're obviously generating good capital. I mean we would expect to see obviously Tier 1 ratio maintained around the level it is at the moment through the balance of this year. But it's probably a little early to say, but certainly our intention would be to try and recover our dividend back to the level it was previously. But going forward obviously there are a lot of imponderables until we know exactly what the situation is going to be as far as Tier 1 capital composition, what's in, what's out.</p>
          <p>And when those decisions are finally made, understanding what the transitional periods will be because I don't think we're going to see a situation where these requirements will happen overnight as from the point of view of having to be initiated. And particularly when you look at a number of the banks offshore, APRA has had a much more &#x2013; a much tighter definition around Tier 1 capital than has been the case offshore. And therefore the impact of any changes in regard to Tier 1 capital are going to be significantly more of a issue for offshore banks as they have to obviously build significantly higher levels of capital compared to where they are today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. My question is about the overseas net interest margin. So really New Zealand, mentioned on page 63 in the profit announcement. If I look at the composition in terms of the cost of interest bearing liabilities and also the benefit of interest free liabilities, there's a bit of movement there. Wondering whether you could talk us through the dynamics in there, especially given the sort of competition for retail deposits happening in New Zealand? And what is your outlook for that part of the business for the second half in terms of the net interest margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, Johan, the interest margins in New Zealand have been under pressure for a long time. Our margin overall in New Zealand has stayed reasonably flat with where it was in the last half. I think we &#x2013; around 1.62, 1.63, 163 basis points. But David might like to expand a little bit more on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's two elements to what you're looking at there, Johan. Overseas obviously includes anything that's offshore. And in particular we were able to make good margin in our global Institutional Banking and Markets business, particularly in London, as there was a flight to quality into the AA credit rating during the height of the GFC. So they &#x2013; that gives us a margin boost in our offshore funds.</p>
          <p>As Ralph has said, in New Zealand we've been able to keep margins reasonably stable, but there's an &#x2013; they're off a lower base and there is an increased fight I guess for retail funds going on in New Zealand at the moment, which is certainly putting margins under pressure. But there's been more common sense I think in the underlying margins over there.</p>

          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. Two related questions if I may, the first one is there seems to be some weird seasonality in the generation of franking credits at Commonwealth Bank. And if you have a look at the franking credits per share, it's gone from being comfortably covering what the market would have expected the dividend to be, down to being 0.13, $0.14. What I'd like to get a feeling is this &#x2013; is this past generation of franking credits, is that demonstrative of what we're seeing in the business? And would that actually put pressure on the payout ratio going forward on a fully franked basis?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, David, it's a question I ask every year which is always a bit of fun, but if you have a look on page 95, there's the inevitable...?</p>

          <p>Well, Brian, the answer to the last question is easy for us, because the answer is we don't know. It's not at all clear that the Basel III information hasn't gotten to that level of detail. And as you know that's an area that's been examined by regulators a lot and so far they've not chosen to make any change. We know that you champion the cause, but fortunately so far they've been very comfortable with...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But &#x2013; whatever, as I said from a treatment point of view, APRA is happy with the treatment as it is now. Under Basel III, we don't know what the treatment will be and as Ralph has said, were there to be a change, it would be 75 basis points. But there's certainly no suggestion of that in the short term.</p>
          <p>As to your other question which was about franking credits, yes, I think it's timing differences. We've gotten the &#x2013; our ongoing franking credit generation will be consistent with what it has been, so it won't be any limit on dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a timing difference, whether it's all in the second half, but it'll &#x2013; our ongoing generation is going to remain consistent over the long term. And so it won't have any impact on dividends.</p>

          <p>Japan Bank for International Corporation. This is a question addressing to earlier on you mentioned that because the Australian government, there's the 5.5 billion guarantee is due to expire. And with your Tier 1 capital ratio, you mentioned that you were going to raise sufficient fund. Can you be more specific about that in terms of when and in terms of the methods and stuff like &#x2013; ?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have an ongoing funding program so, so far, the '010 year, we've raised $40 billion in funding. And certainly we don't see any issues or problems around our funding capability. Our name is very strong, we have a AA credit rating, and certainly we have not seen any issues or problems in regard to the acceptability of our name in local and international markets. So at this point we will continue with the similar initiatives that we've carried out in previous years.</p>
          <p>We have a very intensive debt road show capability, we'll have our debt raising road show immediately following this particular results announcement. And certainly all the feedback that we are getting, we don't see any particular issues there. But I'd just like to ask our Treasurer Lyn Cobley if she'd like to add anything to that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'd just reflect what Ralph said is exactly right. I mean the perception of CBA in the international markets is extremely strong. And we are seen as a defensive player at a time when a lot of other issuing entities have been going through problems. So I think Ralph is spot on. We're way ahead of our funding tasks and feel confident about being able to meet the needs going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>It's James Ellis from Credit Suisse. Just coming back to the collective provisions, if we look at other majors, the balance sheet strengths, the liquidity in the capital you've called out effectively that we're hoarding the excess because of the regulatory environment uncertain to hit. Could the same thing be said though about collective provision coverage? So if it's difficult to reconcile as the environment stabilizes that the economic overlay remains, the additions keep coming through. And how much further &#x2013; acknowledging your modeling has still got a way to go, would you have to keep rebuilding those to ensure that you've covered that regulatory risk as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, as far as collective provisioning is concerned, as you know, James, it's all about the rating of the risks within the portfolio. And obviously in the business and corporate portfolios, all of the credits are risk-rated. And as a result of that, as we re-rate, if we re-rate downwards, obviously the collective provision will increase. We are now starting to see a situation where we've reached I think an inflection point. And that we are now starting to see a situation where in that &#x2013; in those books we're seeing more upgrades than downgrades.</p>
          <p>So I think from the point of view of collective provisioning, we're obviously very appropriately provisioned currently. I think it's fair to say that we still, from the point of view of overlay, taking a more cautious view as to whether or not we have a double dip for whatever. Obviously there's still volatility in international markets and we see what's happening with countries like Greece and Portugal and Spain, et cetera and the impact that that has on confidence in markets. So I think at this point it's a case of being obviously weary, cautious and &#x2013; but being cautiously optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I should say, James, just to sort of add to that, that there is no scope for us to hoard provisions pending some new accounting standard. We have to provide our accounts based on current international accounting standards, which are on as-incurred basis. So as Ralph said, when the time comes there'll be reaches. Interestingly if this new standard comes in and there's an awful lot of debate and water to go under the bridge, it wouldn't be until the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>If it comes in, in fact you'd see lower provisions but you'd be writing down the value of the loans right from the beginning. So it's quite a different way of accounting. And I suspect what will happen if it does come in, is there'll be a once-off adjustment to all banks' balance sheets to bring in these new models with a whole lot of disclosure around that. But it'll be a one-off thing at the time. At the moment, there's no way we can hoard in anticipation.</p>

          <p>Brett Le Mesurier from Axiome Equities. A question following up something you said before, Ralph, about one of the good things that was likely to happen on the net interest margin with the ongoing repricing of business loans. Presumably that also happened in the half we've just had. Bearing that in mind, how come the net interest income didn't increase as fast as assets, which would imply there were some decline in the interest margin in the Business and Private Banking business. Was it simply a result that they have now lost on the side on the transfer pricing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My understanding is that that was not the case. And I'm certainly getting a headshake from Ian Narev to indicate that his margin did not diminish during the period.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you're looking at timing differences, Brett. Margins were up I think they'd been in Business and Private Banking, they're now 60 to 70% through the repricing in Institutional Banking. Sorry?</p>

          <p>Hi, I noticed that Asia is now relegated into the Other category. Does this signal a shift in the bank's overall strategy, maybe, Brett, in favor of domestic opportunities such as Wealth or other things?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's important to note that the Asia that's included in Other is only the Asia to do with our Retail Banking presence. Within our Wealth Management business, we have a significant Asian business. And within our Institutional Banking and Markets business we also have a significant Asian business. So we don't a do a geographic split of Asia. So it's the International Financial &#x2013; the old International Financial Services business relating to Asia which are some retail businesses that &#x2013; and fundamentally it's equity investments in other banks in Asia that have been classified in Other.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's across the board but I mean there &#x2013; it'd be two areas in particular. In New Zealand the dairy industry is &#x2013; after having two or three useful increases in milk prices, that industry is looking a lot better than it was six months ago. And in the property sector, particularly REITs, we've seen a lot of recapitalization go on. And of course as those REITs get more capital then their credit rating goes up. They'd be the two areas that probably have seen the most upgrades but really it's across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you said that <mark type="inaudible" /> that the downgrades, what sectors were the downgrades coming through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it's across the board. There's no particular sector. They're just the areas that have historically been areas of concern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just following on T.S.'s question about Asia, you &#x2013; we've seen some mixed signals about your ambitions in places like Indonesia. I think last year you speculated that you could make acquisitions there. Is there any prospect there this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly we don't make pronouncements on anything we do until we do it. We've made the point very strongly that any acquisitions will be undertaken on a prudent basis. Let's face it, there's been a history of acquisitions that haven't done a lot for shareholder value and you've always got to be very careful that you don't end up with acquiree shareholders being the ones that win to the detriment the acquirer shareholders.</p>
          <p>So we are obviously looking at opportunities all the time. We have been continuing our organic growth strategy in Indonesia. And we have somewhere in the order of 80 odd branches in Indonesia now, and we'll be closing in 100 branches by the end of this half. So that continues to be a key focus for us in regard to Asia.</p>
          <p>Certainly we have reconstituted our joint venture relationship with China Life to now BoCom in China and I'm pleased to say that in the first couple of weeks of that restructure, we've seen a very significant increase in the flow of business which augurs very, very well for that business, in fact a surprisingly significant increase in business there. So as I say we continue to look at opportunities but we're not going to be rushed into making decisions just for the sake of it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally maybe, Warwick, you made reference to the fact that you're a defensive player offshore. Locally, when the deposit guarantee finally comes off, do you see in it sort of GFC-post world that Australian depositors will see when such a load as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think there is any doubt that the value and respect for the Commonwealth brand I think has been enhanced over recent years. And certainly that's borne out by the improving market share position and certainly the improving customer satisfaction. So from my perspective in a post guarantee world, I think the Commonwealth Bank Group is well placed.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott Manning from JPMorgan. Two questions if I may, one on margins and one on capital. On the margin we've had a rise in the cash rate late in the period which will impact you next time as well. You've had a bit more stability in the spot funding costs over the last six months as well. So given that more transparency, if we roll forward spot for the next 12 months, we've got a average approaching spot in both asset and liability rate pricing, is the margin up or down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think as I said earlier on, I think we're going to see a situation where we're going to see in parts of our business a contraction, and in other parts an expansion of margin. So I think that what we're seeing typically on interest rate costs is the fact that it could be argued particularly in the wholesale market that the marginal cost has been reducing, but the average cost continues to decline because obviously we're coming off a very low base prior to the GFC.</p>
          <p>And when you look at the fact that our long-term book average is around 3.7 years, we're in a situation where we're still seeing a continual roll of low cost funding being replaced with high cost funding. So it's hard to make a &#x2013; just a one statement fits all. It's a situation where it's obviously ups and downs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I look at the chart from the RBA on slide 112 where business lines are above deposit costs and housing loans are in line with funding costs, indicating the margins are going up, I shouldn't necessarily take that as indicative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that the issue here is I think you can take the view that &#x2013; our view is that funding costs are going to continue to elevate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And secondly on the capital, there's been a lot of negative outlook at the peak that crosses from pure cyclicality and all that good stuff. Looking at page 93, you've now had a net capital benefit from upgrading of exposures as well as optimizing the portfolio and that's 17 basis point benefit to Tier 1. Have you get a feeling for what the delta that is going forward in terms of any potential future benefits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there will be an ongoing optimization, but I don't think you're going to see an improvement of that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; dare I? Obviously we told you it was price cyclicality so if you look back over the same disclosure over &#x2013; through the GFC you will see there have been some downticks, not significant capital downticks but cyclicality took its toll on capital and as provisioning improved. So as the GFC passes, that procyclicality will unline. So there will be some &#x2013; we believe there'll be some continuing bolstering of capital because of procyclicality unwinding, but it's not going to be terribly material, as &#x2013; just as when you look back over our prior disclosures you'll find that the hits weren't that material either.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs JBWere. Just on &#x2013; following on from that comment that capital generation's improving, looking at the positive benefits of procyclicality. You flagged you got 6 billion of excess capital above the minimum of the target range currently and your dividends are sort of going back to a normalized level. Just can you give me your thoughts of how you actually see &#x2013; kind of the potential to actually increase the dividend payouts even further, just sort of taking a reverse angle of Richard's earlier question?</p>
          <p>And also just if we can get some updates on your thoughts around just some of the M&amp;A happening in Australia right now, or other opportunities you're seeing, and what other gaps do you see for the business? You talked about your strategy and you want to be doing M&amp;A on things which are on track with your strategy, but just elaborate on where the gaps you see for the franchise currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess as far as the dividend is concerned I mean I made the comment a little earlier that we obviously will look at where we sit as far as the dividend position is at the time of our &#x2013; determination of our full year result. Certainly I said at that point that it would be an objective to get back to a similar level of payout but we haven't made a decision yet on what &#x2013; the Board as to what our ongoing level of payout, total payout will be against profit.</p>
          <p>But we've got to take into account what's going on around us from the point of view of the potential regulatory changes. And I think that you can take the view that we will maintain a cautious view. So certainly we are generating good internal capital generation. And I think that where we sit, I wouldn't wish to be making any predications at this point.</p>
          <p>In regard to the second issue around acquisitions, Commonwealth Bank is an organization that in domestic Australia is actually a well balanced organization in the parts of the business it has and all of its businesses are strong businesses and have good competitive positions. There are obviously a number of acquisitions that have taken place, particularly in the Wealth Management area, which we have had no interest in participating in.</p>
          <p>We know the trials and tribulations you go through in acquisition and integration and all the rest of that. And certainly there's no doubt the Colonial acquisition created a fair amount of indigestion for this organization as we went through that process. And particularly when you're buying organizations with old legacy systems and the insurance industry for example had significant purpose with unit pricing and the like, and certainly that cost us a lot of money.</p>
          <p>So I'd have to say that we would only are interested in acquisitions that are very much on strategy and are prudent and that we &#x2013; will deliver good value for our shareholders. So it's all very easy to write the cheque. The toughest thing on an acquisition is the execution. And as I said earlier, the strike rate on that is not outstanding, in fact more often than not, as I said, the acquiree shareholders come out the winners rather than the acquirer shareholders. So we look at all opportunities, but we do have and I make no excuse for it, a pretty high hurdle rate as to whether or not we will do something.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. Ralph, I suspect this will be a question close to your heart, but if we have a look at New Zealand, we've seen three of the four major banks of late produce pretty crappy results out of New Zealand, and one bank's earnings don't seem to have fallen at all yet. Is that an indication perhaps that things are going to get a lot better there going forward or that the other one is going to join you guys?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ralph Davis from JPMorgan. Just looking at your economic summary, looking the growth rates in housing, the recovery in 2010. Ostensibly that would imply continued strong growth in housing prices. And I assume that would also imply continued overweighting into housing. And I guess just recognising what would drive that growth, do you think there's any risk that the regulators might try an increase? I guess risk weightings &#x2013; or try and induce a push into business lending as opposed to kind of continued growth into housing driven by appreciation?</p>

          <p>Well, I think the issue on housing is that Australia has been significantly underbuilt in dwellings, particularly in the major centres now for a number of years. And we've obviously had very strong migration and population growth. And when you look at the outlook for the population going to 35, 36 million over the next 20 odd years, that means that there's going to be a continuing demand for housing. And so I think housing is going to continue to grow at a reasonable clip.</p>
          <p>The issue is obviously around state government and local government issues around land release and the rest of it, and also obviously about high density housing in the center cores of cities. So I think we're going to see an ongoing demand in that regard.</p>
          <p>As far as business lending is concerned, there is a view that banks have been tough to borrow from and certainly the government put a hotline in place last year to address this particular issue, just to see exactly what the problems were in this market. And roughly speaking, I mean they only got a handful of calls on that hotline, where people were able to actually demonstrate that there was an issue.</p>
          <p>I think one of the areas where there's been problems has been those particular parts of the business market that have relied previously on funding by non-bank institutions, mezzanine members and the like. And so there is a section of the development community that have never really been a target market for the major banks. And some of them have been serviced in the past by some of the second tier banks as well. And certainly there's no doubt that they're having issues in that sector of the market.</p>
          <p>But when we look at applications over the last two years for business banking accommodation, we've found that our approval rates are very much in line with what they were prior to the crisis. So we have not been able to really to take a situation where we have a significant number of potential customers who feel to disenfranchised. So I think there's been a lot of noise around a particular sector or a particular sector has made a lot of noise. But when you get to the guts of it, you find that it's more heat than actual fire.</p>

          <p>Do you think that's the regulators' view as well?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think &#x2013; and as far as the regulators are concerned, I think there's an issue here &#x2013; I mean this has been more of a political issue particularly from certain sectors making approaches to politicians. But when you look at the overall situation, it's hard to actually sustain the argument.</p>
