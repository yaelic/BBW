        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, and welcome to Merck's first quarter 2011 earnings conference call. My name is Joshua Young and I am Head of Investor Relations for Merck.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Appreciate everyone joining this delayed start. We will provide our quarterly commentary closer to the start of trading day again in Germany.</p>
          <p>I would like to start with slide number four, which summarizes our first-quarter results. We generated solid performance in Q1, and are off to a good start to the year. We report 3% organic revenue growth, one for the group, driven by the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:02:39) of our Performance Materials and Merck Millipore Divisions.</p>
          <p>From a profitability perspective, we generated a strong year-over-year increase in the group's core operating results, which grew by approximately 46%. This translates into an improvement of our core return on sales to 24.6%.</p>
          <p>Liquid Crystals continued to deliver very strong results in Q1, generated organic revenue growth of 18%, nearly 55% return on sales.</p>
          <p>The underlying performance of Merck Millipore continues to be solid. Strongest performing portion of this business was the Process Solution business unit. It's benefiting from higher levels of monoclonal antibody production from both new drugs and a strong growth of commercially available therapeutics.</p>
          <p>Merck Serono delivered in-line sales performance in Q1. On the surface, the division's growth rates may appear to be slightly lower than expected. However, it is important to note that the division's year-over-year revenues were adversely affected by a stocking effect in the U.S. in Q1 2010 due to the SAP ERP implementation. Secondly, then from the impact of divesting Th&#xE9;ramex to Teva. We will talk in more detail about these two items later in the call.</p>
          <p>Obviously, one of the major worldwide developments in the first quarter was the tragedy that occurred in Japan. Japan is an important part of Merck's business. I therefore went personally to Japan to see the situation with my own eyes and to talk to our people and to reiterate our commitments to Japan.</p>
          <p>So what is the impact of this tragedy on Merck? Key takeaway I would leave with you at this point in time is that the Japanese tragedy did not have significant negative effect on our business in Q1. We are confident in our ability to resume production at our Onahama pigment plant in June. All other business is running quite normal under the given circumstances. What remains to be seen of course is the development of the Japanese consumer behavior in the next <mark type="inaudible" /> (0:05:24).</p>
          <p>We continue to refine the portfolio of the overall group. We received &#x20AC;466 million in cash during the quarter as a result of our divestments in Crop BioScience Th&#xE9;ramex. We also acquired a cell culture media company in China and announced our intention to acquire the microbiology business Biotest to further strengthen our lab solution business.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide five, geographic perspective, Asia was the strongest performer of the group in the first quarter, but Latin America also generated good performance. Growth rates on this slide reflect of course our distinctive growth strategy in Asia and U.S., as well as the year-over-year impact from the Millipore transaction.</p>
          <p>I'm turning to the divisional perspective. Like to start with slide number six, Performance Materials. The division once again delivered outstanding financial performance, generating revenues of &#x20AC;409 million, representing a growth of 15% over Q1 2010. Included in this performance is approximately 14% organic revenue growth. Overall, the division generated a 41% return on sales during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Key highlights of these results was Liquid Crystals business, which grew 26%, totaling &#x20AC;302 million, driven by an increase in our overall market share. Liquid Crystals delivered a return on sales of approximately 55% in Q1. This level of profitability was clearly better than expected, but influenced by some important factors. First, the stronger than expected performance of PS-VA let us to offset the negative mix effect that we anticipated from gaining market share in non-PS-VA segments such as VA, IPS and TN-TFT. Second, we saw slightly more favorable pricing environment in the first quarter than we had anticipated.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead to our full-year 2011 performance, I would still anticipate a negative mix effect from sustained market share gains in non-PS-VA technologies. But one should not expect to sustain 55% ROS margins throughout the year.</p>
          <p>However, the adverse mix effect will not be as substantial as we have anticipated at the beginning of the year due to our Q1 outperformance.</p>
          <p>Then with the Pigment and Cosmetics segment, revenues grew 9%, which included approximately 5% organic revenue growth. There were product mix and a strong demand from the automotive and cosmetic industry's growth and performance.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to Merck Millipore on slide seven. Merck Millipore generated a solid quarter after a strong 2010. Revenues were reported at &#x20AC;611 million, with a core return on revenues of 21.5%.</p>
          <p>Legacy Millipore business performed well, and experienced particularly strong demand from biotechnology customers within the process solution business unit. From a geographic perspective, much of the strength came from Asia, then increasing the higher percentage of our multinational customers and moving their biologic production to locations such as Singapore.</p>
          <p>The division is also benefiting from increasing regulatory requirements in countries such as China. If these regulatory requirements are raised, it benefits high-end suppliers like Merck Millipore. We have completed the organizational integration of Merck Millipore. We are continuing to bring the division onto a common set of IT and HR systems.</p>
          <p>With the organization integration now behind us, Merck Millipore is focused on leveraging our global scale to drive incremental revenue synergies. And this is particularly powerful in areas like Lab Solutions business, where we have one of the industry's largest product portfolios and a global network of direct and indirect sales resources.</p>
          <p>Many countries around the world, they're under-penetrated with either legacy Merck or legacy Millipore products. Proposed acquisition of the microbiology business of Biotest is a good example of this since the vast majority of its revenues generated in Europe. We strongly believe our global presence will help to extend adoption of these products on a global basis.</p>
          <p>Looking at Merck Serono, slide number eight. The division had a good start in the year, delivering solid financial results, but the news from pipeline was disappointing. Merck Serono reported revenue growth of 1%, totaling &#x20AC;1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>From a geographic perspective, Asia and Latin America showed the most strengths. However, I should draw your attention to the fact that the two items to stop the year-on-year comparison for Merck Serono. First, if you may recall, last year's first quarter was exceptionally strong; that is about &#x20AC;50 million of sales that's expected to come in the second quarter pulled forward into Q1. This performance of sales was triggered by the ERP conversion of our U.S. subsidiary in the Serono, which was scheduled in April 2010.</p>
          <p>Orders that would have ordinarily been placed in the second quarter of 2010 were placed in the first quarter in order to ensure that orders were not delay as a result of the ERP implementation. Consequently, the higher base of 2010 lowered our Q1 revenue growth in 2011. We will conversely see a higher growth rates in Q2.</p>
          <p>Second, the divestment of Th&#xE9;ramex last year resulted in lost quarterly <mark type="ph" /> rate (0:12:23) sales of around &#x20AC;20 million in Q1 2011. But if we adjust the Q1 numbers in 2011 just on a theoretical basis for this &#x20AC;70 million effect, Merck Serono's underlying revenue growth would have been 6% in Q1.</p>
          <p>Back to move on to slide two &#x2013; slide eight, sorry. Sales for Rebif came in at &#x20AC;411 million, approximately 4% lower than year-ago quarter. Approximately, &#x20AC;41 million of the &#x20AC;50 million of sales that were put forward in 2010, as I've just explained, came from Rebif. If we were to account for this Rebif sales growth would have been 10% higher in Q1 2011 compared to 2010. This performance underpins that despite the recent dynamics in the competitive landscape of multiple sclerosis therapies, Rebif can capitalize on its excellent market position.</p>
          <p>In addition, market data confirm our views that market uptake of oral treatments seems to be progressing slower as some very optimistic models would suggest.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly touch on the new slope around Cladribine. In January, the CHMP adopted a final negative opinion regarding Europe. And as released on March 2, we received a complete response letter from the FDA. From a financial perspective, this decision means that our 2011 revenue guidance for Merck Serono in the group will be within the ranges that we provided without Cladribine.</p>
          <p>In its assessment the FDA concluded that though there was substantial evidence of Cladribine's effectiveness, requested Merck to provide an improved understanding for safety risks and the overall benefits risk profile either through additional analysis or by additional studies. We have requested an end-of-the-year meeting with the FDA for the purpose of clarifying next steps and identifying that the data from completed and ongoing clinical studies can address the agency's questions. This meeting will take place by the end of May.</p>
          <p>Second, we expect then to see results from our three additional completely enrolled studies CLARITY EXTENSION, ORACLE MS and ONWARD by the end of this year, beginning of next year, respectively. They will provide additional information on the efficacy and safety of Cladribine. Thereafter, we will decide how to proceed further.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the oncology franchise on slide nine. Erbitux sales grew to &#x20AC;209 million in Q1, up 9% compared to last year. From a regional perspective, all geographies contribute to Erbitux growth though as you know we have to absorb price cuts in several European countries last year.</p>
          <p>In Japan, we see the first quarter sales were softer due to a variety of factors. In regard to pipeline progress, we've submitted an indication extension to the European Medicines Agency for their approval of Erbitux in combination with standard first line platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with high EGFR expression.</p>
          <p>This submission is based on the new biomarker analysis of EGFR expressions that was in tumors of patients participating in our Phase III program.</p>
          <p>New data set contains key requirements currently demanded by the scientific community of personalized medicine approach. I guess, in today's regulatory environment, any submission like this carries with it significant risks.</p>
          <p>Moving quickly to the other franchises on slide 10. Gonal-f sales came in with &#x20AC;133 million or 4% softer compared to the year-ago quarter, again ERP implementation effect in our U.S. affiliate contributed the supply decline.</p>
          <p>Gonal's performance is in line with our expectations during Q1. Endocrinology sales were up 7% to &#x20AC;80 million and Saizen generated double-digit growth in &#x2013; mainly in Asia and Latin America.</p>
          <p>Our Cardiometabolic care and general medicine franchise delivered solid performance with sales going 2% year-on-year to a &#x20AC;471 million, the top products performing particularly low. Glucophage grew 6%, Concor sales increased by 4%, means declining sales in maturing markets were more than offset by the strong performance of the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Overall, Merck Serono sales in the emerging markets grew by 15% compared to the year-ago quarter. From a strategic perspective, we've progressed in building and extending collaborations during Q1. Let me just mention the cooperation with Domain Therapeutics develop drugs for Parkinson's disease or the BioIncubator Fund which we started in Israel. Stefan Oschmann told you some weeks ago, he believe that such collaboration can add a lot of value to our pipeline. We can expect to more to come going forward.</p>
          <p>Moving quickly to our Consumer Healthcare business, the division's sales grew by 8% to &#x20AC;117 million, driven by strong growth from six out of seven strategic brands. Consequently, and in line with our strategies, the share of sales from these strategic brands increased to nearly 60% of the division's top line.</p>
          <p>Let me make a short closing remark before turning the call over to Michael Becker. I know that many of you have the chance to meet Stefan Oschmann for the first time recently in an event in London. And I know, you also have questions about what is going to change at Merck and how quickly these changes be made. I want to repeat what I stated in our last earnings call. I kindly ask for your patience. I request that you give the new management team the chance to come together for the first time in the middle of this year.</p>
          <p>Clearly, changes will be made within the organization. We're focused on making these changes to strengthen the growth and profitability profile of Merck. As soon as we are ready to communicate you will be among the first to know about our class.</p>
          <p>With that, thank you very much and I hand over the call Michael.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning and a warm welcome to every person joining us. I'll present the results and developments of our group and its four divisions for the first quarter and update the outlook for 2011. Unless otherwise mentioned, all growth rates are based on year-on-year comparison of the figures of 2011 versus 2010.</p>
          <p>I show the Q1 operating results for the Merck group on slide 12. Similar to what we have seen over the past two quarters, our first quarter results continue to be significantly affected by our acquisition of Millipore. We reported total revenues of &#x20AC;2.6 billion in Q1, which represented 22% growth. This growth reflected a 16% contribution from acquisitions and a 3% positive effect from changes at foreign exchange rates, resulting in 3% organic revenue growth of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The Millipore acquisition also led to an increase in our operating expenses. Marketing and selling expenses rose by 26% and administration cost rose by almost 20% compared to Q1 2010.</p>
          <p>If we eliminate acquisition related costs and changes in foreign exchange rates, marketing and selling expenses increased by 8% and administrative expenses increased by approximately 2%.</p>
          <p>A 77% increase in amortization of intangible assets reflects the higher intangible assets from the Millipore purchase price allocation. Furthermore, this line item also reflects the impairment of Cladribine which was on our book at approximately &#x20AC;50 million. I want to stress that this impairment does not in any way reflect what we believe maybe the outcome of our end of review meeting with the FDA.</p>
          <p>Both the negative CHMP Opinion and the complete response letter from the FDA show that our currently available data package does not allow for an approval of the drug and either of the major markets, the U.S. or the EU. In this current situation and the uncertainty around whether results from our ongoing studies will provide the data required, we decided to take a prudent approach and <mark type="ph" /> simply (0:22:24) write the remaining value of the Cladribine off.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for these amortization charges, Millipore integration costs of roughly &#x20AC;12 million in Q1, our core operating result amounted to &#x20AC;630 million with the core return on revenues of 24.6% versus 20.6% for the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>The substantial improvement is primary a result of higher gross margins on the strengths of our chemical's performance and improved Merck Serono performance.</p>
          <p>We posted an exceptional income of &#x20AC;158 million almost exclusively due to the sale of Crop BioScience to Novozymes that we announced in December 2010.</p>
          <p>Our underlying tax ratio of 25.1% is different than the reported tax rate of 25.4% due to the divestment of Crop BioScience. That was again in line with our target ratio of 25%.</p>
          <p>Net profits amounted to &#x20AC;341 million or &#x20AC;1.57 per share, up 78% compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted for acquisition related costs from Serono and Millipore as well as for the exceptional income, the group's core earnings per share rose by almost 41% to &#x20AC;2.03.</p>
          <p>I'll now talk &#x2013; walk you through the financial details of our four divisions. I'll start with the Performance Materials on slide 13. Revenues grew 15% to &#x20AC;409 million. The division reported a 6% positive benefit from changes in foreign exchange rates and a 5% adverse effect due to the divestment of the Crop BioScience business. This resulted in 14% organic revenue growth for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Please be reminded that this comparison is distorted by two special items. First, we allocated our Cosmetic Actives business from Merck Millipore to Performance Materials effective beginning of this year. Adjusting for this, Q1 2010 revenues were &#x20AC;21 million higher than what we reported last year.</p>
          <p>Second, we sold our Crop BioScience business at the end of 2010. Adjusted for this Q1, 2010 revenues we had &#x20AC;19 million lower than that we reported last year.</p>
          <p>On an apples-to-apples basis, this year's first quarter revenue growth for Performance Materials was 22%. Earlier, we had mentioned the fabulous quarter of Liquid Crystal's substantial growth and its 55% return on revenues margin. This clearly drove the overall performance of the division.</p>
          <p>Our Pigments and Cosmetics business performed well. Costs relating to the repair of our Onahama plant are covered by a provision of &#x20AC;4.2 million booked in the first quarter this year.</p>
          <p>The operating result of Performance Materials jumped 28.4% to &#x20AC;169 million with the return on revenues of 41.3% compared to 37.1%. In line with this strong performance, free cash flow jumped to almost &#x20AC;300 million compared to &#x20AC;107 million for the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for the divestment of Crop BioScience the underlying free cash flow was around &#x20AC;98 million, it decreased of approximately 9%. This decrease was the result of our decision to build inventory of Liquid Crystal products and is also related to the timing of capital expenditure purposes.</p>
          <p>Before I comment on the financials of the Merck Millipore in more detail, let me highlight that for the first time in Q1, we are reporting a new underlying business unit structure for the division, which I show on slide 14. We will report revenues based on the following business units. Bioscience which provides specialized products for the life science laboratories, Lab Solutions, which provides lab products and equipment for applications in life science and industrial laboratories and process solutions which provides product used in the protection of pharmaceutical and biotechnology drugs.</p>
          <p>I should also point out that these businesses are now fully integrated and it does not make sense to try a pro forma growth calculation for the combined businesses. As a result, when you reference organic revenue growth for the division, it refers to mixed legacy performance of Life Science Chemicals business. Legacy Millipore is reflected only in the acquisitions effect for this division.</p>
          <p>That being said, Merck Millipore generated revenues of &#x20AC;611 million, an increase of 166% which reflects approximately 2% organic revenue growth and the 4% positive benefits from changed foreign exchange rates. We are now on page 15, by the way.</p>
          <p>From a geographic perspective, Merck Millipore's business is extremely well balanced and this is a real strength of the division. In Q1, 36% of Merck Millipore sales were derived from North and Latin America, 38% from Europe, and 24% from Asia. We are generating our highest growth rates in Asia due to the impact of the BRIC countries and Singapore.</p>
          <p>With a core operating result of &#x20AC;131 million, the division achieved a core return on revenues of 21.5%; up from the 15.3% for the year ago quarter, reflecting the higher profitability of the legacy Millipore portfolio. Merck Millipore was a significant contributor to the group's strong free cash flow 2010 and this trend continued in the first quarter with strong underlying free cash flow of &#x20AC;58 million generated in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now some comments on Merck Serono as shown on slide 16. Total revenues increased approximately 1% to &#x20AC;1.4 billion. This reflected a positive 2% benefit from changes in foreign exchange rates and negative 1% effect from the divestment of Th&#xE9;ramex. And again I remind you of the Q1 2010 effect in Merck Serono by shifting 50 million turnover from April to March last year.</p>
          <p>It generated 17% growth in royalty license and commission income in Q1, mainly as a result of an approximately &#x20AC;10 million milestone payment for the out-licensed product Vilazodone. Royalty income for the main four out-licensed products remained stable. The division posted more than 50% revenue growth in the emerging markets to &#x20AC;400 million.</p>
          <p>Gross margin of &#x20AC;1.2 billion rose to 3% at a higher rate than revenues with 1.5%. Production costs included ongoing startup expenses for the new large scale biotech production center in Switzerland of around &#x20AC;7.6 million. The 9% boost in marketing and selling expenses was partly driven by exchange rate effects and a comparably low year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we do not endeavor to have our sales and marketing costs to grow faster than our revenues as we saw in Q1. This is something that we will not accept going forward and we are taking steps for both reduced costs and improved productivity within the Merck Serono division. The decline of 9% in commission royalty expenses is mainly a result of the mentioned &#x20AC;50 million shift following the pre-implementation since the line item primarily relates to it.</p>
          <p>Other operating expenses were almost 24% lower than the year-ago quarter. This is due to the fact that the first quarter 2010 included termination costs of &#x20AC;23 million for research project at Merck Serono.</p>
          <p>As mentioned before, amortization of intangible assets is driven by the total impairment of Cladribine of &#x20AC;50 million. This impairment is reflected within our operating results, but did not affect our core operating result as the P&amp;L line of amortization of intangible assets relates to the purchase of Serono.</p>
          <p>The division's core operating result grew by 10% to &#x20AC;347 million with a core return on sales of more than 24%. Also currently, underlying free cash flow rose 43% to &#x20AC;273 million.</p>
          <p>I will make some of the brief comments on our Consumer Healthcare business that performed quite well in the first quarter which is shown on slide 17. Revenues grew by more than 8% to &#x20AC;117 million driven by strong growth of almost all our strategic brands.</p>
          <p>The gross margin grew at faster rate than total revenues due to a positive effect from payments on receivables from Venezuela. The provision had previously been taken at say for the same issue. This and the favorable development of our sales, general and administration operating expenses and income and R&amp;D lines led to the tremendous operating result to almost &#x20AC;8 million.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the key balance sheet data on slide 18, total assets amounted to &#x20AC;22.2 billion, almost unchanged from the total assets recorded in December 31st 2010.</p>
          <p>Net financial debt declined by &#x20AC;743 million to &#x20AC;3.7 billion in the first quarter. Cash and marketable securities amounted to &#x20AC;1.5 billion versus approximately &#x20AC;1 billion at the end of last year. As a result of the larger cash balance, net financial debt dropped by &#x20AC;743 million as already mentioned.</p>
          <p>Working capital increased by 4% to &#x20AC;2.9 billion mainly driven by the net higher payments of accounts payables. Compared to December 31st, 2010, we improved both our DSO and day sales of inventory.</p>
          <p>Todate sales outstanding decreased from 79 days to 75 days and inventory days decreased from 266 days to 232 days. The improvement in DSO and inventory days reflects the higher contribution of our chemicals business which typically carries less inventory, and sees faster collections than our Pharma business.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the group's cash flow on slide 19. Free cash flow and underlying free cash flow for the first quarter were mainly affected by the payments for the sale of our two businesses. First, &#x20AC;265 million for Th&#xE9;ramex and second, &#x20AC;201 million for Crop BioScience.</p>
          <p>Otherwise, we had an adverse effect from the interest payment of &#x20AC;170 million for the bonds issued in March 2010 to finance the Millipore transaction. The free cash flow increased by &#x20AC;451 million to &#x20AC;645 million, mainly as a result of the improved profit after tax and the payments received on the sale of Crop BioScience and the Th&#xE9;ramex business. The underlying free cash flow of &#x20AC;186 million is adjusted by the mentioned effects from acquisitions and divestments.</p>
          <p>I'm now turning to our guidance, which we show on slide 20. There is not really a change to our guidance. The only change since we shipped last our guidance with you on Q4 earnings growth relates to Cladribine. So we simply deleted the guidance including Cladribine and are now only guiding without Cladribine.</p>
          <p>As a result we now expect the group's revenues to grow between 10% and 15% in 2011, and we expect Merck Serono to grow between 1% and 6%. This adjustment solidly reflects the fact that we do not expect generate meaningful revenues from Cladribine during 2011.</p>
          <p>Our revenue expectations for all other divisions remain unchanged. In terms of our guidance for the group's operating results and core return on revenues, the cost that we will avoid from Cladribine launch fully offset the revenues we would have received. This updated outlook reflects the &#x20AC;50 million impairment for Cladribine we include in this quarter.</p>
          <p>The qualitative guidance we gave for operating results for all other divisions in February also remains unchanged. As a result, we expect growth ranges for the operating result of 35% to 45% and for the group's core as we expect a 22% to 23%. That also remains unchanged. It also includes the assumption that we do not expect a material adverse effect on the financial results for 2011 due to the disasters in Japan.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation, and thank you very much for your attention.</p>

          <p>Before &#x2013; its Karl Kley again, before we begin the Q&amp;A session, I would like to make a few closing comments. As many of you know that this is Michael Becker's last earnings call, CFO of Merck. He will retire from the company <mark type="ph" /> but somehow we will (0:37:06) succeed him with Matthias Zachert. Michael has made measurable contributions to the company. He has realigned our financial function, reformed financial reporting, contributed to a huge number of process improvements within the company and business discussions and decisions.</p>
          <p>Michael has instrumental part of shaping numerous acquisitions and divestments of business in Merck. Few companies have reshaped their business portfolio as much as Merck over the last five years and Michael was a key part of this successful effort. I would like to publicly thank Michael for his contributions to Merck.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would now like to the turn the call back to Joshua for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, and thank you for taking my questions. A couple on Pharma please and then a couple on LCDs. With respect to Pharma, I noticed that the gross margin has shown a significant uptick. I wondered whether that was associated with the Th&#xE9;ramex divestiture or whether it was associated with the changes in manufacturing <mark type="ph" /> Veve (0:39:19), and whether or not we should see that improvement as being sustainable.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, if you could just provide us with an update on your relationship with Pfizer with respect to Rebif. How much contribution are these now making to the marketing of Rebif? When does that deal with Pfizer expire given the uncertainties around Cladribine, and how do you expect that to progress in the medium term?</p>
          <p>And then turning to Liquid Crystals, obviously a very strong performance in Q1. Is there any risk or any sign that some of that is due to panel manufacturers stocking up on crystals, given the uncertainties in the supply chain and that we might have pulled some Q2 sales into Q1?</p>
          <p>And also I notice from a number of the panel manufacturers they're signaling Q2 is likely to be somewhat slower in terms of growth, as people digest some of the impacts of Japan and then a strong recovery in panel manufacturing in the second half of the year. Would you agree with that assessment of the outlook sort of seasonally or quarterly for Liquid Crystals? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I think I should start with the gross margin question on Merck Serono. The improvement of the gross margin is certainly not due to the factory in Switzerland; that for the time being is a burden on the gross margin because we have start-up costs. The improvement of the gross margin is down to improvements &#x2013; general improvements in production efficiency and a better product mix. The product mix can change again. The efficiency gain will be sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Pfizer agreement, it's a very important partner for us, continues be an important partner, and plays a major role in the U.S. franchise of Rebif. And we have not disclosed terms of the partnership and I ask &#x2013; kindly ask for your understanding that I also would not like to do it with this call.</p>
          <p>LC, the risk of stockpiling: what we see of course at the moment is slower consumer market for the end products in Japan. And I presume this will go on and you'll certainly also have seen the notification of Sharp that they will close production in April and in May. Having said this, we have not registered up to now slowing of consumer demand in the &#x2013; particularly in the emerging markets where a lot of the uptake of the <mark type="ph" /> timing (0:42:25) product is taking place.</p>
          <p>But if I look at the overall number of panel production, take into account Sharp's productions also and assuming that part of it might be compensated by the other producers <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:42:50) there might be a slower &#x2013; slightly lower business in Q2, but I don't see this coming from the consumer side, but more from Sharp's decision to stop production. I don't expect the major effect, always provided that don't have an exact estimation of what about happening in Japan consumer markets. Projections for second half are what they have been at beginning of the year, so we remained, quantity-wise, confident for the rest of the year in Liquid Crystals.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Many thanks. If I could just have one quick follow-up. Obviously, your two largest competitors in Liquid Crystals are based in Japan. Is there any indication that in Q1 you've gained significant market share in LCDs because they themselves have had production difficulties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our Japanese competitors did not have production capacities for any gain of market shares, not due to production difficulties at the site of any of the three producers, but to technological developments and market developments.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, morning; thanks for taking my question, just one financial and then two R&amp;D. Turning to the financial, just on the gross margin, a quick follow-up. Are you able to split out for the quarter how much of the benefit you think was mix versus efficiency?</p>
          <p>And then just a second clarification question on Merck Serono margins, could you just provide a bit of color on how you see those margins phasing through the rest of the year just noting margin guidance for the group hasn't been raised despite the very strong first quarter for Merck Serono.</p>
          <p>And then two R&amp;D questions, firstly, on Erbitux, I wonder if you could just comment as to whether you see any read-through from the Vectibix rejection just noting two comments in that, firstly the reliability of KRAS testing and second EMEA commenting on the negative survival trend with FOLFOX. I wondered if either of those could apply to the Erbitux status with FOLFOX.</p>
          <p>And then finally, just on Cladribine, I wondered if you could just provide us a framework for how you're thinking about gating future spend on R&amp;D in the product. If the FDA were to request an additional study, would you conduct that in the context of protection of your long-term Rebif franchise, MS franchise? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I start with the gross margin question, which is a drill-down in more detail. The cost of sales consists of a pretty high number of individual influences, and to split the product mix, the efficiency gain isn't really leading to anything and is also not really possible. So I would say it is both and that is the answer.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we have guided cautiously. The first quarter as you pointed out had a very good gross margin, maybe a bit more constrained when predicting the rest of the year as an order and that's what we did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Cladribine, I would like to state that we really now have to wait for the end of May review meeting to understand exactly the FDA's position. But we then really have to wait for the results of the three running studies to see whether they give new light to how we have to evaluate possible concerns on safety. And after that, that means the end of the year, beginning of next year, respectively, we will come up with a decision and also communication how we will proceed with Cladribine. Until then, of course, we have to sustain our spending to support the three running studies. That is obvious. We can't interrupt any study for a number of reasons as you know, and we also see no reason if theoretically possible to do so.</p>
          <p>With that I'll pass onto Bern Kirschbaum for the Erbitux-related questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good morning, everybody. On the Vectibix rejection, we of course followed up with the regulators on this one and it was reconfirmed that our way to deal with KRAS testing is actually a very reliable one. Because we have implemented several measures for example to do the proper training with the doctors to make sure that our testing is really reliable.</p>
          <p>So there was a clear feedback that this should not impact our Erbitux position.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Hello, Holger Blum from Deutsche Bank. Just two questions, one on Rebif. Could you give us some indication about pricing and volume trends, maybe in the U.S. and internationally?</p>
          <p>Second question on Liquid Crystals; did you experience &#x2013; or what has been the market feedback you got from your competitors trying to ship first small PSVA volumes? Do you expect them to ship more meaningful volumes later this year or the first shipment's not really successful with regard to catching up towards your quality? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the last question was the shipment we did from...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You indicated before that your competitors are trying to get into PSVA as well, but not really &#x2013; in trial sizes, so very small volumes. And the question is whether the quality what your competitors are shipping is somewhat comparable or whether they might gain more traction over the course of this year, or whether a potentially tougher PSVA competition is postponed further into 2012 from today's perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Start with the second question. We have an indication that one of our competitors might have PS-VA product and when forecasting last year we mentioned, &#x2013; in forecast of 2011, we mentioned that. I mentioned also in my presentation that our PS-VA uptake of deliveries in quarter one, the better than we anticipated.</p>
          <p>And now there can be various conclusions from that, obviously our PS-VA is satisfying the needs of the customers and they continue to use our products to a larger extent than we really anticipated. To draw conclusions from this result is very difficult for suppliers, so I would rather if you allow me to strengthen commenting what could be the implications on the competitor's products. We take the competitor serious and therefore we still anticipate a bigger PS-VA transaction by the competitor going forward. And that why we remain cautious with the guidance, as I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>For the pricing trend in the U.S., as you probably know, we had a price increase in January. So this &#x2013; next to positive price effect, we had the volume decline. Of course, I mentioned that already. There's a major reason in the anticipated orders for the second quarter which I outlined in my speech.</p>
          <p>The question what will happen if they were all to deliver franchise can only be answered after the second quarter, after we have seen the Rebif's &#x2013; April numbers for Rebif's. As I mentioned, also the oral therapies up to now do not have a significant effect. So I don't expect major movements on the volume side of this for the first-half of the year.</p>

          <p>Hello, gentlemen. Here are my questions, please. The first one is on the Crop BioScience divestments. Can you tell us what were the criteria used for the decision of this divestment? And can you tell us what is your strategy regarding the use of cash?</p>
          <p>Second question is on Erbitux. Can you please remind us, what is the size of the addressable population for the lung cancer indication?</p>
          <p>And also regarding Liquid Crystals you said in the call that you have decided to build inventories. Can you tell us what is the size of that buildup and what's behind this, what is your strategy, and why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the Bioscience divestments, it was a business which really did not &#x2013; sorry, hold on. For the Bioscience divestments, the Bioscience was an area where we which had not too much relationship to the other parts of the group. We were not really at home in the Crop BioScience market. So we had a product which &#x2013; product base which was a nice business developing very nicely, which we inherited from an earlier acquisition. So cash and profit-wise, it was very well. But it didn't fit well, and didn't integrate with the other businesses. And also the product under development, which we had could has only be developed with major investments and we didn't feel that this would make sense to invest in a business which was always a side business for us.</p>
          <p>So this was the criteria for the investments. Of course, the major use of cash for the time being &#x2013; as announced various times as we prepayment of debts. We &#x2013; while we &#x2013; with the cash flow we're producing at the moment, we are slightly ahead of schedule certainly, but of the net that we focus for the next years, will be the prepayment of debt and nothing will change into that's respect.</p>
          <p>The potential &#x2013; the patient potential for the non-small lung cancer, Erbitux is slightly under 50,000 patients.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Turning to Liquid Crystals and the inventory build-up, this is comment to the free cash flow and in the first place it is a year-on-year comparison. So compared with last year, when we held Liquid Crystals stocks more or less at same level, we increased the stock this year in line with the stronger business. So it's not a special build-up of a reserve or a strategic stock. It's just in line with the business and out of the total increase in working capital, this amounts to roughly $10 million. It is basically a year-on-year comparison.</p>

          <p>Then second question on the Japan disaster, can you quantify us the expected revenue and earnings effect of the pigment plant stop until June?</p>
          <p>And the third question again on Liquid Crystals. So as LC <mark type="ph" /> marks (0:58:15) we are above 54% and now progressed, still trying to enter lower margin areas, which should be positive for the sales growth but negative for the margins. And what do you expect, what kind of margin then should be expected for the remainder of the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Pipeline. So we will be submitting &#x2013; after having submitted long already here in Europe, we will be submitting the lung dossier also in China, also in Japan. And for the approvals, please allow me to be very reluctant and very careful. And we have submitted the lung in Europe and as I have said there is a major risk connected with this. We would not expect any approval coming before the end of November, let's say &#x2013; sorry I made a mistake on the lung part news flow. For China and Japan it's not lung its head and neck, which we are submitting in China and Japan, which has not been approved there up to now.</p>
          <p>For the next year, we have some various devices that we put forward for approval related to Rebif -- to <mark type="ph" /> Rebitux (1:00:22) so then we have of course the Cladribine news flow. These are the major news flows coming from the submissions approval in the next years. The other news flow which could come is not related to approval of the submission which is Stimuvax, but I Stimuvax, but I will ask Bernd Kirschbaum to say a few words on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on the Stimuvax as he said before the recruitment has picked up nicely again. So we are back on track, and we expect an interim analysis later this year, followed by a DSNB meeting and there we will get the signal how to proceed and we will then get more news early next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the equipments, as you know roughly a third &#x2013; a little bit less than a third is produced in Japan. We &#x2013; let's assume we have a &#x2013; that we can resume work in the Onahama plant in June. Then the production interruption June will be maximum two, three months. So, I don't think that we have a major effect on any of our numbers going forward.</p>
          <p>Then on the Liquid Crystal margin, as a fact we have gained market shares in the non-PS-VA technologies. And as you also know in the non-PS-VA technologies, our margins tend to be lower than in the PS-VA technologies. That means in other word, the more we would possibly lose on the PS-VA market share and the margin looks not to keep its current level, but would deteriorate a bit. How much depends really how the progress of a competitor in PS-VA could happen. And second, both &#x2013; but I think I mentioned already my expectations so that answering an earlier question.</p>

          <p>And also related to that is that maybe due to a new product line which you introduced there, I understand that in Q1 this year, you launched basically single-use packs in that area mainly for the production of media? And yes, these are my two questions, thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Okay the Process Solution performance is not a one-off, but an ongoing development. And it is based indeed on innovation, but not on one single innovation. This business is characterized by a string of continuous innovation.</p>

          <p>Thank you for taking my question. I'm realizing it's still early days, but we've seen quite a bit of data in oral MS compounds that are in development and could be on the market by 2012-2013, I mean, Laquinimod and BG-12 from BioGen Idec. Could you give us some sense of how we should we think of the impact on Rebif first, specifically the sustainability of Rebif revenues going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you say it's still early days, even if you listen to our colleagues from Novartis on Gilenya, they are cautious because they see the dust needs to settle before one sees how the Streets react. On BioGen Idec, of course we have seen the result; so far it's difficult to comment. They see efficacy, they have met their primary end point. So it's certainly something we need to take seriously. We also saw the results on Laquinimod, which is less worrying for us, and we have seen also the other reaction.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of impact on Rebif, we believe that Rebif has its position and retains its position as a really important basic treatment option. And you will also see as we have submitted the reflex data later this year, how we can better use this, maybe in a different dose format in early MS patients. So we are continuing to invest into Rebif and believe that this can remain actually quite well sustainable.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi; thanks for taking my question. It's Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. I've got a couple of questions, please. Firstly, on Liquid Crystals, I just wondered whether you could give us the impact from FX on the EBIT line. I know you've given it kindly for the top line. It would be very useful if you could do that for the EBIT line. And also give us an idea of how the strengthening euro is impacting this division or the Performance Materials division and possibly the rest of the business; that would help.</p>
          <p>Second question is just on Erbitux. I wondered if you could give us an idea of how you feel the penetration is in the EU and Japan, and where you are versus your targets in Japan. How much more do you think you can grow in the EU and Japan?</p>
          <p>And then finally, a couple of questions on Merck Millipore, please. Could you give us an idea on the demand trends in the EU and the U.S. for Merck Millipore? Have you seen any lower demand due to the government fiscal pressures impacting the scientific research community? And also have you seen &#x2013; what sort of trends have you got in terms of demands outside of that from pharma companies in the EU and U.S.? You mentioned Asia was very strong, but it would be useful to know about the developed markets as well.</p>
          <p>And then finally, just how should we think about their return on sales for Merck Millipore going on? It's very strong; it's ahead of target in the first quarter. Is that sustainable for the full year? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Starting with liquid crystals, and the foreign exchange effect on the bottom line. I'm struggling in my mind whether it would be useful to give that information because it is very complex. I just wanted to remind you that we are hedging the business and that if we have a big advantage in the top line, chances are that we will have an adverse effect in the <mark type="ph" /> heart of our (1:08:33) expenses where the results of the hedges are. Just as a rule of thumb or as a guideline so that you know where to go, any effect that we have in the top line, half of it will reach the bottom line. That's the rule of thumb. The return on sales of Merck Millipore division is sustainable.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And for the Erbitux, we are growing in the existing indications and continue basically to grow in all markets both in Europe, we have problem of pricing measures and price cuts by various governments, notably, Germany and Spain, which do not have an effect on the consumption. But of course among the turnover, we were able to overcompensate these price cuts by volume growth and confident that we can do results going forward.</p>
          <p>In Japan, we need to work out what this &#x2013; what the changes there mean for us. We have now received first-line [audio skip], (1:10:01) we will but at the same time, we have the KRAS effect now in Japan and we still have to sort out what that means. I believe, the softer-than-expected turnover in Japan in the first quarter has also to do with that, but we need to do some more analysis on that point.</p>
          <p>It is true the stimulus &#x2013; governmental stimulus programs have mainly been paid out in 2010, so we don't see the same willingness of governments to spend and support this outside company research in 2011. And so that there will be most probably less demand on new programs and new activities, but we strongly believe that the existing programs, the running programs and the opportunities to gain market share in companies and for new products over compensate any lots of stimulus financing by the governments.</p>
