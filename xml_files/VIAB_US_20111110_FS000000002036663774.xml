          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Viacom fourth quarter earnings release teleconference. Today's call is being recorded. At this the time, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter and fiscal year ended September 30th. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jimmy Barge, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>

Let me refer you to page number two in the web presentation to remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

          <p>Reconciliation for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn the call over to Sumner.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I'm really pleased to join you today to discuss Viacom's 2011 fourth quarter and year end results. I'm certain you'll have seen the numbers by now and know that it was a strong &#x2013; a very strong quarter and another truly outstanding year for Viacom. Most impressive was the balanced performance we saw from our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment divisions. Our television brands are strong, getting stronger and stronger and stronger. And Paramount is building a new stable of film franchises with worldwide appeal.</p>
          <p>Viacom is clearly on a roll. We have a strong programming investment strategy, we have a disciplined operational approach, and most important, we have the best possible management team, led, of course, by Philippe to deliver for our shareholders in the short term and over the long run.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to turn the call over to Philippe who is certainly one of the wisest, most brilliant CEOs in the media industry. Philippe, take over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, very much, Sumner. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us today.</p>
          <p>As we mark the end of our fiscal year, I am pleased to report that Viacom is stronger than ever. We continue to manage our business with maximum efficiency to expand margins across the board for both the short and long-term. Key to that success is our singular focus on content, and we are building on that foundation.</p>
          <p>Viacom is consistently investing in new programming to grow our brands and deepen our audience relationships. We are developing our international operation to unlock long-term growth, particularly at Paramount, which is taking advantage of global opportunities on the film side and at Nickelodeon which is building a robust global consumer products business. We are aggressively distributing our brands across all platforms to capture incremental monetization. Our Media Networks continue to benefit from the dual revenue streams of affiliate sales, which we expect will continue to grow annually at high-single-digits to low-double-digits for the foreseeable future, and advertising.</p>
          <p>In Filmed Entertainment, we are executing on our franchise and brand centric development and release strategy. This, coupled with ongoing operational discipline is resulting in a stable, creatively successful cash flow generator. This morning, I will briefly review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year and provide highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more detail, and then we'll gladly take your questions. As we discuss our results this morning, we will speak to the adjusted numbers.</p>
          <p>Consolidated revenues grew 22% to $4 billion in the fourth quarter, with Filmed Entertainment revenues up 46% and Media Networks up 8%. Our fiscal 2011 revenues were up 12%, driven by a 10% gain in Media Networks revenues as a result of a 10% increase in advertising, a 12% increase in affiliate revenues, and a 15% increase from Filmed Entertainment, primarily due to significant gains in theatrical.</p>
          <p>Viacom's net earnings from continued operations grew 33% to $614 million in the September quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $1.06, up 41% over the prior year. For fiscal 2011, net earnings from continuing operations rose 22% to $2.25 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $3.78, a 25% gain over the prior year period. Our operating free cash flow exceeded $2.6 billion for the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>No one has a crystal ball, but we manage Viacom to be well-positioned in every economic environment. We are constantly looking for opportunities to increase efficiencies, and adapt our organization. In the fourth quarter, we made restructuring moves in our Media Networks and at Paramount, particularly in our international activities.</p>
          <p>These moves, which resulted in a $130 million charge in the quarter, will, in addition to reducing our overhead costs, help us capitalize on emerging business trends and execute faster and more efficiently in response to the continued evolution of global entertainment markets.</p>
          <p>At the same time, in late October, we announced the creation of more than 100 new positions in worldwide accounting, finance and other corporate support functions in the state of Tennessee, near our current CMT Network headquarters. We were able to create not only efficiencies with the move but also bring jobs on shore.</p>
          <p>You can expect us to continue to manage our businesses aggressively to capture more opportunities, better monetize across platforms and drive margin expansion. Shareholders can also count on us to maximum free cash flow and return capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2011, we increased our quarterly dividends 67% to $0.25 per share, and we also bought back $2.5 billion in Viacom shares under the $4 billion repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Today, we announced that our board has approved a major expansion of our repurchase program by increasing it to $10 billion. We expect to complete this program in approximately two years. This demonstrates our focus on growing our returns to shareholders and our strong confidence in our ability to continue to generate significant excess free cash flow, even as we invest steadily in our business.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about how our division has performed in the quarter. Our Media Networks are strong, leading brands that are as vibrant as ever. We continue to invest in programming, the research that informs it and the marketing that fuels it.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, our advertising revenues were up 7%, both worldwide and in the U.S. For the full fiscal year, ad revenues were up 10%, driven by 10% growth domestically. Many of our channels achieved double digit ad revenue increases this quarter, positive momentum that was tempered somewhat by ratings issues at select networks.</p>
          <p>This softness is related primarily to the performance of extended repeats of acquired programming. As we have noted in the past, audience preferences are shifting as they continue to seek more fresh, original programming. Our focus on investing in original programming that we own and control, along with ongoing scheduling refinements, and more selectivity in acquiring third party programming, will help us aggressively address this issue.</p>
          <p>While still early in the quarter, we expect to see continued operating momentum and strong bottom line results in our Media Networks segment. Ad sales growth will face some headwinds from a slight softening in the volume in the current scatter market, although pricing remains strong, and from ratings issues at certain networks, including an anomalous situation I will discuss later. Any impact will be offset by continued strong affiliate revenue growth in the quarter from both traditional and digital sources and from continued cost discipline.</p>
          <p>Studios continue to be a very strong advertising category for us, and growth in the number of film releases should help in the current quarter. We are also making progress in non-endemic categories. In fact, auto and insurance were top ten categories for us in 2011 and top five in year-over-year growth.</p>
          <p>Since mid-September, we have experienced an inexplicable drop in Nickelodeon's ratings, which are historically very predictable. We have had extensive discussions with Nielsen to determine the causes of this anomaly and we have been working side by side with them to understand and rectify the situation. The Media Rating Counsel, the industry's independent auditing organization, at our joint invitation, is also investigating this aberration in the kids' ratings. The investigation includes evaluating independent set top box data which shows meaningfully different viewership trends.</p>
          <p>We will continue to work intensely with Nielsen and the MRC until we have a satisfactory resolution, even as we move rapidly to mitigate the situation with the introduction of a great deal of fresh, animated and live action content into the Nickelodeon pipeline. Before quarter's end, Nick will premiere 15 new episodes of returning and new series, including the recently launched Kung Fu Panda: Legend of Awesomeness.</p>
          <p>In distribution, we continue to expand our reach through traditional and emerging platforms. As a result, worldwide affiliate revenues continue to be a reliable and strong growth driver for the company. They are up 11% this quarter and 12% for the year. Our domestic affiliate revenues reflect rate increases from traditional distributors and groundbreaking deals closed with new distributors. Digital distributors continue to present very attractive partnerships for us. They are high margin and they allow us to monetize library content, in effect creating a new syndication window for our franchises and there's a lot of room for growth in the U.S. and internationally.</p>
          <p>We continue to increase distribution for EPIX which will result in growing long-term profitability for this innovative multiplatform motion picture pay service. We are also working with our distribution partners to create new access points for our consumers With Verizon FiOS, we launched authenticated sites for MTV, Comedy, Nick, and VH1 with on-demand content. Sites for Spike and BET will be coming soon. With Cablevision, our linear networks are available for in-home streaming via tablets and certain other internet protocol enabled devices. We're also working to further enhance the linear viewing experience through initiatives like interactive TV and 3D. We will continue to experiment with new distribution models across platforms as long as we are able to measure the audience and secure reasonable economic terms.</p>
          <p>The popularity of our brands has allowed us to pioneer new content that lives across screens, on air, in theaters, online and in mobile. Our franchises live at the intersection of entertainment and social media and drive today's constant cultural conversation. The record-breaking 2011 VMAs are a great example. The show was MTV's most watched ever, and drove an enormous amount of social media activity and gave us a big ad sales win.</p>
          <p>Overall, MTV achieved its 7th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth and its highest rated fourth quarter since 2007. Jersey Shore was the number one show for our core 12 to 34 demographic. The network's diversified slate is working with ratings for scripted programming up 90% over the same period a year ago, thanks also to breakout out hits Awkward and Teen Wolf.</p>
          <p>In the current quarter, the return of Mike Judge's Beavis and Butt-head, generated strong ratings, averaging a 2.2 rating among 12 to 34's and 2.7 million total viewers, performing very well with males, even with its premiere at bat against game six of the World Series.</p>
          <p>At CMT we're expanding to a second night of original programming to build on the success of Sweet Home Alabama on Friday nights.</p>
          <p>Comedy Central achieved double-digit ratings growth in September. The roast of Charlie Sheen was Comedy Central's most watched telecast ever and drove the network to the highest-rated, most-watched week in its 20-year history. The Daily Show and Colbert Report's late night domination continues as Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert were the highest-rated late night cable hosts in the fourth quarter. In the current quarter, Tosh.0 is up 9% over its previous spring cycle and our new hit, Workaholics, is building a strong following, up 87% over a year ago.</p>
          <p>At BET Networks it was another record-breaking year of ratings for both total day and prime time with key gains in the adult demo. In the current quarter, that momentum continued with BET's newest scripted series Read Between the Lines which premiered back-to-back episodes to a combined 6.2 million viewers. The BET Hip-Hop Awards 2011 drew in 4.1 million viewers and on November 29th, BET and Centric will simulcast the Soul Train Awards 2011 hosted by Cedric the Entertainer.</p>
          <p>Centric, now in its second year, posted its best prime time performance yet delivering double digit viewer gains in the fourth quarter. The network is also among the top ten fastest growing cable networks.</p>
          <p>Fueled by research and refined brand filters, VH1 and Spike are making good progress. At VH1 ratings grew in the fourth quarter from strong performances of Basketball Wives 3 and Single Ladies, and the momentum continues. October marks VH1's fifth consecutive month of year-over-year growth, with prime time ratings in the 18 to 49 demo increasing 45% and total viewership growing 34%. Coming up, we have a more original premieres, including Mob Wives, Love &amp; Hip Hop 2 and the T.I. project.</p>
          <p>Spike is doubling down on original reality programming, building a cost effective slate that targets a broader audience. The strategy is showing results, with ratings up 10% in prime, thanks to new originals including: Auction Hunters and Bar Rescue.</p>
          <p>TV Land, while experiencing some ratings softness, is also expanding its original programming line-up with the return of Hot in Cleveland and the premier of The Exes at the end of this month.</p>
          <p>Nickelodeon, the number one cable network for 66 quarters running, has cable's top animated series in SpongeBob and a trio of live action hits in iCarly and Victorious and Big Time Rush. At Nick at Night, ratings have been helped by newly acquired Friends, which in the current quarter has already improved this time period by 10% versus a year ago.</p>
          <p>Over the next 12 months, Nickelodeon will air 500 original episodes, its most ever, as it continues to expand with properties like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Winx and Beatrix Potter. The Nickelodeon brand is usually exportable and ripe for expansion across on air, online and mobile as well as consumer products, particularly in international markets, where we have lots of head room.</p>
          <p>That brand extension includes its newest initiative, NickMom, a new 360-degree brand which we announced yesterday. NickMom was inspired by research showing that the first generation of parents who grew up watching Nickelodeon have a strong association with the brand, particularly its humor. NickMom will launch in the fall of 2012 as a programming block on Nick Jr.</p>
          <p>Moving to Viacom international Media Networks, we're making solid progress in our goal of reaching 20% plus margins in 2013. We are now seeing margins in the teens, thanks to consistent operating discipline, solid contributions from all revenue categories, and targeted strategic initiatives, like our recently announced new joint venture with SBS Media Holdings, Korea's only privately-owned free to air broadcaster. The alliance will create a new SBS MTV channel and make Nickelodeon the first children's channel to be offered by SBS, unlocking significant advertising, affiliate and licensing opportunities in this lucrative market.</p>
          <p>Programming investment and brand extensions are also paying off. MTV UK saw ratings gains of 20% in the fourth quarter, driven by Geordie Shore, the highest rated show in the channel's history which is great news for our biggest ad market in Europe.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we're driving higher ad revenue growth as a result of our investments and the successful telenovella format with hits like Grachi on Nickelodeon and Popland on MTV.</p>
          <p>The European Music Awards which aired on November 6th were a cross-screen hit. Live from Belfast and hosted by Selena Gomez, the show featured performances from Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, Justin Bieber, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Coldplay. Early ratings indicate growth of 30% over last year's show with an unprecedented number of online votes, almost 160 million via our global EMA voting campaign.</p>
          <p>And our international footprint continues to expand. We're launching Paramount channels in several territories over the next year or so, and we have plans to launch six new comedy channels adding to the 14 we already have outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to our Filmed Entertainment division. Paramount Pictures has had a fantastic quarter and a milestone year. The studio's success has affirmed our strategy of a reduced release slate, a focus on franchises, and the leveraging of Viacom brands. Transformers: Dark of the Moon was the studio's first film to gross $1 billion worldwide. It's now the fourth highest worldwide grossing movie of all-time, and Paramount's highest grossing international release ever.</p>
          <p>Transformers performance was also a strong contributor to the fourth quarter gain across home entertainment and ancillary markets. In the current quarter, we scared up another blockbuster franchise release with Paranormal Activity 3, a highly profitable and usually successful title for us. Paranormal was the highest U.S. opening for a horror film as well as the best October debut ever with a $53 million domestic opening. The film also did sizable business internationally. It generated about $175 million at the worldwide box office so far.</p>
          <p>We've got a lot more coming on the franchise front. Mission Impossible, Ghost Protocol starting Tom Cruise, directed by Brad Bird, and produced by J.J. Abrams is coming to theaters in December. We're also developing ideas for Paranormal Activity 4 and Transformers 4. J.J., in addition to Mission Impossible duties, is also focused on developing the next installment of our Star Trek franchise for potential release in 2013.</p>
          <p>Paramount is adding value throughout Viacom. Together with our Media Networks capabilities, Paramount is responsible for creating a valuable new asset in EPIX. Paramount channels also will help fuel our future robust growth at Viacom International Media Networks, and its new animation division will work hand in glove with Nickelodeon to enhance both businesses and fuel significant growth in our company-wide consumer product efforts.</p>
          <p>Across our divisions, creativity is alive and well. At Viacom we apply intelligence &#x2013; all intelligence we have on our audiences to create compelling content that resonates with our diverse audiences around the world. We are proactive and disciplined in how we distribute and monetize that content. We see data on a disproportionately high viewing of our content on new platforms, whether it's online or on mobile. And we look forward eagerly to the day when better measurement and monetization of that viewing becomes a reality, because we know that this will open up significant incremental revenue opportunities for our company on a worldwide basis.</p>
          <p>Viacom is fit, lean and always focused on shared strategic priorities with a one-two punch of creative excellence and operational discipline designed to grow our margins, we have the financial strength and balance to adapt to changing market forces, go the distance, and deliver ever greater value to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With, that I will turn it over to Jimmy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our September quarter and our fiscal year 2011. Our 10-K will be filed shortly.</p>
          <p>This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results exclude from this year's September quarter, restructuring charges of $130 million on a pre-tax basis, and $90 million after tax as well as $52 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to prior year audit settlements.</p>
          <p>Last year's September quarter adjusted results excluded $27 million in tax benefits that were principally related to the disposition of certain assets.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a look at our segment results. Media Networks revenues increased 8% to $2.13 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 7%, and international revenues increased 11% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a 6 percentage point favorable impact on international revenues.</p>
          <p>Page 11 in our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 7% in the quarter. International advertising increased 8%, with foreign exchange improving the growth rate by 7 percentage points.</p>
          <p>International ad sales in the quarter were impacted by strength in Latin America, offset by softness in Asia. As we said in our last earnings call, we had fewer integrated marketing events in the September quarter as compared to our June quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 9%, while international revenues increased 16%. Foreign exchange favorably impacted the international growth rate by 7 percentage points. The growth rate in the quarter was predominantly driven by rate increases.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to ancillary revenues, world-wide ancillary revenues declined 3% in the quarter, principally due to lower home entertainment revenues. Media Networks adjusted operating income of $958 million in the quarter increased 10% over last year. The operating margin of 42% improved 80 basis points over the prior year. The movement in the margin was driven by top line growth of 8%, partially offset by 6% growth in total expenses.</p>
          <p>Within expenses, programming expense grew 5%, while SG&amp;A expense grew 8%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the growth rate for programming expense by approximately 1 percentage point and the growth rate for SG&amp;A expense by approximately two percentage points in the quarter. The growth in SG&amp;A expense in the quarter was principally due to higher advertising and promotion expense related to the marketing of new and returning original series, as well as increased spending on audience research.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to Filmed Entertainment, revenues in the quarter increased 46% to $1.8 billion. Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.</p>
          <p>Worldwide theatrical revenues increased approximately $400 million to $770 million in the quarter. The increase in theatrical revenues was principally due to the strong worldwide performance of Transformers 3 which was released on June 29th, partially offset by carry-over revenues in the prior year's quarter from films, including Shrek Forever After.</p>
          <p>Worldwide home entertainment revenues increased 26% to $511 million in the quarter. The increase reflects a greater number of current quarter releases. During the quarter, we released Transformers 3 domestically as well as Thor and Rango, as compared to Iron Man 2 in the prior year's quarter.</p>
          <p>TV license fees increased 5% to $391 million. The increase in TV license fees in the quarter was due to higher pay TV and network TV revenues, partially offset by lower foreign syndication revenues.</p>
          <p>Ancillary revenues increased 49% to $121 million, primarily due to higher digital revenues.</p>
          <p>Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $185 million in the quarter, as compared to income of $52 million last year. The $133 million increase in operating income principally reflects the strong theatrical and home entertainment performance of Transformers 3, as well as the pay TV availability of some of our theatrical releases.</p>
          <p>Now, moving below operating income, total company equity losses from investments were $11 million in the quarter. The losses in the quarter principally relate to our investment in EPIX. On a full year basis, EPIX was profitable.</p>
          <p>The reported tax rate in the quarter was 28%. The reported rate was favorably impacted by $52 million in discrete tax benefit. For fiscal year 2011, the adjustment effective tax rate was 34.3%, reflecting a 160-basis point improvement over the prior fiscal year's adjusted rate. The reduction in effective tax rate is primarily driven by an improved international versus domestic mix of income in our operations.</p>
          <p>With, that I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jimmy, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on our full year results, and some of the restructuring actions we recently took which put us in a very good position for next year. I'll also talk about our cash flow, our debt profile, and the return of capital to our shareholders as well as seasonal factors impacting 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the full year results, 2011 was a great year. At Media Networks we had a strong top line performance growing advertising 10% and affiliate revenues 12%. During the course of the year, we added new distribution partners on digital platforms and there continues to be opportunities to add partners, both domestically and internationally. Media Networks adjusted operating income increased 14% to $3.8 billion. And the margins improved by 150 basis points to 42%. The international part of our Media Networks business generated approximately $200 million of profitability for the year and achieved mid-teens operating margins.</p>
          <p>At Filmed Entertainment, revenues increased 15%, and the studio generated adjusted operating income of $341 million. This translates to an operating margin of 6% for the studio. As Philippe mentioned, we generated full year earnings per share of $3.78 and we produced $2.6 billion in operating free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Also, we were aggressive in returning capital to our shareholders, and we are comfortably below our targeted two-times leverage ratio. For the full year, we repurchased 56 million of our shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 billion. We ended the year with 558 million shares outstanding. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $2.9 billion of capital back to our shareholders, which is a return of approximately 12%.</p>
          <p>Right now, given everything we see, we believe these high levels of capital returns to be sustainable into the future. If you calculate diluted earnings per share using our year end share count, full year EPS would be 5% higher than what we reported just based on the lower number of shares.</p>
          <p>Now, touching on our restructuring, in the September quarter, we took actions to address our cost structure by improving our efficiency and reducing our head count in a number of areas across the company. These actions resulted in a $130 million restructuring charge in the quarter. The steps we took put us in a good position for next year, even if we experience a slowing economy. The restructuring will result in approximately $140 million of annual cost savings, approximately $100 million of which will be realized in fiscal 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, moving on to our debt, for the most part it is fixed rate with an average cost of 5.8%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had approximately $400 million of commercial paper outstanding at quarter end. As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $7.4 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding, and approximately $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents.</p>
          <p>At September 30th, our $2 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio, at the end of the quarter, was 1.8 times. Based on our target leverage range, we have excess borrowing capacity. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least three times. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately ten times. If you look at our maturity profile, we have only $850 million of fixed rate debt coming due through 2015.</p>
          <p>Given our free cash flow profile and the lack of substantial &#x2013; substantive maturities, we are in a secure position to weather any market turmoil and continue to return capital to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the 2012 fiscal year. Philippe talked about the ad sales marketplace. In terms of our affiliate revenue, on an annual basis, we continue to see revenue growth in the high-single-digit to double-digit range based on fiscal 2011 affiliate revenue base which includes incremental digital agreements.</p>
          <p>Given that revenue recognition on some digital deals is tied to product availability, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will not be as linear as it has been in the past. Accordingly, in the December quarter, we expect the affiliate revenue growth to be at a rate in the mid-teens.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that Media Networks 2012 programming expense will grow in the mid- to high-single digit range. Our restructuring actions and ongoing expense management will enable us to continue to grow our margins as we invest in our brands and programs.</p>
          <p>At Filmed Entertainment, last &#x2013; last December's quarter benefited from the sale of the distribution rights to The Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel. The December quarter of this year will be impacted by the timing of P&amp;A expense related to the theatrical release of Mission Impossible and The Adventures of Tintin at the end of the quarter. Accordingly, the studio's December quarter will face difficult bottom line comparisons on a year to year basis. However, we do see healthy growth in profits at the studio in the March quarter.</p>
          <p>For 2012, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 35.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash taxes, given the sun-setting in December of accelerated deductions related to film and television production, we expect cash taxes to mirror book action taxes for the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of our stock buyback program we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of stock in the December quarter, and we expect to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for fiscal 2012.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead at the studio's development pipeline. Paramount continues to grow its portfolio of film franchises. In December, the studio will release Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol on a worldwide basis as well as release domestically The Adventures of Tintin which is a Nickelodeon branded collaboration. In April, the studio will re-release James Cameron's Titanic in 3D in conjunction with Fox. Paramount is also planning the sequel to G.I. Joe and J.J. Abrams is currently focused on developing the next installment of Star Trek. In addition, the studio continues to work on the creation of new franchises such as World War Z starring Brad Pitt.</p>
          <p>As for our Media Networks brands, Paramount is developing a Nickelodeon branded live action movie based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. Also, starting in 2014, Paramount will release one CGI animated franchise per year through our recently launched animation division headed by David Stainton.</p>
          <p>To wrap up, in fiscal 2011, we generated strong top and bottom line results. We grew our operating margins and aggressively returned capital to our shareholders. While we have recently experienced ratings softness, we remain committed to investing in our brand and strengthening their competitive position. We continue to operate with a focus on investing in organic opportunities in our core businesses in order to drive earnings per share and free cash flow. We believe that this operating focus, combined with an aggressive capital return program of our share buybacks and dividends, will drive value for our shareholders over the long-term.</p>
          <p>So thanks for listening now, and we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?</p>

          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I cited in my remarks some of the factors. There is some softness that we're seeing in the volume in the scatter market. We had the ratings issues, principally that anomalous situation at Nickelodeon during an important selling season for Nickelodeon. So &#x2013; and it's also an early date in the quarter. You know that this is a big quarter as we get into the latter part of November and into December.</p>
          <p>So I think the issues that we had probably will leave us short of the double-digit growth that we had aspired to. But it's really too early to tell where &#x2013; you know, where we'll fall exactly in &#x2013; in the growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>During that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if you could talk a bit about you mentioned disappointments in some of these extended repeats in acquired programming. So as you move away from acquired programming to more originals, can you talk about what the margin impact would be maybe on network by network &#x2013; you don't have to give me the network details but is this a profitable switch relative to margins, or will margins go down as you invest more in originals and move away from extended repeats?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, as you know, Michael, we have &#x2013; even in the recession, we were able to maintain our margins, and outside of that period, we've been growing our margins in our Media Networks segment. So this has been a gradual process. We are not walking away from third party acquisitions. We have to be more selective in buying those that will play out better. It's not that they don't work initially, it's that they don't run as long. They have always fallen off after a period of time, and that period of time is getting shorter.</p>
          <p>So as we go forward, for those of our networks, because some of our networks are 90% original programming or more, but as &#x2013; as we look at networks that are more dependent or have historically been more dependent on third party programs, like at TV Land, we have been moving gradually as we get off the third party acquisitions, to produce shows like Hot in Cleveland, The Exes and as we build that library, those, by the way, play well in repeats for us and we own them. We can sell them to digital outlets and traditional outlets around the world.</p>
          <p>So in this new world of distribution where there is more revenue opportunity, this will play out well for us both in current ratings and ad sales and will play out well for us in future revenues. So it's a good short term and long-term strategy, but we are basically doing it in a gradual way. But as we've been ending these past deals, we have more firepower to direct toward original programming.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a couple of questions. On Nickelodeon, you mentioned third party set top box data showing something different than the drop that Nielsen is showing. Can you just give us a sense of whether that third party set top box data is showing Nickelodeon ratings flat or up or just not declined as much as Nielsen? I'm just sort of curious relative to the 15% to 20% decline that Nielsen is showing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because we're working very closely with Nielsen and MRC, I don't want to go into too much detail, but let's just say that we wouldn't have had to have any conversation with either of them based on the set top box data that they are examining. That's the reason everybody believes there's an anomaly. We've made good progress. And certainly we've seen some improvement over the last several days. And I expect that to continue, particularly because our Nickelodeon people are not sitting still and we happened to have, in the hopper, before this arose, a lot of new programming. So the combination of those two should help quite a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is really an anomaly. Unfortunately it was a particularly bad time that this occurred. It was a pretty sudden occurrence in mid-September. So the timing was unfortunate. I believe it's a short term phenomenon. One that people, besides ourselves, recognized to be highly unusual, and we're just working it through as expeditiously as possible.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that. And then on the margin comments, maybe I'm digging a little bit too much, but given your international margins are in sort of a strong growth period, I don't know if, Tom, you want to respond to this, as we think about fiscal '12, should we think about both domestic and international margins for Media Networks as growing or is international really driving the overall growth? Thanks.</p>

          <p>The international story is a very good story, both in terms of the velocity of growth as we go forward and just the long-term value creation. We are reaching greater scale in many markets, and really rationalizing our operations around the world. And we have many opportunities to launch new channels and exploit new distribution opportunities that, for international, the opening up of markets through digital distribution is a very significant opportunity, given the difficulties that exist in certain markets for traditional distribution.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's actually Brandon Ross for Rich. A couple of questions. First, is the weakness in repeats being driving the availability of content on new platforms like Netflix? Meaning is the cash from digital not all incremental here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of our programming that we own, that we are selling to digital outlets, it is incremental because we've been very careful matching the windows on our own content.</p>
          <p>Now, whether the fact that there's a lot of content, new content available across the board, just in traditional if you look at what all the networks are doing now, there's more original programming on a number of channels, whether have you dramas on AMC or the original investments in many of the other networks out there, so there's a lot of choice people expect more fresh, original programming, and obviously tastes in genres evolve. You know, when people feel so uncertain, you know, they gravitate to comedies and that's why you've seen a resurgence in comedies.</p>
          <p>So there's clearly something going on because of the availability of programming. Not just on digital but on traditional distribution modes, where repeats are just not playing as well. Not necessarily the second, third, fourth repeat, but the 15th or 20th repeat of a show that we used to be able to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And just a second question, now that EPIX is available on Roku, would you guys think about launching a direct to consumer business, given that all of the distributors are not distributing EPIX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, now, we're focused on expanding distribution traditionally, we &#x2013; as we have been expanding distribution, you know, with the benefit that we do offer is distribution on any device for authenticated customers. We &#x2013; on broadband, you know, obviously we have the Netflix 20-million plus subscribers. The exclusivity window on that deal will open up next year. And that will open up additional opportunities. So, you know, look, the increased ways in which consumers can look at the EPIX content will drive incremental revenues. The cost structure is pretty well-set. The only variability there is how the movies perform that it has committed to buy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if there was any way to quantify the impact on advertising from the anomalous Nickelodeon ratings issue. I mean, is there anything that you can really quantify? That's one question.</p>
          <p>And then on the share repurchase, you know action you've got $10 billion, two years, you're doing $2.5 billion in year one, are you trying to signal that this is going to be very back-end loaded or is it just kind of a measure of conservatism in your guidance for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We said at least 2.5 billion in 2012.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>So that leaves some flexibility there.</p>
          <p>Philippe, do you want to answer the other one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah in terms of &#x2013; it's &#x2013; Nickelodeon, again, because of the time period, it does impact it, so to the extent we had aspirations of having double-digit advertising growth in this quarter, you know, that really took that off the table. But obviously we're trying to manage it as well as we can, including the rest of the quarter on Nickelodeon, with all the fresh programming to mitigate the impact.</p>
          <p>In any event, the total impact, given all of the other things going on in the company, as Tom mentioned, we are going to have a very healthy teens growth in affiliate revenues in the quarter. We have the benefit of solid cost efficiencies, so when you put it all together, we have strong operating momentum going forward. It's a little blip in the quarter but it's not, in my view, a fundamental event in terms of our operating momentum, given everything else that's going on around the company.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question is from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, first off for Tom, you mentioned affiliate growth in the high-teens in the first quarter. Just wondering if you could give us a little more granularity on the drivers there, you know, how much of that is incremental growth driven by your digital deals? And even on the traditional side if you could &#x2013; if you could split out rate and units? You know, basic assumption might be flat units of subscribers and then rate increases in the mid- to high-single-digits, I'm just wondering if you could confirm those types of assumptions. And I have a follow-up, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take that, Anthony. As far as our growth in the quarter, a lot of it, as Tom indicated in his remarks, are driven by recognition of digital revenues under the deals that we have, as well as some incremental digital deals. We are in constant discussions.</p>
          <p>We don't &#x2013; we don't go &#x2013; just as we don't go in on the traditional deals, we don't go in, as some do, on what the specific deals we're doing or what's involved there. On the traditional side, we have healthy rate growth. It's largely rate increases. We're getting more subs on some of our networks that aren't fully distributed, again, pursuant to affiliate deals that we have. And as digital viewing on &#x2013; on traditional distributors increases, that gives more sub growth for some of our digital tier driven networks. So it's a combination of things but largely rate increase on traditional side and digital revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anthony, about 80% of the growth is coming from rate increases. About 20% is unit increases and the unit increases, as Philippe just indicated, as cable operators, you are know, put more digital boxes out there, that expands our channel capacity in the digital world, so that's where we pick up the additional units, even though the aggregate amount of units of subscribers might be declining.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful, thanks. And then a follow-up for Philippe on this measurement issue with Nielsen, it does seem as though we've been hopeful and talking about better measurement on tablets, on smartphones, on mobile devices for a while, I'm just wondering what is the current plan in place and what is the timing in place for Nielsen to start measuring this viewership? I mean clearly it's important for kids, all of us on the phone, we have kids that are watching this content on iPads and I just wonder what is the plan for Nielsen? What is their plan to start integrating, you know, we went through the cycle C-plus-3 and we got &#x2013; I think the industry got where it wanted to go on DVR playback. I mean, what's the plan on mobile measurement? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nielsen would be better able to answer what their plan is. Obviously everyone in the industry has been pushing for this to happen because if you are a content and brand owner, such as we are, we would like to get our content out there as much as possible and have it measured, because that is the currency. So that's really been an impediment to so-called full TV everywhere. There's some other issues such as security and the like. But this is a very significant issue. And this is why we &#x2013; we have to have the right economic arrangements in TV everywhere kind of situations now, in an environment where we can't get advertising monetization on those because of a lack of measurement. So Nielsen is telling all of us that they are working on the issue, but I certainly am not in a position to give a date when it's really going to happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anthony, there's some folks in the industry that believe over the next 12 months they will incrementally add features and build-up over that period of time to get a better measurement of that consumption, and then in 24 to 36 months, there will be the whole notion of inserting commercials dynamically as a possibility which could be a very positive development for everybody in the advertising business.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just have a question on the buyback to make sure I'm doing the math right. Free cash &#x2013; assuming no working capital swings, free cash flow after the dividend payments is about $2 billion a year. You said you're doing about &#x2013; you're targeting about $7.2 billion of this buyback over the next two years. Are you essentially saying you're going to be taking on debt of about 1.5 billion a year over the next two years, or do you think free cash flow is going to grow because of some, you know, swing in working capital?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, we have operating momentum. Our leverage ratio, as Tom indicated, closed out the year at 1.8, below our two times target. We are going to have to increase our leverages to stay up to that 2.0 target given our operating momentum, so the &#x2013; the buybacks will be funded both by our free cash flow and our borrowing back up to that two times leverage point, you know, as our operating growth takes down our leverage ratio without that additional debt.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just to follow-up on your comments on the fiscal Q1 advertising market. Could you give us a sense of roughly what percentage of inventory you do have available for scatter, or  put another way, how much in the December quarter you've sold in the upfront? And then in the most recent cancellation period, were the options excised on the normal level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cancellations were at the normal level, nothing unusual there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, we have a very little scatter left and the marketplace has been very pretty dynamic. So the scatter has pretty much sold out. There's some left sort of at the last couple of weeks, be able to fill out the movie studies, so we have about 20% left, I'd say, of our total scatter inventory.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you just talked about all the original programming hours on Nickelodeon coming up. Any sense on, I guess, timing on when we should see that roll out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have 50 episodes for the rest of this year and about 450 episodes for the following three quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Two quick questions. First, assuming there is some sort of error in the Nickelodeon measurements, is there any way to recapture some of the lost revenue? And then secondly, I think you talked about scatter pricing up in the mid-teens above the up-front a few weeks back. Is that still the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of recapturing lost revenue, you know, unfortunately because of that sales period, this is where the toy companies, everybody else is looking to advertise for the holidays, so to the extent that there were shortfalls in the range at Nickelodeon, this is why it is taking our number down for the quarter, you know, we had to make it up to them. So that's something you can't recapture. Now, obviously we've been looking forward, so we'll go through that blip. It's not material to the overall company, and we will move on.</p>
          <p>What was the other question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Just wondering if you could give a little color on advertising categories. Are you seeing any categories with kind of continued strength in demand as opposed to some where you think there might have been some pull forward into the upfront out of the scatter market of their buying? And then, I guess a longer term question, you mentioned your increased investment in research on programming and I'm just wondering if you think over time that's going to help you get more consistency in your ratings, or monetization, over time? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome. Well, we are seeing strength in the movie category, given the number of titles, given the types of titles that are coming out, whether it's the family titles or the youth-oriented titles, this is a good quarter for the movie category. Toys are a strong category in this quarter. This is why it's so vexing to have had this issue I mentioned.</p>
          <p>And we've been seeing good growth in these non-endemics, which in terms of the long run, is a good trend for us because we clearly have a low market share. That's why the fact that autos and insurance were within our top five growing categories year-on-year is an important phenomenon for us and one we are working to continue to build as we maintain our strong share in categories like movies, like toys, like QSR's, like telecom.</p>
          <p>As far as our investment in research in programming, yes, they are &#x2013; we take a look at our brand direction. We've &#x2013; if you look back historically at how we've revitalized the BET and MTV brands and we're applying those same tools to all of our networks so that we can &#x2013; we're never going to have complete consistency. It is show business. You are subject to consumer taste. But staying close to our consumers, creating programing that we own, that we develop, should overall improve our performance over the long-term.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our research in terms of what we know about kids, teens, young adults, our millennial research has been a key asset as we share that with some of our key advertising partners, and that really does pay off in spades because they are very interested in the behavior of those targeted demographics and how they are going to impact their businesses into the future. So that's a key linkage that we have, and I think a significant advantage we have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thank you. I was wondering how big of an opportunity is consumer licensing revenue for your international unit? You are one of the biggest players in the world, and that's a very high margin revenue stream. Can you tell us how much you expect it to contribute over the next couple of years and if you see any opening opportunities there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a big opportunity. It's one that obviously has to build-up. We'll see it grow for the next couple of years timeframe, but it really should grow significantly beyond that time period. And what we've done is we've beefed up our international licensing operation. We've secured talent from other organizations, and most importantly, you know, we have acquired new intellectual property so that we can compete well on the girls' aisle and the boys' aisle across different toy and soft goods categories.</p>
          <p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will be fueled by &#x2013; which was a great consumer products franchise in the past, we think we can make it bigger that it was in the past, fueled by the Nickelodeon show, by the Paramount movie, by enhanced distribution, and the expansion of Nickelodeon, not just the Nickelodeon channel but Nick Jr. and other channels on an international basis will give us the additional marketing platform to drive that. So that's a major focus at Nickelodeon but also at Paramount. We're very excited by that opportunity and should significantly contribute to our bottom line and asset value over the long term.</p>
