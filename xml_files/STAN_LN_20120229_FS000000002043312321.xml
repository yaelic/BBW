      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, London. Good afternoon to those of you in Hong Kong and in Mumbai. I'm delighted to report that 2011 was our ninth consecutive year of record income and profits. And this performance once again shows that we are in the right markets, with the right strategy, and have the right leadership in place to deliver consistent value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Standard Chartered has continued to perform strongly with an 11% increase in profits. Despite our rights issue in 2010, we have delivered a return on equity of over 12%. And we enter 2012 in great shape, poised for further growth, with strong momentum in both of our businesses. Now in a moment, Richard will walk you through today's results in more detail and then Peter will talk about where we see opportunities to grow the business in the next few years.</p>
          <p>But first, there are a number of things I'd like to highlight. As a board, we continue to keep shareholder interests top of mind when determining our strategy. In the last few years, our income &#x2013; we have grown our income, profits, and earnings per share while simultaneously increasing our capital reserves and total dividends. Despite turbulence in the global markets and the increased cost of regulation, we have continued to generate considerable value for our shareholders year on year.</p>
          <p>This year, we are again increasing the total amount of dividend paid to shareholders. The board is recommending a final dividend of $0.5125 per share, bringing the total annual dividend to $0.76 per share, which is up 10%.</p>
          <p>I'm quite sure that there will be some of you at least here today who will be interested in our approach to remuneration. Put simply, our approach to remuneration has not changed. We continue to reward our people for sustained high performance. And we do not reward failure or short-term risk taking. Despite considerable growth in profits, the bonus pool has been kept flat and the amount we are paying out in bonuses is less than we are paying out to our shareholders by way of a dividend.</p>
          <p>Let me also comment on the contribution we have made more broadly to society and the communities we serve. In the five years since 2006, we have increased our total lending by more than 90% with mortgage lending up 40%, and SME lending up 70%. We now employ nearly 87,000 people. It's worth noting that in achieving this, we have not taken a penny in direct government support anywhere in the Group.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, 2011 was another year of strong performance for Standard Chartered. And the board remains confident for the year ahead. Despite continued global uncertainty and despite the ever-changing regulatory environment, the Bank is in great shape and we have again demonstrated the continued success of our strategy, our diverse footprint, our unique culture and values, and most especially, the quality of our people.</p>
          <p>Let me now ask Richard to take you through the numbers. Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Good morning, London, and good afternoon to Hong Kong and Mumbai. What I'll be presenting to you today is another very good set of results. And we have delivered this despite the challenges in the external operating environment.</p>
          <p>As you listen to this presentation, there are a number of recurring themes. Firstly, continued top-line growth and good momentum in both businesses. Secondly, the diversity of our performance be it by geography, by product or client segment, giving the Group real segment &#x2013; giving the Group real resilience. And thirdly, our conservative operating model demonstrated by our capital, liquidity and funding strength, allowing us to remain open for business for our customers and our clients.</p>
          <p>Let me draw out several key highlights. This is the ninth consecutive year of record income and profit with income over $17.6 billion and profit of almost $6.8 billion. We have delivered double-digit income growth, up 10%, including double-digit growth in Consumer Banking income and in Wholesale Banking client income.</p>
          <p>Expenses are also up 10% despite the impact of the UK bank levy and a materially higher takeup on the early retirement program, or ERP, in Korea than we had expected. Our strong cost control has allowed us to continue to invest in both businesses.</p>
          <p>We delivered neutral cost income jaws for 2011 on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of the UK bank levy, jaws were 2% positive, and excluding the ERP as well, jaws were 4% positive. Double-digit growth in both pre- and post-impairment profit up 10% and 11%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet is in excellent shape, with an advances-to-deposit ratio of 76.4% and a liquid assets ratio of 27.5%. Continued capital strength with Core Tier 1 at 11.8% and total capital at 17.6%. This is an excellent all round performance, demonstrating the resilience of our business model and strategy.</p>
          <p>Over the past nine years, income has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 16% and profit at 21%. Our balance sheet strength and the consistency of our performance have been recognized by the rating agencies. We are the only major international bank to have been upgraded by all three rating agencies since the start of the financial crisis and most recently by Standard &amp; Poor's in December 2011.</p>
          <p>When considering the 2011 performance, there are a number of areas where the final outcome is different from guidance given at the time of the pre-close in December. Firstly, we had a very strong December with Wholesale Banking performing particularly well and across all businesses despite difficult market conditions, thereby enabling the Group to deliver double-digit income growth.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the takeup of the ERP in Korea was far stronger than we had expected. We had signaled the likely cost to be some mid to high tens of millions of dollars, whereas the final cost was $206 million, primarily in Consumer Banking, some $150 million higher than we had expected. As well as being a nonrecurring item, it is anticipated that this will deliver ongoing savings of some $95 million per annum, and, therefore, a $300 million positive delta to expenses in 2012.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, the UK bank levy has settled at $165 million versus the $185 million guided. Fourthly, the loan impairment for the year is up 3% as opposed to our expectation of being below the level seen in 2010, and I will go into this in more detail later.</p>
          <p>And finally, the effective tax rate was lower at 27.2% reflecting both changes in profit mix and increased utilization of foreign tax credits relating to branch profits.</p>
          <p>Looking at the final performance for 2011. Income has grown 10% year-on-year. Net interest income is up 20%, reflecting continued growth in customer loans and customer deposits, up 9%, and 11%, respectively, and also an increase in our liability margins. Non-interest income is down 1%. Within this, Consumer Banking non-interest income was up 8%, driven by strong performances in wealth management and SME. Wholesale Banking non-interest income was down 5%, with the increase in transaction banking insufficient to offset a decline in corporate finance and financial markets.</p>
          <p>We have maintained a firm grip on expenses, up 10%, while continuing to invest in both businesses to build the income engines of tomorrow. Loan impairment was up 3% reflecting our diversified portfolio, the economic performance to the markets we serve, our disciplined approach to risk management and in Consumer Banking, the benefit attached into the sale of a number loan portfolios.</p>
          <p>Other impairment is higher at $111 million compared to $76 million predominantly due to higher charges against Indian exposures taken in the first half. Operating profit of $6.775 billion is up 11%. Underpinning this strong performance is the diversity of our business. Next slide.</p>
          <p>The diversity of the Group whether by geography or by product is something we have consciously built out over the past decade or so. This diversity gives us real resilience and underpins the Group's stability to continue to grow even when some geographies had a difficult year. Our largest market, Hong Kong, contributed just 17% of the Group's income in 2011 even after an exceptionally strong performance.</p>
          <p>A number of geographies delivered a strong performance in 2011 particularly markets where we prioritized investment in 2010 with Hong Kong, Singapore, China, Malaysia and Indonesia primary examples. This has allowed the Group to deliver record levels of income in a year when one of our largest geographies, India, saw income fall by 11%.</p>
          <p>You can see on this slide a number of product areas and capabilities that we have invested in over recent years such as corporate finance, commodities, and within transaction banking and foreign exchange renminbi capabilities that have added diversity to the product mix.</p>
          <p>Looking at performance metrics. This slide shows the key performance metrics both on a reported basis, which includes the UK bank levy and also excluding the levy. Excluding the impact of the levy, profit was up 13%, normalized EPS was up 4% to $2.05 in part reflecting the full dilutive impact of the rights issue completed in November 2010.</p>
          <p>The current level of return on equity is impacted by the levels of capital the Group is now carrying to meet the emerging regulatory requirements and the continuing drag of a low interest rate environment on a deposit-rich bank. Return on equity was 12.2% on a reported basis and 12.6%, excluding the impact of the levy.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet. The balance sheet remains conservative, well diversified, highly liquid, and strongly capitalized, a source of real competitive advantage. We remain open for business and in growth mode. The Group remains primarily deposit funded with total deposits up 12% year-on-year and 31% over the last two years despite increasing levels of competition for liquidity across a number of our markets.</p>
          <p>Our advances-to-deposit ratio and liquid asset ratio both remained strong. Our A/D ratio was 76.4% and our liquid asset ratio increased to 27.5%. We continue to be a significant net lender to the interbank market and we have some $165 billion of liquid assets.</p>
          <p>We also have minimal refinancing requirements over the next few years, only some $4 billion through to the end of 2013 and both our Wholesale Banking and Consumer Banking businesses are self-funded.</p>
          <p>In terms of Basel III, we already meet the minimum requirement of 100% for both the net stable funding ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio well ahead of the required implementation date.</p>
          <p>Turning to assets. Our customer loans and advances, which grew 9% in 2011, continue to be well-diversified by geography and by sector. Hong Kong remains our largest geography. However, this represents only 19% of customer loans and advances. We have a continuing bias to secured lending in Consumer Banking, with 83% of the book being either fully or partially secured. We have low loan-to-value ratios on our mortgage book with an average of 49%.</p>
          <p>We have a short maturity profile on our Wholesale Banking loan book with 64% of the book under one year in tenure, reflecting the trade bias of our business. We have no direct sovereign exposure to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal or Spain, our total direct exposure to entities domiciled in these countries remains low at around 0.5% of total assets. We've been actively managing our European exposures for the last two years.</p>
          <p>Moving on to capital. The Group continues to maintain a very strong capital position, with a core Tier 1 ratio of 11.8%. We have generated $4.7 billion of profit attributable to ordinary shareholders. We continue to grow risk-weighted assets in both businesses, with Wholesale Banking up 12% and Consumer Banking up 7%. The majority of growth in risk-weighted assets has been driven by credit risk. In addition, market risk risk-weighted assets was up 35%, or some $6 billion, reflecting in the main, the introduction of Basel 2.5. Tier 1 is at 13.7%, and total capital is at 17.6%. We remain extremely well-capitalized, and are generating good levels of organic equity.</p>
          <p>Throughout 2011, we have had good support from capital markets, raising almost $5 billion of lower Tier 2 and CDO funding. The support has continued into 2012, evidence in January by two successful transactions in the senior unsecured and lower Tier 2 capital space. Both were heavily oversubscribed, reflecting the strong demand in the market for our name.</p>
          <p>Looking now at performance by business and Consumer Banking. The Consumer Banking business had a strong year in 2011 with record income up 12% to almost $6.8 billion. The business has benefited from selective growth in unsecured assets, improving deposit margins, and the impact of the investments made in 2010. Asset margins in the second half were up on the first half by a couple of basis points, generating positive momentum into 2012. Within this performance, we have seen good double-digit income growth across all of our high values segments with private banking up 21%, SME up 14% and priority banking up 10%.</p>
          <p>Expenses increased 10% resulting in positive jaws, which ran to 1% as we maintained tight control on business-as-usual costs. We've continued to standardize processes and improve cost efficiency to increase our investment capacity. In 2011, we have continued to invest in our Consumer Banking franchise with head count up by over 1,200 staff focused on China, Singapore Hong Kong and Africa. Within this total, frontline head count was up nearly 1,000. We added 35 new branches in 2011, including 19 in China. In addition, we have refreshed or replaced more than 400 ATMs, we have enhanced our mobile and Internet banking capabilities and increased marketing spend year on year by some tens of millions of dollars.</p>
          <p>You can see from the slide that expenses in the second half increased 18% or $387 million over the first half, reflecting, firstly, the non-recurrence of recoveries made against structured note provisions in the first half of $86 million. Secondly, a chafe of $189 million relating to the Consumer Banking share of the ERP charge in Korea, and, thirdly, increased investment spend in the second half by some tens of millions of dollars. The Consumer Banking loan impairment charge has decreased by 9% to $524 million, but increased in the second half of the year and I'll go into this in more detail later. As a result, Consumer Banking profit is up an excellent 26% to $1.65 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning to products. Mortgage income was down 2% with margin compression of some 30 basis points and a 2% fall in balances primarily in Korea. Margins in our key markets were impacted by competition, regulation and the increased cost of liquidity. Market shares remained strong in our key mortgage geographies although we have given up some share as we have priced the book up across a number of markets, including Hong Kong, Korea, China, and India.</p>
          <p>We're seeing good growth in deposits despite increased competition for liabilities across some of our key markets such as Hong Kong, Singapore, India and Taiwan. Deposit income is up 17% year on year benefiting from a 6% increase in balances and an improvement in margins of some seven basis points.</p>
          <p>Wealth management delivered double digit income growth year on year with income up 12%. In the second half wealth management income has shown good resilience, but was down 6% on the first half impacted by weaker investor sentiment given the slowing global economy and market volatility. The outlook for wealth management remains very much influenced by any resolution to the European debt crisis.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide. Income in credit cards and personal loans, or CCPLs, shows excellent momentum, up 18% year on year. Balances increased 17% over 2010, driven by selective asset growth in markets such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Korea and we continue to gain market share.</p>
          <p>SME income is up 14% year on year driven mainly by cash management and foreign exchange. We have delivered 30% higher income per customer managed by a relationship manager across our top eight markets. The SME book remains deposit led, is predominantly secured, and we continue to maintain a strong vigilance on the credit quality of our loan book and we focus on building multi-product relationships.</p>
          <p>Moving to impairment. Loan impairment is down both in terms of dollars and basis points of loss. Overall, Consumer Banking loan impairment was $524 million, 9% down on 2010. Loan impairment increased by some $102 million half-on-half reflecting four factors: the underlying growth of our book, mix change, a small portfolio impairment charge in the second half as opposed to a release in the first half, and a lower level of sales of written down portfolios in the second half.</p>
          <p>Looking by product, you will see that loan-loss rates are down across all product categories. Included within other loans are CCPL balances of $19.1 billion, up 17% or $2.8 billion year on year. The improvement in loss rates resulted mainly from the improved portfolio performance in India and in the UAE, continued investment in collections infrastructure and the benefit from sales of written down portfolios.</p>
          <p>We remain comfortable with our overall exposures and continue proactively to manage our book. However, in 2012, we expect loan impairment to increase, reflecting the size and the mix of the loan book as well as some lower levels of sales of written down portfolios. To summarize for Consumer Banking, overall, this is a strong set of results with good double-digit income growth. We have maintained a tight grip on expenses, but have continued to invest in order to underpin future income momentum.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking. Wholesale Banking has delivered another strong performance in 2011 with income up 9% and client income up 10%, the ninth consecutive year of double-digit client income growth. Own account income was up 2% on 2010 levels. We continue to focus on deepening client relationships, with client income contributing 82% of total Wholesale Banking income.</p>
          <p>In 2011, 48% of Wholesale Banking client income was generated offshore, up from 41% in 2010 and demonstrating the importance of the network and the increasing interconnectivity of our markets. Total Wholesale Banking income in the second half was broadly flat on the first half, reflecting the resilience of the business model even in a challenging period.</p>
          <p>We have seen a number of repricing opportunities across our footprint in 2011 partially reflecting our dollar liquidity strength, but also some withdrawal of European competitors. For example, we have repriced corporate loans in Hong Kong, and there was evidence of repricing in debt capital markets across our core footprint. Cash margins have improved year on year, and trade margins, although down on 2010, increased marginally in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Expenses rose 6% in 2011, but were broadly flat half on half, we've maintained a tight control on costs despite an acceleration of investment spend in the second half of the year. Investment in 2011 was mainly focused on technology and infrastructure, such as continued investment in our transaction banking platforms.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking head count increased by some 600 staff during the year with new investment head count mainly in operations to support volume growth. Loan impairment in 2011 was up 26%, and other impairment was up 55%, and I'll go into more detail on this later.</p>
          <p>Profit before tax increased 9% to reach a record $5.2 billion. This strong performance was delivered despite a challenging market environment, with high levels of uncertainty and volatility driven principally by that Eurozone crisis.</p>
          <p>Looking at income in more detail. Income remains well-diversified with double-digit growth in the three largest businesses, transaction banking, financial markets and corporate finance. Commercial banking, by which I mean trade, cash management, lending and the associated foreign exchange, remains core to our clients' day-to-day business needs, and is at the heart of our Wholesale Banking business, contributing 55% of client income.</p>
          <p>Lending income fell 3% to $841 million with margin compression more than offsetting an increase in average balances of 15%. In trade, income was up 9%, driven by 25% growth in average assets and contingents, as we continue to take market share. Trade margins fell 14 basis points year on year, but showed a slight increase in the second half, benefiting from repricing across a number of our markets. Cash management income saw excellent growth of 27% over 2010, underpinned both by strong growth in average balances, up 25%, and an improvement in cash margins of 11 basis points.</p>
          <p>Global markets income increased 7%, with financial markets, the largest component, contributing 55% of total global markets income. I'll go into more detail on financial markets on the next slide. ALM income of $921 million is up 1%, with income in the second half up 14% on the first half, driven in particular by good income in China and in Korea.</p>
          <p>Corporate finance income was up 10% after a very strong finish to 2011. The 2011 corporate finance story is one of diversity and sustainability of income. We closed 15% more transactions with a greater number of small- to mid-sized deals across multiple geographies, and over 50% of income is net interest income.</p>
          <p>Principal finance income was down 34%, with the business impacted by difficult market conditions, which limited exit opportunities and put pressure on valuations. We continue to invest in this business, which has a good pipeline and strong returns.</p>
          <p>Financial markets. Our financial markets business benefited from good volume growth as a result of its strong link to our transaction banking products set, giving it resilience despite difficult market conditions. Foreign exchange income was up 20%, driven by a 14% increase in slow foreign exchange volumes, and strong growth in our options business. Foreign exchange income has benefited from good growth in our transaction banking business and also from the internationalization of the renminbi.</p>
          <p>The rates business was up 7%, impacted by the benign interest rate environment and margin pressure from local bank competition. Commodities and equities grew strongly with income up 47%. Commodities performed particularly well, reflecting increased product capability as well as our ability to assist our clients in managing volatility and commodity prices. Commodity volumes continue to grow strongly.</p>
          <p>Capital markets income increased 1%. The business continues to win strategic transactions and ranks highly in the lead tables. Credit income was down 33% with transaction volumes impacted by difficult market conditions.</p>
          <p>Moving to loan impairment. Wholesale Banking loan impairment was $384 million, up 26% on 2010, with the vast majority of this loan impairment charge relating to increased provisioning on previously impaired accounts. Other impairment has increased from $64 million to $99 million, predominantly because of higher charges against Indian exposures taken in the first half of the year. Early alerts have increased mainly due to accounts affected by ongoing investigations in India. We continue to monitor the situation, but do not expect to see material impairment resulting from these early alert accounts.</p>
          <p>Gross non-performing loans in Wholesale Banking have decreased 11% since December 2010, mainly in the MESA region. Credit quality across the Wholesale Banking book remains strong. We remain watchful, but are not currently seeing any signs of stress. We continue to be disciplined and proactive in our approach to risk management. Our Wholesale Banking loan book is conservative, diverse, and predominantly short dated.</p>
          <p>To summarize, Wholesale Banking has delivered another good set of results, with record levels of client income. There is currently good underlying business momentum building off the back of a strong close to 2011.</p>
          <p>Turning to geographic performance, Peter will talk to you in more detail about Greater China, India, Singapore and Korea. However, let me highlight some of the other geographies. Within other APR, which grew income 12%, China, Indonesia and Malaysia all delivered double-digit growth. MESA income increased 2%, in part impacted by the geo-political events within the region. Within this, the UAE, which represents over 50% of MESA income, grew by 4%, and both Pakistan and Bangladesh grew income at a double-digit rate.</p>
          <p>Africa's income growth of 8% was driven mainly by Wholesale Banking, which contributes over two-thirds of total income. Wholesale Banking client income grew 10%, with both transaction banking and financial markets performing very well in 2011, offsetting a decline in corporate finance. Consumer Banking income grew 11%, with good growth in credit cards and personal loans, as well as wealth management.</p>
          <p>The Americas, UK and Europe region continues to originate and support our clients' cross-border business within our footprint of Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In 2011, income increased 16%, and profit by 58%, with strong performances in cash management, ALM, and commodities.</p>
          <p>Turning then to outlook. We have started 2012 strongly off the back of a very strong finish to 2011. Looking at January and our momentum into February, Consumer Banking has had a good start with income ahead of the comparable period last year. Wholesale Banking has had a strong start with income well ahead. Expenses are under tight control across the Bank and credit quality remains good.</p>
          <p>We continue to take a conservative approach to managing the balance sheet, maintaining a strong liquidity position and keeping a watchful eye on asset quality given the uncertainties in the external environment. We will maintain a tight grip on expenses whilst continuing to invest in growth. As you have come to expect, we will manage cost growth in line with income growth, so neutral jaws.</p>
          <p>However, when thinking about our performance in 2012, it is important to bear in mind a number of factors: first of all, the material and increasing drag on both income and costs from an evermore complex set of regulatory requirements; secondly, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against Asian currencies; and thirdly, we are not immune to potential turbulence in the global economy whether arising from the Eurozone or elsewhere.</p>
          <p>So, we started the year with very good momentum and exceptionally strong balance sheet and a full transaction pipeline. We remain focused on the fundamentals of our business and on the disciplined execution of our strategy. We are well-positioned in some of the most exciting growth markets in the world and we are well placed to make the most of the opportunities they present.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And now I'll hand over to Peter.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard. Good morning to all of you and good afternoon to those of you in Hong Kong and India. As John and Richard have said, these results represent our ninth consecutive year of record income and profits. We are superbly placed in some of the world's fastest growing markets. We have the right strategy, a distinctive culture and values, a strong brand. We are focused on delivering for our shareholders, supporting our clients and customers, and making a positive impact on the communities in which we live and work.</p>
          <p>But you shouldn't let the consistency of our performance mask the underlying achievement. Every year brings new challenges and 2011 was no exception. Two of our largest markets saw sharp falls in profits. Some of our business streams particularly in Wholesale Banking faced very difficult conditions. The increasing burden of regulation and the UK bank levy created significant headwinds. Yet, our 2011 performance demonstrates once again the power of our strategy and the resilience of our business model.</p>
          <p>The crisis that began in 2007 and brought markets to a halt in the autumn of 2008 continues to unfold. The roots of the crisis are now laid bare, too much debt, too little growth, and erosion of competitiveness and massive macro imbalances. Restoring the vitality of the world's most developed economies is an enormous endeavor, with profound, social, and economic consequences.</p>
          <p>Working through these problems will be painful and will take time. Governments are struggling to control borrowing without undermining growth and employment. Regulators are wrestling with how to make the banking system safer without triggering too much deleveraging. Central bankers are pumping money in, but in doing so, risk laying the seeds for the next crisis. Ugly turn to protectionism and populism are being heard everywhere.</p>
          <p>Amidst all this, two facts are clear. One is that we are witnessing a profound shift in economic power and dynamism from the developed world to the emerging giants of the developing world. The second is that banks need to get out of the box of being part of the problem, and get into the mode of being part of the solution.</p>
          <p>The crisis has undoubtedly accelerated the fundamental shifts in the world economy. Whilst not immune to the problems of the West, countries like China, India, Brazil and Indonesia continue to grow at pace, building industries and infrastructure, turning hundreds of millions of people into consumers. The clouds over the West should not obscure the sheer scale of wealth creation and social progress in the developing world.</p>
          <p>Of course, such growth brings challenges: inflation, friction over resources, social inequality, environmental degradation. Moreover, the lack of consumption growth in the West undermines the export-driven model that has powered most Asian economies. But whilst we shouldn't underestimate such challenges, neither should we underestimate Asian countries' ability to respond. Intra-regional trade and investment is growing extremely rapidly, domestic consumption is growing fast, policy makers in Asia and particularly in China, have much more monetary, regulatory and fiscal flexibility than their counterparts in the West. Taken as a whole, emerging Asia should continue to grow at mid to high-single digit rates, slower than before the crisis, but still much faster than the West.</p>
          <p>This sharp polarization in economic performance and prospects is one reason different banks are in such different positions. Some banks have little choice but to deleverage, downsize and retreat. Others, like us, have the liquidity, capital and business model to turn the turbulence to our advantage. But all of us face the challenge of the ongoing avalanche of regulation, none of us can be complacent about the continuing fragility of the system. We are supportive of Basel III, yet we worry about the increasing profusion of national or regional variations. This is creating incredible complexity, huge costs and a multitude of unintended consequences, not least, the fragmentation of the global financial system and the emergence of new forms of financial protectionism.</p>
          <p>We also worry about the extent to which the regulatory agenda is driven through the rearview mirror. All the attention has been on avoiding another Lehmans or RBS. Very little of the Basel III agenda is relevant to the Eurozone crisis; even less has been done that might protect us from the longer-term consequences of QE, the LTRO, the extraordinary expansion of the role of central banks.</p>
          <p>At Standard Chartered, our approach to all of this is straightforward, stand above the fray, stick to our strategy and proven business model, focus on our clients and customers, keep a tight grip on the basic disciplines of good banking. But it is easier to say than it is to execute. Whilst we are rarely the specific targets of regulatory changes, they do affect us, they do erode our economics. Regulatory drag was a headwind in 2011 and will be again in 2012.</p>
          <p>Yet, for all the negatives, regulatory drags, slowing growth in Asia, the risk of political and economic stress in the Eurozone and the Middle East or elsewhere, we remain confident about our ability to grow and perform. Even as economic growth in our markets slows to more sustainable levels, we can win more market share. Our capital and funding strength allows us to be open for business while others are pulling down the shutters. We are taking share in core products, like trade finance, with volume growth of 25%.</p>
          <p>We see huge opportunities in our core markets of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, both within the individual markets and in facilitating the explosive growth of trade and investment flows within the emerging world. And we also see huge opportunities in being the bridge for trade and investment between Europe and the Americas and Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Whether it's helping Unilever or Diageo make the most of the opportunities in Asia, or Tata invest in Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, or Volkswagen, Tesco, Caterpillar issue RMB bonds.</p>
          <p>And it's by doing exactly this kind of thing, lending to clients, facilitating their trade, helping them manage FX and commodity price risk, identifying and supporting new partnerships and investments, helping them to access capital markets, that we are fulfilling our social purpose, helping drive economic growth, helping create jobs.</p>
          <p>At Standard Chartered, we've never lost sight of the role we play, of the impact we can have on the broader economy. In the five years since 2006, we've increased our lending by 91%, from large multinationals to SMEs, from credit cards to mortgages. Our profits have increased by 113% in the same period.</p>
          <p>Despite all that's changing around us, don't expect big changes in strategy. We still want to be the world's best international bank, leading the way in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We build deep, longstanding relationships with our clients and customers, we're focused on organic growth, investing at pace in both our businesses. We're obsessed with the basics of banking, being strongly capitalized and highly liquid, managing risk proactively, keeping tight control of costs, staying well diversified.</p>
          <p>Underpinning our strategy is a distinctive culture and set of values. Standard Chartered is here for good. Here for good in the sense of commitment and permanence, here for good in the sense of always seeking to do the right thing. But whilst the fundamentals of our strategy won't change, we will be constantly anticipating and adapting to the opportunities and challenges we see. Regulatory change will force us to do some things differently and will change the economics of some of our businesses, but our mindset is as much about how we turn such changes to our advantage as it is about mitigating the impact.</p>
          <p>So far, I've talked big picture stuff, the macro environment, regulation, our strategy. Now I want to change gear and talk about some specific markets. And rather than start with the success stories, let me start with some of the places in which we've faced challenges.</p>
          <p>Korea, as you know, we've not been satisfied with our performance in Korea. The cost income ratio has been too high and the return on capital too low. The core issue was labor productivity. We couldn't reward strong performance nor deal with poor performance. Pay was driven more by seniority than merit. Sustained efforts to get the union to agree to a more flexible approach had failed, so, in 2011, we took a more direct approach. This sparked a strike which lasted 10 weeks and then collapsed. We stayed open throughout the strike, a testament to the professionalism and commitment to our customers of many of our staff. And while it had some impact on income momentum of the order of $50 million, overall, income remained resilient, and customer deposits grew during 2011.</p>
          <p>In December, we launched an early retirement program. This had a big impact on Korea's profits in 2011, but it was undoubtedly the right thing to do. This program will deliver annualized savings of $95 million, and coupled with enhancement of performance management, will enable a big shift in the culture, making Korea much more like the rest of the Bank.</p>
          <p>To further underscore our commitment to Korea, in January, we rebranded the Bank, dropping the SC First Bank name that harks back to the acquisition of Korea First Bank and replacing it with Standard Chartered. Korea is now a seamless part of Standard Chartered as a whole.</p>
          <p>There's still lots to do before we really have Korea performing the way we want given the scale of the opportunities in the market. But we have taken significant steps in the right direction. We've just begun on the new lunar year. It's the year of the black dragon, auspicious for change and prosperity. So with a more productive platform, a business with momentum and the dragon in our favor, we enter 2012 with confidence.</p>
          <p>India was the second of our big markets to see a decline in profits in 2011. However, unlike in Korea, this followed a spectacular year. As you will recall, in 2010, India was our most profitable market. That 2011 proved challenging didn't surprise us at all. To tackle inflation, the Reserve Bank of India hiked interest rates 13 times in two years. This had a predictable impact on economic growth down from 8.5% in 2010 to 7% in 2011 and on business confidence. In addition, a combination of protracted political and corporate governance issues further sapped business confidence, resulting in many investment projects being delayed or canceled.</p>
          <p>Whilst this correction was very real, and the slowdown in regulatory reforms and vital infrastructure projects will have lasting consequences, we remain confident about the longer-term growth prospects of India. The underlying drivers of growth &#x2013; urbanization, demographics, better education and an extraordinarily dynamic and entrepreneurial business culture remain robust. Indeed, there are already some signs that the climate is changing, clear signals of an end to the rate cycle, some steps on critical reforms, progress on transparency issues.</p>
          <p>Moreover, looking only at the onshore income understates the strength of our India franchise. Whilst onshore Wholesale Banking income fell by 14%, income from Indian clients elsewhere in the network more than doubled largely offsetting this decline as we leverage our network to support our Indian clients' international objectives;</p>
          <p>So our enthusiasm for India as a market remains undiminished. We continue to invest apace in people, products, technology and branches. We remain convinced that India will become one of the world's largest economies and is one of our biggest growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>These two markets had a tough 2011, but I'm confident both will resume their growth path in 2012. And the fact that we can be hit by declines in profits in two of our biggest markets, but still deliver double-digit growth in profits and income demonstrates once again the resilience of our model, the advantages of having multiple and diverse engines of growth. Whilst India and Korea faltered, other markets surged.</p>
          <p>For example, Greater China. Taken together, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mainland China delivered income of $4.4 billion and profits of $2.1 billion, up 18% and 46%, respectively. Greater China thus represents 25% of the Group's total income and 31% of total profits.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong had an outstanding year with income up 22% to over $3 billion and profits up 41% to over $1.5 billion, a record for any of our markets. In Taiwan, profits were up 44% to $342 million helped in part by recoveries on structured notes. In Mainland China, income increased by 17% to $825 million while profits doubled to over $220 million.</p>
          <p>We're still making losses in Consumer Banking in Mainland China of around $100 million in 2011 as we continued to invest in building the franchise. We opened another 19 branches and sub-branches in 2011 taking our total network to 81 across 21 cities.</p>
          <p>In Wholesale Banking, profits hit $278 million. Yet even this number massively understates the development of our China client franchise since income from Chinese clients booked elsewhere in our network grew at over three times the pace of onshore client income.</p>
          <p>Our business in Greater China is increasingly focused as much on the flows between these markets as on the opportunities within them. As China's international financial center, Hong Kong is central to the internationalization of the renminbi. We have played a leading role in the explosive growth of offshore renminbi from the beginning. We conducted the first offshore trade settlement transaction in July 2009. We led the development of the dim-sum bond market and priced and launched 56 such bond issues last year.</p>
          <p>But Greater China isn't the only region in which we have seen strong performance in 2011. Across the ASEAN countries of Southeast Asia, we delivered income of $4.2 billion and profits of $1.9 billion, up 21% and 32%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Singapore was the star performer with income up 26% and profits up 40%. Singapore is now the third of our markets to have delivered more than $1 billion of profit following Hong Kong, which hit the mark for the first time in 2007 and India, which did so in 2009. In Singapore we are reaping the benefits of sustained investment for growth, primarily organic, but complemented by select capability acquisitions. This is a market in which we have more than doubled income and profit since 2007.</p>
          <p>As you may have seen, we have today announced that we will subsidiarize our Consumer and SME banking activities in Singapore. Our Wholesale Banking and private banking businesses in Singapore will remain within the branch. This decision reflects both our success and the growing scale and significance of the Bank's Consumer Banking business in Singapore. We have, of course, taken this decision in consultation with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and this is in line with their thinking. Subsidiarization of our Consumer and SME businesses will have minimal impact on the Group's capital or liquidity ratios and little or no impact on the vast majority of our customers.</p>
          <p>We see considerable opportunities for further growth in Singapore. In the Consumer and SME segments, there are opportunities to continue to make market share gains, which we believe, will be facilitated by moving to a locally incorporated structure.</p>
          <p>In private banking, we continue to capitalize on Singapore's strength as an international asset management and private banking center. And in Wholesale Banking, we see significant opportunities stemming from Singapore's role as a hub for trade, for investment, for commodities.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in ASEAN our businesses have performed strongly. Thailand grew income by 16% and profits by 18%. Malaysia grew income by 11% and profits by 18%. Indonesia, including both <mark type="ph" /> pamata (55:51) and our branch, grew income by 24% and profits by 44%. As in Greater China, we are leveraging our network strength to exploit the rapid growth of trade and investment between the countries of ASEAN and with the rest of the world. ASEAN has been somewhat overshadowed by Greater China. Yet with over 600 million people, aggregate GDP of $2.2 trillion growing at 5.3% per year, it represents one of the most exciting parts of the world economy.</p>
          <p>The themes illustrated by Greater China and ASEAN; multiple engines of growth; opportunities in markets and between them, are not just true of Asia, but hold true across our franchise.</p>
          <p>Our Africa business continues to grow well with income up 8% or 13% on a constant currency basis. Our Middle East franchise has proved resilient despite all the political turmoil in the region with income up 2%. In our biggest market in the region, the UAE, we are seeing a return of confidence despite the debt overhang with hotel bookings, airport arrivals, container traffic all up strongly. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, income was up 13% and in Bangladesh, 16%.</p>
          <p>In the West, i.e., Europe and the Americas, income was up 16% and profits by 58%. With Western banks in some disarray, with Western companies reaching out to the emerging world for growth and with Asian companies investing in the West to acquire technology and brands, we're taking advantage of the opportunities to be a bridge between East and West.</p>
          <p>To give you a sense of our diversity, we now have 24 markets contributing over $100 million of income, up from 23 in 2010 and 19 in 2007.</p>
          <p>Delivering record income and profits in any year is always a good result. To do this every year for nine years through a period of crisis and exceptional volatility is testament to the dedication, discipline and professionalism of the people of Standard Chartered. On behalf of the board, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them once again for their hard work in making this happen.</p>
          <p>We'd also like to take this opportunity to thank you, our investors, for your continued support not least in giving us the capital required to absorb new regulation and sustain our growth. Our balance sheet strength remains a powerful source of competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>Amidst all this turmoil, we remain committed to our performance aspirations. Over the medium term and through the cycle, we expect to deliver double-digit income growth, double-digit EPS growth, cost growth in line with income and mid-teens ROE. In 2011, we've delivered on double-digit income growth and flat jaws. But it fell short on EPS and ROE as a result of the dilutive impact of the rights issue in late 2010.</p>
          <p>Looking at 2012, we have had a very good start, which puts us on track to deliver a double-digit income, double-digit EPS and flat jaws. But is it very early days and you don't need reminding that there are very considerable risks and uncertainties in the world economy, for example, in the Eurozone or the Middle East. ROE will likely still be somewhat under our aspiration, partly as a result of ongoing regulatory drag and the lag before this gets fully reflected in margins and partly because of the impact of a low interest rate environment on a deposit-rich institution.</p>
          <p>Our markets are robust and resilient. We have the right strategy and we're sticking to it. We have a powerful brand, a distinctive culture and some fantastic people. Our client and customer franchise is stronger than it has ever been.</p>
          <p>2012 will undoubtedly bring new and unexpected challenges. The global recovery is fragile. There are many risks and uncertainties. We expect volatility and turbulence. Yet we entered the year in great shape. We're confident, but not complacent, excited about the opportunities in our markets, but alert to the risks, investing for growth, but keeping tight control on costs. Our businesses have good growth momentum and have begun the year well. We know what you expect from us. We know what we have to deliver. Thank you.</p>
          <p>John, Richard and I will now take questions here in London. Jaspal, Ben and Julian will take questions in Hong Kong. And Mike, Sunil and Anurag will take questions in Mumbai. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. If you could just remember, there is some protocol here, raise your hands if you want to ask a question, wait for a mic to be brought to you, and if you could say your name and the institution you represent, that would be great. If we could start here on the left, can we bring a mic here, and then we'll go over to the right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Ian Gordon from Investec, could I ask three, please? Firstly, on Hong Kong, I guess this was a standout performance, as far as I could see, especially given the headwinds you flagged, the lower own account income, the asset spread pressures in Consumer. And then, I note the differentiation with your larger peer, the fact that you delivered double-digit loan growth in both businesses even continuing in the second half, notwithstanding your limited appetite for mortgages, so I wonder if you could just provide a little bit of color about how that differentiation has been achieved and how sustainable it is?</p>
          <p>Secondly, wealth management, I thought the H2 performance was quite resilient, given quite the market issues, so within your outlook statements, guidance, you talk about the Consumer Bank being ahead year on year, can you comment on the wealth management contribution within that?</p>
          <p>And then in a similar vein, the third question, corporate finance was presumably a major contributor towards your strong Q4 finish in Wholesale Banking, again, can you talk about the pipeline in that product line, and how significant a contributor that was in terms of your very strong year on your improvement in Wholesale Banking in January and February? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll start by giving you a high level response, and then you can add some color, Richard. You're right. I mean, the Hong Kong performance was extremely broad-based across both businesses, across multiple customer segments, and product lines. The one thing, though, I would highlight about it is that China made actually a significant contribution to Hong Kong's performance a significant proportion of the offshore revenue of Chinese clients with Chinese clients doing things in Hong Kong, as you would expect, given Hong Kong's role as China's international financial center.</p>
          <p>On wealth management, yes, it had a resilient performance in the second half, and as you might imagine, the sort of more buoyant movement of market is good for wealth management as we entered 2012. And on corporate finance, you have taken a correct inference in that we &#x2013; corporate finance income in the third quarter was slowed by the difficult conditions in the markets. It was quite difficult to get transactions complete. But in Q4, and particularly through into December, there was actually quite a lot of activity, and we've entered the year with a very, very good pipeline.</p>
          <p>Richard, do you want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I take &#x2013; in reverse and go back so, to reinforce that the transaction pipeline at the end of the year in spite of a weak December remained robust, that's evident from the fact that the first two months of the year have also been very good. The December performance of the Wholesale was, however, broader than corporate finance. We also saw a very strong continued performance across the transaction banking businesses. We also had a couple of realizations out of the principal finance business which we had anticipated, but we're pleased to see arrive.</p>
          <p>Overall, Q4 income, I think, in the Wholesale Bank was up 9% on the third quarter and 14% up on the previous fourth quarter, and our outlook clearly was we are well ahead of the comparable first two months of the year, looking at our January, February picture for the Wholesale.</p>
          <p>And on wealth management, wealth management, I think I said in my script that we have a 12% income growth in wealth management. It was actually 6% down in the second half, so it did show some slowness, some surprising, given the volatility and pressures particularly in equity markets.</p>
          <p>Wealth management is just under 20% of the Consumer Banking income. We have seen it pick up, so it's currently running in the first two months of the year at a better rate than it was in Q4. Again, probably of no surprise, it's been a slightly, I'll call it easier equity market with a sense of confidence, and that's feeding through, seriously, you can see the pickup.</p>
          <p>On Hong Kong, I mean, is that, specifically, when you look at the Hong Kong performance, frankly, and it's a very strong performance all round. The rates of growth we're seeing, if I take Wholesale, we're seeing 33% growth in cash management income, 23% growth in trade and financial markets, it was up 24%, within that corporate finance, actually doubled. It's been a very good corporate finance performance in Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>We've seen a very good finish at the end of the year. We are still seeing second half momentum in loan growth in Hong Kong of about 7%, second half on first half. So, if you analyze that, you get a sense for the underlying beat. So it's broad, it's diversified, and it's been a very good performance.</p>

          <p>Should we go here? And then Michael Helsby.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, also a few quick questions. First...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can you give your name and institution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Chris Wheeler from Mediobanca. Apologies. First one on Korea, obviously, the takeup, the $207 million versus the $50 million, was quite surprising, I guess. Can you just talk about what that means in terms of numbers of people here? And perhaps also talk about &#x2013; does that mean those people are now gone or do you now have to replace a number of those people or how you're dealing with that. And perhaps around that whole subject, yeah, what's your thoughts are on what the impact might be on revenue or your view that having lost some revenues during the strike this will just sort of &#x2013; we can look at it that any revenue <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:07:25) effects will it be taken, if you want, in 2011? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second one just on India, relative question. Obviously, we've seen an upward trend during the second half, I wonder where you think we should be looking for the rest of the year? I think in your trip down to Singapore, we talked about the elections next year as being an important factor, but the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:07:45) elections this year may giving some indication where confidence may return, just a little bit more thought there.</p>
          <p>*And then finally on the subsidiarization, is this all about you demonstrating to the Singaporean authorities that you're going to safeguard their Consumer customers from any other problems around the Group or is it something else that we might think about in terms of your relationship with Singapore? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me take the last one first. I wouldn't get too excited about this. It's &#x2013; I think it's relatively straightforward what we're doing. It will take a bit of time to implement because it's a very large business. And it has, as I said, minimal impact on the Group. It is in line with the direction of thinking the MAS has about the domestic banking sector. But we also see it as advantageous in enabling us to be regarded more as a local institution for the purpose of SME and retail banking.</p>
          <p>On Korea, it's 848...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>848, yes.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>848.</p>

          <p>13%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...people took up the early retirement program and they have now left the Bank. And the amount of those jobs will be replaced is very, very small indeed. So, you're going to effectively assume that to all intents and purposes that is a reduction from the Bank, and it won't have any material revenue impact and will have a very significant cost impact. As we've said, it works out to about $95 million a year. The $50 million we mentioned in terms of loss momentum was more because the pace of taking on new business during the period of strike was slow.</p>
          <p>As you can imagine, we were running the network with a slimmed down staff. And it will take a bit of time to build back that momentum, but it was, as you say, it exceeded our expectations. We were delighted, frankly, with the result today because it's making a really quite a significant step change in the cost base and productivity of Korea. But I would also say we still got lots to do to really get to where we want to get to in terms of Korea's performance.</p>
          <p>One other aspect of Korea's performance, which I didn't mentioned, but it's worth touching on is that the &#x2013; we're still seeing double-digit growth in the income through Korean clients elsewhere in the network. So, we're continuing to get good traction working with the chaebol &#x2013; the major Korean companies elsewhere.</p>
          <p>On India...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2012 prospects. We use the language of cautious optimism, which is a wonderfully hackneyed phrase, but comes in useful sometimes. I think the first quarter is going to continue to be somewhat slow, and until you have the UP elections, I think we'll still be in a bit of a sort of political hiatus. But I have an increasing sense of sort of optimism about getting through. Clearly, we're getting through the interest rate cycle. I think we are going to see more traction on some of the sort of political and governance issues. And I think that will be positive for the momentum of our business. We are certainly not anticipating the business going backwards in 2012. We are anticipating it going forwards, growing, and it's just a question of how much it grows.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, it's Michael Helsby from Merrill Lynch. I've got three questions as well. Firstly, on costs, clearly, very strong performance to keep your underlying jaws at 4%. You've highlighted a $300 million cost swing in Korea from day one. I was just wondering, taking that into account and the very strong <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:12:36) income, should we be thinking about positive jaws again for 2012, or should we think that you'd reinvest that $300 million in the rest of the franchise? That's number one.</p>
          <p>Question two is on Singapore, clearly, an outsized performance. I think the big driver was you kept costs flat in Wholesale on the back of very strong revenues and you referenced big efficiency savings. I'm very aware that you have to spent a hell of a lot in 2010. Are there more efficiency savings to draw out in Singapore, or is it back to the flat cost type, sorry, flat jaws type outlook?</p>
          <p>And then just finally a bigger picture question, I'm fascinated by your comments about being a bridge to maybe the West in terms of driving revenues. I've always seen you more as a sort of local to local, and an intra-Asia, Africa, Middle East type franchise. How much of your revenues are coming from that sort of wider, Western footprint, and what are you doing to invest in that, and really help drive that share of business going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the &#x2013; you're right to highlight the $300 million delta in costs related to Korea, which is just the non-repetition of the $200 million for the ERP, and the $95 million savings from the ERP. In terms of the impact on the Group's jaws outlook, I think we would continue to stay at this stage, we're very early in the year that you should expect from us flat jaws. But the balance between whether we deliver as we did actually an underlying picture, which is positive jaws, versus investment will depend very much on sort of how we see the world economy and the environments in our markets unfold.</p>
          <p>I don't know if you &#x2013; do you want to pick up on the Singapore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Singapore costs, I think it was a very good performance, some efficiencies, and it was particularly also the delta between 2010 and 2011 in rate of investment. We also actually saw some ability to provide costs out to other parts of the areas for resources located in Singapore, so a buildup of teams. So, SCCG, Strategic Client Coverage Group, more sort of attribution of their cost into deals done outside Singapore. Going forward this year, I would anticipate a much closer relationship again between costs and income actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on your question about Europe and the Americas and the role we play as a bridge, Richard Holmes here is the CEO for Europe and so he would be very pleased to hear you asked this question because I think he like his counterpart in the Americas thinks that their contribution to what we do probably doesn't get enough attention, and I think it's right.</p>
          <p>Europe and the Americas generate $1.8 billion of income. We usually assume that the lion's share of that is actually what we're talking about. It's about doing things for big Western companies typically in our network or it's about doing things for big Asian companies that want to do stuff in the West.</p>
          <p>And we have benefited from both phases of the crisis. In the earlier phase of the crisis, we won a lot of market share from particularly North American clients who were somewhat disenchanted with some of the banks they have been working with. In this more recent phase of the crisis, the opportunity is more in Europe. And you've got to remember that China's largest trading partners in the world remain Europe first and the U.S. second.</p>
          <p>What are we doing to exploit this opportunity? A whole range of different things, but I would highlight two countries where we have deliberately put extra focus. One is Germany where we have very selectively and I'm not getting carried away, but we are selectively increasing our resource commitment to Germany, as Europe's biggest trading partner with Asia and we do see an opportunity to do more with German clients.</p>
          <p>The other one and where we've been investing to grow is Brazil given the very rapid growth, and particularly commodity-driven flows between Brazil and Asia. But I'd reinforce the point that we don't &#x2013; we stick very, very tightly to our strategy, so we do not end up doing domestic business anywhere in the Americas or Europe. We are very much focused on this role of being a bridge.</p>
          <p>More questions? Should we go &#x2013; just beyond you, given that the mic is just there? I can't actually see who it is. I'm not tall enough. Oh, hi.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Rohith Chandra-Rajan at Bar Cap. Three seems to be the order of the day, so if I could have the same, please. Firstly, just on volumes, the U.S. dollar loan volumes look to be flat half on half. The sort of quick calculation in constant currency is perhaps up 5% with most geographies pretty much in line with the momentum seen in the first half of the year, the only exception looking to be Korea, where there seems to be about a 5% outflow in the mortgage book. So the first question, I'm wondering if you comment on that at all?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just in terms of revenue outlook for 2012 in two of your biggest geographies, Hong Kong and Singapore, you highlight a forecast &#x2013; a marked slowdown in economic growth, I'm just wondering about the impact there on revenue performance for those two geographies.</p>
          <p>And then, finally, just on the regulatory headwinds that you've outlined, I just wondered if you could quantify your expected impact on income and costs? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to take the first one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Actually you've done my &#x2013; done the analysis for me actually. So if you take the half two and half one loan growth, it looks flat. It's actually running at 5% up on a constant currency basis. Within that, the four main markets sort of impacted are Singapore, 16% drag, Korea, 7% drag, Africa as a whole, 6%, and Singapore, 4%, but the net for the group is a constant currency beat of 5% underlying loan growth.</p>
          <p>On Korea, again it's 5% fall in assets, you're quite right, against what headline looks like, 12% fall, which is hence the 7%. If you exclude Korea, then the underlying beat to the loans is about 6.25%, 6.3%, so if you annualize that you're getting the type of underlying loan growth &#x2013; the dollar growth that we're seeing. The non-dollar &#x2013; interest fee partly goes to your Hong Kong point, where to pick up, just the underlying loan growth we have in Hong Kong in the second half is 7%, which is 7% headline, 7% constant currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your point about our outlook in Hong Kong and Singapore, you're right that the sort of expectation for economic growth in both markets is somewhat slower. And we're not going to be totally immune to that. However, there are opportunities in both markets to win market share and we've had a good start in both markets. So, whilst I'm not at all complacent, the first couple of months in both Singapore and Hong Kong are good and we have very broad-based momentum in both places</p>
          <p>In terms of the regulatory headwinds, this is a difficult one because the regulations keep changing and so the sort of math keeps getting more complicated. The things that might be sort of worth highlighting, I think would be &#x2013; and it's very, very difficult to put a number to them. Of course, the liquidity rules are coming evermore in place and that has a degree of income drag as we have more and more liquidity buffers. We will have a little bit more impact on the bank levy because of the rate as it was announced, I think, in November, being increased, but it's irritating but not huge, the increment.</p>
          <p>The more complicated thing to get a handle on is when you look at the sort of blizzard of all the other stuff around PLAC, resolution and recovery and all that sort of stuff. There's potentially quite significant costs being built up in those, but there's a lot of uncertainty as to how this is all going to get implemented.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one thing we would &#x2013; so if you try to simplify it, I think, we would say, you can see well north of $500 million of costs annually from UK super equivalents, excluding the impact of PLAC, were that ever to apply to Standard Chartered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's not an incremental 2012 on 2011, but that's a sort of what &#x2013; crudely speaking, you can easily see the cost of being in the UK as being of that sort of order of magnitude.</p>
          <p>I'm sort of tempted to stay roughly where I am and then come forward because it's just easier in terms of moving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. It's Tom Rayner from Exane BNP Paribas. I just wanted to stay on this sort of issue, partly, the regulatory drag. So, I think it's fairly clear where you see your P&amp;L going, your revenue trends and everything. But, clearly, the returns at the moment are depressed. And I would suggest maybe the biggest item is the surplus capital that you appear to be carrying, and the RWA growth I think was 10% last year.</p>
          <p>I'm just trying to get a sense of how important is this repricing story. It sounds as if you're going to try and reprice to improve the margins to some extent, but you can't be sure the regulatory issues go away or that the low interest rate environment goes away. So, I'm trying to get an understanding of how you think you will move from the current levels of return towards your sort of desired mid-teens over the next, say, two years or three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and, actually, on reflection I'd probably make it three things that drive the delta between where we are and where we would like to be. The two I mentioned were when does the full cost of regulation get reflected through in the pricing to customers, and the second one being the cyclical one about a low interest rate environment and its impact on deposit rich institution. The third one, which I didn't mention, is actually this year, the balance in 2011 the balance of non-interest income versus interest income skewed away from non-interest income. And clearly, non-interest income is very advantageous when you're thinking in terms of ROE.</p>
          <p>And that's probably, of the three, the one that is most in our control because while we can certainly do some repricing, and we have been doing some repricing, to some extent it's a market phenomenon. And I think realistically it will take some time for markets participants to adjust to the realities of the new regulatory frameworks. And it's not just the cost of capital that &#x2013; or holding incremental capital. That's relatively easy to do the math on. I think where it'll take a bit more time is when &#x2013; is for people to really factor in the costs of the new liquidity regulations and what they mean for longer-tenure assets.</p>
          <p>In terms of the interest rate cycle, well, Gerard, our Chief Economist is in the front, and you probably have better answer than me. We're not counting on that in terms of dollars moving terribly fast. I think we'll see local currency interest rates moving more rapidly than dollars and that will have some benefit, but we would get much more benefit when dollars begin to move. So, it's quite &#x2013; it's easy to see what has to happen to get us our mid-teens, it's quite difficult to predict exactly when that happens, because not all, in fact, most of the variables aren't entirely under our control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on RWA growth, I think last time you indicated 13%, 14% per annum was a reasonable expectation...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I still think we'll be looking at double-digit, 12%, 13%. The 13% to 14% RWA growth is the math we do when we say what returns can be generated at a particular rate of growth. So you can grow at 13% to 14% risk-weighted asset growth, produce, admittedly at the low end of mid teens, so 14% return, and you can do that at capital levels, core Tier 1 capital levels in the high 10s, <mark type="ph" /> we're pretty steady (1:26:33) at least 100 basis points ahead of that at the moment. So, that's where that comes from, but I think it would be right to think of low-double digit risk-weighted asset growth going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm trying to be a bit cheeky, just I've got the mic, so I wanted to ask a supplementary, so &#x2013; everyone has had three, so I'm going to have two. Just, I mean, the Wholesale Bank, I mean, the performance clearly has been good, but it's, I think, 70% of the profits. &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; 70% of group profits. And I think on my quick and dirty math, I mean, it's still making a better return than your Consumer Bank and I just wonder if we look forward what you think the more normal sort of mix of ROE between those two divisions might be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think the &#x2013; we don't believe there is a sort of perfect &#x2013; it would be great if the world was 50-50 because we don't think it works like that, as long as we are growing and creating shareholder value through both our businesses. And I think it's also important to emphasize how much we run Standard Chartered as one bank, so we're very deliberately thinking about the shape of the balance sheets and the way one business helps another, and not just on the balance sheets, it's about customer referrals, it's about products, sharing of infrastructure, and so on.</p>
          <p>The other point I would make about Consumer Bank is that it's deliberately as a matter of strategy and execution bearing two very significant costs in its P&amp;L in 2011. One is obviously Korea, where we wanted to take a big hit on the ERP to improve productivity. But the other that's a very significant drag on Consumer Banking but is &#x2013; we have no doubt is the right thing to be doing, is that we are losing about $100 million in Mainland China from continuing to invest in rapid expansion. And so, I think if you actually look at the returns on some of our mature businesses, but still growing businesses, in Consumer Banking, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, these are very, very attractive, very attractive businesses. But you've got to get to a reasonable scale.</p>

          <p>If I think about your margins running into 2012, you're highlighting asset margin improvements, against that you have liability margin &#x2013; sorry, I said it the opposite way &#x2013; asset margin compression and liability margin improvement. If I think about 2012, you have monetary policy loosening, that should be a headwind, how should I think about those moving parts running into 2012 and if you could elaborate by geographies as well?</p>
          <p>And, second, on China, your larger UK peer has indicated aspirations to grow inorganically there. Would you have similar aspirations?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The overall answer, the overall group answer on margins, you've heard me say it a number of times before, is that you should expect an outlook that is broadly stable from a group perspective.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With lots of moving parts. I mean, if you look to what happened in 2011, you've got a 30 basis point compression on mortgages, you've got over 100 basis points compression on credit cards. However, personal loans were getting better margins by sort of 29 basis points. Liability margins both sides, both Consumer Bank and Wholesale, were moving up. So, 72 basis points to 79 basis points for the Consumer Banks, so 10% up. And the Wholesale Bank was 79 basis points to 90 basis points in terms of overall cash management. So, again, very good picture.</p>
          <p>Trade, I indicated in my script I think that whilst it was compressed down by 13 basis points or so, 13, 14 basis points, it was actually stable in the second half on the first half, perhaps slightly up, which gives you a clue I think for next year.</p>
          <p>I think the overall dynamic within the business, whether it's by geography or different product sets moving, will in the end turn out, as I said, a broadly stable upturn. So, I will be plotting that. And secondly, I think given time, if you want to go into particular geographies <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:31:30) will do that with pleasure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Manus Costello from Autonomous. I'll have two succinct questions, please. Could you give us a bit of color on the pickup in other Consumer impairment in the second half and how we should think about that going into 2012 as that loan book seasons?</p>
          <p>And, secondly, you talked about the Wholesale Bank under one year lending being 64%, that's actually come down a bit since the half year and the full year. Are you taking share of some longer-tenured business and is this something we should expect to continue in Wholesale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you can have both of those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. Normally, on the Consumer &#x2013; you saw 17% growth in unsecured balances in the Consumer book. As of a proportion of overall Consumer assets, it's still 17% only of the assets are unsecured. And when you look at that, it's important, again, in particular markets, Africa, UAE, a number of others, we only do unsecured business plus the loan business with payroll. In other words, it's risk mitigated even though it's not secured.</p>
          <p>When you look at the loan impairment expectations for this year, starting very quickly on SME not in unsecured, it's the book is 89% secured SME. So, again, it's got good growth. I don't anticipate a particular pick up in that, a material pickup.</p>
          <p>If I then go back to the personal loan and credit cards picture, Consumer Bank overall, increased loan impairment by $100 million. The two elements which we alluded to of higher PIC charge second half versus a release in the first half and the lower loan portfolio sales contribution that's just under $50 million.</p>
          <p>So, I think the rate of pickup you could anticipate which would actually align very well with the underlying growth in the asset portfolio and the mix shift, would be about $50 million to $60 million in a half year period. That's what I would flag as a number.</p>
          <p>And then your second question, I didn't write down and I've now lost now <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:34:03)</p>

That set back, 64% are under one year, predominantly under six months as trade. I've got some appetite yet for that 64% to edge down year on year and it's &#x2013; I don't know what it would have been four years ago, five years ago, I can't remember what the portion was. I would guess still it was in the 60s at that point, so it's edging down.</p>

          <p>Robert Law of Nomura. I've just got one if that's all right and I promise to be as succinct. I'll just ask &#x2013; going back to the headwinds issue, or sorry, the operating leverage jaws issue that you highlighted. And going into this year, you've had I think something like about a $200 million sort of headwind, but you've made flat jaws. It looks like you're going to have at least a $200 million tailwind this time going into 2012. And on the revenue side, you've highlighted how the non-interest income has been weaker. So I guess I'm looking for what's going to get tougher this year for you to only have flat jaws, or, so where are you going to be seeing negative leverage this time around? Or are you just giving yourself a lower hurdle to jump through in 2012?</p>

          <p>Let me start. India and Korea, we do expect them to resume growth in 2012. On your broader question, I mean, I can't argue with your math, but don't underestimate the flow-through drag of things like the LTR coming in as a negative on income and don't underestimate the cumulative impact of a profusion of things relating to all sorts of different aspects of regulation on costs.</p>
          <p>A disconcertingly large portion of our forward-looking investment budget is doing things which are basically to meet various new regulatory demands of one sort or another. And there will be costs associated with things like the subsidiarization &#x2013; just the task of subsidiarizing Singapore.</p>
          <p>But you're &#x2013; I mean, we are deliberately taking a fairly conservative stance. We've started the year well. We're pacing investment very carefully. We think there's considerable uncertainty in the world, although our markets are clearly in better shape than most other parts of the world. I don't know whether you wanted to...</p>

          <p>I mean, if I could, I think that just on the three items alone that Peter talked about, you could expect higher liquidity costs in 2012 over 2011 from the liquid asset buffer, eligible assets definitions to drag us by over $100 million incrementally.</p>
          <p>You would have about a $20 million to $30 million estimated cost of the subsidiarization program in Singapore, and the levy would be a round number increase of, say, $40 million. The actual move up in the rates charged by the Chancellor is already a 13% year-on-year delta before the balance sheet grows. So you get to those and you start to see some of the...</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. It's Jason Napier from Deutsche. Two, I promise, quick ones. In the third quarter, it's my recollection that you mentioned FICC revenues were up 18% sequentially. And now fourth quarter revenues are up 9% in total in WB sequentially. I'm just wondering whether there's some seasonality or mix difference in either the second or the third quarters that aren't obvious at first blush. And then, second one was just on tax rate given the sort of foreign branch exemption you've taken, deferred tax changes and the like. What are you sort of thinking the budget was for 2012 on tax?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can I apologize, because I really can't top of my head think of a particular dynamic in Q2, Q3 FICC revenues that informs me to your Q4. So, I apologize on that.</p>
          <p>On tax, I think we would estimate 27% to 28%, probably towards 27%, but 27% to 28% would be a good rate at this stage to put into a model. Clearly, it's highly dependent on profit mix.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. I'm going to be very brief. What are the messages that we want to deliver today to shareholders? Standard Chartered should be viewed by shareholders as a growth story. And this is the ninth consecutive year of record profits, record growth. And I think it's just another chapter in that story.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we're very pleased with the results today. It's a very broadly based, diverse performance both in Consumer Bank and Wholesale Bank and many of our markets have performed very well. But the important message is, well thank you very much for what you achieved last year, but shareholders want us to not get complacent, but certainly have confidence in the future. And we've talked about the start we've made to the year. There is good momentum in the business. Peter again in the Q&amp;A alluded to some of the challenges that we face, but, nonetheless, we have a strong management team. We have a clear strategy, almost a boring strategy, because it doesn't change very much. But my goodness me, it's very effective.</p>
          <p>So, those, I think, Peter, are the key messages I would deliver to shareholders. And just to say thank you to everybody for coming to today's presentation.</p>
