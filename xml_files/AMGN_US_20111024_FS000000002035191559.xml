        <plist>
          <p>My name is Marvin and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers' prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we'd like to request you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to discuss our financial and operating results for the third quarter. With more than three quarters of the year behind us our business continues to perform well and has good momentum as we head into the latter part of the year. We have also taken several actions so we can deliver meaningful returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>To discuss our results and these initiatives, I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Kevin Sharer, who will provide a strategic overview of our performance; followed by our CFO, Jon Peacock, who will provide additional details on our financial performance during the quarter. Our President, Bob Bradway, who was also recently elected to our Board, will provide some additional color on how our products performed during the quarter; followed by our Head of R&amp;D, Roger Perlmutter, who will provide an R&amp;D update.</p>
          <p>We'll use a handful of slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor Statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation today we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results could vary materially. We will use non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance and the GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Arvind, and good afternoon, everyone. I suspect you've read the press release and have our materials so I'd like to make some comments on the performance of the company, and where we are. As you can see from our results, our business continues to perform well with revenues and EPS both up 3%. Jon and Bob will review our financial and commercial performance in a moment. But I feel like we're well on track.</p>
          <p>We announced today that our Board has authorized $10 billion in share repurchases. The intent of this is to accelerate meaningfully our stock repurchase program and this reflects our confidence in our future outlook and long-term value, as well as the capital markets interest rate very favorable conditions.</p>
          <p>In the quarter we also announced two important executive personnel decisions. I'm delighted that Bob has been elected to our Board of Directors, and we're also pleased that Tony Hooper has joined us from Bristol as Executive Vice President, Commercial, reporting to Bob. Bob's experience and insights will add real value to our Board and Tony's many years of U.S. and international commercial experience will help drive our growth. We also announced an agreement in principle with the U.S. government to settle allegations relating to certain sales and marketing practices, which have been the subject of previous disclosures. We recognized a $780 million reserve in anticipating us finalizing this settlement, which should happen the next three to four months.</p>
          <p>As we approach the end of the year, I'm encouraged by the momentum and outlook for the business leading us to raise our guidance on revenues and earnings per share for 2011. Amgen is in a good place. We look forward to finishing a strong year, and I want to thank all of Amgen's staff for their exceptional efforts this year on behalf of shareholders and patients.</p>
          <p>Jon, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kevin. I'll start with a few comments on our performance in the quarter and then address balance sheet issues and our updated guidance for the year. Overall, revenues grew 3% in the quarter. Excluding ESAs, product sales reached 13% reflecting strong growth across the portfolio particularly on newer franchises. Bob will comment more on our product sales in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses grew by 11%, compared to the third quarter of 2010. More than half of the increase was driven by the Puerto Rico excise tax, for which we benefit from and offsetting foreign tax credit further down, foreign exchange movements on our international costs and the U.S. Healthcare Reform Fee. The balance of the increase in operating expenses was explained by research and development and SG&amp;A. Research and development increased 11% year-over-year driven by our late-stage clinical program costs, but quarter-on-quarter R&amp;D costs declined by $45 million. SG&amp;A increases were driven by investments in the expansion of our international operations and in the launch of XGEVA.</p>
          <p>You'll see adjusted earnings per share are increased by 3%, compared to 2010. There are two drivers of this increase relative to operating income. The first is the tax rate of 10.9%, which benefited from the foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the Puerto Rico foreign tax credits, the rate would have been 17.4%. And to a lesser degree the lower rates in the quarter also benefited from the federal R&amp;D credit, which was not yet extended in the third quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>The second factor impacting earnings per share is the average number of diluted shares, which were 913 million for the quarter, 5% lower than the third quarter of 2010. I'll talk more about our share repurchase activity on the next page.</p>
          <p>To reiterate, and as Kevin highlighted earlier, we've reached an agreement in principle to settle allegations related to certain sales and marketing practices that have been the subject of previous disclosures. In connection with this agreement in principle, again as Kevin mentioned, we've recognize a $780 million reserve, which reduces our GAAP EPS in the quarter by $0.77. And we anticipate finalizing the settlement over the next three to four months.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next page, first of all, cash flow from operations, you may have noticed that those are $300 million lower in the quarter, compared to the same period last year. There are two reasons for this. The first was the full-year payment in the quarter of the U.S. Healthcare Reform Fee. And the second was an advance payment of $145 million that we chose to make on future Sensipar royalties in exchange for an attractive discount from the licensor.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, you'll also see on the page that we repurchased 45 million shares, at an average price of $53.30 per share. This brought the cost of our total share repurchases in 2011 to $3.2 billion, at an average price of $54.10.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, Amgen's Board of Directors, again, as Kevin mentioned earlier, has authorized an increase to the company's stock repurchase program to a total amount of $10 billion. We intend to use this to accelerate our share repurchase program, reflecting our confidence in the outlook and the long-term value of the company and the attractive interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>The capital plan we communicated in April left us with a significant and increasing net cash position. We now believe we can maintain the flexibility that we need to grow our business, consistent with the plans we outlined in April, while also improving the returns to our shareholders by accelerating our stock repurchase plans. This means that we plan to return more than 60% of our net income to shareholders on average over the next few years. Within this, we maintain our plan to increase the dividend meaningfully over time. And we'll also maintain a solid investment-grade rating.</p>
          <p>Finally, turning to the next page, we've increased our guidance on revenues and adjusted EPS to $15.4 billion to $15.6 billion on revenues, and to $5.15 to $5.30 a share on adjusted EPS. Related to this, we've also lowered our guidance on the full year tax rate to 14% to 15% linked to the Puerto Rico tax credits.</p>
          <p>Let me turn over to Bob to address the commercial side of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you, Jon. On Slide 9, I'll walk you through a summary of our global commercial performance for the third quarter. As noted in our press release, our global product sales grew by 3% versus the third quarter of 2010. Excluding ESAs, sales grew 13% during the quarter reflecting strength across the remainder of our portfolio and particularly in our newer franchises.</p>
          <p>I'll review the products starting with Neulasta and NEUPOGEN. Globally, Neulasta and NEUPOGEN grew 6% during the quarter. In the U.S., these products were up 8% fueled by both price and unit demand for Neulasta in particular. Unit demand continues to benefit from increased first-cycle penetration. Internationally, we maintained record shares in this segment and reported a 3% increase in sales with the benefit of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Enbrel sales were up 1% versus the third quarter of last year. The Rheumatology segment grew in the mid-teens, and we maintained our leading share at a relatively stable 31%. The dermatology market grew 20% year-over-year. Although we lost six share points to competition on a year-over-year basis, Enbrel maintained a leading 40% share in dermatology as well. Year-to-date, Enbrel is up 6%. Our On-Course with Phil campaign, featuring Phil Mickelson, has received positive early feedback for building awareness of treatment options for patients with psoriatic arthritis.</p>
          <p>Turning to EPOGEN, EPOGEN sales declined by 27% versus the same quarter last year. The decline was driven primarily by the implementation of bundling and the product label changes and proposed CMS actions, which were announced at the end of the second quarter. Just as we saw with bundling, we have seen a rapid implementation of protocol changes by dialysis providers in response to recent ESA label changes and proposed CMS actions.</p>
          <p>You may recall from our second quarter call that we expected these changes to play out relatively quickly and result in a full year dose decline in the range of 20% to 25%. That remains our view. We believe that the majority of the dose decline will play out this year with only a minor residual impact through the first quarter of 2012. The ESA label changes also impacted Aranesp sales, which declined 4% during the third quarter. Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate, on the other hand, grew 19% versus the third quarter of 2010, contributing to the strength of our portfolio outside of ESAs.</p>
          <p>Turning to our global launches for denosumab, we are pleased with the momentum that we see for XGEVA. The product grew 40% versus the second quarter of 2011 and surpassed $100 million in sales in just our third full quarter since launch. This growth continues to be driven by share gains and overall SRE segment growth. XGEVA ended the quarter with a unit share of approximately 23% as we continue to take share from IV bisphosphonates. The SRE segment grew 7% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.</p>
          <p>In terms of use in urology clinics, there are now twice as many urology practices using a bone-targeting agent now, as compared to the period prior to the launch of XGEVA. On the international front, we launched XGEVA in Germany during the third quarter and the product is off to a strong start.</p>
          <p>Prolia grew 16% versus the second quarter, reflecting growth in our international markets. In the U.S., Prolia sales were soft in July and August, reflecting seasonal trends in the osteoporosis market overall and particularly for new patient starts. I would note we saw a strong rebound in our sales growth trends in September, and so far through October.</p>
          <p>You may recall from our prior comments that we expect broad coverage under Part D to serve as an important catalyst for Prolia. Let me give you an update on that front. Securing access was the first step in the process of advancing the retail segment of the Prolia business, and we achieved that by the end of last quarter. As most primary care physicians prefer Part D we're now focusing our efforts on enabling them to simply write a prescription for Prolia. As part of this, our representatives are working with providers to help navigate through the issues that come up under Part D such as the prior authorization process to ensure successful payment of claims. We're making progress here and have seen a significant increase in submitted retail claims in recent weeks.</p>
          <p>Internationally, Prolia grew 43% versus the second quarter of this year. And at the beginning of the fourth quarter we have now launched in Italy and Spain expanding our coverage to 75% of the E.U. sales opportunity for Prolia.</p>
          <p>More generally in our international business, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales grew by 5% or again 12% excluding ESAs. We continue to maintain share against biosimilar competition for Aranesp and Filgrastim and have maintained our price premium for both. Internationally Vectibix, Nplate and Mimpara grew by 23% in the aggregate. We're pleased with our continued progress in new and emerging markets where we saw year-over-year sales growth of 43%.</p>
          <p>For the U.S. I'd note that all of our products ended the quarter with wholesaler inventories in their normal ranges except for EPOGEN, which was one day above our normal range. In sum, we're pleased with the broad strength of our business, particularly our newer products, and we believe we're well-positioned for growth heading into 2012.</p>
          <p>Roger?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. This afternoon I will review some of our clinical programs and I will speak briefly about the R&amp;D restructuring that we announced last week.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 11, in the third quarter we continued to make significant progress in advancing our late stage programs. Early in the quarter the European Commission granted a marketing authorization for XGEVA as a means of preventing bone complications in patients with solid tumors that have metastasized to the skeleton. As Bob indicated, the launch of XGEVA in Europe is just beginning, but is proceeding well.</p>
          <p>I should note we are working closely with the FDA on the review of XGEVA in the setting of castrate resistant prostate cancer as a means of delaying bone metastasis. The PDUFA date for this review is April 26, 2012.</p>
          <p>Also with regards to denosumab during the third quarter, the FDA expanded the indication for Prolia to include treatment of patients at high risk for fracture who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer or adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer.</p>
          <p>We continue to make great strides in enrolling our key Phase III programs. First with respect to talimogene laherparepvec, our oncolytic virus therapy, we have completed enrollment of our Phase III study in patients with advanced malignant melanoma. The therapy, previously refer to as OncoVEX GM-CFS will henceforth &#x2013; for obvious reasons &#x2013; be denoted as TVEC. As you will recall, TVEC is administered by injection into visible tumor masses and acts both by directly lysing the tumor, as well as stimulating a systemic immune response to malignant cells. The primary end point for this study remains the durable complete response though enrollment was increased to provide more power for observing an overall survival signal.</p>
          <p>We've also made extremely good progress in enrolling Phase III studies for AMG 479 in pancreatic cancer and AMG 386 in ovarian cancer. Regarding the latter, some of you will be aware that shortages in the chemotherapy agent Doxsil from Johnson &amp; Johnson may delay enrollment in our TRINOVA-2 Phase III study, exploring the use of AMG 386 as second line therapy in ovarian cancer patients. Such a delay, should it occur, would not have any effect on our ability to gain registration for AMG 386 using our larger TRINOVA-1 Phase III study, which employs AMG 386 in combination with a different chemotherapeutic regimen. We've had detailed discussions with regulatory agents on our Phase III study designs for AMG 785, our sclerostin antagonist for patients with low bone mass at high risk for fracture and for AMG 827, our IL-17 receptor antagonist for the treatment of psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases.</p>
          <p>We expect both of these programs to begin enrolling patients in the near future. With respect to AMG 827 I should note that following a review of interim data we elected to discontinue our Phase II study in Crohn's disease since we believed it unlikely that this treatment would benefit such patients. Others have reported that IL-17 antagonism is associated with worse outcomes in the Crohn's disease population.</p>
          <p>Finally, we continue to make adjustments to our portfolio. As previously announced, we have discontinued development of conatumumab, AMG 655, for the treatment of malignant disease. However, new Phase II for rilotumumab, AMG 102, our antibody directed against a hepatocyte growth factor, which we presented at the ECCO-ESMO meeting in September, suggests that this molecule may have activity in gastric cancer. In particular, we found that rilotumumab administered once every three weeks in combination with traditional chemotherapy appeared to improve response rates, progression free survival and overall survival in the first-line treatment of patients with gastric cancer. Additional studies indicate that rilotumumab may be especially effective in patients whose tumors express high levels of c-Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor. We are reviewing these findings very carefully.</p>
          <p>The continued progression of our late stage pipeline in oncology, inflammation and in metabolic disease has catalyzed a review of our entire R&amp;D spending profile. While we are encouraged by the success of so many programs, the Phase III costs that accompany these programs are quite substantial.</p>
          <p>I have previously discussed with you our commitment to ensure that we continue to live within our means. With this in mind, last week we announced a reduction in R&amp;D head count. This was necessary to refocus our R&amp;D programs on those efforts likely to have a near term clinical impact. The burden of restructuring fell most heavily on scientists in early discovery, but was designed to increase the efficiency of our key therapeutic areas. The effects of this sharpening of focus will be evident during 2012 when we also expect to see data from our Phase III cardiovascular outcome study of Sensipar in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism and of our Phase III study of TVEC in patients with advanced malignant melanoma.</p>
          <p>Kevin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Roger. We'd now like to open the floor to questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Marvin, would you go ahead and review the procedures for asking questions please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'll stick to one. Maybe for Roger, if I may, the anti-sclerostin antibody certainly looks like it's, at lease to me, potentially the most interesting thing in the pipeline. You said you're in discussions with FDA if I heard you correctly, Roger, around a possible registration program. Could you help us understand what that might look like, what some of the options are, and what the timeline for that might be? And maybe if Jon can remind us the economics on that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mark. Just with respect to 785, yes, we are discussing Phase III designs with regulatory agencies. Clearly, as an anabolic agent, this is a very different kind of a clinical program from what one sees in anti-resorptive agents. So, you're not going to want to give AMG 785 for a very, very protracted period. And hence, the end points of the study will have to be looked at somewhat earlier because you don't want to confuse the anabolic effect with anti-resorptive effects that might result from the use of traditional agents, which would inevitably have to be used thereafter. You can't leave patients with osteoporosis untreated in this setting.</p>
          <p>So the studies will have a quite different design in that sense from the usual kind of anti-resorptive design. And we'll be prepared to share the study design with you in the very near future because, as I say, we'll be beginning those studies very, very soon, we expect.</p>
          <p>With respect to the financial impact, I think it's probably too early to really comment on that. But it will be much more obvious I think as time goes on in that program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see. Good afternoon. I was hoping that Roger could repeat the name of that new OncoVEX product. Just kidding.</p>
          <p>Bob in the press release it mentioned some accounting changes with regard to Aranesp and NEUPOGEN/Neulasta. Could you give us a little bit more detail on how the policy's changed and maybe when that actually went into effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll take that, Eric. This is simply an adjustment to the Medicaid rebate accruals that we've made for prior years, and with the benefit of actual experience we were able to make some adjustments to those reserves and release some of them during the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's a one-time impact, Jon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a one-time impact, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you quantify what that was in the quarter for both products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was not a material amount overall in the quarter. In terms of growth rate it contributed less than a percentage point.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a commercial question: with the newest ESA labels are your folks in the field seeing any measurable increases in blood transfusions? I mean, one of the theoretical arguments here against removing hemoglobin targets has been that, that would be an issue. But now with a few months under your belt with this new label can you maybe comment are docs seeing that? What are folks seeing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. I understand the interest in the question. The feedback at this point is anecdotal so rather than try to quantify for you the picture until we have data let me just say that again it's anecdotal.</p>

          <p>Guys. Thank you for taking my question. It's regarding capital redistribution. Jon, to make sure I heard you correctly are you saying you're increasing the guidance you gave in April to now returning more than 60% of net income? And if so can you give us any indication of how much more? And also could you give us color on the proportion between share buybacks and repurchases? I presume the proportion of dividends is decreasing. And linked to that, finally, are you sticking to your medium term guidance for R&amp;D of 18% to 20% of sales? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the first point yes. We will, as I said, we will be over the next few years increasing the distribution to more than 60% of net income. Again, just to reiterate what I said. As we look to the capital plan that we announced in April we believe we can maintain the flexibility we need to grow the business in the way that we want to grow it. And we can improve the returns to shareholders by accelerating the distribution of capital through share repurchases. So, yeah, over the next few years we are intending to increase the distribution to greater than 60% of net income. The policy we announced in April with regard to dividends has not changed. We will, and we plan to increase the dividend meaningfully over the next few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me answer the question about guidance in April of this year with respect to R&amp;D. We said that we would hold R&amp;D in the 18% to 20% of sales range. In fact, that is exactly what we're doing this year. In fact, we increased R&amp;D spending by double-digits to fund all the programs we have. And I would imagine that next year we'll be close to the top end that 18% to 20% range. And we remain very committed to heavy investment in R&amp;D, and also, holding ourselves accountable for those results.</p>
          <p>With respect to the capital strategy shift that Jon just explained I want to tell you that it's rooted in confidence in the business, our cash flow and value of the company and in the context of very, very favorable capital markets interest rate environment. So, this is a, I think, a strong move by us. We retain our strategic flexibility to move the business forward. We just think it makes a world of sense.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Just curious to talk about seasonality in the quarter for Prolia. Wonder if there is any seasonality for XGEVA? And as you do make the switch to Part D should we expect any volatility in near term sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for the question, Ian. First on XGEVA as I said in my remarks we're really pleased with the progress and the momentum that we see there. So, XGEVA's off to a very strong start, and we're encouraged all around.</p>
          <p>Prolia was soft in July and August. As I said, that's consistent with the market for osteoporosis generally, also consistent with what we see with new medicines and particularly in a primary care setting. So, as we said earlier, in the year we expect the momentum of Prolia to continue to build. We're encouraged by the data that we've seen from September and here in early in October as well. So, the momentum continues to build, and also, continues to build in Part D. And so we're enthusiastic about the most recent data.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. I'm just trying to understand if there's anything that's changed since April when you talked about optimism regarding long-term prospects? And in particular, is this just a better capital market environment that's driving this and reiterating the same confidence from April? Is there anything you've seen with XGEVA prospects for label expansion or the OncoVEX trial that are making you increasingly bullish on your future outlook? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to point to any one thing. There isn't any one thing. I just see across a broad front, whether it's implementing our strategy, whether it's the individual products, whether it's our relations with government, it's across the board, and we think that this is the right time to make a very strong move on capital. And we also think that there's a possibility to have a more favorable capital allocation in terms of the balance sheet. It's just every single one of those factors. And Jon, you might want to make a comment, but I just think it's across the board</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Given that your next Phase III program to read out is TVEC, I'm not even going to try to say that one, the whole name there. But Roger, can you confirm that a single trial is going be sufficient for registration in metastatic melanoma?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I was wondering if you can comment on the rationale around the inclusion criteria, specifically the exclusion of patients with high LDH levels? I think if you look at some previous examples of trials, for example, with tremelimumab or ipilimumab, where high LDH was excluded or included, I think it can impact results. So, can you talk a little bit about the rationale around the patients selected for that trial?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Matt, first of all, this trial, as you know, is being conducted under a special protocol assessment with the FDA. We have Phase II data from a single arm study that provided very impressive complete response rates. The Phase III study is like the Phase II study in terms of its overall design. It parallels it essentially completely with the difference being of course, the size of the study, and as well, the GM-CSF subcutaneous arm in order to exclude the possibility that expression of GM-CSF is having that beneficial effect. I think it's understandable in that context why the agency would feel extremely comfortable with that kind of study. And again, one wants in the Phase III study to try and duplicate the kinds of things that one saw in Phase II, which were so promising. I think that with respect to the entry criteria, that's what makes the most sense.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Question for you on XGEVA and met prevention. So the FDA's focus on overall survival was evident at the recent ODAC panel. So, my question is what's the risk that that remains a focus for the Agency? And was there anything different that surprised you on the panel relative to your initial discussions with the agency when you started the '147 study? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jeff. It's Roger. No. Not really at all. It was kind of a different question that was being addressed by the ODAC panel. And a much more general question that the Agency had about how to look at therapies for patients with so-called castrate-resistant prostate cancer who had not yet sustained metastases. The benefit of providing XGEVA to such patients based on the '147 study, we believe, is quite clear. You've had a chance to see those data.</p>
          <p>And we will have the opportunity, of course, to discuss those data further with the FDA. They're in the midst of their review process. But we think that the benefits are significant with respect to delaying metastases, and we believe the Agency will view it that way as well. The survival issue I think is a separate one, and it will be addressed separately. We were not &#x2013; we did not design the study to look at survival. Indeed, patients who sustained metastases were immediately put on alternative therapies for skeletal-related events, and so there was no way really to assess the survival, and the Agency understood that in terms of the study design.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks. Actually, a question about Europe. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the last few months, business-wise, and what you think we should expect over the next six months? And maybe a little bit about what you're seeing in regards to possible austerity measures, price reductions, et cetera, maybe which countries are tougher than others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Michael. I can appreciate the reason for the question. A couple things. First, as you saw in our results, our business in Europe continues to grow. So, overall, we're pleased with the performance of the business internationally, and we continue to launch new products and benefit from those new product launches. So, we're growing internationally. We recognize there is significant macroeconomic pressure and some of that pressure may be reflected in price changes, and we're continuing to watch that pretty carefully.</p>
          <p>I would observe that, thus far, through the first nine months of the year, price impact has played out pretty much as we expected it would in Europe, so less than a handful of percentage points for us across the whole of our portfolio. But we're continuing to watch that, Michael, as I'm sure you and your colleagues are for other reasons.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Jon, I'll ask you a question about something I thought I'd never bring up on these calls, which is tax. Could you give us a sense of, one, whether the 10.9% should be viewed as recurring in future periods? And then related to that, could you update us on the percentage of your cash offshore and your assumptions about the future ability to repatriate that cash to the U.S.? Your read on whether that is a viable possibility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think first on the question of the tax rate in the quarter, there was some catch-up in the estimate of the foreign tax credits that were applicable to the Puerto Rico taxes this quarter. So, there's a catch-up effect in the quarter for the year-to-date foreign tax credit offsets on the Puerto Rico taxes. So, you shouldn't expect to see as low of a rate going forward. And I think we gave you guidance for the full year of 14% to 15%, so that's what you should look at for the year ahead. The reason it was so low this quarter was that we were able to refine our estimates on the foreign tax credits that we could use against the Puerto Rico taxes. So, hopefully, that answers your question on that. We'll give you guidance obviously for 2012 when we come to the end of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

While we believe that it would be a positive step for the United States to find a way within policy to bring this money home, we don't expect that to happen any time soon, and none of the assumptions that we've made that underlie our capital allocation plans assume that that would happen.

That might be the easiest way to convey it to you. Less than a handful of percentage points behind the growth in the U.S. is attributable to price increases. And as I just said a minute ago, looking across the whole of the portfolio, we've had less than 5 percentage points' decrement to pricing from Europe and the International business.

          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on trends you're seeing with Enbrel.

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Sure. Thanks for the question. Enbrel is up 1%, as you know, through the quarter. Year-to-date, we're up 6%, and we maintain market leadership in both rheumatology and dermatology.</p>
          <p>As regards to the results for the third quarter, the biggest drag on the results, if you will, was the loss of share points in the derm sector. So, as I said in my remarks, we lost about 6 percentage points of derm market share during the quarter, owing to the increased competitive intensity there. But we're encouraged by the franchise overall, pleased with our leading market shares in rheum and derm. Pleased with the impact that our psoriatic arthritis campaign is having for patients, and so we continue to feel very good about our leading position for Enbrel.</p>

I think that &#x2013; in the past, as you're aware, lowering of LDL cholesterol was believed to be adequate, but all surrogate markers for outcomes are now under review, and so with time, we'll find out whether or not that's useful. We are moving forward very, very actively with our PCSK9 antibody, AMG 145. We're very enthusiastic about the program. It's behaving extremely well, and we hope to be able to share Phase II data with you in not too long a time. And as we have those data available, we'll begin to embark on our Phase III program, which will certainly be informed by discussions with the FDA. Thanks.</p>
