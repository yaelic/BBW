        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. I'm Phil Johnson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. I'm joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial Officer, Derica Rice; and by Ronica Fletcher and Nick Lemon from the IR Department.</p>
          <p>You can access the earnings press release and supporting materials, a live webcast and Internet-based replay, and a podcast of this conference call at lilly.com. The replay, the supporting materials, and the podcast will be available on our website through November 21, 2008.</p>
          <p>During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations. But actual results may differ materially due to various factors. For example, our results, alone or following the completion of the ImClone acquisition, may be affected by competitive developments; the timing and success of new product launches; regulatory and legal matters; patent disputes; government investigations; governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and reimbursement; changes in tax law; acquisitions; business development transactions; the state of the financial markets; and the impact of exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Also, the ImClone acquisition is subject to a successful tender offer and antitrust clearance, and may be subject to ImClone Systems shareholder approval, none of which can be guaranteed. For additional information about relevant risk factors, please refer to both Lilly's and ImClone's Forms 10-K and 10-Q.</p>
          <p>In addition, the information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn the call over to John.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Phil. The third quarter was a very successful quarter for Lilly. Our underlying business performed very well, with sales as well as earnings per share excluding significant items both growing 14%. Sales growth was driven by a robust 6% increase in volume and the increase in volume was consistently strong across all major geographies. We also grew sales faster than both the cost of goods and ongoing operating expenses.</p>
          <p>Importantly, we made significant progress executing on our strategy, creating value for shareholders by accelerating the flow of innovative new medicines that provide improved outcomes for individual patients.</p>
          <p>Before providing my usual update on our pipeline, I would like to briefly highlight some of the key areas of activity that support this strategy. I believe this will provide insight into how past actions support our strategy and help you understand where we're headed in the future.</p>
          <p>Across Lilly, we are becoming more patient centered and customer focused. In research and development for example, we are using our AME [Applied Molecular Evolution] technology to design and tailor therapeutic antibodies. We are structuring Alimta trials to identify patients who can benefit most from this valuable cancer therapy. And as we did just last week, we are launching a new Forteo pen delivery system custom made for ease of use by elderly patients.</p>
          <p>In sales and marketing, we are providing our sales representatives with tools and resources aimed at meeting the unique needs of individual doctors. And we continue to lead the industry in providing external stakeholders with greater transparency about our business, having recently announced plans to disclose payments to physicians in the US.</p>
          <p>Second, we are moving more aggressively into biotech.  Biotech therapeutics are attractive for a variety of reasons. They often lend themselves to tailoring.  They carry a higher probability of technical success than small molecules and have tougher standards for generic substitution.</p>
          <p>We have a longstanding presence in biotech, which is relatively unique in major pharma. Currently, nearly a quarter of our sales come from biotech products, making us the fifth largest biotech company in the world. Biotech products also comprise nearly one-third of our clinical stage pipeline today. We aim to increase that proportion over time, entirely consistent, by the way, with our acquisition of ImClone.</p>
          <p>Third, throughout the company we are becoming faster, leaner, and more efficient. We are systematically using Six Sigma to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, delayering management, and methodically reducing head count and the fixed portion of our expenses, and by working with business partners in new and creative ways.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we are expanding our global scope and reach. We aim to capitalize on opportunities to expand our presence in the world's fastest-growing markets.  And increasingly, we will access capabilities, ideas, and capital from beyond Lilly's world in diverse geographies such as China and India. Acquisitions such as AME and SGX also provide us greater access to important US research centers like San Diego.</p>
          <p>Finally, over time we will selectively diversify our business. Now this doesn't mean we will become a conglomerate or that we will venture outside our core areas of expertise. It does mean that through in-licensing and acquisitions, we will look for ways to deepen or build upon our current therapeutic area presence and expertise. We'll also look for new ways to tailor our medicines to more precisely meet defined needs.</p>
          <p>With that context, let's review the major events that have occurred only since our last earnings call, all of which are aligned with the efforts I just outlined to become faster, leaner, and more efficient and more patient and customer focused.</p>
          <p>As part of a series of actions we are taking to restructure our research and development organization, we sold our Greenfield Laboratory site to Covance in a groundbreaking deal. Under the terms of this multiyear deal, Covance will conduct preclinical toxicology work for Lilly as well as expanded early stage clinical work and Phase 2/3 clinical trial support. Covance has demonstrated they can expedite early stage development timelines and improve efficiency, enabling Lilly to lower drug development costs and speed the flow of new medicines.</p>
          <p>We have also initiated a strategic review of our Tippecanoe manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Indiana. A range of options are being considered, including continuing site operations with a revised mission, selling the facility, or ceasing operations.</p>
          <p>Over the past three months, we have made targeted acquisitions and in-licensing deals to strengthen our discovery capabilities as well as to deepen our presence in two key businesses, animal health and oncology. We completed the acquisition of SGX Pharmaceuticals. SGX brings unique capabilities in structure-guided drug discovery. This acquisition also bolsters our presence in San Diego, a key market for scientific talent.</p>
          <p>In animal health, we continue to build our global presence by acquiring from Monsanto the worldwide rights to the dairy cow supplement, Posilac, as well as the product's supporting operations.  We entered into a collaboration and worldwide licensing agreement with Deciphera Pharmaceuticals involving four different project areas involving selective or multikinase targeted BRAF inhibitors.</p>
          <p>Most notably, we announced our offer to acquire ImClone systems. This strategic combination would create one of the leading oncology franchises in the biopharmaceutical industry, offering both targeted therapies and oncolytic agents plus a pipeline spanning all phases of clinical development. It provides the opportunity to generate additional value from ERBITUX from both existing and potential new indications. It supports our strategy to further increase our focus on biotechnology and brings a state-of-the-art development and commercial manufacturing facility. Finally, with three pipeline assets that could be in Phase 3 testing in 2009, it can help Lilly meet the challenge posed by patent expirations in the middle of the next decade on several currently marketed products.</p>
          <p>We've also made progress in accelerating the flow through our internal pipeline, with successes in the third quarter centered on new indications for key products. We received FDA approval of Alimta in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Consistent with our goal of improving outcome for individual patients, we generated compelling data for the use of Alimta in patients with nonsquamous cell histology.</p>
          <p>We also submitted Alimta in the US and Europe for histology based use in the maintenance treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. The data generated in the maintenance trial reinforced the utility of Alimta in treating patients with nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer. In addition, this trial fulfills our FDA commitments from the original accelerated approval of Alimta in second-line non-small cell lung.</p>
          <p>Last December, I spoke about our efforts to eliminate what we term the 'drug lag' that has historically seen medicines reach Japanese patients years after they reach American and European patients. I am pleased to report that we simultaneously submitted tadalafil in the US and Japan as a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension or PAH. The European Commission approved Cymbalta for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Also in Europe, we received a positive opinion from the CHMP [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] for olanzapine long-acting injection, known as Zypadhera.</p>
          <p>We also made progress toward resolving major uncertainties in our businesses. The UK Patents Court just recently issued a ruling upholding the validity of our Zyprexa patents in the United Kingdom. We resolved a multi-state investigation involving 32 states and the District of Columbia related to the sales, marketing, and promotion Zyprexa. Finally, we significantly advanced discussions to resolve the ongoing investigation by the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania related to past US marketing and promotional practices for Zyprexa.</p>
          <p>The centerpiece of our strategy is to accelerate the flow of innovative new molecules. So let me wrap up my remarks with our usual update on our pipeline. Slide five shows a snapshot of clinical pipeline as of mid-October and the flow for the first nine months of this year. You can see that we now have 49 new molecular entities in development. So far this year, 11 new molecular entities have entered Phase 1 testing, placing it on track to achieve to achieve our goal of 15 NMEs entering the clinic this year.  Also four NMEs have advanced into Phase 2 testing, and one compound, a gamma-secretase inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease has moved into Phase 3. We recently initiated our second pivotal trial for this molecule.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have seen movement in a number of important line extensions or new indications of currently marketed products, including the approval of Alimta in first-line non-small cell lung cancer and Cymbalta in fibromyalgia as well the submission of Alimta for maintenance therapy of non-small cell lung and Cymbalta for the management of chronic pain.</p>
          <p>One aspect of drug development to be expected is attrition, and we are committed to making timely go/no-go decisions and terminating molecules quickly that do not show promise. This year, we have terminated development on 10 new molecular entities, six in Phase 1 and four in Phase 2.</p>
          <p>Importantly, the net flow so far this year is positive. More compounds have entered the portfolio than have been removed from it. We expect four additional compounds to be added to the front end of our pipeline before year end and the proposed acquisition of ImClone will serve to bolster our mid to late-stage pipeline with five additional antibodies in development.</p>
          <p>I am confident in the strength of the pipeline and the flow we are generating. This pipeline along with our business development efforts will place Lilly in a solid position to deal with the patent expiration challenges for the next decade.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Phil to review the performance for the quarter. Phil?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. We posted a solid result in Q3 with volume driven sales growth and increasing gross margin percent and leverage within sales and ongoing operating expenses. Our Q3 results set us up well for a strong finish to the year.</p>
          <p>Let's start our more detailed review of third quarter results on slide six with sales volume trends for the quarter. This slide summarizes pricing volume trends back to the year 2000. The 14% growth in sales in Q3 is comprised of 6% from volume, 4% from foreign exchange rates, and 3% from price. The volume growth of 6% in Q3 continues solid volume performance and was achieved despite the drag from the entry of generic versions of Zyprexa in Canada and Germany and of Actos in Canada. Excluding these situations, volume growth would have been over 2% higher.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, you can see how our major products contributed to worldwide volume growth of 6%. All of our growth products are contributing positively with Cymbalta leading the way and Alimta assuming an increasing role. As in prior quarters this year, you will see that Zyprexa shows a volume decline, reflecting the impact of generic entries in Canada and Germany.</p>
          <p>We will now review the sales performance of selected products and then discuss the income statement. Slide eight shows worldwide Zyprexa sales, which increased 2% in Q3 to $1.19 billion. Sales in the US increased 3% to $556 million, driven by higher net effective selling prices, partially offset by lower demand. International sales were up 1% to $634 million, due to the favorable impact of exchange rates, partially offset by decreased demand and lower prices. Demand outside the US was unfavorably impacted by generic competition in Canada and Germany, offset by solid growth in Japan and several other European markets.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide nine, Cymbalta sales in the third quarter were $716 million, up 40% compared with the third quarter 2007. US sales increased 34% to $597 million, primarily due to increased demand and to a lesser extent, higher net effective selling prices. International sales totaled $119 million, an increase of 73%, driven primarily by higher demand and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Higher demand outside the US reflects both increased demand in established markets as well as recent launches in new markets.</p>
          <p>On slide ten, Humalog sales grew 19% to $433 million. US sales increased 13% to $245 million, driven by higher demand and to a lesser extent increased selling prices. Sales outside the US increased 28% to $188 million, driven by strong demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 shows the growth rate in total prescriptions for Humalog in the US over the past 2.5 years. As we can see, total prescriptions were declining through early 2007. Growth finally hit positive territory in mid to late 2007 and has accelerated significantly during 2008. The positive demand trend reflects the numerous efforts to reaccelerate Humalog in our largest market, including the recent launch of the Humalog KwikPen. While we are encouraged by the growth in total prescriptions, we remain committed to increasing not just the absolute number of prescriptions but market share in the rapid acting and mixture segment of the analog insulin market.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows Cialis sales, which were up 21% in the quarter, reaching $377 million.  Sales in the US were up 20% to $140 million, due to higher prices and to a lesser extent increased demand; while sales outside of the US increased 22% to $237 million, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 13, Alimta sales in the third quarter were particularly strong, coming in at $314 million, an increase of 46% over Q3 2007. US sales increased 35% to $149 million, due primarily to increased demand.  Sales outside the US were up 58% to $165 million, due to increased demand and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.  Ronica?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On slide 14, Humulin sales for the quarter were up 12% to $272 million. US sales increased 5% to $95 million, driven by higher net effective selling prices.  International sales increased 16% to $177 million, due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 shows worldwide Byetta sales for the quarter were $201 million, a 22% increase. Lilly reports half of the gross margin for US sales in Byetta plus sales of pens to Amylin and 100% of international sales.  Total Byetta revenue recognized in Lilly's income statement was $109 million, a 25% increase.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 shows quarterly Forteo sales of $193 million, up 7% over Q3 last year.  US sales declined 6% to $117 million due to changes in wholesale buying patterns, partially offset by higher net effective selling prices.  International sales of Forteo were up 36% to $76 million due to higher demand and a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 shows the revenues for the products Lilly has launched this decade: Alimta, Byetta, Cialis, Cymbalta, Forteo, Strattera, Symbyax, Xigris, and Yentreve. These products collectively grew 28%, reaching $1.9 billion or 37% of our sales.</p>
          <p>Before looking at the rest of the income statement, let's look at slide 18, which shows the impact of price, exchange rates, and volume on the sales results.  As mentioned earlier, for the quarter Lilly sales growth of 14% was driven by volume impact of 6%, a favorable foreign exchange impact of 4%, and by a 3% impact from higher net effective selling prices.  As John mentioned earlier, volume growth was strong across all geographies. And a challenging market, Animal Health, posted strong volume gains as we saw a positive impact from our efforts to expand sales in emerging markets like Brazil and China and continued growth in companion Animal Health sales.  In addition, Q3 benefited from the timing of customers buying ahead of price increases in the US.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the income statement. To facilitate our analysis of our results, we have provided two distinct views of the income statement. One view shows our reported results according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This view reflects our earnings from the LillyICOS joint venture net of tax in OI/(D) [Other Income/(Deductions)] up to and including January 2007. After that date, all ICOS and Cialis related revenue and expenses are shown in their respective line items of the income statement. This view also includes charges taken for significant items.</p>
          <p>The pro forma non-GAAP view uses GAAP methodology to restate our results as if Lilly had owned ICOS as of January 1, 2007. In addition, this view excludes the impact of charges taken for significant items. We will focus on the pro forma non-GAAP results as we feel it provides better insight into the underlying trends in our business.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 shows the income statement for Q3. Sales grew 14% to $5.2 billion. Gross margin as a percentage of sales in this quarter was 77.8%, an increase of 0.8 percentage points compared to Q3 2007. This increase was due to higher net effective selling prices as well as manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales.</p>
          <p>Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses were up 12% to $1.6 billion. The increase primarily driven by increased marketing and selling force expenses, included pre-launch expenses for Effient, marketing costs associated with Cymbalta and Evista, the impact of foreign exchange rates, and increased litigation related expenses.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expense grew 13% to $953 million or 18% of sales. The increase was primarily due to increased late-stage clinical trial and discovery research costs.</p>
          <p>The total of marketing, selling, administrative, and research and development expenses increased 12% in the quarter, two percentage points lower than sales. You can see that the expansion of our gross margin percentage and the leverage between sales and operating expenses drove a robust 20% increase in operating income.</p>
          <p>The adjusted effective tax rate on a pro forma non-GAAP basis was 22% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Net income and fully diluted earnings per share showed strong growth of 14%, slightly below the operating income growth rate due to lower other income and the slightly higher tax rate.</p>
          <p>Slide 21 shows third quarter other income and deductions, which decreased by $47 million to $3 million, primarily due to lower out-licensing income, offset partially by lower interest expense. Other income was also modestly impacted by the recent financial crisis. While our investment exposure to the firms most impacted was not large, our other income line for Q3 does include a $10.9 million write-down of certain investments.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 shows our reported EPS as well as significant items affecting net income and earnings per share. These items include charges totaling $1.477 billion related to the pending Zyprexa investigations with the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as well as the resolution of the multi-state investigation regarding Zyprexa involving 32 states and the District of Columbia. These charges decreased earnings per share by $1.33; a charge of $182 million or $0.11 per share for asset impairments and restructuring primarily related to the sale of our Greenfield, Indiana site; and a $28 million charge for acquired in-process R&amp;D associated with the SGX acquisition. This charge decreased earnings per share by $0.03. The table also shows the impact of similar items from 2007 for comparison purposes.</p>
          <p>Further information we have provided in the reported earnings statement on slide 23. Details about our reported earnings are available in our earnings press release dated today, October 23, 2008.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call over to Derica to update you on our financial guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ronica.  Slide 24 provides a summary of our full-year 2008 guidance on a pro forma non-GAAP basis. Compared to our prior guidance, you will notice that we have narrowed our guidance range from $0.15 to $0.05. In addition, we have raised our guidance for our earnings per share from a range of $3.85 to $4.00 to now a range of $3.97 to $4.02 per share.</p>
          <p>We are also revising two other aspects of our 2008 full-year financial guidance. Specifically, we are increasing our guidance for gross margin as a percent of sales and we are reducing our guidance for the contribution of other income. Pro forma sales are still expected to grow in the high single to low double digits.</p>
          <p>We now expect substantial improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales for the full year 2008 compared to 2007, on the order of magnitude of a full percentage point. Our previous guidance had been for modest improvement. This change is largely driven by weakening foreign currencies and continued tight control of manufacturing expenses.</p>
          <p>Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are still expected to grow in the high single digits and we still expect research and development expenses to grow in the high single to low double digits. As a result, operating expenses are still expected to grow in the high single digits, importantly I might add, at a slower rate than sales. Therefore, we expect to deliver positive leverage between sales and ongoing operating expenses as well as between sales and cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>Other income and deductions are now expected to contribute approximately $50 million. This is a change from our previous guidance of less than $100 million.</p>
          <p>We still expect the tax rate to be approximately 22%, excluding the impact of significant items, and to be approximately 23% on a reported basis.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures are still expected to be approximately $1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Please note that our revised guidance does not reflect the impact of our proposed acquisition of ImClone Systems.</p>
          <p>Finally on slide 25, you will find a reconciliation from pro forma non-GAAP EPS guidance to reported GAAP EPS guidance.</p>
          <p>This concludes our review for the third quarter, and we will now be happy to take your questions; Operator, the first caller, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. John, it would appear that Gemzar, Strattera, and Evista may have actually peaked in sales and I'm curious if in fact, you are then concomitantly reducing marketing and selling cost for those particular products. That's the first question. The second question is the Alinta sequential growth is extremely impressive, and I'm curious if again that's just primarily in the second-line indication thus supporting even higher growth now that you have first-line. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, I'll take both of those. I think first of all when you look where Gemzar is in its life cycle, it's pretty amazing that we're still sitting double digit growth. I think that reflects the fact that there are frankly a range of tumors that Gemzar is indicated for around the world that go beyond lung obviously.</p>
          <p>With Strattera, I think the fact that we recently got a maintenance indication for that product in the US is positive. With respect to Evista, obviously we're still in the relatively early days of promoting the products for the two approved indications that include the two types of breast cancer risk reduction. So you can expect we are going to make investments that are commensurate with the opportunities here.  Strattera is still fairly early on in the OUS trajectory. And I think with Gemzar, we really get a complementary detail of that product because as we're calling on oncologists, each one of our sales reps really essentially have Gemzar and Alimta in the bag.</p>
          <p>With respect to Alimta, I think there is &#x2013; probably some of that growth probably does reflect use in first-line, notwithstanding that we did not begin to promote that obviously and so we got the indication I think at the very end of September. But clearly, I think the data in the nonsquamous histology is going to make Alimta increasingly the drug of choice in treating that type of tumor in the first-line setting.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One clarification, as John had mentioned, we did receive approval for Alimta in first-line non-small cell lung. We have submitted but not yet received approval in the maintenance indication. Also before we go to the next call, I just want to let you know that we have been joined by Dr. Steve Paul. The Head of our Research Laboratories is available for your questions as well. Next caller, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I've got a couple of questions; first, what do you expect in terms of current operations, the impact of Cialis QD as Cialis is becoming a bigger product for you folks? What do you expect in terms of the trade-off between pricing and volume growth for QD? Secondly in terms of the pipeline, dirucotide for secondary progressive MS, when should we see data for that; and if you could just &#x2013; maybe if Dr. Paul could give us an update on the Gemzar pro-drug program, what are gating issues there to be able to replace Gemzar over the long term? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bert, I'll take your first question on Cialis QD. We think we've got the two forms of Cialis priced right. The cost per week of therapy for the QD is going to be the equivalent to a person taking &#x2013; the price for a week for therapy of the once-a-day is going to be equivalent to I think three times &#x2013; three individual uses of the PRN product. I don't think we're really looking at a negative situation in terms of any kind of trade-off. At the same time, we've seen since the launch of the once-a-day some pretty decent growth in terms of not only that individual product format, but the current, the 5-milligram &#x2013; what am I trying to say &#x2013; the episodic use version of the product as well.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bert, this is Derica. Just to add to John, since we got the once-a-day indication, our Cialis share of market increased by about 0.8 percentage points. And then subsequently since we launched our DTT TV ads around once daily, we've increased about another 0.6 percentage points, so in total about 1.4 percentage points of share of market increase during that time period. So we've been quite impressed that we've been able to get the balance right between the once daily in terms of the pricing relative to, as John said, the episodic use for the normal usage.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to dirucotide, Bert, when you look at first, secondary progressive indications, hopefully we should have some data on that trial by the second half of 2009. Recently we just had a 200-patient interim analysis on that, plus several data space and monitoring reviews that were positive. With regards to relapsing-remitting, the MINDSET trial is due to have data by end of this year and hopefully by Q1, we will have data presented externally. So that's where we stand with both dirucotide indications.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Bert, this is Steve Paul. On gempro, of course this is the oral drug version of Gemzar. What I can say at this point is the compound is on track. Recall that we are developing it for a slightly different strategy and indication as we treat cancer thinking more as a maintenance drug moving down the path. So the development strategy is a bit different obviously, and hopefully, we'll be able to provide a bit of an update for you later this year at the analyst meeting in December.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. I'm just wondering, can you give us a little bit of feedback on the deal with Amylin that you recently signed? Was this entirely a new deal that hadn't been previously negotiated? Or if this was a change to an existing deal, can you give us some feedback and color on the changes to the structure of the deal? And then secondly on Alimta, can you give us a little bit of color on whether or not that product is being used complementary to or in competition with Avastin in the first-line non-small lung cancer indication? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Seamus. On the Alimta deal, really it was just a continuation of the ongoing discussions we had been having with Amylin. And as we were working through the successive launches of &#x2013; launching BID, we had concluded much of the needed discussions around that, how we would partner. And then as we've been preparing for the potential launch of Byetta LAR, obviously through the construction of the Ohio facility, we were working through how to work out the rates with Bayer.  So what you are really seeing here with the recent announcement is the conclusion of those discussions that have been ongoing for some time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to your second question, we think we are in a good position with Alimta in that first-line nonsquamous histology because the other combination that's often used that includes Avastin is not indicated per se in that type of cell histology. So we think that the data that underpins that first-line approval is going to be very helpful for us. We think the other than squamous histology accounts for maybe 60 to 70% of diagnosed non-small cell lung.</p>

          <p>Thank you. In the last month, Lilly has issued at least three releases which mention prasugrel. The September 26 release stated the review is very far along. Neither the October 16 or today's release reiterated that language. Based on all your discussions with FDA, do you still believe the review is very far along, which we might interpret as a month or two until approval, or was that language intentionally deleted? And if so, why was it intentionally deleted? And secondly, on the tax rate of 22%, to my knowledge that excludes the R&amp;D tax credit. Perhaps you can correct me if that is wrong, so what is the tax rate guidance with the R&amp;D tax credit? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, this is John. I'll answer your first question quite simply. Nothing has changed from the press release we issued on September 26 saying that the review is far very along. However, I don't think we characterized that in any specific way. For example, I don't think we've acknowledged that that means, as you said, that it's a month or two before approval. We've been indeterminate on that. That's the FDA's call; but yes, the review is still very far along.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Steve, this is Derica. On the tax rate question, Q3 and our first nine months year results did not include the impact of the R&amp;D tax credit. As you know, on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate is 22%. Our guidance on a non-GAAP basis of 22% for the year does include the impact of the R&amp;D tax credit. It also includes our consideration of as we look at the balance of our US versus OUS operations and our cash needs as we work through various elements of our business, so all of that has been taken into account in terms of our tax rate guidance on a non-GAAP basis of 22%.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I have two questions, the first about Cymbalta. Could you remind us of the overlap between patients that have depression and fibromyalgia?  And in your early experience in that indication, fibromyalgia, are patients coming from newly diagnosed or dissatisfied therapies? And then secondly on price, it seems that this quarter had higher pricing than we've seen in prior quarters. And I wondered if you could comment as this is an anomaly going forward given the economy, and to what extent this helps your gross margin versus underlying productivity efforts? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Catherine. Let me handle the price question first. The year-on-year comparison does show a slightly higher price impact this quarter than in some of the prior quarters. If you do remember, last Q3, there had been an adjustment made that covers Q4 of '06 through Q3 of '07 for Cymbalta. So you're seeing a bit of an uptick in the way we report this year's sales compared to last year's sales that shows up as a price impact. You will also see in some markets &#x2013; traditionally we've had either zero or negative price contribution. Like in our rest of the world grouping, we actually see a price increase this quarter that are a couple of small situations that do tilt the balance to being a positive 2% price increase in those regions.</p>
          <p>Specifically with the ruling on the Concerta price, w went ahead and released some price accruals that we had for Strattera. And then secondly, the way we work with our accounting on sales in Russia with those sales coming in more heavily this Q3 of '07; that showed up as an additional price benefit in that particular geography.</p>
          <p>For your question on where the patients are coming from, I will need to follow upon that. We don't have that information here in the studio with us. And your first question Catherine, if you could remind me; I apologize; I missed that?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Catherine, this is Steve Paul, a couple of comments here. First of all depression is really quite common in patients with fibromyalgia, so there is commorbidity. But fibromyalgia clearly is a separate syndrome. It's not actually benefited well by SSRIs [Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor] let's say. The SNRIs [Selective Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors] are treatments of choice in our view, so there is substantial commorbidity. But again as a condition, it's a pain condition primarily that is treated with SNRIs and other agents. But it's not treated effectively by traditional antidepressants.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some more information that I can share with you, Catherine, in terms of the overall sales of Cymbalta, we would have roughly about 8% of sales coming from patients who are new to therapy. They would not have been on therapy essentially in the last year or so; about 6.5% coming from switch from other products; about 78 from continuing; and then a little bit less the remainder, less than 8%, from either add-on to an existing therapy or restart of a prior Cymbalta.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you; just a quick question on currency. If you talk about the currency impact to earnings in the quarter and looking forward, can you give your exposure to changes in currency? It looks like you are currently getting a benefit on the gross margin side. But how much on a natural hedge is built into your P&amp;L if we do see a strengthening dollar?  Maybe asked a different way, what percent of top line benefit are impact from currency, also the bottom line? And then just quickly on the Tippecanoe manufacturing facilities, just remind us what parts are produced there and what type of cost savings could be generated if you opt to close that plant. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, this is Derica. In regards to currency impact in Q3, we did see a benefit in Q3 due to currency even though the dollar began to weaken. If you recall from our previous quarter's results, as the dollar was weakening significantly or the euro was appreciating significantly and rapidly, while we were getting the tailwind in our sales line, you will see that we had a disproportionate effect in our gross margin line, and that was as we were having to revalue our inventory levels.</p>
          <p>Now that you're seeing the currencies go the other way where the dollar is quickly strengthening, you're seeing the opposite effect and that's why it's now showing the opposite effect in our gross margin line while we're not getting as much tailwind in our sales line. As we look forward, our inventory turns is about 12 months, and so once the exchange rates stabilizes, we are essentially neutral at the bottom line in regards to FX impact.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect, Chris, to your question about Tippecanoe. it's a large manufacturing site with a mixed mission today: small molecule, chemical synthesis; I think probably the mainstay of Gemzar, the manufacture of Gemzar intermediates and Gemzar final product. We also have some fermentation capacity there that supports our animal health business.</p>
          <p>The site originally was a key part of our cephalosporin manufacturing going back to the '50s, '60s, and '70s, so it is quite a large site. We are using only a portion of that site today, which as Ronica said, one of our options is to reduce the scope of the site mission. The other option is obviously to try to sell the site or eventually to close it down. If we close it down, we would obviously have to contract out manufacturing of some of the products there including Gemzar. I can't speculate on or comment on the potential cost savings there because we really haven't determined which option we're going to pursue. We expect in the next six to nine months, we'll get that decision made.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just going back to the foreign exchange question, you mentioned when foreign exchange is stabilized and when inventories &#x2013; I guess inventories are normalized, but with such a rapid change in the strength of the dollar, to me it still makes me wonder if there is going to be a substantial negative impact on '09 EPS if you just keep rates constant from where they are today. So I guess my question is, are you saying that there will be not much of an impact to EPS in '09 if you were to keep rates constant? And then second question on prasugrel, my understanding is that it may actually be Lilly who is asking for an FDA Advisory Committee meeting. I'm wondering if this is true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, this is Derica, I'll take the first question. Regarding currency, if you recall, when we had- go back and look at the fourth quarter of 2007 where you saw a really rapid increase our appreciation in the euro versus the dollar. And you'll see that during that period that we had a significant decline in our gross margin percentage, and that was due to the significant revaluation of our inventories at that time. Once we worked through those terms, we essentially are neutral.</p>
          <p>Then now we're in a period where we're seeing obviously the rates go the opposite direction, and so you're seeing that benefit in our gross margin line showing up. So even if you look at Q2 of this year versus our Q3 results of having 0.8 percentage points of gross margin benefit. When we look towards 2009, for which we haven't given any guidance, we are basically neutral at the bottom line. So while we're looking at movement in the top line and our expense base and gross margin, they pretty much net each other.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, two quick questions. First for John, as you look for other opportunities beyond the ImClone acquisition to pursue a diversification strategy, I'm curious on your thoughts on the size of deals, the areas of interest, and the appetite for near-term earnings dilution. And then my second question is on Cymbalta. Since US market share trends seem to be flat on a year-to-date basis. You don't seem to have to noticeably benefited from the approval in fibromyalgia. And looking ahead, I'm wondering what's going to change that trend, and I was wondering if you could please address that. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roopesh, this is John. I'll try to answer your first question. I think that for several years now, we've been very clear I believe with our investors that the primary use of our cash and our strong balance sheet after funding our internal operations and our internal R&amp;D, of course, would be to look for in-licensing opportunities or deals like the ones we just announced that either bring added capabilities, greater geographic presence, or it helps strengthen our presence in key therapeutic areas plus take into consideration the challenges we're going to face with patent approvals in the next decade. We believe the ImClone acquisition really fits nicely in that context.</p>
          <p>We also in the last 15 &#x2013; 18 months, we made two Animal Health acquisitions, Ivy Animal Health. We recently acquired Posilac from Monsanto. That's a business we're going to continue to build and grow. On the other end of the deal spectrum, we acquired SGX, essentially a company that brings us some important research tools and technologies, based in San Diego. That deal was under $100 million.</p>
          <p>So I think ImClone probably defines the large end of the spectrum in terms of the kinds of deals we've been looking at. We are very clear that we don't believe large combinations, mega-mergers with other major pharma companies make any sense at all. But we are going to be &#x2013; you can expect we're going to be aggressive in pursuing our strategy through a combination of internal, organic things, making this pipeline of 50, nearly 50 NCEs mature, matriculate and then obviously looking for opportunities. And I believe there will continue to be good opportunities out there for us to consider. Right now though, our main goal is to get the ImClone Systems acquisition complete and get that company and its products effectively integrated.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Roopesh, this is Derica. To respond to your question regarding Cymbalta's performance, just to remind you, if you look at Cymbalta's share and split of business today, our share of market in the major depressive disorders is about 6.7% and our share of market in pain is about 14.1%.</p>
          <p>If you look at the pain side of Cymbalta, we've actually been quite encouraged and pleased with the uptake given the fibromyalgia launch. And today, we've seen about a 20% increase in unaided awareness of Cymbalta approval for fibro. Also, if you look at just at our NRx volume, it's in line with what rheumatologists said, about 25%, and PCP is at 5%.</p>
          <p>If you look on the NDD side or depression side, we are still &#x2013; Cymbalta is still the only branded antidepressant that's growing and gaining share. What you're seeing on the NDD side is the overall market being depressed as the increase in generic utilization by many of the payors.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>An additional &#x2013; just to add some additional color to Derica's comment, another positive trend that we've seen is with our NRx trends versus Lyrica. That has been accelerating since the launch and some of that gets lost in the competitive nature on the depression side with the generics.</p>

And second, can you update on what to watch with respect to Evista and Gemzar patent litigation over the next six months please? Thank you.</p>

          <p>On the Paragraph IV litigation we have outstanding, as you are probably aware, Dave, we've got Gemzar essentially the authority been ruled on by the judge, when she denied our motion for a stay of the 30-month period when she said that they probably need to give us a 90-day notice before they would launch. We have still not received notice of their intention to launch, and therefore, trending towards the pending court date in July of next year.</p>
          <p>On Evista, the 30-month stay expires in mid-November, so just in a few weeks time. We have filed motions both for a stay of the 30-month period as well as for a preliminary injunction hearing. And we're still awaiting word from the court on both of those requests.</p>
          <p>And I'll turn it over to John to wrap up the meeting.</p>

          <p>Okay, thanks, Phil, and thanks to everyone for your time this morning. Let me summarize a view of our key points. Improving productivity at Lilly remains a key focus and we expect to deliver operating leverage for the year, growing sales faster than our costs and expenses. Results this quarter demonstrate our ability to use a variety of actions to prudently control our expenses, including the systematic application of Six Sigma. At the same time, we will continue to invest to maximize the range and the value of indications on important growth products such as Alimta, Cymbalta, Cialis, and Byetta.</p>
          <p>We remain on track to deliver on our pipeline goals for the year. We've made significant progress in the first nine months with solid movement into and through our pipeline. We made further progress on executing on our strategy with the announcement of our offer to acquire ImClone Systems positioning Lilly with an increased focus on biotechnology and helping us to meet the challenge of patent expirations in the next decade.</p>
          <p>Our next key pipeline event remains FDA action on prasugrel.  We continue to work productively with the agency in our continuing efforts to gain approval for this product. We remain confident in our data package and the value this medicine could bring to patients.</p>
          <p>At Lilly, we have a sense of urgency to deliver strong results today while also reshaping the company to win for the benefit of patients and shareholders alike. We are not standing still at Lilly, we're moving, taking actions in accordance with our strategy, all the while insisting on solid operational results even as we build our future.</p>
          <p>Thank you for joining us this morning, and I look forward to my continuing interactions with our investors.</p>
