      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Let's start by summarizing where we are. We had a solid third quarter. We were pleased with the US Federal sector with transaction volumes and continued interest in ELAs, albeit, smaller in size than we saw last year. We benefited from our operational change in local currency billing as the dollar weekend and we had stronger than expected maintenance revenue recoveries. We delivered operating leverage from our top line results.</p>
          <p>The macro environment has provided enough visibility so that we can increase our guidance for the fourth quarter. That said, it's important to underscore that we still remain cautious about the speed and pace of the economic recovery. When you listen carefully to economic views of the largest companies in the industry, there remains significant uncertainty as to how long the recovery will take and whether they'll be smooth and gradual or have bumps along the way. So while we welcome the improved short-term visibility in our business, we are still planning conservatively and assuming a slow recovery.</p>
          <p>We are also pleased to see vSphere tracking well since our launch in May. We've seen customers both gravitating toward Enterprise Plus, our most feature rich offering and at the same time, smaller customers purchasing Essentials and Essentials Plus. We also recently launched two new management products; vCenter Site Recovery Manager 4 and vCenter CapacityIQ. Later this quarter, we plan on launching our new View solution for desktop virtualization. Tod will cover these launches in more detail.</p>
          <p>One of the real milestones of the quarter was closing our acquisition of SpringSource in September. We welcome the SpringSource employees to their first VMware earnings call.</p>
          <p>Now, the key financial headlines for the quarter. Revenues were $490 million. License revenues were $240 million. We achieved non-GAAP operating margins of 22.2%, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.24 a share, driven by a $0.03 tax benefit not contemplated in our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating cash flows were $199 million for the quarter and $898 million for the trailing 12-months. Free cash flows were $185 million for the quarter and $760 million for the trailing 12-months. Although we utilized $350 million to purchase SpringSource, we still have a very strong balance sheet with $2.2 billion in cash and nearly $1 billion in deferred revenue.</p>
          <p>Those are the headlines and here are the details. Revenues for the third quarter were $490 million, which is an increase of 4% from a year ago and 7% sequentially. Our sales teams have executed well. Since adding General Managers for each of our three regions, our decentralized decision-making has enabled us to be more responsive to customer needs. Despite a challenging environment for new server shipments, Q3 license revenues were $240 million, a sequential increase of 5% although down 16% from 2008. The software maintenance portion of our services revenue was $213 million, up 44% compared to last year and benefited from solid execution.</p>
          <p>With the launch of vSphere, certain customers needed to be brought current on their maintenance. Revenue recognized on maintenance recoveries in Q3 more than doubled over last year and provided about $5 million more in revenue than our expectations.</p>
          <p>In total, renewal bookings grew approximately 80% compared to the third quarter of 2008, a very strong indicator that customers are satisfied with the value they receive from our solutions. Professional services revenue was $37 million, down 8% from last year. This decline was expected as our focus continues to be on enabling our partners to provide professional services around our solutions.</p>
          <p>Our overall ELA activity was once again strong with a large number of small and medium-size ELA deals. As a percentage of total third-quarter bookings, ELAs were approximately 15% similar to last quarter and to the same period last year. In general, ELA dollar amounts are smaller than we experienced in 2008 and the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Transactions with order values of less than $50,000 once again represented more than half of the dollar value of total orders. Our overall activity level continues to be strong, but closing larger deals, particularly outside of the US remains a challenge.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, our results for the US Federal sector was strong and the government is clearly moving in the direction of driving energy efficiency in its data centers. This is a key differentiator for us given the maturity of our fourth-generation data center product.</p>
          <p>US revenues declined 1% year-over-year to $246 million and grew 5% sequentially. International revenues grew 9% to $244 million driven primarily by growth in Canada, South America and APAC with easier comparables over last year. We've continued making investments through the recession in our international markets to grow our global sales footprint. In the third quarter, we achieved sequential and year-over-year double-digit percentage revenue increases from APAC and demand in China and Japan was strong.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, late in Q2, we started to bill and collect in euro, pound sterling, yen and the Australian dollar. Until we have prior year comparables, we won't provide you with constant currency revenue impact. However, we did benefit from the weak dollar as compared to our budget rates, when we provided guidance in July.</p>
          <p>So, in summarizing revenue, we were pleased with the US Federal sector, the transaction volume and continued interest in ELAs, albeit smaller in size than we saw last year. We benefited from our operational change to local currency billing as the dollar weakened and we have stronger than expected back maintenance revenue.</p>
          <p>Now turning to operating expenses. Unless otherwise noted, all references to our expenses and operating results are on a non-GAAP basis, which are reconciled in the press release table and posted on our IR website. Total operating expenses, including cost of goods sold increased 6% sequentially to $381 million primarily by the weak dollar, sales compensation, the net costs associated with VMworld, additional royalty cost and commissions paid to partners on booking back maintenance.</p>
          <p>Operating margins for the third quarter were 22.2%. This was our first full quarter of billing and collecting in local currencies and our execution was smooth. As a result of billing in local currency, the impact of the weak dollar on our operating margin was less than our historical experience. As a percentage of third quarter revenue, cost of revenues were 12.6% consistent with the 2009 run rate.</p>
          <p>Third quarter R&amp;D expenses totaled $108 million or 22% of revenues compared with 24% in the second quarter of 2009. This was planned in part of our current product cycle. We have worked hard to operate efficiently and have had success in reducing our CapEx and resulting depreciation. We expect R&amp;D expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we complete planning of our next product cycle and add SpringSource for a full quarter in Q4.</p>
          <p>Sales and marketing expenses were $169 million or 34.5% of revenues compared with 33.7% in the second quarter. The increase was largely due to our ongoing global expansion efforts. G&amp;A expenses were $43 million or 8.7% of revenue, the same percentage as the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our operating profit measured on a non-GAAP basis was $109 million or 22.2% of revenue and slightly better than our forecast range due to operating leverage.</p>
          <p>Diluted non-GAAP EPS was $0.24 a share on 403 million diluted shares. We had a $0.03 positive impact to EPS as a result of our lower than expected tax rate. Our tax rate is very sensitive to the mix between US and international taxable income. The change was primarily due to higher than anticipated concentration of expenses in the US, which was driven in part by the impact of the SpringSource acquisition.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 22%, about 10 points higher than our GAAP tax rate for the quarter. For the year, we expect the 2009 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19%, about eight points higher than the GAAP tax rate.</p>
          <p>Now on to our balance sheet and cash flow statement. The SpringSource acquisition closed mid-September for $420 million, of which $356 million was cash. We realized a $6 million gain from the acquisition as a result of an earlier investment we made in SpringSource. This gain has been excluded from our non-GAAP results. We added around 150 employees with SpringSource. Given their subscription and services revenue model, we expect a dilutive effect on our non-GAAP operating margins of about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter. From a GAAP perspective, the impacts will be larger. Most of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets and goodwill.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains very strong with cash at quarter end of $2.2 billion. We continue to become more efficient in our capital spending as we focus on free cash flow. Our net fixed assets declined for the second consecutive quarter. Although capital spending may vary from quarter to quarter, we are monitoring this closely as we understand the <mark type="indiscernible" /> effect on expenses of current period capital spending on future quarters.</p>
          <p>Total deferred revenues increased 6% sequentially to $990 million. Year-to-date, total deferred revenue has increased 14%. Our net accounts receivable declined nearly $2 million from last quarter and our DSO, including the change in deferred revenue, is approximately 43 days.</p>
          <p>The interest rate on our $450 million note with EMC adjusts each quarter at LIBOR plus 55 basis points. Our Q4 rate is 84 basis points or 31 basis points lower than Q3. Likewise, however, we expect our investment yields in Q4 to be lower than in Q3.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating cash flows were $199 million for Q3. Free cash flows for the quarter were $185 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, non-GAAP operating cash flows were $898 million, an increase of 27% from the same period in September of 2008. For the same period, free cash flows increased 44% to $760 million.</p>
          <p>Our full-time head count at the end of the third quarter was approximately 7,100 people, up about 200 people from the prior quarter reflecting the inclusion of SpringSource employees.</p>
          <p>Our fully diluted share count increased to 403 million shares for the third quarter driven by the impact of a higher share price on the calculation of dilutive securities. We expect that our diluted weighted average share count for Q4 will be approximately 410 million shares, which reflect both the higher share price and the full quarter impact of the shares issued for the SpringSource acquisition.</p>
          <p>Before I turn it to Tod, I want to share with you how we are looking at the business to give you some assistance in developing your estimates. We are beginning to get better visibility into our business and it appears more customers are moving forward with their IT investment plans, but their approach remains cautious and deliberate. As I mentioned earlier, while we welcome the improved short-term visibility in our business, we are still planning conservatively and assuming a slow recovery.</p>
          <p>We believe that Q4 will follow seasonal pattern and we are planning on a range of between 540 and $560 million in total revenue. Given our growing deferred revenue balance and our expectation that the trend in maintenance recoveries will continue, we expect that services revenues as a percentage of total revenue will continue to grow and we expect to see a double-digit decline in license revenue in Q4 compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Barring any unusual items, we believe that our fourth-quarter non-GAAP operating margins will be between 23 and 25% after taking into account our adjustments to GAAP operating income that Mike Hasse disclosed at the start of this call. We expect our GAAP operating margin to be approximately 16 to 17 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margin.</p>
          <p>Although we aren't providing a lot of details today beyond the fourth quarter, we want to provide a couple of data points on Q1 2010. We're expecting Q1 2010 revenue to be seasonally down from Q4, approximately 5% of the good working assumption and we will update you again in January.</p>
          <p>To summarize, we're pleased with our execution and solid performance in the third quarter and we're planning for the future assuming that the economic recovery will be gradual.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it to Tod. Tod?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon. As you'll recall, I spend a significant portion of my prepared remarks last quarter discussing vSphere and the effort underway to drive important operational improvements here at VMware. These efforts have progressed, illustrated by our solid third quarter and positive upward movement of several key indicators of our health. Some of these include customer satisfaction, which continues to trend at industry highs. Renewal bookings was performed very well and were up approximately 80% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>And lastly we continue to experience strong interest in vSphere as measured by over 500,000 downloads in the first four months of availability. Further, according to a recent Web poll approximately 75% of customers are upgrading to VSphere within six months.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned before, VSphere will take several quarters to make its way through the channel before it begins to significantly impact our revenue. The signs are encouraging and overall demand for VMware products remained strong. This is reinforced by the 21,000 new customers who are added to our VMware Family in the first half of 2009. Many of these customers participated in VMworld 2009, which we hosted in San Francisco in September. Over 12,500 customers and partners will attend it, a solid attendance number are specially given most industry conferences have shown sharp declines in attendance this year due to travel restrictions.</p>
          <p>We also hosted a 140 industry analyst at our coinciding two-day analyst conference. It was our largest conference ever and signaled the growing influence of VMware as represented as some sectors well beyond virtualization attended including storage, networking and application development. Significant announcements of VMworld included additions to our vCenter virtualization management solutions family including Site Recovery Manager 4, which expands enterprise class disaster recovery capabilities, while minimizing cost and complexity.</p>
          <p>We also announced Capacity IQ, a new solution that delivers unprecedented insight into infrastructure capacity and resources. These solutions complement app speed, chargeback and Lab Manger 4, which we introduced and shipped in Q3. We also made good progress increasing ecosystem support for VSphere. New joint solutions include an integrated solutions with HP called Insight Control for VMware vCenter Server. This solution will help customer simplify management of mixed physical and virtual data centers.</p>
          <p>We also announced vCloud Express, a new cloud service offering that's based on VMware technology from the world's leading service providers including AT&amp;T, Verizon and Terremark. And on the desktop front, we announced broad customer adoption of VMware View with more than one million seats estimated across 7000 customers. Our desktop opportunity continues to show momentum <mark type="indiscernible" />. We now have dozens of customers who adopted View for deployments of more than 5000 seats including five with over 20,000 seats deployed. This deal of deployment is an important signal the customers are getting more comfortable and are considering desktop virtualization as enterprise ready. In addition, we believe our upcoming V4 launch further aggresses the cost and quality issues that have inhibited broader adoption of desktop virtualization. This said, we are very early in the desktop virtualization market and the pace of growth is unknown. But we believe that VMware is well positioned with great technology and a strong ecosystem to lead this sector when it does take off.</p>
          <p>Overall, I am pleased with our performance in the quarter. Our field execution was impressive given the still challenging economy. As we look at some of the verticals and our geographical expansion efforts, we're seeing signs of real promise including the US Federal sector and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand the call over to Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Tod. I'd first like to start by adding my thanks to those members of the team <mark type="indiscernible" /> a good quarter in what are improving, but still challenging times. From a broader perspective, we continue to be focused on extending our core value proposition of achieving capital equipment savings. We conserve the consolidation to one of operational efficiency and access to the benefits of the cloud. And doing all of that in an evolutionary way for of our customers.</p>
          <p>To this end, we're both deepening and building on the vSphere foundation. As Tod and Mark noted, we continue to be pleased with the way vSphere has been accepted by our customers and the way that the technology is holding up on the real workloads. We are investing heavily in this core technology and we are well-positioned for the opportunity to make vSphere the foundation for the cloud, both the private cloud and the public cloud.</p>
          <p>On the public cloud front, we've extended our vCloud initiative with significant announcements from major service providers, AT&amp;T, Verizon, SAVVIS, Terremark and others. And part of this announcement was the introduction of the service called vCloud Express that will be offered by some of these service providers. This service allows customers to buy compute capacity very inexpensively by the drink, while maintaining compatibility with the VMware virtualization software is used by majority of the world IT shops.</p>
          <p>The net results as we now have a spectrum of service providers who can provide a complete range of cloud offerings. Also as Tod and Mark noted, in the third quarter we started delivering the members of our vCentre management solutions family. This family will give our customers further capabilities to realize operational efficiencies and we will continue to extend this family with new capabilities over the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>In the current quarter, we're looking forward to releasing VMware View 4.0, our desktop virtualization solution. This release introduces the PC-over-IP protocol. This protocol brings us the state-of-the-art capability to support thin clients and should open up the benefits of VMware based virtualization on the desktop to an even larger set of customers, who have more demanding requirements in terms of graphics and wide area performance.</p>
          <p>View 4.0 also significantly upgrades the desktop management capabilities we offer to our customers, again in keeping with this theme of driving increased operational efficiencies. The net is that View 4.0 is going to allow customers that already have significant investments in VMware software and the data center to further leverage that existing infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in terms of our product here, and as Mark noted, we formally closed to the acquisition of SpringSource in September. SpringSource as a way of reminder has become the leader in terms of Java programming with more than half of new Java code now being written to the Spring Framework . The benefits of this Framework are also being extended to new age web programmers via the Grails framework.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Spring family also includes the high <mark type="indiscernible" /> application management capabilities and the tc and dm application servers. We are enthusiastic about the set of capabilities not only because they lead in terms of increased development productivity, but again because of the operational efficiencies we can enable by integrating Spring capabilities with Wyse VL capabilities.</p>
          <p>We believe in time that this can be game changing and will further enable us to raise the bar for the industry. With the team and the technical capabilities we now have in place, we believe that we are well positioned to make significant progress on this journey of enabling our customers to gain new levels of operational efficiency to gain access to the cloud and to do this in an evolutionary way.</p>
          <p>Finally as both Mark and Tod noted, the economic climate has improved and there are definitely some swallows in the sky, but we should remain cautious. It's too early to declare that summer has returned in full.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll open it up for questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And we'll go first to Heather Bellini with ISI Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning guys or good afternoon, sorry. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about the customer conversations you had this quarter and what's different about them in particular versus last quarter? And also, for example, like why all of a sudden are they starting to spend again and feel better about ELAs? And I guess I'm also wondering what they're telling you about their virtualization plans for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Heather, this is Tod. What we're hearing from customers is, as they are realizing where they are on this virtualization journey and what they need to do to effectively do more with less resource, they are actively looking how they can drive virtualization as a core part of their solutions process. That said, it's not quite like the days of yesteryear where ELAs or customers were looking and buying three, four years out in advance in large ELAs. They are still looking conservatively and doing sort of smaller byte <mark type="ph" /> size transactions. So while the ELA activity was up in plenty of interest on all levels of the business, we're not seeing big large significant buys that we may have seen a few years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask a follow-up to that --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because one of the bear stories have been that you have a bunch of ELAs that were signed two, three years ago that are going to come back to haunt you as people use up that capacity before they have to engage in new transaction. I was wondering if you could shed any light on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So on that front, we really sort of got the momentum with our ELA business in about the summer timeframe of 2007. So, and 2010 is when those opportunity is to renew those ELAs will be upon us. As you know, our licenses are perpetual licenses in general. And so the opportunity to renew really is selling additional value, additional products, management products, desktop or expanding beyond what is in the core ELA, but we don't expect those to really start to come into play until mid next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, the other point, Heather, this is Paul, is that the good news is by and large people have gone through their ELA licenses very quickly. So we've seen there people actually deploying those and getting usage out of them, and of the early ELAs that are coming up for renewal, by and large we are seeing the customers are willing to renew and in some cases, even extend beyond what they had in their early ELAs. I think to really a question of sort of what's different this past quarter from the first half of the year, as I think that people that's collectively realized that the sun is going to come up tomorrow morning and they have got to start planning for that. So people are starting to think again in longer terms rather than just thinking about survival from quarter-to-quarter. But that being said, even though, they are thinking longer term, they are still trying to be very cautious and make sure that they don't guard on a lim <mark type="ph" /> and get surprised if this recovery does turn out to be, as Mark said more bumpy than you might think. But certainly the welcome news here is that people have started to think in longer-term horizons and not just thinking about the immediate survival.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much. And sorry for the background noise here, going through a bit of fire in our building. But I had two questions really to ask you. One is, I'm wondering if you can quantify Mark the license revenue impact from switching over to the new billing system mode assume that you've probably built a bit of that in your guidance, but the dollars didn't probably surprise you a little bit. So wondering if you could quantify that. Also secondly, just give some really rough metrics, obviously good to see the business rebound back and you certainly sound a lot more confident that you did a couple of quarters back. But I'm just looking into your implied guidance for Q4 and Q1 and the license revenue looks like you're still projecting it to be roughly down to maybe flat best case in the upcoming March quarter against what looks to be an easy comparison to March quarter earlier. I would probably have expected a little bit more of warmer guidance given that you still are in hot priority for IT spending for next year what not. I am just wondering if you could shed some color on what is behind those relatively -- at this point, which looks to be flattish to slightly down license revenues for the upcoming March quarter against easy comparisons. That's it. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Cash on local currency billing, we had factored part of that into our guidance back in July, but as the dollar did weaken, we had about a 70, 75 basis point lift on license revenue during the third quarter as we have across all currencies. With respect to first quarter guidance, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we are proceeding cautiously, we are planning cautiously. But reminder that Q1 of last year had the benefit of some very large enterprise agreements that we did with both the US military and with certain companies in the private sector and so our ELA license revenue during the quarter was really very strong. Also we had an some OEM carryover from Q4 of 2008, which had a positive impact on the quarter. And as we look ahead just into this quarter, we'll give you a more -- a better look at it in January. But at this point, we're still looking at decline in license revenue growth in the first quarter based on the implied guidance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And finally any revenue contributions from SpringSource that was material or perhaps not I would imagine? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We -- for the third quarter -- we closed the transaction really mid-September, so not much of a contribution and based on their revenue model, which is largely services and maintenance amortization. There's not a large impact in the forward quarters. It's largely a strategic acquisition for us and we are getting a lot of interest from customers as we talk to them on the Enterprise about ELA as well.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks guys. Quick classification. I guess with regards to this professional service revenues declining on a sequential basis, even with that decline it seems as though that the license business will still grow slower on a sequential than the services, did I hear you correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so the mix of what we will see -- the mix and the guidance that we provided of 540 to 560 will continue to tip more toward services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. And then with regards to VDI, it seems as though View 4.0 is going to have much more of a PC like experience on its end clients. So I guess the question is clearly this is a fantastic secular growth opportunity going forward. So I care to speculate when we could see this kind of cross over the threshold of double digits in terms of percentage of total sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we've got a lot of customer interest in this. We mentioned in our last quarter's call we're spending 20 to 30% of our SE time with customers doing evaluations on proof of concepts. So when you look at the overall market opportunity, we're bullish on it. As far as when it's actually going to tip and start to take off, it's really unknown. There is a lot of factors as far as when will companies pursue desktop refresh, when will the update to Windows 7 come out et cetera et cetera. And so we're just continuing to stay focused and execute and we just don't know when it will tip.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Paul. I'll just give some color on that is the market for desktop virtualization really pulls into two categories. There is a category of people primarily the early doctors where we're seeing a lots of success to date were driven primarily by security and control priorities, particularly in the financial sector, the military sector, to some extent in education and health care where people really want to make sure that whole information stays centralized and nothing leaks out of the desktop. That is a very important -- that it is the minority of the total possible market. What we have to do now is speak to people for whom security and control are concerns, but they not be only concerns, the complete economic impact and the operational cost have to be taken into account. And that's where we got -- a necessity spend the longer sales cycle looking through that and convincing those people that is not only as a safer and more secure way of doing things, but a cheaper way of doing things. And that's going to take some time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thanks. Mark I have a question just about the fourth quarter too. So, do you expect to see more maintenance catch ups on the fourth quarter because -- license to be down double-digits. And unless you expect something to happen here with services after being down 4 or 8% in this quarter. Just want to make the model where it's going to hard to make it work without some more maintenance catch up there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John. We do expect the trend in maintenance recoveries to continue through at least the fourth quarter. And so, that's built, partly built into the guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you tell us about how much you'd expect in that or &#x2013; -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we expect the trend to continue up sequentially. And as I mentioned for the third quarter, it was stronger than we had anticipated contributing about $5 million of services revenue in addition to what we had built into our guidance in the quarter. So we expect the trend to actually grow and to increase over Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just quickly a follow-up. In the US, you said the federal, you had good contribution from federal at the end of the fiscal year. And the US itself was sort of flattish. I'm just curious what you see assuming this is the strong US federal government contribution. What you kind of see happening here in the US, it sounds like momentum is getting better for you're seeing less decline in license revenue. At the same time, that <mark type="indiscernible" /> which is obviously is important, it doesn't look as healthy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Also from a geographic perspective, as we looked at guidance the US appears to be a bit stronger. We are seeing some weakness in EMEA. We're coming off of their seasonally weak quarter and so there's some expectation that it will grow sequentially and there'll be improvement and there was a lot of strength in APAC. The Federal sector, strong contribution in Q3, but part of that is also maintenance. And so when we talk about the overall strength part of that's going to our deferred revenue line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Could you, just curious, I mean, we've had some other companies too that had some good strong federal sector. I wish you would expect at the end of the fiscal year, but it is also some maintenance, big maintenance catch up. Was that contributed to the maintenance catch up here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was really across the board. It wasn't isolated to the federal sector at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one thing I'll just add, this is Tod, is we've put a programming in place in the May timeframe to really focus on smaller transactions that's because of our growth and focus we hadn't really put as much energy as giving the smaller dealers to renew their maintenance contracts. And so as a result of that problem we've seen some great strengths in Q3 and as Mark said, we expect that to continue in Q4. And one of the primary reasons is people are excited about VSphere and their opportunity to upgrade to VSphere is a compelling reason for them to catch up on their back maintenance and get current.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just want to follow up a little bit on the question about license growth. I too came up with relatively flat number for Q1. When do you think licenses can grow again? And then relatedly, why wouldn't you start renewing some of these ELAs early?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Katherine, this is Mark. The -- as I said in early comments, we are approaching the economy very cautiously. And we'll give you more color on 2010 in the January call. But we're looking at server shipments, we're looking at a general trend in IT where spending is not forecasted to be robust. We certainly believe that we'll get our share of that, but we're just not at this point ready to declare that license revenue will accelerate and grow year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What about the ELA renewals? Why wouldn't you try to renew those somewhat ahead of schedule as most of them are coming up in the back half of 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In some cases we're absolutely engaged with all of our ELA customers that have renewals in 2010. And if we can in a situation we can bring things and close the deal, we absolutely will do that. But given this worthy economic climate is, a lot of customers are saying, I'm just going to continue to stay with where I am at. And as we get to the quarter when the ELA will expire at that point is when they will renew. But trust me, if there is opportunity to renew it early, our sales folks are intended to make that happen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks, congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to see if you could drill down a little bit into the dynamic of ASPs that you seeing. You've got two new sets of skews on the high end also on the low end. Could you just address what's your stand -- at the net results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So we've been pleased in the sense that with our enterprise plus products, we've seen significant amount of interest of customers upgrading to that, which is our highest and future rich products. We've also seen a lot of transactions or volume with our essentials and the essential plus product. And the net effect if we've been able to balance out in the whole ASP's to where they have been in the last couple of quarters. So I am more exited that we're attracting a new set of customers that are just entering into the virtualization journey with essentials and the essential plus. And then our existing enterprise customers that really want to get vantage of the robust feature and value of our solutions can do that with the enterprise plus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fantastic. For large deal activity at this point early in the quarter, would it not surprise you to see the same kind of I guess, proportion or contribution from ELAs that you've seen in the fourth quarter -- fourth quarters of the last couple of years, over that 20% threshold again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's fair somewhere between -- we've always <mark type="indiscernible" /> in between 15% to 25% max. And so, we would expect that to hit more to the high teens and possibly 20%. But a lot of that activity really won't be in the pipeline that it won't be known to us till the very end of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" />. Just one more quick one if I could. On hiring, do you have any sense where you expect to end the fourth quarter and how aggressive you get with ramping up higher again as the environment feels better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are continuing to really invest strategically in the critical positions that we have across the company. We're just in the process now on boarding 150 people from SpringSource. But we're continuing to hire and we continue to hire key positions inside.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>I mean, any change from the pace, I guess over the last couple of quarters I guess it's been --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Paul. As Mark was saying earlier, we continue to manage in a cautious and deliberate way. So we will continue to invest where we think it's necessary to invest for the long term. Specifically as we said before, we are investing in the growth geographies of Asia and the developing world. So a lot of our head count growth, our net head count growth is coming in those areas as well as in certain key R&amp;D functions. But outside of that, we remain, still at this point, trying to be very disciplined and very cautious.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. I'll ask a follow-up actually to that last question to Paul or Mark. As you think about, we're looking to next year, and understanding you're not giving specific guidance, but just at a high level, if we start to see IT spending improve and you start to see demand will accelerate, will you wait a quarter or two to start to reinvest more aggressively? In other words, we expect to see maybe margins be better than the trajectory that we've seen over the last several quarters for a period of time? Or will you start to reinvest more aggressively given all the growth opportunities you have in front of you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we're in a position to speculate about that at the point other than to reiterate what we have said is that we don't say any reason at this point in time to advent <mark type="ph" /> in our cautious stands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we should be thinking about margin expansion then next year?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just one last question on the product side if I could? You recently decided to continue selling the Enterprise edition when previously you were going to get rid off the Enterprise edition on the 15th of December. Could you walk us through A) the logic around that decision and B) what impact do you expect to have or that decision to have on the numbers if any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. This is Tod. The original plan was that at December 15th we are going to end the Enterprise product and then provide Enterprise Plus as the upgrade option for customers. What we heard from our customers is, some of them were not ready to make their upgrade decision to vSphere. They were waiting to tell and they got through the end of the year or particular cycle or event that they had in their IT shop. And they wanted to preserve the opportunity to upgrade to the Enterprise product. And if the SKU <mark type="ph" /> went away they were feeling their hands were going to be tied. So we decided to extend the opportunity for customers to do that. We don't expect it to have a significant impact on ASPs. If anything is <mark type="ph" /> done -- good things with our customer goodwill and showing that we will listen to them and want to be -- with them to address their IT solutions.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have not. It's been similar to what it's been in the last two quarters. One of the other thing we've mentioned here on the call is the OEM server shipment still continue to be down year-over-year. Until in Q3 Gartner just updated the numbers that OEM server shipments were down 16.3%. But we haven't seen a shift from one of our partners to another one, it's <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>

          <p>Yes, thanks. I had a question for you on the competition side, if I could. You've seen new products from here and you've seen some pricing changes as well. So is there any change in the decision cycle that you have seen that is noticeable. And then also wanted to see if you have seen any change in your channel momentum was how systems integrators is one recovering better than the other? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So from a decision cycle and engaging with the customers, we haven't seen any impact from the competitors. In the procurement cycle, we will talk about it but when it comes to actual improvement concerts in kicking the tiles and watching the value and the robustness of our solution in action. We stand about the rest. As far as the channel partners and the channel makes we have got a strong channel ecosystem and there are also having well. We are saying our transaction business run through <mark type="indiscernible" /> or the rubber they are all executing well.</p>

          <p>can and do you see anybody that you're talking to that are bit might be kicking the carriers are doing their evaluation. Do you have many customers that are looking at the fourth quarter and lenders in kicking over to the fourth quarter and focusing more in 2010 here or are they looking near term and short-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that compare to Q1, they are looking and little further out certainly not looking at all 2010. I mean looking at the fourth quarter and maybe first quarter next year of the first half and not of this is just project based where forks are looking at next year I may want to do they call center move or refresher or whatever the situation is. And that project may extend beyond the next 90 days, so we're seeing some of that. But we're certainly not seeing folks in general say, the next three years, I'm going to do X, Y and Z and I want to buy it all now.</p>

          <p>Operator, we're going to take two more questions please.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll go next to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, excuse me -- I have two questions if I could. You mentioned server shipped and I'm just wondering if you could give any color on what the OEM represents of your current business, particularly given the catch up accounting if you will. You mentioned servers were down year-over-year, but both HP and Delaware were up double-digit sequentially. And so surprise your license revenue was up a bit more, but the first question is just on how much is the OEM of your current license rev just generally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the X86 system companies represent a significant part of our overall revenue. But part of that is through their own channel businesses. And so historically our OEM revenue and actually royalty reporting that attaches with server shipments has been even in the 20% range or less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry to interrupt, but just royalty part is what I am interested that's 20% or less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's just over a long period of time. Now that said when the server shipped, there still are licenses sold with them, but more so through the channel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, sorry -- this a follow-up question if I could. Mark you mentioned that you thought when the customers start adopting vSphere that your license rev, you'd anticipate a pickup in your license revenues. I just want to see if you could help us understand about how that process works or how that unfolds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. For customers that are under maintenance, they have right to vSphere's part of their -- is part of their maintenance right. What we've said is that vSphere is strategic, it's part of the platform for developing the private cloud and that customers are initially going to start by taking it on to <mark type="indiscernible" /> and gradually building their deployments over time. We have opportunities both on new license revenue as well as upgrade revenue and we've been pleased with the progress that's made on vSphere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adding -- I think we've been -- to point out that vSphere is not going to be a big bang. This has to go through the stages of adoption that was going to the effect will be felt over several quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And we will go next to Michael Turits with Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, two question. One the maintenance catch-ups. It sounds like that's $5 to $10 million in the next quarter that's trending up a little bit. Does that just kind of start to trail off in first and second quarter, does that five to 10 just pretty much drop out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Michael its Mark. Certainly at some point the -- we started the program beginning in the second quarter. And it was really focused on the smaller transactions. We've always been a high-volume transaction company. So overtime, we expect that to drop off. But we were pleased and had with the trend that we saw in the third quarter had additional $5 million of revenues that we hadn't anticipated, and we expect that trend to continue at least through the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Al right, this is Tod. I'd add one thing. And even if you were the back maintenance part drops off, we expect then once be -- someone gets current with maintenance that they remain current and they renew again the continuing year. So they will stay within the fold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And then just a big -- I am sorry, bigger picture question. As we move more to multi- core processors and increasing that multithreading within the course. And are we going to higher consolidations ratios and how much of the dampening effect is that having on license sale? I know at VMworld you address this and say that the consolidation ratios will become less in the factor of greater penetration. Just wondering if how much of the dampening effect that isn't having right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Paul. There are several factors that work here. One is, this certainly, theoretically with the fast and the <mark type="indiscernible" /> processes, you can achieve greater consolidation ratios. What we find higher is the trends were setting that as well, which is that as virtualization in our customers goes beyond tier 2 and three loads test and development things like that and they get close to real production deployments. Typically customers elect to not to put as many work clothes on a single machine. So they can get greater performance and greater reliability. The other thing that offsets the increased consolidation ratio is that we're providing customer's abilities to do more things with those course. Example being there <mark type="indiscernible" /> which are essentially choose of course if you like. So the increased software functionality that we are giving them plus the customers are electing to be more cautious in deployment offsets to some extent the larger ratios that are theoretically possible. So while this is certainly a factor, it's not the overwhelming factor that you might think it is.</p>
