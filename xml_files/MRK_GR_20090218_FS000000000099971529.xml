          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results 2008. It's a great pleasure to see you here had a sunny day in Darmstadt and also warm welcome to the people that follow our investor conference via the webcast. I'm very pleased that all members of the Executive Board are on today and they will give you all the details of the past 12 months, full year 2008, and also the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Dr. Kley will provide you an executive summary as well as some more details about the strategy, after that our CFO Dr. Becker who will provide you the details on the financials and Elmar and Dr. Reckmann will provide you then the details of our divisional developments and after Dr. Kley's closing remarks we will open then as usual the Q&amp;A session. Before I hand over to Dr. Kley I would like to ask you to switch off your cellular phones and as usual I will also like to draw your attention to the disclaimer with the usual suspects of forward-looking statements et cetera.</p>
          <p>But now Dr. Kley the floor is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, I know that your focus particularly in these troubled times is very much on quarterly if not daily results and detailed updates, dates from the operating business. We've therefore decided today that Elmar Schnee and Bernd Reckmann will give you an detailed update of the divisional situation in both pharmaceuticals and chemicals and that's why you see the four of us here today. As we have reduced the number of Board members in the last two years from 7 to 4 we can even manage to sit on a table, so that's also helpful in this respect.</p>
          <p>So in order to not to tell you too much and keep you away from the financial operating numbers, I will restrict myself to some short remarks on the overall picture and then the strategic framework. 2008 was a successful year. We had top line growth, we had bottom line operating result, stable, cooperating result we're reporting to you in the nominal operating results reported was the best ever in Merck's history.</p>
          <p>We are maintaining our strategic focus. The crisis does not change that at all. The crisis has an effect on managing cost, on managing capital, on postponing, recov &#x2013;  focusing these kind of things but the overall strategy, sustain change and grow should be in place. 2008 we delivered on some elements of the strategy, which was presented to your earlier last year I think. The established Merck Serono is the leading biopharm &#x2013; one of the leading biopharmaceutical players. We continued our investments in innovation and started to deliver, which was very much at the &#x2013; close to the heart of Elmar Schnee, Bernd Reckmann, myself. Delivery in innovation, not only investing for innovation. And we managed to grow regionally in those countries and regions of the world, which are our strategic focus.</p>
          <p>We think if you look at our results they vindicate our risk diversified model, the group results are very strong despite the turmoils in the &#x2013; in parts of the chemical business. And therefore we feel very confident to propose a dividend of &#x20AC;1.50 per share, which is excluding the Generics bonus, 25% above last year and clearly shows our commitment to shareholders, also in times when some of our governments feel that no dividend should be paid at all. We don't feel that way.</p>
          <p>Top line growth 7%, research and development, there are of course some timing issues in it. I think Michael Becker and Elmar Schnee will report on it later. Core EPS up 10% and cash flow &#x2013; free cash flow now in the positive results the lower results contribution from the chemicals but also has some special effects in it, which Michael Becker will revert to later.</p>
          <p>So, as a company, as a group, we delivered on the guidance and also Merck Serono met partly, even exceeded the guidance. In Liquid Crystal obviously we failed until the September results. We thought very clearly that we were on our way to deliver on the guidance, otherwise we would have told you differently in October. And then we had in November, December the same experience as many other companies had before, a rapid fall from the cliff within two months with the halving of the volumes. And of course against that backdrop we could not deliver on the guidance. Still if I may modestly say, I don't feel it's a suffering business, some of the press comments this morning I was wondering I think that a business was 45% return on sales is not really suffering. So all in all, we didn't meet the guidance but we are not in a crisis situation.</p>
          <p>The levers for growth, which we mentioned, number one is innovation. Innovation in Pharma will be a part of Elmar Schnee's presentation in more detail. Important is we've worked on the pipeline. We have moved projects in the pipeline, of course some get full market approvals, in 2008. So, the measures, the personnel decisions and the process decisions and the project reviews pay off and we are quite happy with that.</p>
          <p>We're also investing in innovation in Chemicals. I won't go through to all of that. These are three areas, where we're very closely taking a look at it and have even decided in some of the areas to move ahead. In OLED, the organic light-emitting diodes, we feel we are amongst the technology leaders and we are in the, admittedly small market, definitely the European market leader as well. Even if it's not as displayed a topic maybe as time will tell us, for lightening it remains a high attractive market which we will be able to participate.</p>
          <p>Photovoltaics is certainly one of the markets, talking materials, not rooftops, certainly market with a very high growth, has a lot of synergies, which with what we do in liquid crystals, light and energy. And also a number of our customers are moving to the fields like Samsung, LG and others. So, it's one of the areas we are determined to take a close look and to enter to stimulate future growth in that area.</p>
          <p>And Nanotechnology, of course, plays a major role in a number of areas such as surface treatment. My favorite picture a cat scratching a car was unfortunately not reprinted so, these are nano materials but they don't look very sexy.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest also in bricks. We think it's an important element of an industrial company so we continue to do so. The Merck Serono biotech centre is going ahead. The biggest investment of the Company and, of course, none of the delays or postponed investment is related to this major investment, which is key for our future success. Maybe some of you, when entering our compound here, have looked to the right and have seen the research center for the Chemicals coming up and we are also building in the United States a Center of Excellence for discovery and protein production in Billerica, close to Boston.</p>
          <p>Third element, regional growth. United States, the Pharma business for the first time exceeding $1 billion, and Japan with the launch of Erbitux, we finally got a sizable footprint and could more than double the business within the last year and the growth path will continue. China, tremendous success, 86% in growth and also optimistic for 2009. In India, while the consumer business and Pharma is growing well, the focus there, which we have is very much on the Performance Life Science business, microbiology, biopharmaceuticals with production research corporations. So, these four countries which we have defined as the key countries for the next years are delivering because of the investments, which we are doing there.</p>
          <p>And with that overview, I would like to pass on to the fascinating topics of numbers, numbers and numbers and who would be better suited to do that than Michael Becker? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. I tried to keep the amount of numbers too in a reasonable scope, but in order to put them in perspective, we look at the full picture and let me start with the most important items from our income statement, up to the operating result.</p>
          <p>The revenues and the total sales cost increased at the same rate, namely 7.1%, while the total fixed cost SG&amp;A fell slightly. Therefore, our statement is that our growth is of good quality, and this is an important feature of our cost control and operating performance. If we take a second look at the revenues, we can see that the royalty income grew a lot stronger than our main business. However, this increase is also a good help for us to foster the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>The quality of growth to maintain in these times is particularly pleasing, because our margin was under pressure, not only from customers, some of whom in the chemicals industry are experiencing difficulties and some of them even significant difficulties, but we were also under pressure from currency effects that were unfavorable in places, pretty unfavorable for us on an annual average.</p>
          <p>The Serono integration proved beneficial for the other operating expenses, as we incurred &#x20AC;125 million less integration cost and we were able to unearth further synergies, which are then more prominent in the results statement of Merck Serono. Having said that, I'm also satisfied with our cost control elsewhere. R&amp;D expenses, as already been hinted, rose by 20%, which was an unexpectedly strong increase and is chiefly attributable to the Merck Serono division.</p>
          <p>Amortization of intangible assets rose due to the strong Swiss franc. Please bear in mind that the corresponding rights are mainly held in Switzerland. We also have, again for information purposes, the core operating result, which of course did not fare as well as the headline operating result, because the improvements that came from the Merck Serono integration costs, the fall of 125 million, is outside the core operating result.</p>
          <p>Looking briefly at the fourth quarter in isolation, it is very pleasing to note that we managed to achieve the quality growth also in harder times and with less sales to compare the cost development with. And here the increase of the research and development expense is more apparent, as there was an acceleration in the fourth quarter. Elmar, in his presentation, has the details.</p>
          <p>As currency is such an important influence on our performance; I'm sure you know, on the left hand side the effect of the full year 2008, which is an average effect from January to December. And you can see still strong influences in all divisions, which takes away a good deal of our really excellent organic performance in all divisions, including those who are facing a strong headwind. But then we have in particular in Liquid Crystals roughly 10% negative currency effect and this is in the division of more effect than in other divisions because most of this headwind, most of this negative effect falls through to the bottom line, as we have explained in previous presentations. And that remains the same.</p>
          <p>Now, as we approach the year end and we're explaining the average effect and the expected elevator beneficial effect on our currency situation, I think it is important to show also the situation in January this year compared to January 2008. And although there is the very beneficial effect of some currency, especially in those currencies that are important for Liquid Crystals, namely Japan dollar, Swiss franc is not for liquid crystal and Taiwanese dollar, so a big, big increase in Japan and very good increases in the currency, strengthening of the currency of the other three. But there is a more than balancing effect of Korea, the U.K., Brazil and Mexico, which leads as of January still, to negative currency effect. So, the hoped for elevator effect was sort of &#x2013; there was a considerable break in that due to the red countries on the right hand side. And I think that is important for you to bear in mind when you try instead of us to take a look in to the future.</p>
          <p>If we take a look at the income statement up to the profit after tax and minority interest, the situation gets more complex due to the sale of the generics business in October 2007. I would like to draw your attention to the exceptionals, the financial result and the tax rate. I have a separate page for the exceptional, so I have put them last and start with the financial result. The interest expense and the financial result was about one quarter of the previous year, since our debt fell below &#x20AC;1 billion at November 2007.</p>
          <p>As you know, we also report as part of our financial result the calculated interest on our pension provisions, which are in excess of 1 billion and which were 60 million euros plus of 12%. Exchange rate difference has lowered the financial result by 18 million euros compared to gains of 9 million euros in 2007. So, the swing was 26 million. This was in the end not surprising given the development on the foreign exchange markets. The financial result still shows a prior 50% improvement overall.</p>
          <p>The headline tax rate does not look so favorable because the impairments only carry a very low tax credit, a Swiss tax credit as the write all in Switzerland of only 13%. We were, however, able to improve the underlying tax rate, which is adjusted for exceptional items from 28.2% to 25.8%. The last quarter, so the quarter we are also reporting is of course completely distorted by the exceptionals; the financial results suffered from the negative currency effects which were more apparent towards the end of the year in contrast still the underlying tax rate is even better than in the full year.</p>
          <p>With this I would like to go to the list of exceptionals; we have a number of exceptionals on our purchase price allocation following the consolidation of the Serono business.  Nearly 200 million relate to the product technology of Raptiva, which is a complete write-down; we have a partially write-down of licenses in connection with the inbuilt (20.58) product which is the conclusion out of a change in the contract, we have impaired the goodwill of Lexigen and acquisition of the early part of this decade, which is also now written off completely and we have written off another part of our development technology relating to the high-dose human recombinant growth hormone that's 20 million.</p>
          <p>The impairment of financial assets relates to our stake in our development partners, ZymoGenetics and then we have restructuring charges.  One relates to the sales force of Merck Serono, which we have sold and other restructuring relates to the chemicals business, the PLS business, which were measures in the U.S. and Brazil and this is the theme of the exceptionals which amount to 400; the operational contents, the operational reasons can be explained by Elmar and Bernd in more detail.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the balance sheet which remained strong with an equity ratio of 61% and net debt just under &#x20AC;500 million. One notable and perhaps surprising fact is the intangible assets here under non-current assets, the first-line which despite the amortizations and impairments in the total amount of &#x20AC;900 million didn't decrease accordingly but actually increased which was not due to new intangibles, but is a currency effect again we already mentioned Swiss franc influence, but far more prominent than in the P&amp;L.  Because in the P&amp;L the deprecation of intangibles is calculated at an average exchange rate while the balance sheet is calculated as a one-time on a certain day exchange rate.</p>
          <p>There the Swiss franc had gained a lot more than on average. So all our depreciation of the intangibles have been balanced by a currency gain, the counter position is in the equities, so strengthens our equity but of course it is flagged because currencies look great; they can go up, they can go down; if the Swiss franc goes down again, so will the intangibles and accordingly the equity.</p>
          <p>And I think all other items are significant, we look at the working capital in connection with the free cash flow I think that's a better picture or more important picture. If we look at the cash flow &#x2013; at the free cash flow, in the cash flow, then you can see that the cash flow as such, so the simple cash flow &#x2013; the cash flow of profit after tax plus provisions and depreciation was nearly unmoved. It just, it rose actually slightly by 2%.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow, however, declined from 978 to 601 million euros, which is a result of the lesser results coming from Chemicals and also special effects from the Merck Serono division, which are in two positions, one in the working capital changes, which are in total 300 million, which is an increase of 100 million and these 100 million relate to the discontinuation of the sale of our receivables at Merck Serono in Italy.</p>
          <p>In Italy we had given the total credit and collection for hospitals, we have sourced, had sourced that out, so including a complete sale of the receivable. Analysis showed that the financial part of that deal had become unfavorable, so we stopped it and took 100 million defect, on the whole year was 100 million because we started already to collect ourselves. It was a volume of nearly 200 million, but the effect on the year and this cash flow is 100 million and that is the explanation for the increase compared to last year in the working capital changes.</p>
          <p>And the other influence you see as you can see in the others, last line of the statement &#x2013; a negative impact difference between 170 and 300, so 180 million and that was due to share deals that took place in 2007 and had nothing comparable in 2008.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we sold our shares in Genmab, which resulted in a cash of 120 million and we also sold shares in Imclone and Medarex, where we have small number, a small number of shares out of our research collaboration that brought something like a double-digit euro cash.</p>
          <p>I think this concludes the many, many figures, so I hope it was bearable and with that I pass on to Elmar to return to the interesting part of life.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Mike. I think we have also some figures in my presentation. Merck Serono concluded the year with positive momentum. If we look back over the 2008, we can proudly say that in each quarter we had double-digit growth. In the first quarter which I will focus my presentation on it, we grew 16%, including in this is 2.7% because we had to move out a discontinued business from generics and we took the whole sales of the whole year in the fourth quarter in -- which accounted for 2.7% of 16%.</p>
          <p>From now on, of course they will be included in Merck Serono's results. If we look on the royalty, we had a nice increase of 41%, which gives us quite a nice boost. If we look on the return on sales with 24% into Q4 is lower and this is already been alluded to; we had a higher selling and marketing expenditure because we prepared launches, we have Kuvan we have Erbitux and so forth. And of course R&amp;D we saw a spike in the fourth quarter. Now these spikes you should not take and put into your model because in our strategy we say that we are committed to 20% of our turnover.</p>
          <p>We increased R&amp;D spending because we were able to increase the recruitment which is directly related to money invested and we also cleaned some of the projects up which led also to costs because you have to close down properly ongoing projects. If you look into the cash flow of course as already pointed out it was lower and Michael explained the reasons for this.</p>
          <p>Now let's come to the operational development. We had overall a very strong performance in all of the therapeutic groups and all key therapeutic areas, through double-digits, 14% in the Q4. Rebif is now available in 18 countries and we expand the growth and I have a separate chart on those as I will also have a separate chart in Erbitux to explain the growth. But I would like to highlight that we returned to sequential growth with Erbitux and we grew 20% in 2008, over the previous year.</p>
          <p>If we look on Fertility, we had a very nice growth of nearly 9% and here it pays off that we apply regional strategies, and secondly Pergoveris does surprisingly well and gets very fast adopted by our customers. If we look on the Cardiometabolic Care business, in there obviously our lifecycle management still pays off and we had an increase of 16%.</p>
          <p>We will see for 2009 the last patent expiry in this franchise, which is 40 million Concor sale in France. However, we can also launch a small new form which gives our reps something to talk about which is a very nice form of Glucophage powder.  As you know it's a high dose product with 1000 milligrams a day and for elderly people powder will make quite a nice difference in taking the drug.</p>
          <p>Raptiva we heard also, we took a full write-down from our balance sheet.  Unfortunately in the last quarter we saw PMLs rising and we had to notice that the PML came all after three years treatment on Raptiva and we are currently in discussions with EMEA.  Whatever the outcome we will have a severe restriction on the current potential, and in line with our strong balance sheet approach, we have written off the entire position in this balance sheet.</p>
          <p>If we look on the product, let's go to Rebif on the next page &#x2013; Erbitux is first. Let's start with Erbitux. So here again we are very pleased with the 20% decrease. However, we did not realize the number from us given to you is 600 million, which tells us we shouldn't give you a number of our sales from our product, then we wouldn't have to backpedal. However, we had some very nice successes during the year, we had the approvals of first line colorectal cancer, we had the approval in Japan of the second and third line which we launched there in the last quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>And Japan goes very well, so we are very pleased and we do our planned numbers in this market. Of course we got then the head and neck approval for first line rather faster than expected based on the very favorable results in the extreme trial. I talked this you before in the last quarter and we reported the third quarter that we were having some issues with the KRAS screening.</p>
          <p>The KRAS screening is very, very well adopted and the physicians love it because you can exclude patients, which you do not see a beneficial effect on Erbitux. However, to establish the testing facilities it took longer and it was a little bit harder but we think that we are now well on the way and in most of the European countries the tests are able to be done and can be turned around in at least two weeks after getting the sample to the lab.</p>
          <p>Of course, we filed also the non-small lung cancer file and this will open up a new area of growth for Erbitux. We expect approval in the second half and having shown at the congress lately that the patients who have in the first three weeks a skin rash, show 15 months survival benefit in this indication that should really propel the product after we get approval in Europe.</p>
          <p>We started the EXPAND trial, which is a new indication for Erbitux, in Phase III the gastric cancer. And of course Erbitux is now approved around the globe and there's a very fast application each of the <mark type="inaudible" /> and we have 75 countries already in colorectal and 71 in the head and neck indication. I'm convinced that, to return now to our last growth path for Erbitux, and with the indication of lung we will see an acceleration against the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now let's come to Rebif, which I would then qualify, rate as a continued success. We increased 13% organically our revenues, and we increased our patient fees not only in the USA where we are the only interferon who gains new patients, but we expanded it also in Europe, based on our new formulation which is now nearly launched throughout Europe.</p>
          <p>Erbitux is very well accepted, and has an excellent efficacy side effect profile. One of the reasons why I think we thrive in the area is we have excellent service built around the drug, field nurses, call centers, so we really look after our patients and help the physicians to have success with treatment.</p>
          <p>Currently we work hard on lifecycle management, because we believe that Rebif will have its place with orals or without orals, but certainly an oral from us and with further extent, with the CIS indication we have the trial ongoing where we should get results which allow us to get clinical isolated syndrome indication, and we work also on the next generation device and we will lauch in Europe an electronic device, very much similar to the Easypod device in Europe, which allows of course also some excellent measurement of compliance and the physicians and the payers look forward to this one.</p>
          <p>This is an impressive chart we received in 2008, or only since actually the last report to you, two marketing authorizations. We launched two Phase III trials and we saw the results of those ending life in three days. And I don't have to go through, you followed this, but of course the highlight of this for sure has been cladribine which I would like to talk a little bit on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Cladribine is our oral treatment for multiple sclerosis, and we worked hard during Christmas and the beginning of the New Year to get this data out as we promised because as you very well know we are in a race against a somewhat bigger company in Switzerland. And we received some extraordinary results, at least in our measurement, of 55% respectively, 58% in the lower dose reduction of the relapse rate.</p>
          <p>Now you should not be disturbed that we have a somewhat higher response rate in the lower dose, because it has never been actually targeted to show a difference between the doses. And the difference of the doses is not the dose as such, there is only 10 milligram tablets, but it's the duration, so it's either from five to 10 days or it's from 10 to 20 days treatment in one year. And if you think about that, a patient who is used to have an injection every day, every three day, every week. he could have a treatment of up to three weeks only per year and then forget his disease and get his results. I guess that could appeal to the patients.</p>
          <p>We started two other trials already before we have known the results. The oral trials would give us the early access indication, and the onward trial where we try the combination of interferons with this oral treatment.</p>
          <p>So, what can you look forward over the next quarters? Of course we launched Kuvan very early on in this quarter. We get of course the detailed data for clarity, and we wait for the American Neurological Society meeting where we will have a full presentation on the data. We will also do so with the exciting news from safinamide, which we got in Phase III; we showed that we have met the primary end point in the add-on treatment in Parkinson's disease.</p>
          <p>In the second half we will see the first results out of our Phase II studies in rheumatoid arthritis for atacicept and we will file in the first half of 2009 the cladribine in the USA as well as for the European authorities. And another biggie which we can't wait for is of course the indication for the lung with Erbitux. So this concludes Merck Serono, so let's go to Consumer Health Care.</p>
          <p>Also in Consumer Health Care we had actually a very good organic growth, 10%, in the fourth quarter even accelerated to 12%, whereas overall global OTC market grew 14, sorry 4%. We saw some very strong growth in regions like China, India. Since we have a very sizeable business in the U.K., we suffer quite a bit on the pound sterling. We remained true to our strategy, which we announced some time ago that we increased the sales and marketing directed to our key brands and also that we wrapped up and reorganized R&amp;D investiture.</p>
          <p>Hence you see also there that we have a decrease of the operating results, which is more marked in the second half because we had one off payments in the first half from the sale in Spain but also &#x2013; a payment from a company which owned us the money based on the pollution of the drug which we had in a year or two years ago with the fish oil.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow is strong but it's in line with the profit and the CapEx, we believe we have a quite a good position in this market as you can see, on the next chart, there... our strong brand performance is going on, we have some very nice successes with single brands and each one of our therapeutic foci actually grows. We think also that despite the OTC market being somewhat weaker in a recession, that through our strong brands, and through maintaining our investment, that we can maintain a growth in our OTC business also during 2009.</p>
          <p>I would only like to mention that we grew in Q4 the top five markets, which we have 10%, where the market was minus, and this top five markets for us were 70% of our turnover. So we are confident that we will grow in the OTC business, though we might see one, two, three percentage points less growth through the recession, but we will not go to a negative growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Elmar, and welcome also from my side. It's my pleasure to present to you Chemicals. Let me start with some general comment on Chemicals. As you all know, quarter four was very difficult for chemical businesses. We experienced a tough market environment. We saw this in a substantial decrease in demand, especially in Liquid Crystals and pigments, resulting in a 15% decrease in Chemicals revenue in Q4.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we were able to keep our market and technology leadership in Liquid Crystals and successfully introduced the new PSVA technology. Our Performance &amp; Life Science business grew accrue with new products in regulated markets and in our focus countries, India and China. Overall, Chemicals had a respectable year with an organic growth of 4.7%, reduced by currency impact by 6%. And equally important, we consequently implemented our strategy in 2008 and focused our efforts on innovations, as already mentioned by Karl-Ludwig.</p>
          <p>Now, let me come to Quarter 4 and to Liquid Crystals.</p>
          <p>The long lasting growth story of Liquid Crystals took a break in quarter four. Sales dropped by 33% to 166 million, based on a strong decline in demand in line with the softening in consumer electronics markets and corresponding heavy under-utilization in the factories of our customers.</p>
          <p>The decline in quarter four revenues is volume driven. There is a slight currency effect by the ongoing currency headwinds in Korea. Gross margin was 59% in Q4. Marketing and selling costs; on track, below last year. Total SG&amp;A, however, increased compared to last year by &#x20AC;13 million, due to the swing in currencies and hedging activities in this highly volatile environment.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D spending in Q4: up by 30% with &#x20AC;23 million, above last year's quarter, mainly reflecting our increased commitment to innovation like PSVA and the Liquid Crystal business, and new technologies like OLED, LED and flexible displays. With &#x20AC;52 million the operative result was 60% down compared to last quarter. This represents a return on sale on 31.5, and the lower operating profit as well as the increased inventory level, led to a drop in the free cash flow by 50% compared to last year's quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some more details on what happened in Liquid Crystals during quarter four. Demand and sales have been on the level of the previous periods during October and until mid of November.</p>
          <p>At this point, we were confronted with a sudden clash of incoming orders and cancellations of existing orders from our customers. At the year-end LCD fall off the cliff and we saw extreme low demand during December, when all LCD manufacturers were heavily under utilizing their capacity with the Taiwanese manufacturers hit most strongly.</p>
          <p>In fact, what we have seen, over the last six week of last year was a market multiplied by 0.4. The current over capacities in the LCD industry lead to a deterioration of prices of all types of panels, up to 50%, during 2008 and our customers as you know, most of them lost money in Q4. This results in high price pressure for all material suppliers and intensified competition amongst the suppliers, and this is also valid for LC materials.</p>
          <p>In line with the unexpected and rapid change in the market, Merck announced on December 17 curtailing the production for both liquid crystal and pigments. The capacity cuts were managed by extension of holidays and by flex time, and after a prolonged Christmas holiday there will be shutdowns around Easter and the beginning of summer.</p>
          <p>During the course of Q1, we will reevaluate the situation and we will decide on additional measures if needed. In parallel, we will continue with our efforts to manage production costs down, as in the past, where we have been quite successful.</p>
          <p>After the first six weeks now in Q1 we see that the market is staying on the level of the last six week of last year. And it is unclear how long the market will stay at this bottom. Nevertheless, the long-term perspective for the Liquid Crystal is still intact and brilliant as Liquid Crystals are the winning technologies in this place and today, only 13% of all worldwide place TVs are flat panel TVs.</p>
          <p>Merck will therefore continue to focus on innovation, technological advantages, customer proximity, and superior quality, and does not lead to price reductions. And based on this recognized technology leadership in all segments, we have been able to keep our leading market share through 2008. And although in a changed market environment, we will defend our market share. Therefore we see it as important that we continuously invest into new technologies. We still see big room for improvement for LC materials and the superior PSVA technology is a proof.</p>
          <p>PSVA, which speeds up switching times, and helps to reduce energy consumption as well as manufacturing costs at the customers, was successfully launched with two customers during Q4. Merck is owning different intellectual property rights for PSVA, and we are the only supplier of this innovative technology to the panel makers. In addition, as mentioned we are heavily investing in new future technologies like OLED, LED, so we don't foresee cutting R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>Let me switch to Performance &amp; Life Science. The PLS business benefited from the diverse product portfolio, the successful regional expansion, and the price increases in late summer resulting in a 1% growth of 298 million sales in the fourth quarter. A double-digit drop in pigment sales, based on the low demand of automotive and other industrial coating applications, was balanced by the strong development in life science solution serving the less cyclic markets of Pharma and biopharma production and biosolid performance of our level three business.</p>
          <p>We invested in sales and marketing, mainly in sales force in Asia and in improved web and e-commerce platforms. R&amp;D, on the same level as in previous quarter, and finally the operating results improved by 54%, we have also Q4 2007 which included some restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, mainly impacted by higher CapEx, and changes in inventory level. For the full year we are pleased with the performance of PLS with an organic flow of 4%, negatively impacted by currency by 3%, and the operating result was up 15%, so PLS has delivered quality flows. Michael has mentioned the restructuring efforts. We closed down one manufacturing site in the U.S. and we consolidated another manufacturing site in the U.S., and we exited a business in Brazil, which led to the mentioned exceptional expenses.</p>
          <p>A closer look at the PLS business shows a good development in North America and Latin America, North America benefited from stronger U.S. dollar as well as from the progress in the regulated Pharma and biopharma markets, balancing the decreases in pigment sales which majorily hit Europe as well as North America.</p>
          <p>We remained committed to pigments and have introduced a new product to the market that will strengthen our position, exiting the down turn in automotive industry. Latin America benefited from a strong prop bioscience business and besides the strong development in the regulated markets we achieved good gross with innovative products and solutions including rapid test for screening and microbiology and analytical testing.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation and I hand over to Karl-Ludwig.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>In closing, again we strongly believe in our business model and we also strongly believe that our portfolio positions us very well to steer through the crisis. What is important for me is the message that we fore-think the crisis is after the crisis and therefore our strategy remains unchanged. That means development of pipeline products and Elmar's presentation has shown the progress we've made in this area. Maintaining the market leadership in liquid crystals, while the numbers might be unclear the leadership is not. Focus on innovations and specialty chemicals and I showed you some examples where we are active. We will continue to exploit growth opportunities, with a strong focus on the U.S., Japan, China and India. So, the strategy is clear. The short-term auto glut, not. We did not want to talk around the issue, so we decided not to deliver prognosis this year and understand, as been discussed also with the investors' community, that does not take anything away from our confidence.</p>
          <p>Merck is not only here to stay, we are certainly one of the companies who will come out from the crisis as strong as we went into it. And all in all we remain committed to growth and that's our promise for the future. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. With this closing remark I would like to open now the Q&amp;A session. This time we have so to say two flying microphones, so I can ask to just to raise your hand and one colleague will then provide you a microphone. And I would like to start with Vincent Meunier, who was first in the first row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Vincent Meunier from Exane BNP Paribas. Three questions please, the first one is on the emerging countries. Can you give us a trend, currently in Pharma, because we can expect there a sort of weakening of the consumption of Eskaer drugs?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on Cladribine. Can you gave us more details with regard to the toxicity of the compound? We know that in the Phase III some people have developed cancer and also we know that there is a risk of teratogenicity. This is the case for the injectable formulation of that drug and that will be potentially a limit in the use of the drug because the population &#x2013; the target population are young women.</p>
          <p>And the last question is on Erbitux. Do you expect potentially from the EMEA questions on the EGFR mutation that would conduct potentially to reanalyze the FLEX results as it was the case for the Crystal study in colorectal with regards to the KRAS mutation? We should have potentially a sort of duplication of reanalysis, not for KRAS but this time for EGFR mutation. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let's start at the emerging markets. I know as much as you do what emerging market concerns. We know that the GDP growth correlates very nicely with healthcare expenditure. So, based on this, if it goes up it corresponds, maybe it might go to correspond if it goes down. But so far we haven't seen a weakening, but it means not that we will not see one. I don't know is the honest answer.</p>
          <p>Regarding Cladribine side-effects, I mean we made a press release and we talked about the four cancers which we had, which were four different cancers. The safety report said nothing to do with the drug. That's the reason why we didn't mention it in the first time, but then the question was asked, we were very open about it.</p>
          <p>The other side-effects concerning teratogenicity, the protocol actually demanded that the male as well as the female are on birth control measures. That was the case for the study. Nevertheless, we had five women who gave to healthy baby birth. So, we haven't seen something, it stands, to this but that's not a sample big enough to do. I would expect that the label has to be decided by the authorities, what they want to give in this concern.</p>
          <p>Regarding Erbitux, if I could expect questions from the EMEA, I won't be much better off and faster because I would just deliver the answers upfront. We do not expect that they will ask for this, because number one, the hypothesis is not proven, in itself nor prosectively. The basis for the hypothesis are very low patient numbers and therefore we think they will not. But I don't know, is the honest answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we will continue with Marietta and then we go to Dani.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Marietta Minutz, Presentation Aeraltz three questions please. The first is actually a set of questions relating to Erbitux. First is just whether you still reiterate your conviction that it can be a &#x20AC;1 billion product in the E.U. in 2010. And then regarding colorectal cancer, whether following the introduction of widespread KRAS testing, you have actually noticed a change in the split of first line versus second line usage? And also relating to lung cancer, how you actually expect the drug to get used in practice? Do you think that doctors will just give it for three weeks, then assess for the rash and discontinue and switch the patient to something else if there isn't a rash, or how do you expect the rash situation to come in there?</p>
          <p>And then the other questions are much quicker. One question just on OTC. A lot of your competitors have obviously discovered that as an alternative growth engine, and I was just wondering how you expect that to change either the competitive landscape, whether there are brands that you will need to specifically defend or countries that you need to specifically defend? Or whether you could actually imagine selling your OTC business at a time when you might get really good multiples for this?</p>
          <p>And my final question relates to Chemicals. I believe you had always been sort of on the lookout for potentially a third leg. And you just didn't find anything suitable. Do you think that actually in the current market conditions you might find a very attractive business at very attractive multiples as well or is that not really in your radar screen at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Erbitux as blockbuster statement. We had first Karl-Ludwig Kley saying it. So, that's okay. But we heard also in Reuters that our head of oncology said it, which is worth much more because he has to make the sales. Yes, I still believe Erbitux has blockbuster potential in our territory. Not in E.U., the bet is in our territory, because we have always elected in America and Asia and Japan.</p>
          <p>To the question about the split, we have not market results data currently at hand, which show this. However, of course we are in contact with hospitals, and from there we see a trend that people start to use inline with the KRAS in first line treatment. And in Germany, a few quite marked ones, where we could notice this. And we are confident that this will happen. Because if you look at the selling data, it is nearly 80% responder rate, 40% resection, 34% decile cancer &#x2013; I mean how can you ignore these numbers? I don't know.</p>
          <p>Regarding FLEX, it's too early to really speculate how the physicians will treat. Because obviously the primary endpoint was significant, it means not only the people with rash had an effect on them, maybe also some wider patient population. We have to see what the label is, but I would guess that maybe the patient will ask the physician why he doesn't get a rash and might be very interested to get Erbitux first, because it has this marked effect. But I can, at the moment, not speculate what the physicians will do, because we need the indication and we need to more discuss with the physicians.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> the patients that don't get a rash. Is that <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know. We haven't number one told you what is doubt and we had a predefined sub root analysis, which we analyzed. We haven't done other analyses currently. We know that we had attended a little bit month survival benefit on the intention to treat analysis, which is significant. And if you compare the patient population taken into, which was not highly selected as by other companies, then I think this is a very decent result and I have no doubts that we will get a approval on this Phase III trial.</p>
          <p>Regarding OTC, yes, at the moment, we have the advantage in Merck that we are already diversified. I'm thinking much better than any pharmaceutical company because we have Chemicals business. At the moment, it seems to be our work to buy OTC but all the generics. I have, you know, some sort of an understanding for OTC but I can't follow the generics attempt, since we sold our business on top of the market, which was actually fabulous timing. Today, you could buy Myimbek for half including what we sold it to them regardless of the debt of course, only I talk only equity, so.</p>
          <p>I think it's an interesting business. But you see the competition in OTC needs some time, because OTC is about brands. And to build brands even if you go new in that needs years. We have the great advantage that we have established brands, very well known, some over decades and we pushed them now in, so we are in there. And if some braver companies are coming in, yes, that will increase the competition, the consumer will have more choice, but they cannot overtake our brands in two years. So, that will not happen. So, we feel very comfortable about it.</p>
          <p>Are we selling? I wouldn't say that we do because I think we are very happy with our OTC business, even if the multiples might be teething</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to Chemicals, growth is, as you referred to, a fundamental filler of our strategy. And growth, of course, can be organically or can be achieved by acquisition. So therefore we are observing the opportunities for this ongoing in the market. We have our eyes open and I can assure you that we will inform you as soon as there is something to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, we continue then with Dani Saurymper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Dani Saurymper for Goldman Sachs. Two questions if I may. Just you mentioned Liquid Crystals inventory has increased. I just wondered how much was actually left in terms of stocking? And I know it's difficult because of the mixtures, not just the actual individual crystals themselves, but how much do you actually have left to sell through into customers?</p>
          <p>You also highlighted that there was high pricing pressure, which typically you've resisted through innovation. So, I'm just trying &#x2013; can you give us some context to what kind of pricing pressure you will see versus historically?</p>
          <p>And then with respect to Pharma, Elmar is it possible you could just comment on the fourth quarter gross margin for Merck Serono, if you adjust for the tremendous growth in royalties, I think there was a marked step-down in the gross margin in that fourth quarter. If you can just maybe give a little bit more color on why that was the case?</p>
          <p>And then very lastly related to royalty income, very strong growth there. So, I am just curious to know a) what it's linked to and b) when would you anticipate the royalty income stream is actually expiring as it relates to the patents on the products you're earning royalties, or how should we think about that going further forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, starting with the inventory question, as you know, we explained, the Liquid Crystal material, as a substance, is a very sophisticated piece of chemicals, so to synthesize this product, it takes 6 to 9 months, with up to 16 different chemical reactions, so your question is completely right, there is of course inventory on all kind of levels. They are on all kinds of level where you can store the product. And on the other hand, it also requires that we are flexible, if market and demand may pick up again, because then there was a long lead time until we can have new material from origin again available. So we are balancing between these two elements actually, with the curtailing of production, I think, we are on a good way to manage this for the time being. We have seen some increase in inventory level at the end of the year and depending on the further development of the business we will see how this develops. We are sure that for the time being, as you know we have a very, very small visibility on this business for 4 to 6 week, the measures we have decided will help to manage inventory. And as said, if there is change needed, we are prepared to take the necessary decisions.</p>
          <p>On the price pressure, we see a development towards an increased price pressure on all suppliers to the LCD industry in the course of the last year, especially in the course of the last quarter. It was Merck's strategy so far, that we always fight this price pressure by cutting production costs, which we did successfully in the past, and which we will continue to do, and by focusing on innovation, on technological advantage, customer proximity. And this will definitely continue. We will not lead price hikes, but we of course have to offer a competitive offer to our customers, including performance and price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the OR in Merck Serono, the difference explains as follows: we had a somewhat smaller gross margin, so we grew 14, gross margin 11 which had to do with some adjustments in cost of goods, which were done in the last quarter. The trend of the gross margin. we'll not maintain this. so don't worry about this. We increased our R&amp;D spending by around 80 million in the last quarter, which I already explained was due to some closing down of projects, but more importantly some investments of new studies launched, but also accelerating of ongoing Phase III trials. Because we were somewhat behind in our recruitment, and we had a big effort on the higher priority projects to push them along.</p>
          <p>We had also higher marketing and sales expenditure, in terms &#x2013; mainly marketing expenditure. In preparation of Kuvan, we had the big physician meetings going on. We prepare Erbitux launches, Japan, we went onstream, so there are quite a few costs which we took in the first quarter. And this was by definition, so it was not that this is a surprise to us, it was really what we wanted to do.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D came a little bit higher in than we wanted, but as you see, we are currently having a great success in our pipeline, and certainly I don't want to slow down the R&amp;D momentum only to come in just on batches so we didn't do this. Regarding the royalty, as you know, we have four products on which we get royalty which is Avonex, Enbrel, Humira and Puregon from Schering-Plough <mark type="inaudible" /> and they expire between 2009 and 2017, so in this area we see the expiry of those royalty streams.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And then we continue with Holger Blum, Deutsche.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Holger Blum, Deutsche Bank. Just two quick questions, one follow-up on the Liquid Crystal statement on price, historically you always said you have 5 to 10% price erosion in the business, does it mean now for '09, we should a high &#x2013; expect a higher number than that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on pharma, it's obvious that for Liquid Crystals it's tough to provide a guidance in this macro outlook, but for pharma you should have your key drivers very much under control, as we are not so sensitive to the cycle though.  And what should we think there, in terms of margins from pro bono, for instance in the upcoming year. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first with the price pressure on Liquid Crystals, as pointed out, price pressure has increased in industry, but it's too early to say, with our limited visibility, what the price impact will mean, with respect to duration, and how it will develop on the near and mid term.</p>

          <p>So we continue with Andrew Baum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Andrew Baum from Morgan Stanley. Three questions, please. Firstly, your balance sheet, this is aimed towards Dr. Kley.  Your balance sheet gives you significant flexibility to building your business strategically. I don't expect you to tell us what targets you are looking at, but perhaps you could give us a sense of prioritization, whether on the pharma side or the chemicals side, on which geography you will be looking to allocate capital in first.</p>
          <p>Second question, for Dr. Reckmann, Juxto is obviously and others are building out capacity in this space will have plans too, perhaps you could outline what you know from competitive intelligence as to their CapEx build, and have they put that on hold given the current economic environment?  And final question for Dr. Schnee, I guess two parts, number one, the announcement that Erbitux production in Vevey is going be in 2012 is somewhat later than I anticipated, at least.  Has there been slippage there and if so why, and then secondly are the patients in CLARITY still on drug, so was there an active follow-up or have all patients been taken off drug now the trial has stopped? Thank you.</p>

          <p>If we talk about the flexibility that is being given by our balance sheet, then the prime question of course arises with regard to acquisitions but there is more to it, I mean there is CapEx, there is investment in R&amp;D, there is licensing deals. So, if we talk about capital expenditure, we don't prioritize this according to regions, we prioritize this according to projects, and they may rise in certain regions in one period and in other regions in others.</p>
          <p>I think Karl-Ludwig Kley has already outlined where our strategic focus lies with growing for the future and expanding our business. And the other part is the factory that we already mentioned. The investment R&amp;D is also dependent on our R&amp;D centers. So, I think the real question relates to licensing and acquisitions, and that is different from the divisions and also from regions because, as we have said before we are looking in the Merck Serono area more for licensing deals.  And the earlier, the more convenient it is because we think that we have enough to digest in the rest of our business.</p>
          <p>We have excluded fully pledged companies with the exception of regional strengthening and the focus there is the U.S. So, we have said we are willing to acquire companies in the U.S. to strengthen the local U.S. business. As far as pharma is concerned, we have been outlining that we like to look for a sizable acquisition which diminishes the dependency from Liquid Crystals, that is chemicals, sorry I said Pharma, chemicals I meant.  That is a program since quite some time and the balance sheet has been strong for years. So, there is nothing new that now comes to our mind.</p>
          <p>Whether these are the right times to go ahead with it is another question that can be answered in different directions.  It's certainly not correct that if companies are now in dire straits and in difficulties, that these are by definition good companies. They are, maybe companies with a low share price, but that doesn't mean that they are good companies and one thing you can take for granted, we will only be looking for good companies and not for companies that are cheap for reason of the market and may be also for other reasons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with respect to &#x2013; just to let you know, this is a private company, we have access to the same information as you have, therefore we are &#x2013; we can't give anymore detailed insight in this. Obviously, as the substantial decline in demand for Liquid Crystal, which we experience now makes &#x2013; gives some room for increasing of manufacturing volume for all three competitors in this market no doubt.   And we all hope that the upswing which on long-term will happen of course, there's still the predictions that on long-term the LC area will grow in a double-digit range.  That this will happen at some point of time, but for the time being, we don't know whether this will be in four months, six months, twelve months. So the visibility is simply not there, neither at our side as supplier and I would also guess to say not on the side of the LCD manufacturer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding our manufacturing site in Burbank, 2012 onstream means sellable product was all the time tough. We took a small delay because we are fighting some greens successfully. Because they didn't understand how actually biotech manufacturing works, but at the end, they were congratulating us and everybody is happy and we will catch up this two or three months. We will finish by 2010 construction and you know we've the batch we have to get the machinery going which takes quite some time.  But you will be pleased to hear that we already successfully manufacture Erbitux on the site in a 5,000 liter vessel which allows us also to start to talk with regulatory authorities and maybe gain sometime, but it's just may be, I think.  And you had a second question I think which I forgot...</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Its <mark type="inaudible" /> from Merrill Lynch, thanks, Just a couple of questions &#x2013; couple on Liquid Crystals.  I don't know whether you comment on capacity utilization where you've brought -- I know you talked about taking some out &#x2013; 50%, 70% and 90% any color you could give would be helpful there.  And just a follow-up on the acquisition's, does your uncertainty on Liquid Crystal's outlook affect your willingness to do deals in the near-term at all.  And then a couple on the pharma side on Cladribine, now that you have the data.  And just wondered if you could give us some color on how you view positioning versus Rebif and whether you plan on filing both doses.  And then just wondered if you could give us some early feedback on any impact you're seeing at all to Rebif from the Extavia launch, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question was on capacity cuts, so what we are &#x2013; have decided so far it's in the range of 20 to 25%, and second question I think Michael has already commented.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Cladribine, no, I'm not telling you the positioning how it could look like because we don't want that Novartis knows this, but one thing there is space for both drugs. So, regarding the &#x2013; what was that Erbitux -- I forgot the name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Extavia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Extavia, that was my handwriting, it looks very similar to  Erbitux. So Extavia is launched currently in Germany and Denmark, as I understand.  And to my great surprise Novartis is behaving like Sandoz giving 25% discounts on the very same bio-sharing product, which I do not understand how we can do this, but maybe I learn this at one point. So far we have not seen its impact, but it's too short.  I think we have an excellent service as already mentioned around our drug, Rebif is a fabulous product and I expect that our people will be in a position to limit the possible damage very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So can we then move over to Jeff Holter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jeff Holter from Jefferies. Just because we don't have the guidance this year, in the Chemicals division, can you give us a bit more of a feel of the mix of fixed and variable costs because obviously as volumes may move around a lot in this top line that will be quite useful as a guide for forecasting margins? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If this relates to Liquid Crystals which I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Both divisions individually speaking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then for Liquid Crystals because of this special competitive situation we will not give any more information on this for the time. And on PLS, I think we have to differentiate between the different products, mostly interesting will be the pigment area and they are, I think we have a classical chemical differentiation between the shares between fixed and variable costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Then we may continue, I think that must be the lady from Redburn, so I am right, Anita.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Anita Vasu from Redburn Partners, just a quick question on the currency impact that you saw for Liquid Crystals, can you kind of provide sort of just a split of the currencies that you invoice in this division just so that we can figure out how that margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the invoice always in the local currency except Korea, so we invoice Japan in Japanese Yen and Taiwan in Taiwanese dollar.  In Korea it's different because we invoice to the customer in dollar, the company is in one and we invoice in dollar to the company. So it's a pretty complicated and complex picture there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So can we then continue here in the first row please &#x2013; young guy sitting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi thanks, Richard Foster from JPMorgan, just a couple of questions; the first on &#x2013; going back to Liquid Crystals, I just wondered whether you could &#x2013; you've mentioned that you would be looking to adjust your cost structure, is this mainly the COGS that you can adjust or is there any scope to cut SG&amp;A, and how quickly could you cut SG&amp;A in the Liquid Crystals business. Secondly on Raptiva, I wondered whether there was any more color you could give us on the discussions that you are having with the European regulators, obviously you've taken a very conservative approach to write it down but any further color you could give us there would be very good. And then finally, on cladribine, I was just &#x2013; I think you mentioned that you weren't seeing a dose response with the product, so I'm just wondering why in the trials you chose to use two doses of cladribine and whether the ongoing trials continue to use both those doses, thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adjustment of costs is mainly focused on COGS. If you look at the figures, you see that SG&amp;A is very small figure, it's about 7% and, let's say, the proximity to our customers and all this added value which we bring is an essential part to bring innovation and to avoid some of this price pressure to our business, therefore there is no room for big cuts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Raptiva, I cannot, because we are currently in discussions with them; the FDA is discussing with Genentech, and we really don't know in which direction it goes. Of course there are alternative treatments but Raptiva has also some very good sides and the side defects we have now seen three from 47,000 patients treated and they are not so marked, though all of them have been in three &#x2013; in patients who used the drug more than three years, so maybe there is something with length and you can imagine many things but at the moment I can't give you more around it.</p>
          <p>Regarding cladribine, why did we use two doses, cladribine the active substance has a very short half-life, it's eight hours, and the two doses actually distinguish itself on the duration of the treatment which we use in the year to make sure that you deplete as much to get the effect and that's the reason I have used two doses, now of course there will be more analysis done on the secondary endpoints, on the tertiary endpoints and of course maybe there comes something out, at the moment we haven't seen this on the headline results but I think there is absolutely no doubt that we have the right doses because the convenience for the patient is absolutely fabulous. So, we have to get late in Feb the whole presentation and dig really into the data and maybe we can come to a conclusion, the patients carry on with both doses, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So any additional question here, Mr. Wendorff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so again on chemicals, net working capital, were there inventory write downs in Q4 and if not do you expect some in Q1 and another question do you expect a positive effect due to increasing net working capital for the free cash flow in 2009. And then another question on chemicals, in some of the Liquid Crystal Display <mark type="inaudible" /> gave the guidance and said I expect the booking out of the crisis for the display and panel prices in Q2 and even increase in the second half of this year and do you expect the same, or is there a time lag effect for Liquid Crystals for around half a year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah that's for Mike, that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question was inventory write-offs in Q4 in Chemicals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was no &#x2013; no special significant inventory write-off in Q4; Q1 it will depend, till then we are already in this low visibility so we will see and regarding the market development I think there is some expectation from &#x2013; from customers, some from the market research institutes but this is &#x2013; it's very much speculation, so we cannot comment on this. Of course we would hope that they are right but it's just really speculation and the normal history shows that there is some slight upswing, if you have the cyclic downturns but there is of course a question when and how much and so on, so our expectation is that the sales and margins are staying under some pressure for some time going forward...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That is, as we explained sometimes to you anyway with the Liquid Crystal business, so there was &#x2013; every different product has a different mixture and therefore you don't have a sharp decline from one day to the other, but if there was a new product at the manufacturer side then of course there's a new deal and negotiation for mixture and then that defines how the speed and kinetics of this price adjustment are in both directions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So now we continue with Mr. Wendorff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank, two questions if I may. Firstly regarding Rebif, and you experienced quite strong growth there in 2008 in the U.S. Particularly, as far I understood it's quite an important contribution also from price increases, I was wondering if you could split out that between volume and price and how your situation &#x2013; how do you see the situation regarding pricing there in 2009 and secondly regarding currency hedging, if you could elaborate a bit about the strategy there for 2009 against which currencies you intend to hedge, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding Rebif in the States, we had 21% growth, of which roughly 3% is volume growth, the rest is price. Regarding the price increase this year, we don't know, we haven't taken one into our budgeting, because I believe that might come pretty fast to an end, these quite sizeable price increases. If there is a possibility and our competitors go, then of course we should take as long as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you would not be the active part in that this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this &#x2013; we have to see what the industry does, I mean, I think we have to see how it develops.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The currency hedging question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The currency hedging hasn't changed. We have these two areas, one is the translation and the other is the transaction area, as to the transaction area, when we have liabilities trade or receivables we show that under other operating expenses as a currency movement. If we have a movement in financial liabilities we show it under the financial result. It is very difficult to hedge against translation because that is just the calculation according to currency of our balance sheet or P&amp;L but we try to hedge with a &#x2013; where we have visibility or continuous flow and expect this continuous flow we try to hedge our turnover, the expected cash flow from turnover. We take a safety margin which allows fluctuations, either from time or from economy, and the resulting hedges we report also under other operating expenses because we can't match it with the bottom line because there is not a strict congruent situation.</p>
          <p>In situations like we had in the last quarter, when we have a rapid decline of turnover, these hedges may go into the void, so if we hedge, say, 60% of the expected turnover and we have a decline of 50% then 10% goes into the void when we have a hedge where there is no flow from turnover and this we should &#x2013; would bring them down to the financial result.</p>
          <p>That is one of the reasons why the financial results suffered more than one would expect in the last quarter. The hedges that we have are typically, for the turnover, typically up to 18 months, sometimes two years, that depends. That depends on how comfortable we feel with the expected turnover and with the expected currency development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So we then stay in the Frankfurt area and continue with Mr. Kraus from DZ Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Elmar Kraus from the DZ Bank, I have a couple of questions to Mike, &#x2013; Elmar Schnee, sorry. The first will deal with Raptiva, so you've taken the approach of a complete write-down, so would you advise us to the same with our models, and what &#x2013; as I understand it this is a therapeutic area where you would like to stay so what are your plans with everything comes to worst and you have to take Raptiva off, is there a replacement actually online.</p>
          <p>And then it's another question on Erbitux, you mentioned that you already succeeded in a 5000 beta-fomenter at your new production site, which obviously is a very good thing in that short time but, as I understand the final fermenters should be roughly four times the size or even five times the size, so this will then make additional discussions necessary and how is your imagination of the timeframe for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding what you take in your model, I have this to leave to you. If you have a conservative model, maybe you should, as we do with our conservative balance sheet. But of course we would like to keep it, as long as the drug is commercially feasible. Regarding the Erbitux, yes, we produce in 15,000-liter fomenters, finally, but the scale-up is the life of biotech because you start with half a liter and then you go up. We think that the scale-up will happen in the time line which was confirmed before as 2012 to be on the market, with commercial drug. What I'd be doing if &#x2013; forgot this to answer, if Raptiva worst comes to the worst, we do not have a successful product because it comes from Genentech, so we had some limited sales force structure, which we would have to change, but maybe we have a good chance if really this comes that we could put those on cladribine, which is not so far away from an indication point of view because there is an immunological component to it too, so. But we will cross this bridge when you have to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So as you would like to come to the end now, probably, what are the eminent questions probably which weren't addressed so far, anything else that we need to cover? So, probably just a final one here from Tim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Tim Race, UBS. Just a question on cladribine patent exclusivity, or actual exclusivity in your &#x2013; what makes you confident that you will get 10 years exclusivity and not just the one year for a new indication, and then maybe if you could just comment on the structure of the royalties to Tiva if it is launched and successful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>The structures of royalty you have to pay on cladribine if it's successful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If successful we are not disclosing the royalty, we haven't done it but it's a royalty in line with the state of the product when we licensed it, it was a Phase I product. Regarding the protection, we feel comfortable with the protection which we have in Europe. So, I can't see why we not should be comfortable.</p>

Thank you very much to everyone who came here to Darmstadt, I think we have some more opportunities to discuss this details in the near future. The next reporting date is the 27th of April when we report the first quarter 2009. This will be then again done in a conference call meanwhile if you have any question, our team is more than happy to provide you any necessary information. Thank you very much again for being here in Darmstadt. Take care, all the best and hope to see you soon. Bye-bye.</p>
