        <plist>
          <p>Good day and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Conference. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Alfv&#xE9;n. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good day and welcome to this result presentation. We will start with a presentation followed by a Q&amp;A. So today, we have the Group President and Group CEO, Mr. Christian Clausen; Group CFO, Mr. Fredrik Rystedt; and Group Chief Risk Officer, Mr. Ari Kaperi. So, I will leave it over to Mr. Christian Clausen, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Welcome, everyone. I will give an opening remark and note that we have two main messages today that we have a very strong business momentum which continues, which is encouraging because it shows that we also have a very high earnings power, and we have a lot of good progress in our change agenda where we're building the future bank business model.</p>
          <p>On the earnings power, we have the highest ever Q1 income and profit, some revenue growth and a lot of new customers, very stable cost development, and then an ROE of 11.7% and a strengthened Core Tier 1 ratio at 11.6%. So 11.7% on 11.6% is not a bad ratio.</p>
          <p>On the future bank business model, we are doing a major effort. We have approximately 100 projects, which is changing products, processes, advise tools, more or less everything. And we are improving in order to be more efficient on capital, liquidity, funding and cost. The target is, of course, to produce a strong bank with a good earnings power also after the new regulation has now been, and of course also to mitigate the effect from our customers on the new regulation.</p>
          <p>Our business model is based on relationship strategy. And it's very clear from the next slide, that's a very strong relationship. You can see income is up 35% since last five years and the number of relationship customers is up 42%. There is a very strong relationship and just underlines that building a stronger relationship to even more business with customers, attracting new customers is a very stable in low risk way of growing the bank.</p>
          <p>Now, Fredrik Rystedt dive more into the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. I will start from slide six. And as you can see, we had a nearly flat development of income with a maintained high level of net interest income. Same for net fees and commission and also a good result from our fair value, both in terms of comparison to last year and also the fourth quarter costs were close to being flat and adjusting for FX at flat or below.</p>
          <p>Loan losses is slightly lower at 26 basis points in comparison to the fourth quarter. And as you can see, risk-adjusted profit up and net profit up on a full year basis, and slightly down in comparison to fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So if I start on slide seven with the net interest income, it has been stable. And of course, the main parameters there in the first quarter has been lowering interest of rates and therefore falling deposit margins and to large degree compensated by lending margins. Volume growth has been fairly low and we have a slightly higher funding cost than we had in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide eight, you can see the financial impact of this. So the limited growth we've seen both on a household and in the corporate side. You can see also it contributes with the positive note of &#x20AC;9 million. But you can also see the very significant impact of lower interest rates in deposits. And there are couple of different parameters there. The first one is relating to just interest rates going down.</p>
          <p>And the second thing is that at these very low interest rate levels, our ability to lower interest rates on savings accounts is, of course, also limited in contributing to a fairly high number for the quarter of &#x20AC;69 million. And of course, competition remains fierce at least in the couple of our markets. As you can see, funding costs have increased by &#x20AC;14 million and the other line there on slide eight relates to mainly the day count effects of &#x20AC;50 million.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the totality, as you can, see we're quite pleased to see on slide nine that we have maintained a blended margin. So the all the deposit income and all the lending income at more or less the same level as we had in Q1 2011, thereby compensating for much lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>Lending volumes, as I said, on slide 10, up approximately 0.5% and equally low, you can say, growth levels in both household and corporates. The year-on-year, of course, we had a reasonable growth level in 2011, thereby contributing to approximately 6%. Net commission income at high levels. We have a good trend in savings commissions and we have good performance in general. So if you look at assets under management, picked up with approximately &#x20AC;10 billion to the highest level ever and inflow of &#x20AC;1.2 billion contributed from most parts of our asset management.</p>
          <p>A little lower on the back of lower general lending levels. We have lower lending and card commission. And just to also remind you, we have a cost for the new deposit guarantee funds system in Denmark of this quarter of approximately &#x20AC;6 million.</p>
          <p>Net fair value, again, maintained at a stable level in the customer areas, slightly up. So we had a good customer demand also in this quarter and the trading environment was good. The reported revenues are lower in Life. But we also had, as some of you will remember, a one-time reversal in Q4. So if you compare or take that away, the income development also in Life is very stable.</p>
          <p>As you can see, our expense line is stable and as we have expected, a very strict control of expenses in general. Flat cost development and we had some one-off effects also in Q4. So the actual underlying cost level from Q4 to Q1 is slightly decreasing.</p>
          <p>You can see on slide 14, we maintained a high pace of &#x2013; in terms of capital generation, we increased by approximately 8% in the quarter. So the total capital generation over the last several years since 2006 has been over 9%. So of course, this gives us exactly the flexibility we want to achieve whatever capital levels that may be required from us as we go forward.</p>
          <p>We have continued to work with capital efficiency in the quarter and risk-weighted assets are reduced that you can see on slide 15 by 2%. Part of that is a benefit from a IRB approval relating to our international branch. It's contributing to a reduction in risk-weighted assets of &#x20AC;3.1 billion. The credit quality is stable, so not really having an impact on risk-weighted assets this quarter. And derivative exposure has come down and therefore also contributed positively.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of the risk-weighted assets development and, of course, the equity generation, we have continued to strengthen our balance sheet and we have now reached a Core Tier 1 of 11.6%, which is a full Basel II figure. Also, the funding has worked fine in the quarter. We have so far issued &#x20AC;11.5 billion. So we have kept a very high base in the first quarter of both senior unsecured and covered bonds. And we have maintained strong access to all funding instruments throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 is just a &#x2013; I just want to quickly outline the fact that we have now introduced in our reporting a distribution of our full funding cost to the business areas. So the purpose of the liquidity premia system we are now running is to, of course, align the interim pricing with the true cost that we have corresponding in liquidity. And of course, in a longer perspective, this will ensure that we have the correct customer pricing for each product and to each customer and we understand the profitability. The principles behind the system is a calculation at each contract or transaction level. And the key parameter in this is of course maturity. So now, we price the maturity of funds going into each product.</p>
          <p>We have reached a status where the model is more or less developed. We are, at this moment, working with several pilots in the group and we have distributed full liquidity premia cost to the business areas. You will find that in the line business area other in the report, so very limited or no funding cost left in group treasury, all distributed now to business areas. But not yet to countries and not yet to unit we unit. We will do that as we progress in 2013. Just to give you a little more money to it, approximately &#x20AC;90 million of liquidity premia or full funding cost above LIBOR in retail, approximately &#x20AC;55 million in wholesale.</p>
          <p>The liquidity buffer remains of high quality. We are LCR compliant for the group as a whole in the quarter. And we have slightly changed the compositions to a more high-grade liquidity buffer.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 20, we have a return of equity of 11.7%. And it's worth noting that if you look back from 2007 where we were at significantly higher levels, we were doing that at approximately CT1 ratio of 6.8% compared to the current level of 11.6%. So if you sort of translate that, we come close to 20% with comparable equity levels that we have at this point of time. So I think that concludes my comments. And I'll leave over to you, Ari, to talk about credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, Fredrik. Q1 loan losses where according to our expectations which is, of course, always good. And the level was 26 basis points excluding the Danish guarantee provision. It was 25, which is according to our average expected level over the business cycles.</p>
          <p>Still, we have a few areas, Denmark and Shipping, where the problems are not over yet. I thought it's also important to see that the development in those areas, they were not up. Actually, they were stable or down. And in other areas of the credit portfolio, <mark type="ph" /> CCs (00:11:57) remained very low level and in most of the areas, they came down. So all in all, the credit quality is very solid. And as Fredrik already mentioned, the rating migration was more or less stable.</p>
          <p>On the next page, you may wonder that why our impaired loans are, however, up. There was no drama in the development. So that in absolute terms, the impaired loans are up by roughly &#x20AC;500 million. There are two explanations. &#x20AC;300 million comes from Shipping where we <mark type="ph" /> impaired (00:12:30) just less than a handful of new customers with very low loan losses provision amount. And as you know, when we make even a small loan loss provision, that triggers the impairment of that old customer <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:47). Then, &#x20AC;200 million are coming from Denmark. Also there, most of the increase is coming from a limited number of medium-sized corporate customers, whereas in other areas, the development was stable. The factor of these small loan losses in Shipping which impaired were relatively high customer exposures is also explaining this overall decrease in our provision ratio at the group level.</p>
          <p>Next page, you see this country split as it &#x2013; more or less no losses in three out of four Nordic countries. I mean, Denmark, the situation is very stable.</p>
          <p>On the next page, you see these net impaired loans. And as I said, the increase was visible only in Denmark because of these few medium-sized corporate customers as well as some agricultural customers. You can also see in this page that actually now we have harmonized the definition of impaired loans in all countries and we have restated the information as from beginning of Q1 last year. So it has not changed the development in the countries, but it has then influenced the level of impaired loans in various countries. In Finland, it was down, whereas in Denmark and Sweden, it was up. But now, they are comparable.</p>
          <p>Page 25, again, we are showing this split in Denmark between household and corporate losses. As you can see, the good news is that household losses in Denmark were down because, of course, of positive information. Whereas as I mentioned already, there were a few medium-sized corporate customers with new loan losses which give this volatility into corporate losses.</p>
          <p>And finally, this following page you see the story of Shipping. Also in Shipping, the losses were down. But of course, they are still at a relatively high level. The &#x20AC;60 million is coming from more or less three components. There's a few small new loan losses which I mentioned that is roughly &#x20AC;20 million out of the &#x20AC;60 million. There's some old corporate customers where we have taken down the collateral values further. And then it's some quality provisions we <mark type="ph" /> baked (00:15:20) in the first quarter. And then you see in Shipping this quite big increase in impaired loans, but that is coming from two, three customers.</p>
          <p>So that ends the credit quality section. Back to Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I will give a few comments as to our work on implementing the future business model. Of course, it's all about ensuring that we can get more efficient. An important part is the way to service our customers. It has a lot to do with product innovation and focus on our advisory concept, our relation <mark type="ph" /> finances (00:15:56) strategy. And to mitigate the impact of customers from new regulation.</p>
          <p>Of course, the driver is very much on the cost efficiency and capital efficiency. We run a lot of products and I'd like to give a bit more flavor to what we are doing. The essential part of the strategy is, of course, our relationship strategy. And that is very much carried out by changing our distribution strategy simply following the customers' behavior. So, we work to build more advisory branches or convert existing branches into advisory branches, where we have no service but only advise. And then have the customers to service themselves much more on the services and transactions on the mobile and Internet solutions.</p>
          <p>We'll see on the next slide, which we also develop our presence in the corporate area, very much in terms of using the capital market for long-term funding for the corporate customers with a new regulation as the costs were expensive for the long-term, risky, lending on the balance sheet. And therefore, this is of course something which can very much be done under capital markets. And we can show clearly that we lead the league tables, the current league table of lead manager on bond issues where we're also leading, which is very important.</p>
          <p>This is a way to ensure that we can help the customers when they need to go to the capital market. And that is the case. They should go for their long-term lending. Of course, we'll provide the short-term and the bridge financing and all sort of things. But the long-term lending is part of the capital market going forward.</p>
          <p>The customer behavior supports our distribution journey. It's very obvious that the relationship strategy goes hand in hand with new customer behavior. So the customers do less manual transactions. They use the net bank much more. And most importantly, they start to use the mobile banking a lot. And we have now toppled the number of mobile banking users which, on a daily basis, uses their mobile to do banking transactions and all sort of things.</p>
          <p>And this is very important because with this behavioral change, we can change our branch network in a way that has come a long way. We are taking down the number of branches with cash and we're increasing the advisory part of our staff significantly. And that we do by changing the network. So we have considerably changed it only in two years. We have half of the network now doing advisory business only. We have no transactions in the branch. We have some 200 service branches which only do service.</p>
          <p>Typically, we have one or two service branches in the major cities where we can service the customers that the rest of the branches are mainly advisory branches where the customers go and they get their price. And then they do their transactions on the net. We still have a third of the branches as community branches which do both. But this will be refined even more going forward.</p>
          <p>We are, at the same time, taking down the number of branches considerably. So we expect by 2013 to be down with some 200 branches. This is a considerable efficiency drive. An interesting thing about this is the customer satisfaction goes up. The customers like to go into our advisory branches and get advice and to service branches to get service, much more <mark type="ph" /> dedicated (00:19:28). Our employee satisfaction also goes up because the employees know exactly what they are supposed to do and to be trained to do that.</p>
          <p>We are accordingly taking out cost and we are reducing the number. If these were ahead of plans, we have taken down 1,600, 4%, since the mid of last year and we have the plan to reduce it by 6% by the end of 2012. We are continuing also in Poland to build the relationships for banking approach. And therefore, we have taken out some branches which only did mortgage selling and concentrated in full relationship branches and taken down the staff as well also to make that relation more efficient.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we're taking our cost in a large number of areas. It's very much about the distribution network, as I mentioned. The code word is cost to serve, to lower that. We're optimizing a lot of the value chains where we're streamlining them, so it's easier to deliver an excellent service or product to our customer and with less cost. We are also refining the product processes. We are building new products which are typically light on capital consumption and funding. But we're also doing them in a more efficient way.</p>
          <p>Then, we are optimizing some unit costs, not leased premises and other areas where we have concentrated people, moving outside the business center and things like that. We are putting some of the manual processes into our operation center in Poland which is very efficient and cheap. And we're addressing some of the issues on our IT area which is also important. All in all, this produces a lot of efficiency, and a lot of metrics show this increase in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:21:07) customers per FTE and so on.</p>
          <p>On the capital side, it's very much about being more efficient in the way we use our capital and thereby to reduce the risk-weighted assets in a lot of process and projects. In the quarter, we can see that the credit quality actually went up. Well, actually, they're up a bit more than the slide shows on household and corporates. But then, we had a negative migration in institutional counterparty business because a lot of the financial institutions were downgraded in the quarter as you know. So underlying, we have an improvement on the household and corporate side which is bigger.</p>
          <p>The growth is slightly positive and then the derivative book goes down. So the growth comes out with a negative RWA number. And then the RWA optimization we're doing is we're moving the international branches to foundation internal rate increase was all the plans which are taking down the RWAs.</p>
          <p>But on top of that, this is an area where we run quite a lot of projects. And three important rollouts is in progress, advance internal rating base in the corporate portfolio, a foundation for Baltics, and then the internal market models for counterparty risk issue. All we know, it's very important now in Q1 will past the three months in completion and counterparty is an important area where we obviously see a lot of relief coming from our model.</p>
          <p>On top of that, a lot of things are happening. We are reclassification some of the SME segments to reduce our rate consumption. We are improving the collaterals and collateral model in various units including Luxembourg. We are started already in March including the most of our derivatives business on the central counterparty clearing and we are focusing on capital Life products. And as I said, we are strengthening our capability of using the capital market for providing corporate credit.</p>
          <p>So the conclusion is the same as the beginning. Two main messages, very high earnings power despite a difficult quarter with low interest rates and low growth. We have managed to increase our revenues and produced the highest Q1 profit we have ever seen. At the same time as we are progressing well on the change agenda. And I think it's encouraging to see that we can do both at the same time, keeping the focus on the customers and the momentum and at the same time changing all these projects at a fairly high speed.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, operator, with this, we would like to open up the conference for a question-and-answer session, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you very much. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will come to our first question which will be from Omar Keenan from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just three short questions, if I can. Just firstly on the Norway mortgage margins, can you talk about what you've seen in terms of the very positive developments there? It seems to have accounted for a large chunk of your lending margin increase.</p>
          <p>And then just secondly on the brokerage fees, which were quite a bit stronger and you showed the slides on where you got to on the league tables. Can you comment on that result a little bit more? And then just lastly on the Shipping. What proportion of Nordea Shipping lending was done in the 2007, 2008 in terms of the loan book today? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Maybe I'll just start with the mortgage margins. It was a good quarter in terms of mortgage margin. I think the Norwegian market has been the lowest, I think, for us. It's fair to say, historically at least, in terms of mortgage margins. And we have strived to increase that and we have succeeded to a large degree in the quarter. There is a limited lag effect also contributing to the good margin.</p>
          <p>Having said that, of course, the mortgage lending in Norway in totality to the group as a whole, of course, is quite small. So it's not, as you put it, the main contributor. There are many other areas contributing. So the positive margin development is largely coming from other sources, particularly Norway contributed positively.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of the brokerage fees, of course, this is a fairly volatile result. So it depends on the closure of transactions, et cetera. And also there, as Christian alluded to before, we had a good run in putting up all parts of the brokerage and we have increased in most parts over several years. So again, this was an exceptionally good quarter for us. But generally, the trend is quite clear. Shipping, Ari?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then your shipping question. It's impossible to say exactly that what is your share of the portfolio we build in 2007, 2008 in the current Shipping portfolio. But we have, for the very long time at that type of charge again in Shipping that we are not, let's say, growing our lending portfolio. We have that type of charges that we are supporting our Shipping customers to do, let's say, then to get financing from the market, from the banks, from the capital market. Then we arrange loans and then we keep only limited part in our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So that, yes, there was this dividend growth in those years in our Shipping lending. But it was anything excessive. So that it was very well controlled. When I take a look on those customers who are today in problems, I can't make any kind of conclusion that they are exactly those customers which we took in in 2007, 2008. So that there is not that type of correlation existing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Would it be possible just to, I guess, give a ballpark figure of what the vintage of 2007 to 2008 lending is in the Shipping book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to give now any figure because I can, of course, give you a little bit more information over the phone if that is then very important to you. But on top off my head, I would not say anything at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take now our next question from Matti Ahokas from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Matti Ahokas from Handelsbanken. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, as Fredrik pointed out that now the lower rates are actually having a negative impact on the margins on the savings account as well. Was this is a surprise and should we interpret this that the sensitivity towards lower interest rates within the group has actually increased?</p>
          <p>And the second question is regarding, there was a quote today by Michael Rasmussen in the Danish newswire is that he believes that the impairments in Denmark. I'm talking about a loan loss provision specifically have picked and now are trending down. Should we see this as guidance and I'd like to hear your other thoughts about the statement? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me start with the sensitivity. I think it's fair to say that it's approximately &#x20AC;550 million as it has been before. So there is no real change. Having said that, however, it's not fully symmetric on the upside and downside. And the reason is, of course, as I alluded to that we cannot lower the interest rate more than zero basically on same accounts. So when you have very, very low interest rates, we have this sort of one-time, this kind of effect. So yes, in that sense, it's a little higher on the downside than it is on the upside at these prevailing levels.</p>
          <p>But the other reason which is contributing with approximately &#x20AC;10 million or so is fierce competition, you can say in general. So we will still, just to give you an indication, have the same kind of interest rate sensitivity as we've had before.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then the impaired in Denmark or let's say credit risk in Denmark, whether or not it has been, I think that how we guided in the last quarter, Q4, was that we see that in Denmark, we see for the time being, for the next quarters is that we'll have these level of loan losses. But we also said that it's difficult to see any reason to believe that the loan losses would go up from those levels we saw in Q4.</p>
          <p>Now, what we saw in Q1 was very much according to that type of, let's say, assumption. And I tend to believe that the same as Michael had said, so that perhaps still it's very unlikely that there would be a rapid increase in terms of loan losses. Whether or not that is visible in exactly in the level of impaired loans remains to be seen because there's a volatility in that loan. Just to measure, one day measuring in the end of the quarter what is the level. But I definitely I agree with Michael's assessment in terms of credit risk situation in Denmark.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. <mark type="ph" /> Geoff Dawes (00:32:14) here from SocGen. Thank you very much for the call. I've got two relatively quick questions. The first is in Denmark and the Shipping book. And from your comments that you just made, it sounds like you feel more comfortable with that book now than you did at the end of last quarter. Can you just confirm whether that is true and also whether you feel the same way about the Shipping portfolio?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the cost line. Should we consider flat costs to be the best case here? I mean, from what you say about competition and from what we can see about the rates environment, it's going to be a struggle to get revenues to go higher. And if that's the case, can you do any more on the cost line to ensure you get some positive revenue draws for the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Geoff (00:32:57), I'll start from Denmark and Shipping. Yes, I think that we are still sticking to this guidance we gave in Q4 that relates also to Shipping. So that, yes, the level of losses will be higher than average during the second half. But yes, we do some positive signals also in the shipping market. So that this over capacity size of the order books, it's little by little coming down.</p>
          <p>Freight rates, they are below in many of the segments. There is no improvement on that area. But at least, there seem to be some light in the tunnel, specific to what's the end of this year and perhaps even more to 2013. So that also there, I would say, that it's unlikely to see that we see a high increase in any of the risk indicators in Shipping. But we must remember that the problems are not over yet. There are some weak-ish customers and we expect them to see at least that also the short future this level to be maintained more or less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the cost line I'd like to say that this was part of our new normal plan as the strategy for the coming years. But we started out by taking out a number of people, 2,000 people, 6% of the staff. We're reducing costs. And then the idea is that we will continue to reduce costs. But we also have an investment program ongoing in the new normal as I described. We have 100 projects ongoing which will increase our capital efficiency, our funding efficiency. We're rebuilding products and process and all these things. So we think it's a much better way to profitability to actually do all these changes built in the future business model, at the same time as we continuously take out costs.</p>
          <p>So we don't take cost out by cutting cost. We take out by making processes more efficient. So after we have reduced the staff of this amount we have mentioned, 6% until end of the 2012, then we will continue to reduce. But that will be in sort of normal process. We have more than 1,000 people per year going for retirement and some hundreds of those will most likely be reduced as staff reduction. But part of this efficiency drive and a very important part of efficiency drive is the capital efficiency as I mentioned. And this is a very important part to profitability.</p>
          <p>So I think we &#x2013; it's hardly likely we'll increase or the plan is we'll increase ROE from both sources. Revenues, of course, I cannot comment anything more than you know that it relies a lot on the economic environment and interest rate level. But in general, as you can see, we have a re-price in the lending program. I think that movement will continue. So yes, of course, you can always do more on cost. But it's much better strength to create shareholder value by running the big changes and then building the new business model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Maybe if I can just come back to that Shipping question and ask it in a different way. You've seen revenues come down quarter-on-quarter, which is taking you quite close to breakeven. Are there any scenarios in that book that you envisaged a loss for that division over the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't foresee that we would have a risk of starting to make <mark type="indiscernible" /> <mark type="ph" /> great (00:36:33) figures in Shipping. Of course, for the recent relatively shorter time period, but nevertheless...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...nevertheless underlying business is sound and profitable. And actually, the reason for decreasing income in Q1 was not so much coming from the net interest income. It was coming from the somewhat lower net fees and commissions, because there was not so much <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:37:05) in the market, not so many new deals coming in the market. And of course, that is also going to be changed as soon as the market is little bit harder and better. So that you could see that we would start to record losses in our Shipping franchise. We have not done it and it's difficult to say that we would start to do it.</p>
          <p>There is still a good trend of increasing credit margins, because it's obvious that the credit risk in that business has gone up. And of course we, as other banks, we are pricing that risk or breaking that up. So the great margins are still increasing.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from Claire Kane from RBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have a quick question on your funding strategy. I know it's in the quarter that you did a lot of net issuance of long-term debt, but reduced considerably your CP and CD funding, I think about almost 30% on the quarter. And I was just wondering, is that part of your strategy to be NSFR compliant or do you just &#x2013; so you don't need that funding or there's less of a demand for that funding of yours?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on capital, can you give us an update on your Basel III quarter one pro forma? What reliance you have on further mitigation, what IRB approval you are still outstanding? And what your target is longer term, because I noticed your 15% ROE target is based on 11% Core Tier 1. And clearly, the minimum has now have been set at 12% and if you do think that 12% will come in. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me start with the short-term funding. What we did in the fourth quarter, in the turbulent times, we actually increased the short-term funding quite considerably up to a maximum of roughly &#x20AC;55 billion at that time. And we put a lot of deposit with the Fed and ECB over the year end. So we had a very, very strong funding situation, and this is liquidity surplus and we have taken that down in the quarter. So that's the sole explanation.</p>
          <p>So you can say the redemption have been there all along. We have issued a little bit more than the redemption in the long-term funding. But the reason for the decline in the short-term funding has to do with simply reduction of Fed and ECB funds. And LCR &#x2013; whereas NSFR, was not at all the reason. LCR, we are compliant on a group level, not for all currencies, but on a group level. And we are still compliant on that figure.</p>
          <p>Talking about the Basel III pro forma, we have alluded to it also previously that we will have an impact of approximately 100 basis points. And we have also stated that the activities that Christian was alluding to before in terms of the IMM, advanced IRB, the foundation IRB in both the Baltics and in the international branches. That would basically take out each other. So, that's still our assumption. We are still having the same estimate and we have thereby no real further information relating to the outcome of the advanced IRB approval.</p>
          <p>We have, however, in the quarter, as you've seen now, taken the benefit of the foundation IRB in the international branches. So again, the estimates that we made last October in the Capital Markets Day are still valid. As to the timing of the advanced IRB, we have estimated that it should be within this year. But again, this is of course not our task. We have submitted our application for advanced IRB about a year ago and it's still in progress and we cannot give you a firm end timetable at this stage. But it should be within this year or possibly first quarter of next.</p>
          <p>Long-term target, I think you suggested again, I think it's fair to say that we don't, of course, really know the final target yet. There're still a lot of ongoing discussions within the European community. And how this will end up is, of course, not fully known to us. We have seen the statements by the Swedish FSA and the Central Bank and government of the 12% that you refer to. And of course, we will basically comply with whatever rules that will apply for us. And I would just like you to think of or draw your attention to the slide I showed previously in terms of capital generation. We are generating and we're continuing to generate a lot of capital. So we, of course, therefore have the flexibility to reach whatever capital requirement that may be put on our bank.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will take now our next question from Fridtjof Berents from Arctic Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. If I could return to that slide you referred to also when it came to reduction of RWA in the quarter. If you look forward with an expected loan growth potentially around 4% to 5% and so on, how would you see your RWA grow in that respect? Do you have any more room for maneuvering with the RB models and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the question was that &#x2013; once again can you repeat it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question was whether the approvals would give us more room to maneuver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think you can say that of course it will. But as Fredrik just alluded to, I mean, there are some uncertainties of the full effect when they are fully implemented and we have all the improvements in place that we have these three major rollouts and a number of the other projects going. So we'll have some RWA flexibility. And we also expect a certain loan growth. Right now it's very subdued and it will probably stay pretty low this year. But we have pretty good flexibility in all the ongoing projects and the fact that we generate all the capital product management.</p>
          <p>So I don't think we are very worried about that. Our main drive is to be more efficient, I mean to do the same business with less RWAs by creating more, playing it more safe, less risk, by making sure that we have the right modeling of the risk and making sure that we clean up all the waste around in the corners where we had some commitments which are not used and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>So to run this business in a low RWA, that's our clear target all together at reducing risk. Exactly the numbers are difficult because they're at the stage where we have used and how we implement the models and how they count and so on. But then again, the pipeline is pretty long. So all in all, it's not a major concern. Our big drive is to create more efficiency in the way we spend the RWAs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I just may follow-up, are there any new areas where you will introduce IRB over the next quarter that will potentially have a similar impact on RWA or are you now fully approved on all portfolios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we alluded to you before, there are several model issues, both the IMM, which will hopefully be approved this year. Of course, that will have hopefully a positively mitigating impact on the CVA risk of Basel III and the advanced IRB. And we also have the Baltics which is a much smaller issue. But in total, all of these were estimated to produce approximately the same impact as the Basel III.</p>
          <p>So the timing, as I alluded to before, is sometime during this year hopefully for all of those. And maybe we will have a postponement of the advance to next year. But our estimate is during this year. And maybe you will take some additional guidance from the communication we made at the Capital Markets Day where we estimated that our risk-weighted assets, including all of these changes, Basel III, models and efficiency, would be a moderate growth. That was the guidance we gave.</p>

          <p>Gentlemen, we will come to our next question from Nick Davey from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks very much for taking the time. Nick Davey here from UBS. Two questions, please. The first on Poland, where you're looking to close around a third of the branch network. I just wondered if you could perhaps talk a little bit more around the topic really. It wasn't that long ago that we were looking to open about a branch a week. If I look at your Polish operations, I suppose pro forma for an 11% allocated capital or Core Tier 1 within the division, it looks like it's running at about a 10% ROE. Is it simply that you think it's difficult for that Polish business to contribute positively to the group's aim of reaching a 15% ROE? Is it the case that following these measures you think that should be a boost to the division's ROE? Is there any sense that if you don't get to the required ROE or return hurdle rates, that you might reconsider your position in the region altogether? Could you perhaps just flesh out some thoughts there?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, please, on the internal transfer pricing model changes. Fredrik, I think you talked a little bit about this, but if I could just take you back on to that point, please, just exactly which products you've piloted these changes on, exactly what sort of feedback you're getting or, perhaps more pertinently, looking forward into 2012, by when would you hope to have achieved or seen some sort of returns on passing on higher costs of funding and liquidity to your divisions? When would you hope to see some sort of returns with regard to wider lending margins? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Nick, I will try to elaborate on both of those questions. First, as it relates to Poland, it is, of course, as you rightly suggested, not long ago since we had a different scenario from Poland. Of course, it's also not long ago since the whole group was subject to &#x2013; in the regulatory environment and a lot of other things were subject with different environments. So this is a part, you can say, of our new normal efforts just to strive for a higher return on equity.</p>
          <p>So what we're now doing is that the portion of the Polish business that is more driven by fewer mortgages with very little ancillary business, we're just basically scaling that down. And the business model, as we go forward, will be much built on a more holistic bank offering with advice, et cetera, as we do in the rest of the Nordic region. So yes, it is an issue of contributing to the group. ROE in some of that business that we are now not doing, you can say, is unlikely to take us to the appropriate return on equity levels that we want.</p>
          <p>It's not a matter of reconsidering our presence in this region. We believe in both the Baltics and in the Polish businesses. So it's just a matter of how we want to do business relationship banking with a full offering to the household and the corporate customers. We believe in that and we're going to do exactly the same thing in Poland. So yes, it is a change of direction, but it's within the new normal efforts that we have been making.</p>
          <p>As to the liquidity premia, this has been a project that we've been working on for quite some time, about two and a half years. And of course, it's a conceptually fairly difficult issue. There is a funding cost on top of LIBOR/SIBOR, or the reference rates, of approximately &#x20AC;600 million total. And then we know we do millions of transactions and lots and lots of thousands of products. So of course, in some way or another, this &#x20AC;600 million is attributable to all of these transactions and these products.</p>
          <p>So there is no absolute truth in any sort of book you're relating to how this should be done. So what we have been doing in the last several years is developing our model of the truth. We have also developed a Frontline system such as trust and profitability system and economic profit calculators &#x2013; or pricing systems, you can say. And thereby, we will enable the customer interfacing units and the branches and, of course, eventually, this is used in the business areas, et cetera on all the units to see the full funding costs for all products and all transactions.</p>
          <p>So there is no limit to which product. All products are in, all units are in. So that's the content of the model, and it's a cost transparency model. And by this, we will be able to see the profitability of customers, of course, also products or units and business areas. And we are in a process now of piloting this in the four Nordic countries. And, of course, those pilots may lead to recalibration of the models. But I think that's much more likely &#x2013; what is much more important is that we assess very clearly the behavioral impact when you use the system, because, of course, in some regions, for instance, you may have a very big dominance of businesses which has very little ancillary businesses and where price increases need to take place or profitability is low. And of course, you cannot change overnight. So you need to have a strategic view on transitions like that.</p>
          <p>So we're piloting. We're looking at the impact and we will implement it no later than 1st of January, 2013 in the Nordic region. So now we have distributed the full funding cost to the business areas, and as I've said, as of 1st of January, 2013, we will take it also for your benefit further down the line of the units and countries that you see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much. That was a very detailed answer. Could I just ask one quick follow-up on the Polish side? I just want to be clear I understand then on the profitability of the various products in Poland. I understand then you're stepping away more from the plain vanilla mortgage lending. Is that not some of the higher ROE business that you're engaged in in the region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think there are different kinds of mortgage businesses. Some parts of it and traditionally the foreign currency lending has been very high ROE. And the <mark type="ph" /> low <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:53:11) z&#x142;oty lending has been lower ROE. So we're not stepping away, Nick. That's not a fair description. But I think it's fair to say, just as is the case in all the Nordic countries and elsewhere, also in the Baltics, by the way, it's not enough just to do mortgages. But with the customers, we are a house bank or a full relationship bank. So to those customers where we deem that mortgages is the only product and there is very little prospects of doing more businesses, then we'll typically not do that. And those branches that are engaged solely in mortgage lending, those are also the branches that we're closing. So you're right, it's not a bad business necessarily. But it has to be coupled with the rest of the offering that we want to give.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>We will come to our next question from Per Gr&#xF8;nborg from Danske Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions, both related to net interest income. The first on Finland, where in your note, in your report wrote that earnings on lending showed a strong improvement mitigating the pressure on deposits. Can you talk a bit about what sort of lending is it that you are seeing your margins coming off? Is it <mark type="ph" /> mode (00:54:34)? Is it corporate lending?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to Norway. It's been touched upon a couple of times. I guess that one of the key drivers of your rise in NII and all is that you didn't follow the Central Bank when it start mid-December. The Central Bank did start again mid-March. I have not noticed that you have taken any actions on your mortgage pricing after the mid-March price rise. Can you tell a little bit about that? That's the two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. NII in Finland, first of all, you can see an impact on the NII in Finland, of course, from the decreases in the interest rates. So clearly, that has had an impact. And one of the reasons of course is that we have a significant volume of transaction accounts, or deposits in more general terms, on the Finnish market. But we have largely compensated. And I think it's fair to say that we have compensated both on the corporate and the household side. Finland has increased in margins over a consecutive period, but traditionally at least, Finland is very, very price sensitive and, therefore, we have been able typically to increase margins less in Finland than we have elsewhere. But again, this was a good quarter, and to some degree at least, compensating for the decline in the deposit income.</p>
          <p>As it relates to Norway, we have had very low &#x2013; and I alluded to it before, we've had very low margins on the Norwegian market. And we have been striving to increase margins also in Norway before. And we have tried to do this also in this quarter. Maybe an obvious question, Central Bank, as you referred to, is actually not driving entirely our funding cost. There is a distribution. Where there is a difference in our funding cost, we found ourselves in a combination for mortgages, for instance, of senior unsecured and covered bonds. And of course, the repo rate of the Norwegian Central Bank is only indirectly having an impact of that. So we are not following automatically the Norwegian Central Bank when we decline. What is important for us is our funding cost and not the repo rate.</p>

          <p>Okay. On Finland, just one clarification. This improved lending margin, it has nothing to do with that I guess your mortgage book is also largely linked to the 12-month Euribor. Then, one could imagine that you have some mismatch between your funding and your lending pricing if you still have your mortgage book price on old 12-month Euribor rates and your funding is shorter term.</p>

          <p>Our final question will come from Christoffer Rosquist from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. This is Christoffer Rosquist from Barclays. Just two quick questions on funding, if I may. First, you mentioned at the beginning of your presentation that funding costs, slightly increasing funding costs have reduced NII. Can you just give a little bit more color on that, if that's something that's specific to Nordea or is something wider across the market? And if it is specific to Nordea, is that something that you expect to be able to drive downwards?</p>
          <p>The second question is if I can follow-up on the presentation this morning on funding in Denmark, where I understood that you were quite confident about your ability to roll over mortgage bonds, because I understand that the Central Bank has been quite concerned with short-term bonds funding long-term mortgages. So just if you could clarify a little bit why that wouldn't apply to Nordea. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I will try and do that. First of all, the funding cost, I alluded to &#x20AC;14 million, that's partly due to the higher corresponding volumes in long-term funding volumes than we have previously. So that's part of the story. And then the other part is just that spread levels prevailing is higher than the past. So it really is not a specific Nordea issue. It's very much a market-related issue. I think I also stated that we continue to find ourselves a very attractive rate. We, of course, maintained AA rating. So we continue to benefit from that strong position.</p>
          <p>Then if you relate to the Danish question and you were right, there was this question this morning about is there a concern. First of all, I think it's important just to stress the fact that we are actually not borrowers in the mortgage market. The system is such that the individual customers that borrow, they are the actual issuers of the bond. So contrary to &#x2013; for instance in Sweden or Norway, we are the issuers of the bond. In Denmark, it is the actual customers issuing the bond.</p>
          <p>So what has happened over the last four years roughly is that most of the long-term or a lot of mortgage funding has transformed into short-term funding to rates now of approximately 50% short. And the funding is also short. So it's not a matter of having a long-term funding financed with short-term funding. That's not the case. It is actually a short-term mortgage funded with a short-term loan. So we are not really sitting on that risk.</p>
          <p>And of course, the issue is that if you cannot refinance, if investors don't anymore want to have mortgage bonds, would that create a problem? Well, actually not really for the bank because what would happen is that the price levels of the mortgages would immediately go up. And of course, that in itself will constitute a cash flow problem for individual household and in itself, that would be a problem for the bank in terms of potential loan losses and all sorts of other things.</p>
          <p>And therefore, we have to put up capital instead. So the system is very clearly different to the one prevailing in the other three Nordic countries. So, it's not a matter of us not being concerned. It's just that the liquidity risk is not actually sitting with the bank. It's sitting with customers and we put up capital. But I think our view is clearly that a system where the funding is with the loan and the funding is done long-term is preferable to the short-term funding that has now gained such popularity.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So just to clarify it, you're not the part of &#x2013; well, as I understand that some of the institutes have been spreading out the refinancing over the year as in contrast to the January rollover?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But again, it is the customers' funding, right? So the auction process is to customers. So we would clearly support the direction to extend funding and not have it in one year. We don't think that's a prudent way of behaving. We should have a longer funding for the customers than what is currently the case.</p>
