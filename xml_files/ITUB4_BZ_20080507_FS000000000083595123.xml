        <plist>

          <p>Good morning for who are in the U.S.  Good afternoon for who are in the Europe.  It is a pleasure for us to present the first quarter results for Banco Ita&#xFA; Holding.  For those who are following through the internet and have the slide present.  We are starting slide #2, the highlights. The first highlight is the net result income itself R$2.48 billion with an annualized ROE of 28.1%.  If you reanalyze just the recurrent net income 1.979 billion which is a increase of 10.6 when we compared to the fourth quarter which means our annualized return on equity of 27.2. That is a very good level for the condition in terms of competition that we have today in the Brazilian financial market.</p>
          <p>The second point is the extraordinary items.  This quarter we sold our stake in MasterCard International and VISA International and these results on a positive impact of 55 million in the case of MasterCard itself, and 65 million in the case of VISA International after tax.  The third point is the growth of our credit portfolio, 7.9% in the quarter showing the very active quarter in terms of demand for credit. The economy is very heated and therefore our growth is very good.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus our growth in personal loans, special vehicles.  Vehicles sold 10.5 increase in the quarter and when we compare with the last -- first quarter of 2007, we see a increase of 65% in terms of vehicles.  The small and medium size companies up 15.9% in the quarter and up 50% in the 12 months.  We continue to focus our strategy in terms of loans in these two segments this year as we did in the last two years.</p>
          <p>Slide #3, we see more details of the non-recurring effects in our result. I think we don't need to spend much time here.</p>
          <p>Slide #4, highlights I would say here in this slide to give you -- pay attention in the stockholders equity of R$29.2 billion in the quarter also should look at the BIS ratio of 16.6. That continues to be in a very good level, even the growth of our credit asset.  We've been able to keep a good ratio of BIS.  Efficiency ratio also a very good number, 43.3% in the quarter. Very below when we compare to the first quarter of 2007.  We expect this level for the year to remain around 45%.</p>
          <p>Non-performing loans ratio are at 4.3%, a little bit lower than in the fourth quarter of 2007 showing the good shape of the Brazilian economy in this year of 2008. We don't see the increase in terms of delinquency for the year.</p>
          <p>In slide #5, we see here more details of our managerial financial margin and the total margin -- financial margin with our customers achieved R$50.058 billion with a increase of 7% -- almost 7% in the first quarter when we compare to the number of December, and 15.8 when we compare with this first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>In terms of financial margin with the market, I would like you to you pay attention in our treasury numbers. That was finish <mark type="inaudible" /> million below the first quarter of 2007 when the market was very favorable and below the fourth quarter of 2007.  This quarter we saw more volatility in the market, we saw some increase in interest rates in the market in the interbank market.  So all these with the international situations resulted in lower results in our treasury operations in the Ita&#xFA; Holding Financeira.</p>
          <p>In terms of banking fees, we are going to talk a little bit more later.  We saw also some reduction in the quarter as more related to competition in seasonable sectors.  Our insurance results and pension plans and capitalization R$706 million with a increase of 2% when we compare to the fourth quarter and almost 10% in terms of increase when we compared 12 months ago.  Results from loan losses R$1.583 billion with a increase of 22% when we compare to the last quarter of 2007.  This mainly because of the strong increase in our loan portfolio in this quarter.  As we saw the level of delinquencies remained almost stable.  So, the nominal increase in reais is due to the increase in the portfolio -- of the credit portfolio itself.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses, a reduction of almost 7% in the quarter when we compare to December. We are going to talk about this a little bit later.  So, all these result in the recurrent net income of R$1.979 billion.</p>
          <p>When we analyze in the slide #6 the loans by customer, kind of customer, we see the total loan portfolio increased as I said are almost 8% in the quarter.  We can see here more details in terms of individual loans. Vehicles represents almost one-fourth of our total credit portfolio and we believe this trend will continue through this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of company loans, we will continue to focus more in small and medium size companies. We have a very good quarter in this segment this year and we will continue to focus more in this segment where as we have been saying Ita&#xFA; has a lack in terms of market share, when we compare to the market share that we have in other areas of the financial markets in Brazil.  In terms of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, we see also an increase. We have been more active in these three countries, especially in the company segment.</p>
          <p>Slide #7, we can see the trends in terms of non-performing loans. We see that we have almost a stable number when we compare 4.3% in total delinquency ratio for the consolidated operations of Ita&#xFA; Holding, when we compare to 4.4 in the last quarter of 2007.  We can see here a little increase in terms of delinquency for individuals and a decrease in terms of Company's non-performance ratio.  In terms of coverage ratio almost 150%, which is very comfortable taking into consideration the good environment that we have in Brazil today.</p>
          <p>On slide #8, we can see the nominal growth of our provisions for loan losses, but we can see that the ratio recurrent expense for provision for loan losses, when we compare to total credit portfolio remains stable in 1.5%. That is the number that we expect to continue in the coming quarters.  In terms of provision for loan losses compared to the total credit portfolio we continue to decrease, but it is also a good sign of the solidness of our credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>In slide #9, we can see the funding for -- and resources portfolio that we manage.  In terms of funding, in terms of deposits, we can see an increase in deposits considering demand and saving, time, and mortgage notes, an increase of almost R$13 billion. That means a 12.2% in terms of funding increase in this quarter.  This is important because we are in all this growth in terms of credit portfolio so we need more deposits to face this growth for the bank.  So, we increased our deposits in terms of companies and in terms of individuals.  When we analyzed the institutional market, we saw in this quarter a little decrease in terms of deposits of the pension funds and that's a net off all the other asset managers, but it's not important because we continue to have a very good space in this segment which we need to grow more to this segment.</p>
          <p>In this quarter, we used more our clients directly client base especially individuals.  In terms of assets under management, we see the number of investment firm almost stable.  We are seeing a transfer from deposit from money market mutual funds through deposits, time deposits in this quarter.  This is because the time deposit is paying more for the client than the money market fund.  So, that's the main reason that's why we are seeing the numbers of assets under management almost stable, when we see the investment mutual fund.</p>
          <p>And we saw a little increase in terms of individual portfolios because mainly of the growth of our private banking operations.  In terms of provisions, second quarter reserve for our insurance and pension plans and capitalization business, we saw increase of 5.5% in terms of technical provisions this quarter, mainly because of the growth that continues in the pension plan business.  In the total interbank deposits, a little reduction and the total resources in the #4 in the last line, we saw a increase of 5.1% in terms of money, considering deposits and investments that the clients has with us.  So, we continue to have a very good and <mark type="inaudible" /> source of funding for our -- to fund our operations.</p>
          <p>On the Slide #10, we see the service fees. The total for the quarter R$2.5 billion, with a decrease of 6.4%, when we compare to the last quarter of 2007, and an increase of 3.3%, when we compare to the first quarter of 2007.  Going more in details of course here we have seasonable effects. The first quarter usually is not the most heated in terms of use of the bank for our clients, so we have a reduction in terms of asset management. As I said we have seen some transfers from money market funds to deposits.  So this means that revenue is here. And also less performance fees provisions in the quarter, because of the volatility of the market.  In terms of current account services, we can see that the trend of reductions in terms of fees in this line continues, because of the competition that is increasing. And also because the package that we announced last year in the third quarter that we've reduced a lot of fees and service fees in terms of accounting services for our clients and of also because of the new regulation of the Central Bank that some of that are already in place.</p>
          <p>Credit card almost stable when we compare to the last quarter of 2006, always remembering that the last quarter of the year usually is the most active in terms of use of credit card, because of the Christmas and holidays.  And so, this number is not bad.  But we see more difficulties in terms of growing this business, because the competition that is increasing.  So, when we analyze we see the comparison with the first quarter of 2007 increase of 4.4%.</p>
          <p>In terms of fees generated from our loan operations and guarantees also some reduction in the -- when we compare to the last quarter of 2007 and mainly because of the new regulations of the Central Bank and more competition.  The line of collection services in the quarter.  <mark type="inaudible" /> will have a increase when we compare to the last quarter 2007 because in the first quarter, usually we have more collection of taxes for the government that is in fact based mostly of them in the beginning of the year.  So we continue to believe that the banking fees will increase around 8% for the year and we saw some seasonal factors affecting the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Slide #11, non-interest expenses, we have a reduction of almost 7% when we compare to 2000 &#x2013; the last quarter of 2007.  Here also we have some factors that is -- we had less expenses usually in the first quarter, especially in personal expenses because of vacations of people. We used to have have less marketing expenses than others who usually in the first quarter has less expenses.  We continue to believe that the level of expenses for the year will be around 12%, always remembering that we continue our policy of opening new branches. That is a high-cost investment for the bank.  We expected to open around 140 new branches this year.  That means, important growth for the number of branches and please always remember that our branch to break-even takes around 2 to 2.5 years and to be accretive compared to other branches, it takes around 4 to 4.5 years.  So, the level of investment that we are doing is very high, especially when we consider that we open around 130 branches in the last three years, each year.</p>
          <p>This reflects the efficiency ratio on the Page 12 even considering all these investments that we are doing the last year especially in our Tai&#xED; operation and opening of new branches.  We have been able because of the growth of the revenues especially in terms of credit to reduce our efficiency ratio in the quarter 43.3 and in 12 months 45.9, very good numbers. And we expected the year to finish around 45% for the year of 2008 in terms of efficiency ratio.</p>
          <p>And on to Slide #13, we have the unrealized income and losses.  We have a total of gains unrealizes of R$7.1 billion with a reduction compared to 8.4 at the end of the year of 2007 mainly because of the reduction in prices of the companies that we have stake that are listed in the stock market.</p>
          <p>On Slide 14, we have the segmentation, traditional segmentation that we usually present to investors and shareholders. Our Banco Ita&#xFA; with the operation, Ita&#xFA; BBA corporate and investment banking, Itaucred with our non-checking account clients and Tai&#xED; an incorporation where we allocate the extent of cash flow of the bank.</p>
          <p>If you go to Page 15, we see that all these segments had very good return. Banco Ita&#xFA;  34% for return of our retail operation. Ita&#xFA; BBA 26.5, that is a very good number for wholesale banking.  Itaucred is almost 40%, 39 and the lower is the investment of cash flow of the effects of capital that we have.  So all these managerial numbers reflect 27.2 in terms of return that we have in our recurrent results.  I would say that is a very good and sound levels of return analyzing the level of competition that we have today in the Brazilian market.</p>
          <p>On Page 16, we can see the strength of our results both in terms of net income and recurrent net income seeing that we continued to grow our numbers.</p>
          <p>And the last Slide is #17, with the number of shares that we've repurchased in the first quarter 24.6 million shares, the number of shares that we bought in the first quarter using the excess of capital that we have is one way of doing that, is buying back shares. And we did I in a very good pace for the first quarter taking advantage of a very low level share price in our view taking into consideration the long run returns that we can have in the Brazilian operation and Brazilian system in terms of banking.</p>
          <p>Another thing is the split of one new share for every four that we have and with maintenance of the level of dividend.  So the monthly dividend that we pay increases by 25% with this deal.  And also we counseled 25.3 million shares, 10.3 common shares and 15 million preferred shares in the last shareholders meeting at the end of last month.  So these are the highlights that we would like to present to you.</p>
          <p>And now we are open to questions as you probably have.  Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session.  [Operating Instructions].  Our first question comes from Mario Pierry from Deutsche Bank.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning.  I have two questions.  The first one is on your net interest margin. We saw -- looking at the data from the Central Bank, we saw that credit spreads were up about 300 basis points during the quarter, but your net interest margin declined 10 basis points.  So, can you just comment why such a big discrepancy between this data that we see on the Central Bank and what you report?  And the second question has to do with credit growth; your loans are growing about 38% year-on-year. You're guiding for growth of 25 to 30.  Is there any concern at the bank that the Central Bank in Brazil might take other measures to try to slow down the strong growth that we see in the economy today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Silvio speaking, Mario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of net interest margins, the data from Central Bank is the operations that you are make during the month or during the quarter.  And when you look our net interest margin it's the total portfolio.  The reality is you have a mix from the new operations and the old operations.  If you look at the new operations that <mark type="inaudible" /> during this period we have an increasing spread, but it is not sufficient to change the total net interest margin of the quarter.  In relation to the second question, we are not today, we don't have any concerns about other measures that Central Bank can take. I think is the measure is done and we are working this scenario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Silvio, let me follow-up then on the net interest margin. From what you said is then you expect net interest margin to start trending higher, since we are seeing the new credit being granted at higher spreads; but, I have a question with regard then to your cost of funding like the recent data that we have seen is that funding in Brazil is getting more expensive as well. Are you feeling that pressure? Also with that in mind would you still expect margins to trend higher in the next couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  We are supposed that net interest margin will be flat.  Our guidance before, which was -- that we expect that the net interest margin, will decrease 60 basis points, but not anymore.  Today, we are working a scenario that the net interest margin will be flat during the year, basically, because of the increased interest rates.  In reality, we have many factors that affect the net interest margins.  The mix, the new operations, the increase in the interest rates, but the bottom line being net interest margin that will be flat, Mario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and any comments on the funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the scenario that we are working more competitive today.  It is higher because of the expansion required and because of the competition because of the international scenario. That being our vision we will be more positive the next couple of quarters, because of the situation involving investment rates.  Recent -- in the first quarter the corporate companies become -- come back to the domestic market to borrow money.  In these next couple of quarters, we suppose that the international market will be more open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question.  Our next question comes from Juan Partida from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  I have two questions.  The first is that we saw significant increase in the securities balance this quarter. I was wondering if you could -- you could comment what are the motivations for that? And my second question is, we saw a significant decline in other taxes in other operating taxes such as fees and <mark type="inaudible" /> That seems to be a higher decline that implied by the elimination of CPNS tax. Also is there any reason for that decline and what we should expect for future quarters.  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the securities portfolio Juan, is something that is related with the fourth quarter again because of the increase in the necessity to provide fund for the bank.  You remember that last year, we increased our liquidity and now we are operating the level that's supposed to be the necessary level that we need to operate.  In terms of other taxes, you are right, this is a net effect.  And the other effects is -- relate with fees and <mark type="inaudible" /> that is normally we have. When we paid a dividend from one company to another, probably have the impact in this second quarter -- is in fact is a small amount, not significant. Is not happening in the first quarter when you compare the first quarter with the first quarter '07.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening everybody.  I have a question on funding and another one on commissions.  On the funding side and with loans growing so quickly do you envisage being more aggressive in terms of time deposits to try to encourage additional funding including from your money market accounts?  Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, remember that in this month, May, we start &#x2013; the Central Bank will start to collect reserve requirements for the interbank deposits in the leasing corporation. And it means that we have this first.  Our increase is &#x2013; correct, that we need more funds. Second, these prepare for <mark type="inaudible" /> deposits for these new reserve requirement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So you do expect to be more aggressive on the funding side in terms of...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we will be more competitive because these reserve requirement will be increased from 5% in May to 25% on January '09. Each two months these reserve requirement will be increased.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On the commission side, do you envisage any growing pressure in terms of prices on credit card fees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>During this first quarter we had the impact is today the environment is more competitive.  But we are supposed that this being the level that we report will be in the level that we operate in 2008.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Yes just my question is regarding asset quality. I mean obviously it's pretty attractive right now, but could you give us a bit more detail on what's going on in the individual NPL ratio. What is it that's driven this up slightly? Are you seeing slight deterioration in terms of the asset quality of auto loans, for example? Or where is this worsening of the NPL ratio in individuals coming from? And also can you give us some idea in terms of your charge-off policy, how you'd see that going forward in '08. We have seen an increase in that in the first quarter of this year as reflected in the coverage ratio coming down. How do you see that going forward? Do you believe you will be charging off loans more aggressively?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>In terms of asset quality, we supposed that the ratios will be flat.  Today we report 4.3% and we suppose that to be the ratio that'll be kept including the expenses in relation to the total portfolio. We are not see improvement in terms of nominal <mark type="inaudible" /> in reality will be flat during the year.  That is our vision.</p>
          <p>In terms of car loans, in reality the nominal amount is bigger than before in terms of the delinquency but not in terms of the ratios.  We are increase the portfolio very fast, that's the scenario.  In terms of charge-offs we have here in Brazil to adopt the Central Bank policy, and we charge off the credit after 360 days that you overdue.  In terms of the operations that exceeds thirty-six months and if you have a guarantee, we have to expense the charge-off period for more 360 days.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone.  I actually have two questions.  One is on the economic scenario and what the interest rate cycle is. How much more will interest rates have to rise this year to affect your estimates on loan growth?  That's the first question and the second question is about your capital policy. I mean what do you plan &#x2013; considering doing with your excess capital for 2008? Do you still plan to do more shares? And how do you see the opportunities for acquisitions in the Latin space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the economic scenario we are supposed that the interest rates can increase 200 basis points.  But because of the first quarter was bigger in growth than we expected, we are keeping our guidance.  We are not supposed that the <mark type="inaudible" /> will affect our guidance. 25% to 30% is our guidance in <mark type="inaudible" /> growth.  The second question Roberto, I will pass to Alfredo.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the use of capital we consider that buying back shares is an important part of our strategy in terms of using capital, the excess.  And we are analyze because this depends on the price conditions and the market conditions in general.  We have an authorization of the Board to buy more shares and these will be realized under the market circumstances.  In terms of Latin expansion we continue to focus our strategy in Brazil.  And we have much more opportunities, the spread, the return on equity is much higher here than in other countries.  But we are more active in these countries.  Even in Argentina we have been more active.  We increased our <mark type="inaudible" /> especially for our companies. We are reshaping all our branches; we have changed the name of the bank there.  We will be only Banco Ita&#xFA; not anymore <mark type="inaudible" />  We are opening more branches in the countryside of Argentina.</p>
          <p>In Chile, we are also more active the operation that we bought from Bank of America was very calm.  We are more active we are open and getting more clients.  We have a very low level of attrition with client basis in Chile and Uruguay.  So, we continue to increase these operations.  We are open to certain small acquisitions like we did in Uruguay in terms of Pension Fund Company.  But we &#x2013; our target continue to be the Brazilian market where we can see and we see in the coming years much more opportunities for the bank especially for banking and we continue to see much higher returns on equity in Brazil than in other countries.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Saul Martinez from Bear Stearns.  I want to dig into the auto loan portfolio a little bit.  You've obviously had very, very strong growth now in this past year. And I want I just first question is have we seen any shift at all in terms of the portfolio between new and used vehicles and how much of new loan origination is coming from new vehicles versus used vehicles&gt; That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on asset quality in the auto business. I realize you guys indicated that asset quality's stable in auto loans. Or you indicated that asset quality is stable in auto loans when measured against total loans. However your loan loss provision at Itaucred for vehicles rose substantially in the quarter sequentially from 259 million to 330 million. And <mark type="inaudible" /> loans in the auto loan portfolio did increase sequentially as well. So I am wondering if you guys are concerned at all given the very strong growth you have had and some concerns industrywide about underwriting standards in auto lending whether you are going to see asset quality weakening in the auto book as we &#x2013; as some of these loans start to season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in terms of our car business the shift that we made recently is we become more stringent to grab credit. In terms of the analysis of the proposals we are selecting a more detailed customer.  In terms of the mix between brand new cars and used cars is 40% of these brand new 60% the used cars. In terms of the credit quality, it's flat. The increase in the total provision in the total portfolio during the period is <mark type="inaudible" /> with the portfolio.  It's  increase the portfolio and you need to make more provisions related towards that. We have not see any signs of deterioration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I guess my question though Silvio is if I look at loan loss provisioning in at Itaucred in the vehicles segment it went from 260 in 4Q if I'm not mistaken to 330 in your loan portfolio of your 10%.  So that's a pretty substantial increase in provisioning levels there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the question is as mortgages or maybe the first question is, do you expect mortgages as a percentage of your total book to increase and if so what does that do to your NIMs, your net interest margin?</p>

We are expecting that in 2012 to 2013, we can achieve a 10% of our portfolio, the total mortgage.  We will continue to grow in this space about 50% of the portfolio year-by-year.  In terms of net interest margin this year the portfolio continues very small.  It will not affect the net interest margin guidance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi I just had two questions.  The first one is on the share buyback program. The diluted number of shares have stayed constant throughout from quarter to quarter.  Is there any reason why the treasury shares haven't been canceled for example, they might be used for something or do you expect to cancel those shortly.  And then just a follow-up question on Brazil going investment grade.  I am afraid it's bit of a broad question, but could you give us a few examples of how that might be helpful to the bank going forward for example <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your first question, the last shareholders meeting realized in the end of April, we announced a cancellation of 25 million shares for -- the amount that we have in our book.  So we did this cancellation of 25 million shares in this last meeting.  We keep part of these shares because we use these shares to serve our stock options program.  That's the reason we keep 3, 4 years ahead in terms of estimation that we are going to use in our stock option program.  So what we did we cancelled these 25 million shares that we think is excess that we are not going to use in the coming years, in this program of stock options.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In relation to the impact on the investment grade stocks for Brazil, in our case, we expect it to be more active in the international market to get money.  I think the opportunity for Ita&#xFA; to be more present.  That's the first impact that you will see. The other impact I think will be spread out in the next or the couple of years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and congratulations for the results.  I have two quick questions.  First one is if you plan to give more emphasis on the insurance segment?  And the second one is related to fee income.  As we saw this sharp drop in first <mark type="inaudible" /> and if we look year-over-year it represents a growth of 3%.  I wonder if this changes anything regarding the guidance that you gave for this line for this year?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your first question about insurance, we have, in considering traditional insurance, our market share is not very high.  Some reason for that.  The main one is that we are out of the health insurance that is almost half of the market.  We don't sell this kind of insurance in the last 16, 15 years because we consider this a very risky business. We saw high level of interference of the government in terms of prices, in terms of what can, should be attended by the insurance company.  So, this explains most of our low presence in terms of market share.</p>
          <p>In the other segments of the traditional insurance, we have a reasonable presence in the life insurance and it's more than we would like in terms of auto insurance.  So, we are working.  We don't see much many opportunities in terms of acquisition.  These are very competitive markets.  So, it is not easy to gain market share.  To gain market share you have to reduce price of the insurance.  So, you start to have other risks in terms of results.  We have a small, but very profitable insurance business.</p>
          <p>If possible we would like to increase by acquisition, but it is not easy because there is not many offers or companies available to consider in terms of acquisition.  So, we continue our policy to be profitable to have -- take care in terms of underwriting of insurance, but we know that we have some lack in this business, but we are not comfortable with that of course. But we don't see as I said, many opportunities to acquire and as I said also it is difficult to gain market share and not implying an increasing risk and delinquency of the insurance.   So, we will continue to work in the direction of improving our operation and looking for opportunities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the fees, we are keeping our guidance that fees will grow 8% in 2008, <mark type="inaudible" /> 2007. You know that in this month in May, the central bank implement some measures. But we are not consider that we will affected our profitability in relation to the guidance.  In reality, basically, we had the backlog of this change in the first quarter already.  In reality, we will charge some other fees that we didn't charge before, and there are charges that were eliminated that we have done already.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Thank you.  Good morning.  Can you shed a little bit of light on the drop in investment banking fees?  And as a second question what is Ita&#xFA;'s corporate strategy with respect to its investment banking operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, <mark type="inaudible" /> this is Vassimon.  The reduction in investment banking fees in the first quarter reflects a more challenging environment.  The market was basically closed especially for equity transactions.  But, looking ahead we have a more optimistic view, because we believe that the market will start to recover although still on a selective basis.  We have already seen in April, a relevant transaction in the equity markets in Brazil led by the Ita&#xFA; BBA, and so expect fees to recover in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>As a general strategy, we see investment banking as a relevant part of our strategy of being a one stop shop for our corporate customers.  And I believe that in this new environment of investment rates Brazilian companies will more and more require investment banking services.  I think we are well-positioned, we have been among the top three in terms of equity offerings in the past few years and we have been the leading bank in the Brazilian fixed income market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me do a quick follow up.  With Unibanco's new approach to their investment banking operations of apparently spinning that off, do you guys have any similar idea in the back burner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe that Unibanco's movement was right one and pretty much in line with what we have already established in Ita&#xFA; BBA.  I mean, in Ita&#xFA; Group, as you may know we have this corporate business concentrated in separate units to allow a more concentrated focus on this segment.  So I see the movement of some of our competitors somehow ratifying the strategy that we took before them a couple of years ago.</p>

          <p>Victor, this is Vassimon.  I believe that in a investment grade environment we should expect some reduction in the margins in loans.

          <p>Okay thank you for your time being with us.  I think we have a very good quarter, very good in terms of recurrent results. We think we are in a very good position to face competition and to face the difficulties and opportunities that we have in the Brazilian market.  We continue to be very optimist about the environment here in Brazil in terms of economic growth, low inflation that will result in a good environment for credit and for loan expansion.  We continue to be optimist about the results.  We continue to see this environment benefit --  doing good benefit for the banking industry in the coming quarter.  So we expected to keep the pace in terms of good results in the coming quarters.  Thank you for your time and hope to be with you again in the next conference call for the second quarter result.  Thank you.</p>
