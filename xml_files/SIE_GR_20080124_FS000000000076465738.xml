          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Siemens 2008 First Quarter Conference Call. As a remainder this conference is being recorded. Before we began, I would like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on page two of Siemens' presentation.</p>
          <p>This conference call may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on the company's current expectations and certain assumptions and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Michael Sen, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alexis. Good morning everyone and welcome to our first conference call of the year. We have issued today quite a bit of information, and I hope you have all had a chance to review it. Our earnings release, the flashlight and all other documents went out at 7.15 AM. We also issued two press releases, one related to the new margin targets, and another to the start of initial phase of the share buyback program. You can download these documents as well as today's presentation from our website.</p>
          <p>I'm joined today &#x2013; in today's call by our President and CEO, Peter L&#xF6;scher and our Chief Financial Officer Joe Kaeser. The agenda is straightforward &#x2013; Peter and Joe will provide you with an update on the execution of our strategic agenda, which we laid out in November and he give you some details and context on our first quarter of fiscal '08. After that we will take questions.</p>
          <p>You all know it is a busy day here in Munich with both the release of our Q1 numbers and the convening of the company's AGM. Therefore after his remarks, Peter must as CEO leave to attend the shareholders meeting with Joe handling the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn it over to Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael and good morning to everyone. I've been saying all along that Siemens' broad and well-positioned business portfolio is a key strength, and our first quarter results show this.</p>
          <p>We off to a good start to the year. Siemens' growth opportunities remain strong. We achieved strong organic growth and a book-to-bill ratio well above one for all sectors and a book-to-bill for the Group overall of 1.32, which is higher in comparison to last year's of 1.2.</p>
          <p>Revenue climbed 10%, orders increased 9. On an organic basis, revenues and orders rose 8 year-on-year. Group profit from operations 16, which is evidence of the power of our underlying businesses, but there were clearly some disappointments in the quarter and I want to speak bluntly about them.</p>
          <p>First the performance of the fossil power solutions business is simply unacceptable. We have changed out the management team. Wolfgang Dehen will review the challenges, get to the root of it and sort it out. We will come back to you with more details shortly.</p>
          <p>Another area is quality-related charges in Transportation Systems, which are new. And like you, my patience is wearing thin. The new management team there is also in the spotlight to get this problems fixed soon and I don't want to hear the word of Combino any more, but this is a program review which is ongoing in the transportation division as well, which is now our Mobility Division.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the year ahead, we are confirming 2008 topline and earnings outlooks given in November. We will grow our revenues at least twice as fast as the global GDP. We will grow our group profit from operations at least twice as fast as our revenues. Joe will detail out the financials in a few minutes, and I like to first update you on the progress in the plans we have announced just around 90 days ago.</p>
          <p>We continue our execution against our strategic plan and it's everything about delivery. We are sound enough and I am pleased to say that in a short time we achieved some significant progress.</p>
          <p>Simplifying management and increasing accountability is a core part of our plans and here is what we have accomplished so far. As you know, the Supervisory Board approved our streamlined organization and leadership structure, end of November. We have in place a tight and leaner managing Board, including the operating CEOs of the sectors, as well as the new divisional structure within in each sector. And structure is important but people are more important. And there is a sense of urgency which I have talked about. We have named the CEOs of the divisions as well as the CFOs of sectors and divisions. Everyone understands the goals and timetables, and that's all about accountability and performance.</p>
          <p>With the new leadership team in place, the potential that we know is here can be realized as quickly as possible. Clear and concise priorities have been established. The next milestone on our roadmap was to establish target margin ranges for the industry and energy sectors as well as for the divisions, and please bear in mind that the Service Rotating Equipment division in the sector Energy will not be reported because of its cross-divisional service character.</p>
          <p>Before going into more detail on these targets, we are happy to announce that we have decided to start our share buyback program immediately after the AGM, and Joe will give you some more details on this in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the margin improvement plans, we have announced today detailed target margin ranges for our power and industry sectors, as well as for each of our divisions. These are all new and if you recall we set the margin range of 14 to 17% for the healthcare sector in November. I will take you through some context on these ranges. We are targeting a margin of 9 to 13% for our industry sector. Within the sector we have raised our targets for industrial automation and motion control substantially as we expect to profit from the attractive PLM market due to our UGS acquisition and a continued optimization of processes.</p>
          <p>Also the margin range for building technology has been slightly raised because of increasing demand for energy efficiency solutions. The new target margin for the energy sector has been raised to 11 to 15%. This is a substantial increase compared with the weighted average of the former PG and PTD, which is 9 to 13%.</p>
          <p>The more aggressive target set for each of our divisions reflect the attractiveness of these markets and our improved performance. Achieving our margin target for the Healthcare Division will bring us more in line with the performance of our peers.</p>
          <p>In Imaging IT, we will close the gap between Siemens and the current market leader. We will leverage our number one position in diagnostics and expect this segment to be a strong contributor to margin improvement with the projected range of 16 to 19%.</p>
          <p>In our Workflow and Solutions division, we operate in an environment with strong and well established competitors, although reaching our target of 11 to 14 will likely be challenging. We are confident that we will be able to achieve margins in this range.</p>
          <p>The targets for the cross sector businesses, SIS and Siemens Financial Services, have not been changed and we look at these ranges in a specific way. The upper limits of our target ranges are backed to best-in-class margins, whereas the lower limits are what we would expect to achieve in the event of a downturn in the economic cycle.</p>
          <p>We want to be measured by action, not by words, and here is what the path of our coming months looks like. At this moment, we are working hard to set the details on achieving our SG&amp;A cost reductions. This will be done by the second quarter conference call in April. You will get the first interim report in July. We will start pro forma reporting inline with the new business structure, give an outline of the new management compensation scheme and guidance on the expected EPS range for full year 2009. And we will, of course, continue to provide full year EPS guidance ranges in the following years.</p>
          <p>We are committed to the execution of our TAP plan. Just to remind you which stands for transparency, accountability and performance, and now on track to deliver on the objectives we have set out.</p>
          <p>And with this, I would like to hand over to Joe, who will elaborate on the first quarter results and I truly apologize that I now must leave because the general &#x2013; the Annual General Meeting convenes in a few moments and I must be present. And please excuse me for the rest of the call. Over to you, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks Peter. See you in a bit. A very warm welcome to all you also from my side, who are listening in this morning, very early morning for our Q1 conference call. Before I move to the first quarter, let me update you on our share buyback program.</p>
          <p>This continues the optimization of our capital structure which we started already last summer by buying back the outstanding convertibles in the amount of 3.3 billion. With this transaction we substantially reduced the dilutive effect on our earnings per share.</p>
          <p>Having done the groundwork and gotten past the blackout period, we have now initiated the first phase of buyback as soon as possible. We will commence with &#x20AC;2 billion, open buyback for a purpose of cancellation between January 28 and end of April. And you will see weekly updates on that on our IR webpage.</p>
          <p>While the equity market trends we have seen recently might not to be all to our liking, we certainly see some benefit for us competing up our stock right now. Time &#x2013; timing for the next phases of the buyback will obviously reflect capital market conditions, but the direction, ladies and gentlemen, is very clear as is the commitment. We rapidly implement what we promised to our owners.</p>
          <p>Let me now come to our first quarter. On a topline, we see continuous strengths with 8% year-on-year organic order growth and 8% organic revenues. Let me also add &#x2013; and that might be interesting &#x2013; that our quarter-on-quarter order growth is 14%, suggesting that we see continued strengths here and that's been repeatedly saying that we do not see any cloud on the horizon just yet that doesn't mean we are not there, but our books clearly do show continued strengths.</p>
          <p>Auto cycle dependent businesses like A&amp;D continue to shine with a 15% organic growth and 16% organic sales growth. Medical too in a way operating in a very difficult environment, so a 5% organic order growth. I also want to point out that these figures were generated in a time of fundamental change and derividation (12.56) in the Siemens organization and I do believe that does clearly show the capabilities of this company.</p>
          <p>Group profit from operations is &#x20AC;1.7 billion, 9% merchant &#x2013; 8.9% merchant on operational revenues and that's actually reasonably close to Q4's strong 9.3% margin. PTD, Medical and I believe especially, A&amp;D compensated for PG and TS's underperformance. A&amp;D and PTD both had a clean incremental margins of above 30%. The PG issues are clearly unacceptable as I think clearly, as stated by Peter. And they should not come as a surprise though to the markets since we have given guidance on the issue beforehand.</p>
          <p>We took more than &#x20AC;200 million in charge for fiscal Q1. I would not add those as a &#x2013; one-offs and assume that PG has an underlying margin of about 11% right now, since the nature of those strategies is related to recalculation of the project in progress. And I would not think that they are there yet, which is disappointing in the current market environment. However, as Peter said, we have a new team in place and we expect to give continuous updates as things are progressing.</p>
          <p>Of course, there is also very pleasant news in the Energy sector. If you look at wind and service businesses both are performing very, very well total submission and distribution.</p>
          <p>A&amp;D and Medical both performed well in their respective markets excluding PPA and one-time integration charges, as well as smaller divestments. A&amp;D had an underlying margin of above 16% and Medical, 15.7.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we expect about 200 million PPA and integration-related one-time cost at A&amp;D, 200 million and roughly 370 million at Medical, which is in essence lower than we have originally anticipated and communicated.</p>
          <p>I hope you have noticed that we have also made good on our promise that diagnostic sales at margin are already included in the current fiscal Q1 earnings release. The underlying margin before PPI and integration isn't what we believe encouraging 21.5% margins.</p>
          <p>Maybe some additional clarity on strategic equity investments. Now, here Siemens Networks has booked around 120 million of charges in this quarter, which is materially less of what we had originally anticipated. As a result, SEI had made a profit of 26 million instead of an anticipated loss. And as you certainly all know that in a few hours Nokia will give more details on NSN operating result and what to expect in their fiscal year 2008 going forward. So far &#x2013; therefore we do expect continued volatility of Siemens Nokia Networks even though I have to say that they are moving clearly and quickly ahead in the directions they have been communicated and you'll also hear that this afternoon with the Nokia conference call.</p>
          <p>Net income came out of &#x2013; at 6.5 billion, including a 5.4 billion total P&amp;L effect relating to VDO. Net we came out significantly above the &#x2013; what I have been guiding as conservative 4.5 billion in December. Here I think it's also important to know that there had not been any additional tax charge for the transaction in this quarter since we already charged everything to fiscal Q4 2007 as far as Siemens VDO transaction was concerned.</p>
          <p>Other drivers on the bottom-line also included asset management progress at Siemens Real Estate where we expect a significant three-digit amount from proceeds for real estate sales in the course of the year and we have started that already in our fiscal Q1 and that also shows in the numbers. This converts fixed costs into variable costs in the medium term and thereby enhances our flexibility going forward. So, its not so much about making big profits on estate sales, it is about bringing down the breakeven point as such and not be inflexible if and when it comes to adjustment in regional resource management.</p>
          <p>Regarding taxes, we had a 29% rate this quarter. The guidance for the full year remains at 35 to 30% going forward. Maybe some more details on the headquarter cost. There were 307 million this quarter including &#x20AC;93 million investigation and consulting cost and a few smaller other items. We do have started the prep work for our G&amp;A project, yet do not expect significant reductions for the remainder of fiscal year 2008. This is a more back loaded savings topic and we will update you every quarter on the progress.</p>
          <p>I will assume that total headquarters cost to be in the ballpark of fiscal Q1 since all our drivers continue working towards a thorough, effective and timely investigation and remediation. For the second half of fiscal 2008 we will give an update after fiscal Q2 2008.</p>
          <p>I will be moving to the questions in a moment. So, let me sum it up. As Peter mentioned we moved very quickly on the reorganization and first results on delivery. Priorities clearly are and remain to be organic growth and getting the most out of every euro in sales, in every business, in every market. This especially means that we move quickly to the cost reductions and the restructuring programs to benefit from those, should the support from a strong economic cycle for a bottom-line fade away.</p>
          <p>With that ladies and gentlemen, I'd be happy to take your questions. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, operator do we have the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes sir. Your first question comes from the line of Simon Smith (20.11) with Citigroup.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh hi; good morning. My question related, I guess, unsurprisingly, to Power-Gen. You've &#x2013; you obviously had the very significant charge there for the &#x2013; or losses for the contracting business. And then you've &#x2013; talking about volatility in coming quarters. Clearly the new management team is still at an early stage in terms of getting to grips with that business, but clearly you've &#x2013; I know you do have a &#x2013; quite a large amount of visibility in the part of business that has gone wrong, which I guess is good and bad. But I just wondered as, what you can currently see, if you could quantify the period that you think the issues may affect you and give some sort of indication for the medium-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Simon, and obviously, I do understand that Power-Gen is of essence here. I mean, generally speaking we've done and the group, the division has done a very thorough review on all the projects and to all what is known and what they can think of has been included in the 200-million charge. By the same token, since some of those projects are still in a &#x2013; I would call it reasonably early stage, I have to be cautious that whether or not that remains stable till the end. Not suggesting to guide it down; I'm just saying that since the progress on some projects is in the 30 to 50 percentage stages for some of those, I'd be cautious for fiscal Q2 and then we actually should exactly know what there needs to be done and get it over with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I mean it would be fair to say that once you are six months into a period, the amount that you feel that relates to this will have been accounted for and from that point on, apart from, say, the volatility of equity stakes, you &#x2013; we should expect you to be trending broadly within your target range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what I was trying say is that we have booked everything we &#x2013; the division could think of. Also even with some sense of caution. By the same token, though, if you look at the root cause of the charges, it's been related to matters of delays in the project start; it's been related to supplier, related failures to ship boilers and other topics on time, predominantly coming out of the fact that it's a very, very strong, let's say, a buyers' &#x2013; sellers' market from the products. So therefore there is uncertainty and I do trust that the new management team will get to the bottom of that quickly and then see whether there is any more need to review on the project. At this point in time we've taken everything the division can think of in terms of risks going forward.</p>

          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Andreas Willi with JPMorgan. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A quick follow-up question to Simon's and then a question on OSRAM. On Power-Gen, could you also indicate to what degree some of these problems relate to contracts being taken in one or two years ago at too low margins? And to what degree this is just execution &#x2013; the issues you mentioned before? And on OSRAM you mentioned in the press release that it's a challenging environment. Given the good results you had and the consistency there, I was just wondering, what do you see as &#x2013; what is challenging in the OSRAM environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks, Andreas. On the PG, clearly, everything is execution-related. It's not about taking orders at low margins. We've known that; we've continuously communicated in the market that we start projects now which had been booked as order intake in 2004, late 2004-2005. It is about execution and getting a timely project management together. That's in essence what the majority of the topics are, and that leads to a recalculation of the total project, and the effects on those projects you see in the 200-million charge.</p>
          <p>Now, on OSRAM, I think the same statement here is to, as I said it for other businesses in the economy, there is no clouds really on the horizon. By the same token, though, if consumers are being affected, that might need OSRAM in the first place as an early indicator. Secondly OSRAM's got some transaction exposure to the currency, especially, U.S. dollars, and that has been just a caution that this division like it (25.24) is still performing very well &#x2013; might face some headwind going forward. The third one is that, as you know, there is a shift in the consumer environment from shelf space management on lightbulbs towards a light engineering topic of the semiconductors and that's also something the division needs to manage over time: get its sales channels in place and make sure that the Octa (25.55) semiconductor technology stays on top of things. So it is no specific cautioning, it is just that this very successful division going forward will have a lot of work to do to stay as successful as they are or even improve their profitability.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mr. James Stettler with Dresdner. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah; thank you, and good morning. Apart from the issues you have identified in Power-Generation Transport Systems, is there anything else out there in the project-related areas which could cause problems over the remainder of the year? And have you identified &#x2013; have you clearly gone through these projects in a detailed way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have gone through all the projects &#x2013; we actually even sent a quite large amount of people from audit to help the division to do a thorough review on the issues we've been seeing in project management and in also, let's say, supplier management. Because some of those issues have been related to suppliers not shipping on time as they have promised and therefore the whole project as its been key &#x2013; turnkey project has been negatively affected. I think the uncertainty I will have as a CFO is whether those topics are really the root cause of matters or whether there is some technical challenge which has not been thoroughly understood. That's why Peter and I have talked to Wolfgang Dehen last week already and asked him -- we help him with that to setup a technology engineering team to really go to the bottom of matters and make sure that we are not looking for root causes in project management, where else they are in technology. That's I think what we have not quite fully understood and that's why I am cautious about Q2, but everything else I think we have thoroughly understood and accounted for in the charge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in terms of orders taken in industry solutions mobility and Power-Generation, have you changed the way those orders have been &#x2013; the projects have been structured over the last six months or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as Peter said, we are very cautious on taking on turnkey projects. There is a very clear strategy that we go more for the product and service-related business rather than the turnkey. And that also starts materializing in the order acquisition environment. But so far, in the last six months we have really not seen any major change at this time.</p>

          <p>Yes; thanks. I had two main questions. The first one, please, was on building technologies. Your orders were down year-on-year on an organic basis. Could you please give some update on what you are seeing in the construction end-markets for that business, perhaps in the different regions, the mix of commercial versus industrial and so on? And secondly, looking a bit broader I see in your &#x2013; if we take the average of your three sector margin targets, you're looking at generally in the mid teens I guess as margin at the upper end of the range. If I look inside your industry sector though, you've got two divisions there, industry solutions and mobility where your target range through cycle is mid-single digit and they are the same as the prior target range. So, I just wonder how you think &#x2013; when you're thinking about your margins, how you offset the fact that you're looking at an overall Group margin that is in the mid teens and these divisions you're looking at are mid-single digit margins? How do you see those fitting into the company in the long-term? Why haven't you seen scope for additional margin expansion in those businesses? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah hi, Julian. On SPT, the major impact from the order slowdown is related to the United States and to Germany. We will be looking into that, we remain somewhat optimistic that this will be caught up for in the quarters to come, that's what the division is already also forecasting. I think the good news is that &#x2013; the SPT is basically not in the residential business area and predominantly in the industrial area and also now is catching up in growth markets like Asia. So, therefore, we do not see any structural disadvantages going forward. Now, on the three target margins. I think first notably we have significantly increased the power &#x2013; the power sector margins and that clearly shows the commitment to get out of that business what that deserves to get out and we are the first of the way here so you can expect the boulders move in that area. While the healthcare sector target margin increase was basically related to the Dade Behring impact, the energy certainly is a considerable stretch.</p>
          <p>Now on industry, it is true that there are a couple of divisions which are basically laggards as related to the overall target margin, by the same token though especially for instance IS and Mobility, they do have a very, very capital efficient business with ROCE numbers way above the target margin of 14 to 16%. I think here we need to do two things &#x2013; on the IS, clearly understand &#x2013; and IS basically metals and water &#x2013; here we clearly need to understand what will the numbers look like if and when the industry cycle is not as favorable as it is today, and how that would impact the current margins and that certainly will lead to let's say structural considerations. And on the mobility, the first topic clearly is that you need to execute well. Mobility is in a sense TS and therefore execution is the key now to bring the margins up and also the capital efficiency further and that is much as I can say at this time. As I said organic growth, execution on TS and PG and then we certainly will see some more focus related considerations going forward, but not in the short term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I just wanted to clarify that in mobility, for example, even if execution goes perfectly your target margin would still be less than half what the overall implied sector margins is? Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a correct statement with regards to the target margins, but then again I would clearly like to reiterate the fact that capital efficiency is also important. And both divisions have a significantly higher ROCE than the average of the Group and the sector.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, two questions if I may. First off on orders. Joe, you've made some comments about focusing less on turnkey and I was just wondering if this means that we'll see effectively a lower rate of order growth for the Group going forwards than we've see in the past. Effectively you are going to be competing for less revenues. And the second question was just on your guidance of two times GDP revenue growth. Clearly there's been a downgrading of expectations of GDP for the year over the last month or two. And I was just wondering if that corresponds with your own expectations coming down a little bit in terms of where you see the Group's revenue growth this year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi Sam. With regards to PG and focus on turnkey, I think your assumption is right that going forward, you will see less quantity but more quality of earnings, if and when that concept materializes in the revenue space. And of course also much less risk on project execution since there is a very clear and concise accountability on projects &#x2013; on projects &#x2013; on products and services. Now on the GDP, we do see and do realize that the markets are more cautious on the GDP growth. At this point in time, I want to say that as I said earlier, there clearly is not any cloud on the horizon. We are getting increasingly cautious to look out for them since especially in the industry cycle there is a lot of, I would call it or describe it as perceived downturn, but the facts do not suggest that there is any at this time. But we are very cautious on the fact that this is out there and we will act accordingly.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Martin Bulkey (36.02) with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Yes, a couple of questions please. First of all, on the new target ranges that you've set for industry and energy. You mentioned that the top end of the range has been benchmarked peers, while the lower end is what you might see in a downturn. At that top end, have you done internally some more detailed plan as to how are you going to get there? Obviously you've already announced the SG&amp;A plan, but beyond that, are you yet at the stage where you have a detailed roadmap to get to those higher margin levels? And the second question was on the automation business, obviously a very strong margin when you clean out the PP&amp;A charges, the incremental margin I think more than 30%. Could you let us know what's happening there? Was that a pricing effect or has there already been other changes happening in that business to substantially improve the margin? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Martin, on the target ranges, we've done a very intensive benchmarking with our respective peers in the respective divisions. And that benchmarking then had been accumulated to the sector margin with some I think cautiousness on industry with regards to the 9% rather than maybe 10. Reason being that obviously this industry sector likely might face the earliest signs of any downturn if and when it arises. As far as what our reactions to that, well first of all, you just take the lower end of 10 to 20% SG&amp;A and apply that to the divisional businesses, this already will &#x2013; may put on a big chunk of the GAAP in most of the divisions. And that does of course not mean that the businesses themselves do not need to come up with very detailed actions on the cost of sales such as let's say, low cost purchasing in low cost countries, as well as with R&amp;D efficiencies. But here we do expect detailed plans in the next couple of quarters from the sectors and the divisions. Since we just want to make sure that this is going to be their own goal they are going to go after. On A&amp;D that's been, I think, in essence to clearly cut it short here, on A&amp;D that's been the long awaited growth conversion. While the division has been quite busy in the last years to really invest in its sales channels predominately, in Asia. Now it sees the benefits of a strong growth conversion and we do expect that to remain stable going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Siemens, yes. Well generally, we have three areas of &#x2013; where currency impacts the business. The first one is the easiest one, that's the translation. We translated the topline and the bottom line so therefore not much happening for the merchants. It's different of course, in transactions; where the goods and services, we buy and sell are being mirrored against each other. Here in general, I have to say that all our bigger projects such as in PG, mostly in high-end, so PTD and others are being hedged by the time we book the order. So therefore no short term impact on those projects, as long as they take to be completed. On the more products and systems businesses such as A&amp;D and Meds, which are obviously important to the group as well as &#x2013; as far as currency is concerned on A&amp;D we too hedge 80% of the business on a six-month rolling forecast and on Medical, we hedge 80% on a twelve-month rolling. So therefore do not expect any &#x2013; let's say a rapid changes and impact from transactions in the next nine to twelve months. That may change when we are there and the rolling average changes. Update on FAC and EN, you know that is always somewhat difficult. We do that when we are there. There is activity on EN, clearly is &#x2013; all other assets, which are let's say related to other operations, we do have a plan. There is a project from other operations with Peter L&#xF6;scher and I have been introducing that program, we want to see those businesses, be either attached to the sectors or we need to find better options for our shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, morning, Joe and Michael. Three quick questions if I may. First, on the real estate sales and proposed sales, can you just tell us about the geography, what kind of real estate and where the geographies are? Second one was just a quick update on lead times in Power-Gen, PTD and A&amp;D? And then, thirdly, just on the order intake, if I look at the energy orders &#x2013; 8 to 9 billion, can you just maybe qualitatively just talk about the sort of financing that your customers are displaying to you as you book that order and what your sort of financing thresholds are, whether you have seen any sort of incremental changes quarter-to-quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Timm, a whole bunch of topics here. Let me start with the Siemens real estate. As we have been talking about that matter for a while, first of all, we do have a lot of real estate on the balance sheet. Secondly, not all of that needs to be owned by ourselves. But thirdly and that has been, let's say, the real trigger to continue off-loading assets of real estate is that I just do want to see those fixed cost become variable cost over time. And that's why most parts we do sell those properties, it's predominantly office building and related infrastructure and lease those back over a period of &#x2013; depends on what the conditions are &#x2013; of 3 to 7 years. From that on, those fixed cost are variable cost and I think we are well advised to continue that because we might see different geographic mixes on the resources needed over time. And so that actually answers the question already on the geographic split. So those real estate sales are mostly in Germany and related areas in Europe. Some are also outside Europe but the majority clearly is in Germany. Now after that, I think your second question was update on A&amp;D, PG?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lead times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lead times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And lead times. PTD and I mean the whole energy cycle is still extremely robust and we are somewhat limited in lead times, not so much in our capacities but more to suppliers' capacities, which are usually specialists in small mid-sized businesses. If you talk about high quality steel, or a boilers, that is very, very transparent end supplier community. So that takes care of this one.</p>
          <p>On transformers, that's an interesting topic because transformers we have been watching very carefully in terms of who &#x2013; which competitor is building what factory where. We just inaugurated our new transformer factory in India. So we are basically ahead of the average crowd in terms of getting capacity utilized which we have been building. So we might see a little ease on transformers in Siemens. On competitors, of course, I cannot comment because I don't know. So that's on the lead times.</p>
          <p>A&amp;D is very, very straight on. They have a very good planning. They do invest in CapEx thoroughly and have short-term revenues right after that. So that's more shorter ones. In essence, lead times have not significantly changed. They ease a bit in certain areas but still strong demand in energy and also in automation.</p>
          <p>Now on the financing and order intake maybe, order intake on PG and PTD, I think PG is not just for south (46.08). PG also is very, very strong in renewables. We see continued growth &#x2013; continued interest. We are planning on further capacity considerations in certain areas where demand remains to be strong given the regulators' environments.</p>
          <p>On the financing of projects, we do have offloaded all the financing commitments we have given through Siemens financial services. There are nonrecourse expense. We do closely follow that one because one theoretically could not rule out that banks which are affected by the current crisis would be wanting to bail out. We have not such sign as of yet ,but we're watching that environment very carefully.</p>

And we will be in the U.S. pretty soon &#x2013; the mid-February, round about. So the last question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes sir. Your final question comes from the line of Benedict Uglow with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Joe. Hi, Michael. I had two topics. First of all was just, given it's the AGM and given there has been so much noise as usual in the German press, could you give us all a sense for the current situation with legal proceedings? I know that Peter and Dr. Kr&#xF6;ner (47.47) met with the SEC, I think, before Christmas. Does the amnesty program and the things coming out of that affect the timing of any settlement with the SEC? So that would question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two is, I think we slightly skirted the issue of the nature of the losses in the PG business. Could you give us any sense of how much of that 200-million number is directly related to Areva Framatome and what your view is vis-&#xE0;-vis taking potential losses on that going forward? Is &#x2013; have we made a forward-looking provision against Areva Framatome in that 200-million number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah; hi, Ben. Let me start with the AGM and the channel environment. I mean we've been trying hard over the last, I would say, 12 months to really, if I may say that, to separate the paper from the flyshit here; means basically you know facts versus opinions and all kinds of asked and unasked advices. Because we have to run the company in the wake of a serious matter to be managed and it's your judgment on how management has been dealing with that. So generally, everything which are facts are being represented in the legal proceedings, first of all. And if I am not mistaken, there have not been significant news since we reported last about it in Q4. I still feel extremely comfortable with our books and the records we have closed on fiscal 2007, as far as the completeness of all tax charges are concerned and there is no sign that there would be any material deviation to that going forward.</p>
          <p>The meeting as you see (49.46) SEC, I mean this is always something which is difficult to report on, because it is about perceptions &#x2013; the perception on our end has been it was a very good meeting and that &#x2013; let's say there is &#x2013; we had a very good meeting. And actually as a matter of fact also the SEC has endorsed our 20-F 2006, which I think they would not have needed to be &#x2013; to do, if they hasn't been confident that the company is moving.</p>
          <p>On the amnesty program, whether that would positively or negatively affect the SEC deliberations or settlement considerations, I would not think so, reason being that the company itself is moving forward with its remediation and introducing a robust compliance system all the way from the top to the bottom in all regions of this world and also test whether it had made it all the way down and once the company is done with that I think that's another time then to show to the government in the U.S. what the company has done on a company Compliance Program. The amnesty program is laid out as such that we understand potential wrongdoing by people and not by the company, so therefore I would not expect that to be materially affecting any SEC topics.</p>
          <p>Now the PG business and charges with regards to Framatome and there had not been any forward-looking charges on the &#x2013; on the Framatome part we have a joint venture with. However, we did book &#x2013; we did book a charge on the Finnish project and that's about 70 million in the current &#x2013; in the fiscal Q1 &#x2013; 70. The equity part of our revenue in Q1 was insignificant. That was about less than 10 million. So, there is no impact there, 70 million on PG's part for the Finnish project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just so I understand it, that's acting exclusively as Siemens as &#x2013; presumably as a supplier as opposed to via Framatome, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. It's a conventional island. It's about the steam turbine environment and that's got nothing to do with the nuclear part we are sharing with Areva.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and do we expect &#x2013; I mean presumably Areva are going to have to come back at some time and make further provisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's &#x2013; that's been something &#x2013; I think this question will be well placed with Areva, since they've got more visibility on the project. I think maybe one statement on the Finnish project, because that has turned out to be not exactly what one would wish for since we have already I guess provisions accumulated on the projects in the excess of 200 million &#x2013; 280 million actually, which is quite significant. The point here is that if and when there will be new projects with the same engineering layout as the Finnish reactor then this will pay back and the more the better. If this has been the first one that has been quite a lesson for Siemens and likely also for Areva, but that's something Areva needs to take care of. So, that's in essence how I see the project, I would say disastrous development, because it's been a new setup and people have learned obviously a lot and it was very costly. Going forward, if that layout &#x2013; that design can be applied to more projects, then this will get positive benefit but that would be the speculation, so we just need to see how it goes.</p>
