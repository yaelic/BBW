          <p>Good day and welcome to the Colgate-Palmolive Company Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call.  Today's conference is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgate.com.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Now at this time I would like to turn the conference over the Vice President of Investor Relations, Bina Thompson.  Miss Thompson, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Duane.  Good morning everybody and welcome to our Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Release Conference Call.  With me this morning are Ian Cook, President and CEO; Steve Patrick, CFO; Dennis Hickey, Corporate Controller; and Ed Filusch, Treasurer.  We will discuss the results for the second quarter and the first half this morning, excluding charges relating to the 2004 restructuring program and certain other items in the first six months of 2007.</p>
          <p>For the reported GAAP results with reconciliation to the results excluding the restructuring charges and other items in the second quarter of 2007 are included in the press release and the company's financial statements and are posted on the investor relations page of our website at www.colgate.com.  Comments about these expectations will also exclude restructuring charges but during the Q&amp;A, we will answer any questions including or excluding these items as you wish.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with our second quarter results.  Sales, operating profit, advertising spend, net income and EPS were all at record levels.  And as Ian said in the press release, every region contributed to our solid performance.  The strong momentum we have seen in the fast-growing areas of the world, Latin America and greater Asia Africa continues and we see no signs of a significant slowdown in either one.  Even in markets where the economic conditions are difficult, such as North America and Western Europe, our categories are still growing and in addition, we are growing market share.  Worldwide our market shares are up in toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash, bar soap, shower gels and dishwashing liquids.</p>
          <p>As you know, the challenge for all consumer goods companies this year is the relentless and unprecedented rise in raw and packaging material costs.  We have, as have our competitors, been taking price increases to offset those cost increases.  In this quarter, worldwide our pricing was up 4.5%, the highest in well over a decade.  It is, therefore, encouraging that we continue to deliver solid volume growth within our ongoing targeted range of 5 to 8% with the expectation that such growth will continue for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Gross margin in the quarter was slightly down.  In this current environment of pressure on gross margins we have redoubled our efforts to reduce our overhead expenses in addition to our many ongoing savings programs and our restructuring savings.  This has indeed happened so that we were still able to increase advertising a healthy 18% while delivering strong EPS growth well ahead of expectations.  Cash flow and the balance sheet are strong as well, another good indicator of a healthy business.</p>
          <p>So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America.  Our performance in North America is particularly encouraging given the current concerns about the economy and its related effects on consumer purchasing habits.  You read in the press release about a healthy amount of new product activity, which resulted in record shares for Colgate Total toothpaste and our manual toothbrushes.  In fact, for the quarter, our national market shares in the US as reported by AC Nielsen, increased year-over-year in toothpaste, manual and power toothbrushes, liquid hand soap, body wash, dishwashing liquid and fabric softener.</p>
          <p>We're excited about more new products scheduled to launch in the third quarter.  The first is Colgate Max Fresh with mouthwash beads.  This toothpaste offers innovation on three fronts.  It will be the first toothpaste with mouthwash beads.  It will be the only toothpaste sold in a clear tube and the carton will have a die cut to showcase the product inside the clear tube.  This new product, along with a companion Max Fresh manual toothbrush with a mint-scented brush handle and tongue freshener, will help to expand the Max Fresh portfolio in the important fresh breath segment.</p>
          <p>In Personal Care, we will be launching Lady Speed Stick clinical proof; a premium priced high efficacy deodorant with clinically proven wetness protection, nonstop odor control technology and a skin conditioning system.  It is packaged in a high-impact carton, which conveys premium image.</p>
          <p>In Home Care, shipping this week will be Palmolive pure and clear dishwashing liquid.  It is biodegradable with between 25 and 75% post-consumer recycled plastic and is endorsed by the EPA with a designed for the environment seal on the back label.  In addition, it is in distinct elegant packaging, which creates a unique and differentiating impression on the shelf.  All this new product activity will help us to deliver continued mid-single digit volume growth for the balance of the year, while we continue to take price increases where necessary.  Operating profit is expected to be up modestly for the third quarter and full year.</p>
          <p>Europe, the macroeconomic situation in Western Europe continued to be very challenging, which resulted in the modest volume growth in the division as a whole.  You may recall as well that volume was up 9.5% in Europe/South Pacific in the year ago quarter.  GDP growth in Western Europe is slowing while inflation has been increasing.  France and Italy are two countries which are the most difficult at the moment for all companies in our industry.  Volume in Central Europe was strong in the quarter and volume also grew in the South Pacific region.  So overall we still see category growth in Western Europe with both Oral and Personal Care categories growing and the Home Care category down slightly.  Category growth in Eastern Europe is still quite robust.</p>
          <p>We have been able to maintain our shares across the division, which is encouraging and as referenced in the press release, a number of premium price value-added new products have contributed to this.  As in the US, we are continuing to build the Colgate Max toothpaste line with the launch of Colgate Max White, which complements the already successful Max Fresh.</p>
          <p>In the Home Care category, we are launching our newest fabric conditioner, Magic Moment in France, Greece and Belgium.  And as you will hear shortly, this premium price innovative new product has been met with great success in Mexico.  Although it's still early days, results are encouraging and we hope to build on our already strong shares in these markets, which range from 30 to 50%.  Volume in Europe/South Pacific is expected to grow modestly in the third quarter and for the full year as well and operating profit is expected to grow in the mid-single, mid-to high single digit range for the third quarter and full year.</p>
          <p>Latin America; we're delighted with the continued strong performance in Latin America.  Across the region, our market shares have increased in toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash, bar soap and dish liquid.  It's also encouraging that year-to-date we still see good category growth with an acceleration over 2007 in the countries of Mexico and Brazil.</p>
          <p>As referenced in the press release our regional toothpaste share is up over two points from the prior year with virtually every country contributing.  Colgate Total Professional Clean, launched in 2007, is benefiting from strong second year support and is adding share, which is almost entirely incremental.  More new product activity in both toothpaste and toothbrushes is planned for the second half.  This includes Colgate Total Professional Sensitive toothpaste and Colgate 360 Deep Clean toothbrush.</p>
          <p>In the mouthwash category, we continue to make excellent progress as well.  On a year-to-date basis our market share is up over five points to 23.5% with the latest reading at 23.9.  In bar soaps we regained market leadership in the most recent period.  We achieved our highest shares ever in Mexico, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic.  And in liquid soaps, a small but fast-growing category, we've already clearly established a leadership position where we are over 20 points ahead of our nearest competitor.  In dishwashing liquid, our share is up slightly across the region and in Mexico; we've achieved market leadership in the most recent period.  On a year-to-date basis, our share is up about 1.5 points.</p>
          <p>I told you a moment ago about our recent launch of Magic Moments fabric conditioner in several European markets.  This new product was launched in Mexico in January of this year with a premium price that helped boost sales results.  Recent share readings in the self-service supermarket show Magic Moments with an 8.3% share of the market, the majority of which is incremental to the business.</p>
          <p>But looking ahead, we expect volume growth in Latin America to be at second-quarter levels for the third quarter and full year.  Operating profit is expected to grow double digits for the third quarter and full year.</p>
          <p>Greater Asia Africa; the momentum in this region continues with solid volume gains and market share gains as well.  Second quarter records were set on every line of the P&amp;L. In Greater Asia itself, volume increased in virtually every country.  Our overall toothpaste share for the region increased 20 basis points to 38.8.  We maintained leadership positions in China, India and Russia.  In Thailand, our market share is up almost 50% to 60%, up 160 basis points versus the prior year.  Our toothbrush market share in India reached a high of 37.2%, up 250 basis points versus a year ago.  In Russia, our toothpaste share reached a record 49.2%, up 270 basis points versus a year ago.  Across greater Asia, toothbrush market shares were up in eight of 13 countries.</p>
          <p>A new line of mouthwash developed for sales in the pharmacy has been launched in Thailand as a pilot test for the division and early results are quite encouraging.  In addition, as referenced in the press release, we've just introduced our GABA products in Russia where the profession is already endorsing these products.  In Eurasia, we continue to grow our priority category of shower liquids.  Our market share continues to climb, narrowing the gap with the market leader from 10 points in 2002 to about four points in 2008 year-to-date.  And we've launched a number of new products in this category, including Palmolive Amazonia which was developed in Brazil, and has helped increase share in that market by 160 basis points year-over-year.</p>
          <p>So looking ahead, we expect volume in greater Asia/Africa to increase at second quarter levels for the third quarter and full year.  Operating profit is expected to increase double digits in the third quarter and full year as well.</p>
          <p>Finally, Hill's; we are quite pleased with the volume growth of Hill's which was good both domestically and internationally.  Here in the U.S. consumption at the large format pet specialty retailers continues to be solid, which is very encouraging.  As you know, the challenge for all pet food manufacturers this year has been the very steep rise in commodity costs and this continued in the second quarter with the average increase in the U.S. over the second quarter of 2007 at around 30%.  We've taken substantial price increases around the world to help offset these cost increases as have our competitors.</p>
          <p>Our ongoing new products program, as outlined in the press release, offers consumers a wide range of value-added products, which should result in continued growth in Hill's.  In addition, programs such as our Alliance for Healthier Pets program, which we told you about last quarter, continue to generate awareness and support from the veterinary profession.</p>
          <p>Our outlook for the balance of the year at Hill's is for volume to increase low to mid single-digits in the third-quarter and full-year, operating profit is expected to be up several digits in the third-quarter and full-year.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we are delighted that the strong top and bottom line momentum from the first quarter has continued into the second quarter of 2008.  Our solid second-quarter results reflect the ongoing success of our four strategic initiatives; getting closer to the consumer, the customer and the profession, being more efficient and effective in everything we do, continuing to deliver innovative new products around the world, and building a strong team of leaders for today and tomorrow.  We look forward to sharing our continued progress throughout the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>And now, Duane, I would like to turn it over to the Q&amp;A portion of the call with a reminder to everyone that we would like you to start with one question.  Should you have a follow-up, you can get back into the queue for that.  So, Duane, we're ready to start.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question will come from Bill Pecoriello with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody.  Ian, could you go through the gross margin walk-through for the quarter, but then also comment on how you expect the components to change in the second half as more pricing moves through the P&amp;L, but you still expect the gross margin down modesty?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bill, good morning, thanks for a customary question.  I would just echo Bina's point in terms of the approach to the business overall. And say we are indeed quite pleased that our focus on the strategic initiatives is allowing us to grow our brands, build market shares in growing categories, generate the funds to increase our advertising support and still deliver strong double-digit EPS growth.</p>
          <p>But turning to the gross profit walk-through in specific. For the second quarter of 2008, Bill, you take the prior-year gross profit of 57.1%, favorable is pricing in the second quarter at 1.7%, 170 basis points, a 40 basis points pick up from restructuring, 160 from our funding the growth savings project with continued focus there. And then material prices at 430 basis points negative leading to a -230 with the pricing of the 170, with mix etcetera adding another 30 basis points which gets you to the 56.8, which is the 30 basis points down on the year.  So that's the composition of the walk-through of the gross profit for the quarter.</p>
          <p>As we look to the balance of the year, and as you saw in our external release, we have not only looked at the balance of this year, but also at 2009 as well. We have maintained commodity costs at the current high levels. And we have assumed oil for the balance of this year at around $130 for the second half. And obviously, we have pricing, most of which has been announced, built into the back half of the year, which will see our total year price up something between 4.5 and 5%.  And the combination of those assumptions and the pricing will see the gross profit for the balance of the year down around the same as we saw for the second quarter of this year. And we feel quite comfortable about the assumptions in that projection, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's more into the early part of '09 when you'll see the sequential improvement in gross margin, not into Q4 as the pricing moves through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, I mean we will have both the rollover effect of the pricing, and then of course, the actions we have planned for next year. Because in our assumptions we see oil, we project oil to move up to around 140. And all of that is built into the assumptions for next year, which will see gross profit begin to increase again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Nik Modi with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Ian, clearly consumption remains healthy in Latin American and Central and Eastern Europe.  Just curious on your thoughts on trade-up and the dynamics there, and if you're seeing any slowdown in consumer uptick in some of the premium price innovation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer is, so far no, Nik, we're continuing to see premium offerings regardless of geography, like Colgate Total, continue to grow.  I would make it very clear, as I have said before, that part of our strategy in emerging markets is to make sure we have offerings in all of the price segments that consumers shop in. Whether that is a sachet in a sari-sari or a kulmato store in the rural areas, all the way up to large size tubes. And also products that are in different price segments of the category; super premium, premium, mass-market price and entry-level pricing.  So we aren't seeing any slowdown in the consumers' interest in the higher value offerings, but we are well covered in terms of the portfolio we offer by segment in the marketplace.  And of course, we are staying very close to the consumer's behavior in that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question then is from Ali Dibadj [Sanford Bernstein].  Just one moment, I'll have his line open. Yes, Ali, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ali, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess one real quick question, then a quick clarification if I may.  One is I found it interesting that you mentioned 2009 just a second ago and also obviously in the release, since you have one again underneath you talked about one assumption you made obviously about oil. But the other two that I'd love to hear about how you're thinking around are foreign exchange for the first part which is clearly has helped over the past little while here. And secondly, elasticity on the pricing you're taking, particularly as we are starting to see some elasticity pain here in some of the categories as you're taking pricing. You could even argue in parentheses that some of the volume sustainability here is some of the retailers buying ahead.  So I want to get an understanding of foreign exchange and elasticity.</p>
          <p>The quick clarification question is you mentioned gross margins being down another 30 basis here for the year.  Can you give us a sense again about operating margin guidance like you did last quarter?  Do you still expect that to be flat or not?  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's more than one question, Ali, but I will try and take them on.  In focusing a little bit ahead to 2009 and foreign exchange, we have as you would assume for the back half of this year and into 2009, assumed a declining benefit from foreign exchange.  And as you might assume from us, you could say we have been potentially conservative in that regard, but nonetheless, we have assumed a declining ForEx capability in the go-forward.</p>
          <p>Relative to pricing and the consumer's reaction to pricing and elasticity, as we think about pricing in the market, and as you know we have taken 3% in the first quarter over 4% in the second quarter with second-half pricing now just beginning to hit the marketplace. So far, we continue to see our shares grow. So far, at least in the categories that we do business, we have seen those categories continue to grow on a dollar basis, maybe 3 to 3.5 growth is now 3% growth at the lower end than the higher end, but nonetheless, pretty good growth.</p>
          <p>And with the assumptions we have with the roll-over benefits of pricing from this year into next, we see us having to take substantially less pricing next year than we have this.  So the new pricing that will impact consumers will be substantially lower, about one quarter of pricing that we had to take this year. And as we look at the back half of this year from our point of view, as we said, we continue to guide the earnings per share in that mid-teens level. And that's with the gross margin you see there, that is with healthy levels of advertising expense, and that will see us delivering double-digit EPS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will be from a Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, two questions if I can.  First of all, can you talk about Latin America and the margins there?  They just kind of continue to drift down. And I just wondered whether that's a mix issue or whether you're just spending more, whatever it is, market shares look great.  But just wondering where those margins start to flatten out?</p>
          <p>And then can you just remind us, what's the percentage breakdown Eastern Europe versus Western Europe? Because it sounds like Eastern Europe is really carrying the day and I'm just trying to get a feel for just how bad Western Europe is in terms of top-line growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think Wendy, relative to Latin America, as we've said, I mean the profitability returned from Latin America is extraordinarily positive from a percent growth in EBIT, largely driven by a top-line growth and a little bit of gross profit. From an EBIT point of view, we have taken the view, as I've said before, to continue to invest in those terrific share growth positions on top of market growth and delivering a very healthy EBIT. And we don't comment on EBIT for the year in general, but EBIT for the year will be higher than the second quarter.  So that's Latin America, which we're very, very pleased about because the growth is across the board and the quality of the growth is very high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For example, just to follow-up on that, I mean but no reason for example -- I mean 27.6 is the lowest margin you've seen in that region for a while, but no reason to believe that the margin won't continue to drift down.  Do you think it stays north of 28 on a full-year basis for as far as we can see?  I mean there's nothing changing in the market dynamically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is nothing structurally, Wendy, other than our choice. And for the year, I see it north of 28.  So it's a choice, it's nothing structural.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And relative to the European environment, we see Western Europe flat to modestly down, and Eastern Europe up high-single-digits. And we're quite comfortable with that, as Bina said in her comments, Western Europe traces largely to Italy and France, which have structural category issues that we and others are working through. And we see for the second half of the year for Europe in entirety, a 1.5 to 2% of volume growth for the balance of the year. And I would of course remind you that the second quarter comes up against the highest comp of last year, which was nearly a 10% volume growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely.  But then -- and just the split, is Western Europe, in dollar terms, three times as big as Eastern Europe? How do you think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Western Europe is bigger, Wendy, but Eastern Europe is growing fast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I got it.  Thank you, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Filippe Goossens with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Ian and Bina. Great results, obviously.  If I may, a two-part question on Brazil.  Ian, as you know, there have been a few data sources out there indicating a slow-down in category growth in that country.  On one hand, you could argue that it could be a result of the introduction of the value-added tax, which is something that L'Oreal during their most recent trading update, again, referenced to.  Just kind of wanting to hear what you see as the impact of the value-added tax on that category slowdown?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I was wondering, our economists in Brazil have pointed out a growing concern with regard to food inflation, which is running right now around 17, 18% in Brazil.  Any take from your end, Ian, in terms of whether food inflation if sustained at current levels eventually could start having a negative impact on the purchasing power of consumers, perhaps not only in Brazil, but maybe in other parts of the world?

          <p>Thanks, Filippe.  Yes, the Brazil VAT matter, you have been most diligent and consistent on, so let me comment on that first and then let me come back to the categories through that.  As most people I am sure know, this is a VAT tax that is now being collected by the manufacturers as opposed to as historically by the retailers implemented on the personal-care business in the first quarter, our home care business in the second quarter. And it will be on the food business in the third quarter, although of course, we don't have food.</p>
          <p>It has really not impacted our business. We have clearly been very, very focused on it. And I would say there have been three reasons.  Number one, very early on and before entering this year, we had developed an internal training program in terms of how to implement and collect the tax with the retailers that we deal with right down to the price point impact by region of the country.  Secondly, we had no business interruption because we were able to invoice through SAP which included the VA tax directly on the invoice.  So it was a seamless conversion for us.  And thirdly, as we reach many of these small retailers by middlemen, we extended the training program to the middlemen so that they too knew how to execute the VAT tax at retail levels.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the most important point in all of that, is not the internal preparedness but rather the reaction in terms of category consumption, which for the second quarter on the personal care business consumption of our products was up some 9%, and on the home care business, some 8%, and the toothpaste remained at 9%.</p>
          <p>So leading that then on to your second question I guess in life you can never say never, but I must say so far we are seeing category growth rates that are in fact outpacing prior years on our business and no immediate signs of consumers trading away from or down from our products because of food inflation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a simple question on pricing.  I think you said that pricing helped 4.5% for the quarter and should help 4.5 to 5% for the full year.  Can you just kind of give us a gauge of what percentage of the businesses is now benefited from pricing in this quarter, I mean was it 25%, was it 50% versus the full-year pricing you're going to put in place?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, I really don't have a sort of distilled summary number on that.  We literally have lists and lists of by-category, by-geography where we have taken pricing where we have announced pricing but I don't have a distillation.  We have taken pricing I would say quite broadly, both geographically and across categories that have been impacted by costs both in the year-to-date and announced and planned in the year to go.  We can take that off-line and go through literally geography-by-geography but I don't have a distillation.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's balanced, we've had our pricing in the first half and pricing in the second half I would say that the majority of pricing in the second half has been announced and some significant increases, toothpaste here in the US &#x2013; pet nutrition here in the US for example, have been accepted at retail and are in the process of being implemented as we speak, so the majority of this is not on the come, it is announced and being implemented.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys.  Just wanted to try to get a feel for the dynamic between market share gains and category growth.  I know Ian, you've been saying Mexico and Brazil accelerated in category growth.  I guess -- are you seeing that across the company or has your share gain picked up speed in order to support your acceleration in top-line?  And also, what do you think is driving category growth, acceleration in Mexico and Brazil?  Is that just trading up in you -- in your products?  Because you guys are such a large part of the market?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I, pleasingly as we have said before, we do continue to see good category growth.  I think in the case of some of the emerging markets and Bina had mentioned Brazil and Mexico, specifically, I think that has to do with trading up and pricing in our business and the consumers staying with our categories.  We have in some markets around the world, as I said, seen modest slowdowns versus historical levels but still very, very good low single digit growth rates, particularly in oral care and personal care, which as you know, is the primary focus of our business.  And so the share gains are being delivered on top of still so far healthy category growth rates around the world.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Good morning, Ian.  The question is really the price elasticity, again and I'm sorry to beat this one to death.  But given your big price increase, we saw in the earlier scan data so it's only 15 days in July.  But it looks like in US toothpaste, as an example, your price increase was 2X realized what the competitors were.  So is there a risk that people aren't going to follow these increases or actually drag their feet on it since you're sort of the category leader?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's always that risk in life, Bill.  As I mentioned the last time you will remember there was even some debate about whether or not the United States another major manufacturer was or would take pricing.  Subsequently it was confirmed that they would and were because I made the comment that the cost impact was industry wide.  So ultimately, I think economic reality will see a need to take pricing in the marketplace and see it implemented in a world where retailers are accepting of the cost driven nature of the price increases and may there be a 15 to 30 day lag between manufacturers in terms of affecting the price increase, there may indeed be so.  But I think on these things, you need to be patient and make sure you execute what you plan to execute.  I can tell you that the sales progress at the beginning of this quarter is very solid around the world.  And so we're still quite comfortable with the balanced approach we're taking.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Good morning.  You said that the gross margin for the second half might be down about as much as it was in the second quarter.  Is it fair to assume it might be down more in the third quarter and less in the fourth quarter owing to the coming of pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be fair.  Our estimating is more balanced than that but that would be fair, Alice.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on to the topic about the consumer possibly shifting away from the high end.  I guess you haven't seen any shifting within Colgate from your value added, more expensive paste to less value added more basic versions of Colgate.  Do your assumptions in your guidance assume that the value added high end continue to gain share over the next six to nine months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our assumptions, Alice, assume balanced growth across all of our segments.  So there is not an overarching assumption in terms of premium leading the day.  We believe that at the higher priced offerings we deliver value that so far the consumer is prepared to pay for.  We see little progress of private label and where we have seen it, we see our shares continuing to grow, notwithstanding that but we're very focused, as I said earlier, on making sure that we are offering the right value in all of the segments that we operate in in categories from entry price points to the higher priced value offerings.</p>

          <p>In terms of pricing and commodity costs, this is probably a good problem to have and probably a question that would have sounded crazy about a month ago.  But if oil continues to fall, what happens to that windfall?  Do you guys keep it?  Does it get spent?  And what happens to the price increases you've already implemented this year?  If oil goes to 90, for example, next year and not 140?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, given the year we've been living through, why don't we have that discussion next year?  I would say as an aside comment, that I told you that our assumption was the 130 and then 140 next year.  My sense would be that from a list pricing point of view, there would not be a give back.  I think we'd have to work our way through exactly what was the oil price level, what was the scale of the so called benefit and how that might impact the marketplace.  I really in the world we are living in, prefer at least for planning purposes, to keep a more bearish view right now.</p>

          <p>Just quickly I wanted to ask you quickly about the overhead expense control that you alluded to.  I was just wondering if you could maybe walk us through what types of things you're doing and I guess to what extent they are sustainable or whether we're talking about paring back hiring or if these are more sustainable types of actions.  Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, it is a focal area.  It is something that we began when we announced our restructuring.  We said at the time that we had two thoughts on our mind.  One was efficiency and the other was to strengthen our end market capabilities.  So in strengthening our end market capability, we have seen fixed cost investment, overhead investment in our selling and marketing capability and with the consolidations that we have been putting in place from a sourcing point of view and other organizational point of view an offsetting benefit in the second quarter from savings elsewhere.  So the approach is structural and we are looking to have those benefits for the medium term.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I'm going to actually follow up on that since everyone's asking two questions, I feel like I will too.  On the overhead expense control, is the idea then, Ian, that the investments you've been making that you described, the rate of increase in those investments is now slowing so we're starting to see the efficiency benefits kind of show through that you've already been generating for a year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, Lauren, and I must say we're seeing the same inflation in the questions being asked as we're seeing in the business I guess.  But I would say, yes we put a very disciplined focus on making sure that whether it was selling capability, merchandising capability, detailing capability, that we had those resources on the ground.  And that is now well positioned, we believe, around the world.</p>
          <p>And secondly, we are stepping up our focus from an overhead point of view in the area of indirect expenditure, everything from computers to telephones, which has become a very sharp area of focus for us now and going forward.  But, yes, the investment commitment is pretty much in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great.  And then on funding the growth -- okay, one housekeeping question to throw out there is that there was a big jump up in other expense.  And just if you can tell us what that was and how we should think about that going forward?</p>
          <p>And then my real value-added question would be about funding the growth that the savings this quarter were much more than they were last quarter last quarter and actually quite a bit higher than we discussed after last call or last quarter.  So what changed that you were able to re-accelerate that program?  Because as I recall last quarter, we talked a little bit about it being that it was tougher to get procurement-based savings in this environment and that's been a key component of funding the growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer both questions, Lauren.  First on the other expense, we have, as you noted, taken some contingency charges for potential legal and environmental matters in different countries.  And secondly, have a higher minority interest income as a few minority businesses, minority interest business we have, have also been doing rather well and I would say that is not to continue in the future.  So that would be that.</p>
          <p>Relative to funding the growth savings, all I can say is it is an area, as you know, of intense focus in the company and we have redoubled our focus on that area starting since before we came into this year.  And I would say as we're going forward I think on the last call, I said that I figured holding it at around the 90 basis points we saw in the first quarter might be a conservative position to take.  I would venture to say in terms of some of the areas we are now focusing on our current forward projection would see us somewhere between the two.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just one question.  Cut me off if I ask a second question.   Just curious, not much mention of CBP lately and to the degree that played a role in the pricing you achieved the way you reported and the second quarter results or how that may affect the pricing of 4.5 to 5 for the year could you just talk about CBP as an impact on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm glad you raised that because far from being a low-key area it's an area that is we believe is picking up steam in the company.  We have now moved it around the world, we'll have over 70% of our business operating with Colgate Business Planning by the end of this year.  We will deliver the 100 million that we had talked about in terms of savings with Colgate Business Planning but I think more importantly to your point, it is becoming a facilitating tool in terms of how we not only implement list price increases but more importantly how we increase average selling prices by more efficient promotional activity.  And we continue to have many, many examples by the new geographies in terms of changing promotional techniques, changing the timeline of promotions being run.  And so it is very much vibrantly alive and playing a very important role in pricing strategy that we see today and that we plan for tomorrow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, I'm just trying to understand if there's a differentiation between taking pricing to offset cost of goods inflation and pricing that is coming through because of the CBP program. Is it an evenly split result?  Or are we currently experiencing predominantly pricing to offset commodity inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is clearly a significant increase in list prices being taken to offset commodity inflation.  There is also a focus on Colgate Business Planning which if I take you back, we have said not only affects price, not only affects therefore gross profit, but can also affect volume in terms of the way you manage your promotional trade spending because it's an ROI model not an absolute savings model.  So as we've said before Colgate Business Planning is in fact influencing differing lines of the P&amp;L and I wouldn't be able to unbundle between the two of them in the price line but it is fair to say that certainly in the current quarter and the next quarter that there is list price increases being taken to offset commodity inflation.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I'm wondering that as list price increases go into effect, if there will be some change in your marketing mix away from direct to consumer advertising and more to the trade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure they're mutually exclusive things Connie. And I'm not sure that pricing at least the way we think about it as a matter strategy would lead you one way or the other.  I think we believe that there is power in traditional to consumer advertising and the question is what is the best way by brand, by consumer segments, to reach that consumer and I think it's fair to say, regardless of pricing activity, that the store as we've said before the dental and veterinary professionals, these are important influence points in the consumer's brand choice.  So were constantly reassessing and reallocating our investment across all of those touch points but I don't think the fact that we are taking pricing is changing the way we would connect with consumers.  I think in today's world we are always thinking about what is the best mix of our investment to reach and connect with them.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thanks.  Kind of following up on Connie's, question.  The first question is can you talk about the A&amp;P target I think and hopefully you haven't mentioned this earlier but the 12% as a percentage of sales of the advertising.  Certainly you're getting a pretty good lift off of the top line so it might come in a little bit shy of that but that's the first part.</p>
          <p>And second can you talk maybe between that balance between advertising and maybe the promotional in-store merchandising and more the categories that are affected by private label and more value brands such as Home Care.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Jason, well two things, you will recall that when we talked about this 12%, we created it as an inspirational goal and it remains that.  And we said very much that the way we got to our advertising investment was on a bottom up basis market by market, trying to keep our share of voice which is if you will the share of spending that goes to consumers at competitive levels, depending on what we were doing in each market and what our competitors were doing.  And in this quarter, we are at about 11.7% in terms of that advertising level and based on what we see in the market I would say that we will finish this year around that level with the top line growth that we have in the market we foresee and we will continue to aspirationally move ourselves towards the 12%.  But we're very happy with the balance we're getting between investment, new products, pricing and volume as evidenced in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, when you talk about how you spend that money, frankly that varies by brand, it varies by consumer and it varies by the objectives you have at any point in time.  Macro, I would say you're seeing more digital because digital is proving to be a very efficient way of targeting and engaging with consumers and you're seeing more at retail because that is a terrific touch point to reach the consumer at the moment or just prior to the moment of purchase.  But each of these decisions is made by marketing plans developed for brands on a country basis.  So it'll be different market by market and it will be different brand by brand but if there is an underlying suggestion that some of the traditional media like television advertising and magazines as was kind of raised three or four years ago is going away, that is absolutely not the case.</p>

          <p>May I just add a housekeeping question on the interest expense at 25 million.  I know there was some refinancing out there but can you just talk about, there's a pretty big discrepancy between last quarter, this quarter and certainly you did buy back stock in the period.  Just wondering how we should think about that going forward?  Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I'm just digging out the exact numbers.  It's the change in commercial paper costs, simple terms.  Rates are down from mid-single digits to very low single digits and that's the benefit we're getting.  I think we may have mentioned this previously on a call but that's where we are, and that's what we see for the balance of the year.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from Linda Bolton-Weiser, Caris.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  It was interesting the comments you were making Ian about the Latin America region and thinking about EBIT growth rather than EBIT margins and certainly you're getting really good return on investment on your marketing spending.  So I'm curious as to whether we should think about that concept for Colgate as an entire company?  Maybe very modest if maybe even no EBIT margin growth going forward but very robust top line and EBIT profit growth?  Can you comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can, but I shan't.  I think where we would focus, Linda, would be to say that in these unprecedented times, we are I think in a very focused, disciplined way through cost savings, pricing, mix, Colgate Business Planning working our way back to an increasing our gross profit which we expect to do in 2009.  Continue the focus we have on the overhead part of SG&amp;A, and to your question, that will give us the option as to how we construct the rest of the income statement while delivering the solid double-digit EPS growth next year.  And we haven't begun our budgeting process yet for 2009 and I think we will we will be addressing those issues as we go through that.</p>
          <p>So no philosophical change at this time, understand the question, our focus is on gross profit to decide how we best plan the business going forward in 2009 to deliver that solid double-digit EPS growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That sounds good.  And can I just ask about inventory?  It was up about 18% year-over-year.  Can we expect that to remain high for the rest of the year or is there anything going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's up year-on-year, it's down quarter-on-quarter and it relates to some of the sourcing transitions we're going through, and in this particular quarter it relates to new product launches actually in Latin America that required pre-build of inventory and that was approaching one day and our call on the year is to see that inventory flat for the year at this quarter's level, so no increment.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, thanks for taking a follow-up.  I wanted to ask about and I understand you don't want to touch operating profit for a company, but you do talk about operating profits for example from North America and I was struck by the fact that last quarter it was supposed to be operating profit dollar up mid-single digits, now it's operating profit dollar up modestly for the year and if you back out what you've done over the first couple quarters, that's operating profit dollar potentially even down for the back half of this year and I'm trying to understand what is driving that.  Is it the advertising spend being 12% and kind of ramping up for an innovation? Is it maybe Colgate Business Planning is going up against its comps? Is it forward buying by the retailers so you expect volume to be down? Is it some sort of restructuring to go after overhead?  I know it's a long list, but I guess my question is very shortly, why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is if you go back to 2007, the first comment to be made is that the operating profit in the third and fourth quarters was you may recall very high double-digit, secondly of the operating profit for the balance of the year is not negative in the United States, it is positive and that relates to a combination of gross margin pressure and the investment that we choose to make in the business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Thanks for taking it, I just wanted to real quickly on the advertising spend again.  I know you said that you'd be thinking around 11.7% at the end of the year, just to clarify do you mean that the year 2008 will see advertising at 11.7% sales or do you mean Q4 levels will be around there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question Chris, I would say that for the full year of 2008, we will see advertising around the same level as this quarter for the full year.</p>

          <p>Ian just in the area of the commodities, I believe in the past your hedging has been fairly limited, mostly in the area of corn or Hill's related. Has that policy changed as you're looking forward here? You seem rather secure in your commodity outlook into '09 in terms of margins, so I'm just wondering has the hedging policy changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The hedging policy has not changed, Alec, and your recollection is correct, we are well hedged and locked in on prices for Hill's. We tend to take a one year view on these things and manage the rest with our long term strategic relationships and through the income statement, so there has been no philosophical change in hedging.</p>
