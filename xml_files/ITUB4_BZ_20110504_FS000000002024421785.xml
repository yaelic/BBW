        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello. Good morning for those who are in the U.S. Good afternoon for those who are in Europe. It's a pleasure for us to be back and share with you about our first quarter results.</p>
          <p>For those who are following through the presentation, we are in slide number two, starting with the highlights for the quarter. The first one is the result. The recurring net income reached R$3.6 billion in this quarter. What it means, ROE annualizes of 23.4%, that means an increase of 7% when we compare to the fourth quarter of 2010, and the net income of R$3.5 billion in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The second highlight is our loan portfolio. The portfolio finished with R$345 billion in this quarter, that means a growth of 3.2% &#x2013; 22% &#x2013; 3.2% when we compare with the end of 2010, and almost 22% when we compare with the first quarter of 2010. It was a strong and solid growth, the growth was higher than the market, and we continue to focus more on the middle companies and individuals.</p>
          <p>The third is the financial margin. The financial margin was R$10.8 billion with our clients, a solid number for the quarter. And when we compare to our monthly increases, it was 17.2%. In the quarter, this margin with clients was almost flat. Banking fees totaling R$4.5 billion, with an increase of 11% in 12 months.</p>
          <p>Fourth highlight is the NPL and results of loan losses. The NPL for 90 days remain in the same level for the third quarter in a row at 4.2%. I think it's related to the mix of the portfolio that we have. We have seen some deterioration, especially in very small and small companies. We signalized in the last months &#x2013; in the last conference call, in the guidance that we provided, that we are seeing and expecting some duration in delinquency because of the increase of the interest rate and macroprudential measures taken by the Central Bank. So, we &#x2013; it was under our expectations from the duration in the numbers. The total number is okay, 4.2%; when we have seen, as I said, from the deterioration especially in small &#x2013; and especially in very small companies.</p>
          <p>For this, we made in this quarter R$270 million in provisions above the minimum required by the Central Bank. It relates to the methodology that we adopt when we consider the potential losses of the revolving credit that we have. So, we continue to expect some deterioration in the next quarter. We expect to make some additional complementary provision in the next quarter, but we expect the total number of the bank to stabilize around 4.5% during the year. So, it's not a huge deterioration, but it is a deterioration that we expected due to the conditions that we are seeing now in the economy in Brazil. This complementary provisions achieved R$5.1 billion, considering these new provisions that we made in this quarter.</p>
          <p>The fifth highlight is the non-interest expense. In the quarter, when we compare to the fourth quarter of 2010, we saw a decrease of 8.1%, due also to seasonal issues related to the first quarter. And we saw 2010, we seeing this was an increase of 19%, what is higher than the guidance that we provided for this year, around 12% &#x2013; it was 13%.</p>
          <p>In the fourth slide we can see tables from managerial financial margin and service fees. In the quarter this number remained almost flat, a 1.2% decrease, but a growth of 12% when we compare to 12 month.</p>
          <p>Loan losses, R$3.2 billion, an increase of 21.7% due to the new additional provision that we made in this quarter that I already said in the previous slide.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses, R$7.7 billion, a decrease of 8.1% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide number five, we can see net interest margin with our clients. A decrease in the quarter from 12.2% to 11.7%, but it's still a very good number, and this is related especially to credit card, that we have a very strong position in the market of credit card. And in the first quarter, you can see that this also happened in the first quarter of 2010 that we show a decrease especially related to the credit card business. But it is our expectation that the net interest will be back to the previous levels in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Banking fees, stable in the quarter, also related to accounting services and credit cards.</p>
          <p>ROE, 23.4% in the quarter. It was a good quarter, and this number is no longer our expectation for the future.</p>
          <p>On the slide number six, you can see the growth of the total assets, 3.7% in the quarter, 23.5% in 12 months. Also related to securities and also related to the growth of the credit portfolio that was very strong in this period.</p>
          <p>Stockholders' equity, R$63.7 billion, a strong growth of 4.7% due to some gains that were accounted directly in the stockholders' equity in this period.</p>
          <p>Loan portfolio, 3.4% in the quarter. And as I said, our growth was higher than the total markets released by the Central Bank, and almost 22% when we compare to the 12 months. And the funding, a growth of 3.3%, deposits and client money under management in the period in this quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide number seven, we can see more numbers, more details about our results. I think it's important to see the financial margin with clients, and as we said, a small decrease in this quarter, but strong number when we compare to the fourth quarter of 2010, was almost stable. I think it's important because first quarter is very strong in terms of business with clients, is strongest in terms economic numbers and for the bank. So, I think we have again strong numbers related to the business that we do with our clients.</p>
          <p>What was down, it was margin with the market, the treasury, structural and proprietary, that show a decrease in the quarter when we compare to the fourth quarter, and also when we compare it to the first quarter of 2010. So, I think in terms of financial margins, the numbers are good, the numbers show some decrease, but the number of clients, I think in our view, is the most important, it show a very strong and solid number.</p>
          <p>Also, I think it's important to see the results from the insurance business, that includes pension plans and capitalization and not home insurance &#x2013; it's additional &#x2013; with a number of 10.6% in the quarter was very good.</p>
          <p>Loan losses, as I said, we made some additional provisions in this quarter related to the loss that we expected for the coming months. And also, I think recover credits written off was good when see the numbers for 12 months, 44.9% achieving R$1.2 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And non-life interest expense, reduction of 8.1%, I think in line with the target that we have, that will be closer to have more efficiencies in the coming years. Just to remember, that our target that we announced in the first &#x2013; when we released the 2010 numbers is to achieve 41% in efficiency ratio by the end of 2013. So, we continue to work hard to achieve this efficiency value.</p>
          <p>The recurring net income, R$3.6 billion. Some small non-recurring event. So, the net income that we released, R$3.5 billion for the quarter, now due as a very strong number related to &#x2013; especially related to client piece.</p>
          <p>On slide eight, we can see the loans by type of client. We continue to focus on personal loan. Credit card, as I said, first quarter usually not strong because of this very strong use of credit cards in the Christmas period and the end of the year. So, we continue to focus on individuals. Very close with the macroprudential measures taken by the Central Bank. At the end of the year we had some &#x2013; we suffer a little in this segment in terms of credit, even though the number of the sales of new cars, record in Brazil, but the lack of financing reduced due to the measures that the Central Bank announced in December.</p>
          <p>Mortgage continues to be strong, and we expect that this will be the trend again this year, at 15% only for individuals, and 62% when we saw the numbers compared to March of 2010.</p>
          <p>In terms of companies, the news this quarter is strong corporate business, that was the growth 4.2%. Also with some improvements with the market for developers, that is included in this numbers. But anyway, the corporate business is very strong as also the capital market is not so strong for companies. But anyway, we continue to focus both in segments.</p>
          <p>Small and very small companies and middle market continue to be our targets, especially the middle market; very small and small, we reduce a little the pace of concessions of credit, and in this quarter related also to some expectations in the duration of the delinquency especially in very small companies. So, we reduced the pace, but we continued to focus our growth especially with middle companies.</p>
          <p>On slide number nine you can see the trends of the NPL for 90 days. The third quarter in a row with the same average number of 4.2%, but we can see that for individuals the number continues to get better, specially related to the mix that we have and also related to new car financing and mortgage that usually shows less delinquency.</p>
          <p>It's not the case when we saw the numbers for companies; companies increased from 2.9% to 3.1% when we compare the last quarter, especially related to small and very small companies. In terms of middle market and large companies, the numbers continue to be very good.</p>
          <p>Coverage ratio for 90 days, 173%, which seems to be a strong number, even though we reduced when we compare to 2010 September when the number was 196%. But anyway, it's a very comfortable number in terms of coverage.</p>
          <p>R$22.2 billion in provisions for loan losses. Of that, R$5 billion additional above the minimum requirement of the Central Bank regulation. And write-offs of R$4.1 billion in the first quarter of 2010 (sic) [2011].</p>
          <p>On slide number 10, we can see that we have very comfortable allowance for loans losses. The number that we have in terms of total provisions are very comfortable for us. When we compare to the total portfolio, there's now in 7.3%; that give you a good cushion to continue to grow the portfolio.</p>
          <p>And when we can see also the result of loan losses compared to the financial margin, 26.9%, very &#x2013; with a good reduction when we compare to the peak that was in the second quarter of 2009; the peak number achieved almost 41% &#x2013; that was the peak of the financial crisis that started in 2008.</p>
          <p>Coming to slide 11, we can see the funding. As funding continued to be not an issue for the growth of the client portfolio, we continue to find the more funding from clients, especially retail, that was our basis for <mark type="indiscernible" /> deposit and also then the growth from our portfolio mentioned on here. The total funding in terms of deposits and assets under management and technical provisions, R$810 billion, 3.3% when we compare to the last quarter. That was a good growth. When we consider all the instruments and also our free capital, the total number is R$1.057 trillion.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, there you can see banking fees revenues in line with the expectations for the first quarter. And we continue to believe that due to the economy growth for this year that we expect to be something between 3.5% to 4%, and this number be in line and continue to grow in the same pace as you can see, even go a little bit higher as we can see in the 12 months &#x2013; compared to March 2010, that was 11%.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expense is on the slide 13, 8.1% in terms of reduction. I think it's important to notice that we increased our personnel in 1,800 new employees, specially relates to the middle market operation and the expansion of branches that we opened. And even with this, we continue to have a good number in terms of personnel expenses this quarter. Administrative expenses also was an important reduction when we compare to December 2010.</p>
          <p>So, we continue to work hard to achieve this level of 41% in terms of efficiency ratio. We can see on slide 14 our efficiency ratio in the quarter, 47.8%. And in 12 months it's still 49.5%, is above the number that we would like to have. But we continue to believe that we are going to reduce this efficiency ratio to something around or a little bit below 47% for this year.</p>
          <p>Evolution of our BIS ratio. BIS ratio, 16.1%, very strong. Both in terms of secure and tangible and Tier I, very strong numbers. And we have a pending approval of R$2.6 billion of Tier II in the Central Bank. If we configure this number, the BIS ratio would be 16.6%. So, in terms of capital, I think it's not a little patient for Ita&#xFA; Unibanco to continue the growth of the business, especially related to credit to our clients.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, you can see the managerial numbers, the pro forma numbers for the four segments that we usually reveal. We can see in the first quarter of 2011 that R$3.6 billion in recurring net income. R$2.3 billion came from our commercial bank; R$665 million from Ita&#xFA; BBA &#x2013; that is our corporate and investment banking operation; consumer credit, R$425 million; and treasury and excess of capital, R$218 million. So, you can see the result, and all the numbers are very good, especially when you see the numbers related to clients' piece.</p>
          <p>To finalize, the market capitalization, average daily trading, we appear to have a very good liquidity both in New York and S&#xE3;o Paulo, and our market capitalization by the end of the quarter, R$175 billion.</p>
          <p>That's until now that we would like to leave it to show you, and also we are open now to questions that you probably have for us.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alfredo, good morning. One question on the interest margin. You explained that to a large extent this was seasonal, and you would expect that because it's related to the strength of your credit card business and it happens almost every year. But my question is, did you have in your budget and your expectation for the year this type of decline? Because you guided for 250 basis point improvement in the cost/income ratio for the year as a whole, and it's difficult to imagine that happening if the NIM doesn't rebound in a quite meaningful way in the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>You did say in your remarks that you expect the NIM to recover, but I want to get a sense if the decline of 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter surprised you and was a bit more than you were expecting or it was pretty much factor in the way you thought about the year as a whole when you gave that guidance for the cost/income ratio improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, [foreign language], good morning. Yes, it's very much in line what we had in our business plan for the year. It didn't surprise. If you also take a look in the last two years, one of them showed in the shot here just presented by Alfredo, last two years we had a drop of 30 basis points from 2009 &#x2013; '08 to '09, and 40 basis points from 'from '09 to '10.</p>
          <p>Now it's 50 bps; this is very much in line with what the normal seasonality of our NIM behavior. It's also very much linked to the credit card business &#x2013; you know credit card business is very impacted in the first quarter since we came from the most important quarter to the less important quarter.</p>
          <p>It's also a consequence of the selectivity process that the bank has been doing, and also is a consequence of the vintage maturity. Of course when we take a look in the total portfolio, the very old portfolios of vintage that are now running off are those with the highest level of NIM. And as we had anticipated, this is a trend that should be compensated in volumes, and this was exactly what happened in the quarter. If you look at the total management clients, this is flat. So, NIM was compensated by that was not a surprise, very much in line with the budget, totally aligned with other guidances we made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you do expect this to have a meaningful rebound in the rest of the year that would likely make the first quarter NIM the low point as has been the case in prior years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question is a bit more on the spike on the delinquency, early delinquencies &#x2013; the delinquencies that are up to 90 day, which cause you to conservatively increase your excess reserves that I assuming you expect to consume later in the year as those early delinquencies become real delinquencies. Could you elaborate more what's behind it? Part of that is seasonal, I imagine, but not all of that is seasonal.</p>
          <p>So, it was a bit more of what we had seen in prior years in terms of spike in that early delinquency ratio in the first quarter of every year. So, what's behind it and &#x2013; because the guidance Rogerio gave of the NPL ratio as a whole may reach to 4.5%, so only in a region of 30 basis point, seems a little too optimistic in line with what we saw in the early delinquency bucket in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's a seasonal impact in this number as well, as you mention, but in 2011 was a bit more than the other years. So, more than seasonal, but considered and anticipated when we made the presentation on the last year figures.</p>
          <p>So, it's again, it's just part of the overall picture we had. Just now it's been captured by our model; we have adapted the model based on our expected losses, a strong December 2010. It's now capturing now in our models. One of the indicators that shows that is the 31 to 90 days overdue &#x2013; not only this one, but this is a much clearer one to show, and it was there. So, it's really a little bit more than seasonality, but was captured in this movement.</p>
          <p>And if &#x2013; of course, when we talk about a deterioration in the portfolio, what we do believe is that this is not actually a strong deterioration. What we see is a slight increase in delinquency during the year; so maybe 20, 30 days are the only ones we have now, but we cannot anticipate precisely the size of this movement. What is important is that the expected loss model captured this, and captured not only for the provisioning methods, it's also driving our selectivity, our pricing and it's the business of the bank &#x2013; it's not only provisioning, it's just a consequence of this. What I think is important to make an obsession is that we move based on the markets we anticipate we'll see, so we take all the decisions to protect the results of the bank based on the scenario we are foreseeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you say that given your models and what you have seen, despite the fact that the early delinquency is up to 90 days, have increased more than just what seasonality would indicate? Do you feel comfortable that the NPL ratio over 90 days should not increase more than an additional 30 basis points or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point in time, it's possibly 20 bps, 30 bps. We are not sure about this figure of course, but what we do know is that this is being more monitorized and capturing the model. So, it's quite a comfortable position right now, Daniel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Considering also the mix of the portfolio, Daniel, don't forget that we are changing the &#x2013; we have been more selecting, considering small and very small companies; we are still growing in mortgage; new cars, that continues to have low level of delinquency. So, I think this expectation is more related to the credit that we provided before, not the credit and the spreads that we are doing this last months, especially in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alfredo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Jason Mollin with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. My question is also a little bit on asset quality. You mentioned that you're seeing this deterioration a bit on the small side of the SME segment. If you can talk about what you're seeing &#x2013; is there any segments that you're seeing more of industry, or what kind of companies are you seeing this slight deterioration in asset quality?</p>
          <p>And my second question is also on the side of &#x2013; you talked about this previously on the other call, but just in terms of expenses and synergies after the merger, if you can give us an update on where you might be seeing some of the synergies coming through in some of your discussions. In your MD&amp;A you talked about data processing. If you can give us a bit of an update on that front. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, hi, Jason. Rogerio. So, maybe it's better if we make a split between individuals and corporations. In individuals we have some signs of increasing delinquency. However, you know we are moving from a riskier type of credit to a safer type of credits, particularly with important increases in auto loans, particularly on brand new auto loans, and also in the real estate mortgage business.</p>
          <p>So, what gives actually a sort of a mitigation of this impact when you look at individuals, but we also identified some movements in individuals' portfolio not impacting too much our Ita&#xFA; Unibanco portfolio but we do see in the data from the market &#x2013; and actually you also could see when based on Central Bank figures just posted.</p>
          <p>If you look at corporate, the large corporations are not suffering anything out of this macroeconomic scenario right now at least. And if you look at the smaller companies, particularly on those very small companies, yes, they suffer more than the other segments. Once again, what drives our selectivity process, what drives our target to further penetrate the markets.</p>
          <p>I am sorry, you have a second question on synergies, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question on, yes, on synergies, if you can just give us an update on where we've been and where we &#x2013; what kind of progress you might be seeing or be confident of in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I think the affirmative here is so far for good. We had a normal decrease because of seasonality in the first quarter. This normal decrease, it's 4% or 5% &#x2013; we had a drop of 8%. What it starts to show some improvement, and if you look at this segments, as you mentioned, you can see insurance, for instance, we showed some improvement in combined ratio and some improvement in order process, also credit card as a consequence of the integration of the seven platforms into just one. So, it start to be seen. Of course, and it's fair to say most of the movement in expenses in the first quarter was due to seasonality.</p>
          <p>On the other side, on the planning side, I think it's worth to be mentioned that we have developed the plans which each one of the managers of this bank so is now engaging all the levels of the managements, and the targets are there &#x2013; part of the remuneration schemes and part of the targets for everyone over the next months. So, we are quite confident that we are going to deliver on the guidance.</p>

          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. I do have a question on your margin; there's something that's not clear to me. You mentioned that the decline this quarter was due to credit card seasonality. However, if I look at your spread, your rate on spread-sensitive end products declined 80 basis points first quarter versus fourth quarter. This is in the context of overall industry spreads that increased 390 basis points, and your credit card loans fell 1%. Now go back to last year, last year the spread reduction was only 40 basis points; so half of what we saw this year. However, last year, spreads in the industry were growing &#x2013; sorry, were declining a lot; spreads actually fell 190 basis points in March of 2010 and your credit card loans fell 2%. So, I would have expected, given all of these numbers, that the impact on the credit card would have been significantly lower than last year, and it doesn't seem to be the case &#x2013; it actually seems to be the opposite.</p>
          <p>So, there's something still that I don't understand on what's happening to your margins, especially because spreads have increased a lot in the industry. So, I'm wondering if this has to do rather than with the credit card seasonality, more with the fact that consumer lending is growing much slower than overall lendings, particularly corporate and commercial which have lower spread, and therefore, we may continue to see this below expectations margin going forward. I don't know &#x2013; I'm really trying to understand what's happening, but certainly there's something else here than the credit card. So, I just wanted to get your color on that. That's the first question; I'll ask another one later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jorge. Well, I'm not absolutely sure that I understood your first question, but I think you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I can repeat it, no problem. Do you want me to repeat it, I'll repeat it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. Let's make it &#x2013; and you just confirm if my understanding is correct. I think you are looking at the portion of our net interest margin explanation that addresses the spread sensitive and not the interest rate sensitive portion. Am I right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I am, yes. But if you look at net interest margins, it's the same thing, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I think it's much better if we look at net interest margin, because whenever we look at one of these portions, we have some impact due to the way we show this figure, because in the interest rate portion we show what we could name the floating spread we do. And the spread is from the treasury price, the internal transfer price. So, if you look at the aggregate, that's what I was saying that the drop was 50 bps, quite similar to the 40 bps showed last year and 30 bps showed in the previous year. And this was &#x2013; it's very much in line with last year but was a little bit bigger because we have been moving that in the credit cards penetration. So, the credit card is increasing this impact in the mix of the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So, your margins fell 50 basis points this quarter; this in the context of interest rates that went up in the economy, of spreads that went up 390 basis points, and your credit card portfolio that fell 1%. But if you look at last year, last year your spreads fell &#x2013; your net interest margin fell 40 basis points, however, interest rates were flat and spreads in the economy fell 190 basis points. I'm not understanding how this has to do with credit cards; it doesn't seem to be related to the credit card otherwise we would have seen a different impact. So, trying to understand what else is impacting your margin beyond this credit card issue and then what the expectation is for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>And my concern &#x2013; and this is where I wanted an answer &#x2013; is does this have to do more with the fact that consumer credit is growing more slower now, and it's expected to grow much slower during the rest of the year than your corporate credit which has a significantly lower spread and therefore we may see subdued margins for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jorge, I was mentioning credit card when giving additional colors on seasonality. You were right, it's not only seasonality, it's also a production of the selectivity process we have been doing in that portfolio. It's also a process of the vintage maturity process. We had some very old vintage that are now running off. They were contributing to a higher level of spreads than the very less one. And the very less ones, since the last quarter, they have been growing in terms of spreads in the origination. So, I should add not only seasonality, but also the selectivity process and the vintage.</p>
          <p>So, at the end of day, we never &#x2013; we always said that if you look long term, this compression in net interest margin is possibly to come. It's not a short-term or maybe not even a medium-term issue, but it's going to be noticed over time. And what we have always said is that any movement in net interest margin should be compensated through higher volumes, and this was actually by coincidence or not, it was exactly what happened in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So, if you look at the net interest margin, it was compressed at 50 bps, but once compensated, if you look at the total margin with clients, this line was actually flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So, let me move on. My second question is on your effective tax rate. It was 28% in the first quarter of 2011 to 29% in 2010. What are your expectations for full year 2011 and full year 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's 27%, 28% for this year. In the first quarter was a little bit lower than this. And if you look in comparison with fourth quarter, was actually is a stronger difference because in fourth quarter was a bit bigger than this average. So, it's 27%, 28% is the right number to be used in the earning model for this year.</p>
          <p>And from next year, a portion of our social contribution &#x2013; that you know, the tax credit, et cetera &#x2013; is going to be &#x2013; most likely is not going to be sufficient to irrigate the full year. So, we should see some increase in the effective tax rate as from 2012. Hard to precise right now the figure, but almost sure that is not going to be below 30%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, 30% is a good number for now, or...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I'm going to ask very similar questions. So, sorry if I keep beating a dead horse. First on your NIM progression, it's a follow-up to Jorge's question; I'll try to make it a little bit more simplified. But how quickly should we see the impact of higher lending spreads in the system filter their way through your net interest margin?</p>
          <p>Obviously we started to see higher lending spreads show up in the Central Bank data, but that's obviously just for new loans, not for your entire portfolio &#x2013; and as you've mentioned in the past, the durations on those loans have lengthened, so it takes awhile for that to filter through. Should we be seeing higher lending spreads starting to benefit your net interest margins in the next quarter, or is it still a couple quarters away before we see the NIM progression really benefit from the higher lending spreads you're seeing in the system?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on your asset quality, I'm a little confused here because you guys have just given 30 basis points increase; your competitors are saying delinquencies aren't going to go up this year. If I look historically, across different cycles, you've never had an NPL cycle where NPLs only have increased 30 basis points. They've historically increase substantially more than that.</p>
          <p>So, I'm a little confused because you're more conservative than your peers but you're arguing that this cycle is going to be, from a historical standpoint, a very, very shallow cycle. So, I'm just curious how confident you are in terms of your own projections about the increase in the delinquency rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, net interest margin, we should see from now some improvement. It's not going to be a very strong recovery, because the portfolio is very big. So, the impact of the recent vintage with the higher level of spreads is going to be noticed over time. It should impact marginally. It should be more noticeable to the right side of the driver, and should be more observed in the second half of the year, and then increasingly.</p>
          <p>In terms of the quality of the credit, this increase of 20 bps, 30 bps in the NPL is not precise actually. Based on the data we have now, what is important to reaffirm is that based on the expected loss model, we have price, we have changed, we have applied all the impacts of the models, not only in the provisioning, but also in the pricing in the selective policies by the bank. So, we should also see some consequences of this changes in our behavior towards or in favor of this NPL movement.</p>
          <p>It's also worth to note is that we have been changing the quality of the portfolio differently from other bills you should be observing, because what we see now is a slight deterioration in the NPL, but on the contrary, we have a movement in changing the mix of the portfolio what could reduce a little bit the impact of these movements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you're wrong &#x2013; if you think you're more likely to be wrong in that delinquency rates will be higher or delinquency rates will be lower than your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we see now, Saul, is that &#x2013; this is very much linked with the macroeconomic conditions in Brazil. So, what we see as most likely during the next quarter, because of this spike in the inflation, we can see some increasing in this trends. However, in the second half of this year we should see their other way around movement, so we should start to &#x2013; delinquency should start to improve in the second half. So, to better address your question, I think we can be &#x2013; we can need additional provisions, eventually in the second quarter and most likely in the second half of the year, should be in the other way around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what you're pointing to here is that net interest margins are going to benefit more from higher lending spreads likely in the second half, and your asset quality is going to &#x2013; could get better in the second half. So, you're &#x2013; it sounds like you're very optimistic about earnings progression. Those two comments suggest you're pretty optimistic about how earnings will progress in the second half. Is that a fair assessment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I should say optimist, not pretty optimist, because I am referring to small movements in all the directions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's not that it's going to be seen when jumps up or down. It's a slight movement in the second quarter and a slight movement on the other way around in the second half. It's normal behavior of the Brazilian economy. It's very much aligns with what we are observing in the inflation. So, inflation is now hitting its peak probably in the year, then in the second half should be backwards to the range of the target inflation by the government.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. You talked a bit about the progression in expenses quarter-on-quarter. I was wondering if you could help me understand the year-on-year change in expenses, and also I guess fee income, because the expense growth was pretty significantly above the annual target you guys gave at the end of last quarter and the fee income growth was a bit below &#x2013; I think it was 11% instead of 14 percentage points.</p>
          <p>So, I'm wondering if that's also something that &#x2013; I mean, it's going to have to improve later in the year in order for you to meet that guidance, so I was wondering if you could tell me maybe what didn't work this quarter and what's going to change throughout the year to help you get in line with this target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jonathan. Expenses are now when we take quarter-on-quarter is now higher 19%, our guidance is up to 13%. It should be back in line to the guidance by the second or most likely the third quarter, and the reason for that is that we had in the second and third quarter of last year very strong expenses figures due to the migration, and those are not going to be repeated this year. So, we will back to the guidance by the second or most likely the third quarter. It was actually part of the calculations when we announced the guidance.</p>
          <p>Same when referring to fee income, fee income is now actually closer, it's 11% quarter-on-quarter; our guidance was 14% to 16%. Normally, fee income accelerates as from the second quarter, so we should be soon inside the guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. So, most of my questions have been answered, but in terms &#x2013; I didn't see you provide your guidance again, so I'm assuming that the guidance that you provided at the end of the year still remains. My question then becomes, with your loan growth, I think you guided back then a loan growth of 16% to 20%. Since then I think your economists have reduced the GDP forecast for Brazil, and also we have seen the introduction of more macroprudential measures. So, I was just wondering, do you have any reason to be reducing your outlook for loan growth this year?</p>
          <p>And I'll also like to ask, so far from the macroprudential measures implemented by the Central Bank, judging by the data from the Central Bank, we have seen very little impact. Do you work off a base case were more measures could be implemented? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario, thank you. The guidance &#x2013; you are right, the guidance announced was 16% to 20%. This guidance was built up based on the overall picture of 15% growth in the market. We &#x2013; although it's right, we have a different view in terms of the GDP growth. It's not going to be different in terms of credit growth is going to be close to 15% if the measures put in place are effective to that, and so far, they are being effective to that. So, we are maintaining, we are keeping our 16% to 20%. What is actually big enough to accommodate is more movement, and those are not different from the scenario we had when we announced the guidance.</p>
          <p>We disagree with the point that the measures were not strong or not effective in terms of demand. The impact in our overall origination for auto loans was important if you consider first quarter this year. On first quarter last year, we had to reduce it 15%, not only because of the macroprudentials, is a very mature portfolio. So, we had 5% to 10% growth in auto loans. It's going to be more or less like this, but the impacts due to the macroprudentials, they are noticed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, then you are assuming that no more macroprudential measures are implemented?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is not exactly known. We don't know what's going to be done. But it seems, based on the minutes of the meetings at CEF, it seems that is going to be much more interest rates raisings instead of use of macroprudential. You read, I read, everyone reading this. This is the picture. But it's the way I mentioned before, so I think that final chapter of this book is the 15% or close to 15%.</p>
          <p>So, more or less macroprudentials, more or less interest rates should be towards this target anyway. But we, based on the history we see, we believe it's going to be increases in interest rate and not use of macroprudentials in this use.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. Thanks for the opportunity. Most of my questions have been answered, but I have one question regarding the profitability of your consumer credit business. I mean, look at slide number 16, there was a significant reduction in the RAROC for that segment. And I know it seems that the allocated capital has increased, but I was wondering if you could explain what is driving that profitability down.</p>
          <p>I don't know if here you are probably reflecting the higher capital requirements for the vehicle finances. So, if you can elaborate on that. I mean, are you seeing any pressure in any specific subsegment within consumer credit or maybe it's just provision. So, I would appreciate your feedback on that. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the main reason you just mentioned, the main reason was the capital allocation process that was changed during this quarter. But it was also impacted by the seasonality movement that I mentioned in the net interest margin aggregates for the bank. It impacts much more this column to any other one because this consumer credit is very much credit card business.</p>

          <p>Thank you all for your participation. We had a good quarter related to our clients' business which having strong numbers related to taking up with clients. I think we are expecting this slight deterioration in credit portfolio and provisions for loan offers. But it's being under control; I think we have been more cautious since we announced that we were expecting the deterioration when the Central Bank started to increase interest rates some months ago. So, we have been more selective. We have improved our pricing models. We have improved our provisions models. So, we think everything is under control. We continue to believe that the economy will grow 3.5% and will provide a good environment for banking in Brazil.</p>
          <p>So, we continue to be confident that we are going to deliver a good numbers for our shareholders in terms of results and in terms of efficiency ratio in the coming quarters. So, we continue to be very confident in the operations and solid numbers that we have been releasing quarter-by-quarter and we will for sure continue to release in the coming quarter.</p>
