          <p>Good morning, everyone and welcome to our Fourth Quarter Results Presentation. This morning, our CEO, Ossie Gr&#xFC;bel and our CFO, John Cryan, will be presenting our results to you. After the presentation, we'd be very happy to take your questions. First of all we'd like to take questions in English from the telephone. After that, we'd be happy to take questions from our audience here in the room. And then obviously any questions in German, we're very happy to address as well.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to Ossie, I'd like to draw your attention to this slide. It's our cautionary statement with regard to forward-looking statements and I'd ask that you read it in detail.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to hand over to Ossie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Caroline.</p>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and everybody who is attending the call. Thank you very much for participating in our fourth quarter and yearly result conference.</p>
          <p>I also would like to, for the people who are here, to introduce Tom Naratil, our future CFO. If you would stand up and say hello to everybody. So now you have seen him that he actually exists.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, in 2010 UBS achieved a net profit attributable to shareholders of CHF 7.2 billion compared with the loss of CHF 2.7 billion a year ago. Or you can say we had a turnaround of CHF 10 billion.</p>
          <p>Our return on equity for 2010 was 15.9%, and considering the markets and the higher capital requirements, that is quite reasonable, I would say. But looking back at 2010, I also would highlight that we made our fixed cost target of CHF 20 billion, which we announced in 2009.</p>
          <p>Our net new money has continued to stabilize during the fourth quarter and I am quite positive for 2011.</p>
          <p>Today, UBS has one of the highest capital ratios with a Tier 1 ratio of 17.7%, but as we all know, we have to grow considerably higher there in the future. As a result of these achievements and the efforts of our staff, client confidence in UBS is increasing again, and I think we will see more evidence of that in 2011.</p>
          <p>That said, the results for the year were not entirely satisfactory for us. We still have considerable work to do in all divisions to achieve our ambitions. Many challenges remain, but that makes it interesting as well.</p>
          <p>The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and clients' confidence into markets is still relatively low. As a result, activity levels are low, much lower than we expected, but higher client activity levels are of critical importance for &#x2013; to our profitability. In addition, the regulatory frameworks are changing fast and it becomes more evident already today that there will hardly be a global level operating field.</p>
          <p>The process of determining new regulations is also likely to take considerable time and costs. But one thing is clear, the banking industry will be forced to make big changes and we will have to change with it. But foremost in this environment, we need to focus on our client needs, deliver our global and integrated banking platform and provide solutions that address their concerns.</p>
          <p>We still have to work hard on that. The newly created investment products and services team is now fully operational and is crucial to future growth and success. Another example, how we want to serve our clients better is the global family office group, this unit will give wealthy families more access to our Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter result was a net profit attributable to shareholders of CHF 1.3 billion, also generally improved is not yet meeting to the high standards we want. However, the result includes an own credit charge of CHF 509 million.</p>
          <p>Now let me go in &#x2013; I won't go into too much detail on the performance of our business in the quarter, as John will give you the results in detail later. But would like to highlight briefly a couple of developments.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management, revenues were up as brokerage and trading income improved from the low levels in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to generate strong inflows from the Asia Pacific region and globally from our ultra high net worth clients. And I am particularly pleased about this trend and optimistic for this year.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management Americas, transactional revenues increased due to higher client activity and management account fees on the back of an improved invested asset base. And the net new money trends continued to improve here as well.</p>
          <p>Our Investment Bank had a performance, while improved and considerably improved, is clearly not yet satisfactory for us. Here we have to work hard in 2011, which will include lowering the cost/income ratio. But there are some bright spots in Investment Banking.</p>
          <p>Client activity picked up from the low levels of the two previous quarters leading to a 17% increase in revenues. Some of our businesses, particularly in the IBD, we had a great performance due to higher equity capital markets and advisory activity. However, as I just said before, we are aware that we must improve significantly 2011.</p>
          <p>It is my expectation that the investments we have made in many areas of the Investment Bank, particularly in our FICC businesses, should start to pay off and generate more value to our shareholders this year.</p>
          <p>Our retail and corporate businesses in Switzerland showed stable revenues and our asset management business improved its investment performance. We expect retail and corporate to continue with stable profitability and asset management to profit from its investment performance.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, let me say few words about compensation, not because it's the flavor of the season, but I want to point out to you that our performance contingent bonus pool for the year 2010 is 10% lower than a year ago.</p>
          <p>We will continue to compensate high performers according to market, but we will clearly distinguish between those who create value for the bank and others.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we have every reason to approach the future with confidence. UBS has a wide business model, client-centric and proudly diversified with a global footprint. And we are well positioned and also have the right spirit to capture growth in all of our business.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll hand over to John.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Ossie and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to take you through the detail of our results.</p>
          <p>Here are the highlights for the fourth quarter performance. We're reporting net attributable profit of CHF 1.3 billion or diluted earnings per share of CHF 0.33.</p>
          <p>At the pre-tax level, we made CHF 1.2 billion, after taking a charge of just over CHF 500 million for the own credit effect on our financial liabilities that we measure at fair value.</p>
          <p>Net new money, as Ossie says, is stabilized and we have plenty of grounds for optimism of outflows in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Before I move on, there is a generic point that I wanted to make that you should bear in mind when considering the fourth quarter results. This is the effect of the significant appreciation of the Swiss franc against other major currencies.</p>
          <p>For example, the Swiss franc appreciated 5% against the U.S. dollar and 7% against the euro throughout the quarter. This had an important effect on our invested asset bases, our balance sheet, our risk weighted assets, and the foreign currency translation account in equity.</p>
          <p>At Wealth Management in Swiss Bank, we saw some slippage as a result of credit loss expenses incurred in a small number of cases. At Wealth Management Americas, the results were held back by a significant increase in litigation provisioning. In Global Asset Management, we did see some improvement, but we strive for more.</p>
          <p>And as Ossie said, the Investment Bank's results disappointed, although a modest profit is an improvement on the third quarter performance.</p>
          <p>We benefited from an overall tax credit for the quarter, as I guided in Q3, we took into account the pro rata credit for Q4 from the re-measurement exercise we conducted on our deferred tax assets during the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we recognized deferred tax credits net of amortization of CHF 391 million in respect of U.S. and Swiss tax losses.</p>
          <p>The benefit of booking up additional deferred tax assets was partially offset by current tax expenses paid on the group's profits in the quarter of CHF 242 million. As a consequence, we were able to record a net tax credit for the quarter of CHF 149 million through the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>The corporate center result reflects a gain of CHF 153 million on the revaluation of our option to acquire the SNB StabFund, and a CHF 158 million net gain on the sale of a property in Central Zurich.</p>
          <p>The net profit attributable to shareholders fell CHF 374 million quarter-on-quarter, but the underlying picture is rosier. Operating revenues actually improved significantly by CHF 780 million before own credit. The main factor driving the lower bottom line result quarter-on-quarter was the change in tax credit following the recognition of the deferred tax credits in Q3 that I just referred to.</p>
          <p>Q4 also saw an increase in own credit charges, higher credit loss expenses in the Swiss Bank and in the IB, and the increase in litigation provisions.</p>
          <p>As I said, the expenses in the quarter were adversely affected by a total of CHF 230 million for provisions taken against litigation cases against regulatory investigations and other related matters.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management Americas, overall we took provisions of CHF 152 million, mostly related to the sale of principle protected notes. In the Investment Bank, we took an increased provision against expected losses from the repurchase of certain U.S. mortgage loans for which we've already taken a provision in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In the corporate center, we took a further provision in relation to derivatives trading with U.S. municipalities, a business we exited some time ago. And in Wealth Management, we accrued CHF 40 million of expenses in connection with the Swiss Confederation's request that we reimburse it for its costs incurred in providing administrative assistance in settling our dispute with the authorities in the United States of America.</p>
          <p>Personnel expenses in 2010 amounted to just short of CHF 17 billion. As you can see there on the right hand side of the chart. The bonus pool for the year was CHF 4.3 billion, a reduction of 10% from the pool of CHF 4.8 billion in 2009.</p>
          <p>Of that CHF 4.3 billion pool, there are several adjustments that are required to arrive at the accounting charge for the year. After a minor adjustment of CHF 84 million for post vesting transfer restrictions, approximately CHF 1.6 billion of the pool is at risk for recipients. And so its recognition for accounting purposes is deferred to future periods. The proportion of the CHF 4.3 billion pool charged in the performance year is therefore, CHF 2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>We also had to charge the accounts with the part of the deferred expense brought forward from prior periods that needs to be recognized in 2010, and that was CHF 1.5 billion. The IFRS charge for the year for bonuses was therefore, the CHF 4,156 million number that you can see on the chart.</p>
          <p>Taking all compensation plans in place at the year-end, together with the deferred awards, we are planning to grant this quarter for the performance year 2010, the total amount expected to be recognized in future periods is CHF 2.8 billion. And of this amount, we expect approximately CHF 1.6 billion will be charged to 2011, with the remaining CHF 1.2 billion carried forward to 2012 and the years thereafter.</p>
          <p>As the industry continues to be required by regulators to defer to future periods, the vesting of the greater proportion of bonus awards, so the fixed proportion of the overall accounting charge for personnel expense will increase.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we set ourselves a target for reducing our expense rate to CHF 20 billion or below for 2010.</p>
          <p>We define the target in relation to expenses, excluding bonus accruals and significant non-recurring items. We achieved that target, but we were assisted in doing so by currency depreciation, particularly in the USA and the UK.</p>
          <p>Our overall expense base, including bonus accruals was just short of CHF 25 billion for the year, equivalent to roughly CHF 100 million for each working day.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the divisions. Wealth Management saw a recovery, but not a full recovery of client activity levels, as evidenced by the 18% quarter-on-quarter increase in transaction related revenues.</p>
          <p>Net interest income has stabilized and is slightly improving as actions we took in the treasury and a slight steepening of the yield curves have improved our income from deposit replication. The recurring portfolio fee income is still under pressure, in particular from currency movements that have more than offset the good market performance of invested assets.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax profit in Wealth Management improved 7% on an underlying basis, if we exclude the CHF 40 million accrual we made in expectation of having to meet the costs of recent administrative assistance from the Swiss Confederation.</p>
          <p>As the chart shows, expenses have been steadily increasing over the year as we've responded to market pressure for talent overall in the Wealth Management Industry.</p>
          <p>And I would expect this underlying trend to continue as we increase the number of client advisors. Although inflows into invested assets matched outflows in the fourth quarter, I do believe the situation has stabilized and there are grounds for optimism that we will see more noticeable positive net flows in future, in spite of some net outflows in Europe.</p>
          <p>However, the performance of Asia Pacific and the global ultra high net worth segments in 2010 was pleasing, with each recording net new money inflows of over CHF 10 billion, although there is some overlap between these two categories.</p>
          <p>We saw a recovery in gross margins in the fourth quarter to 92 basis points per annum. The improvement was largely driven by the overall increase in transaction-based revenues. We saw a small increase in interest margin, partly attributable to the increase in lending.</p>
          <p>We continue to work on our account and product fee structures with better application of risk based pricing. The balance of invested assets at the end of the fourth quarter was 2% lower than its starting point for the quarter. Good market performance added CHF 13 billion, but this was more than offset by the CHF 32 billion reduction from foreign currency depreciation against the franc.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management, 31% of our invested assets were denominated in euros and 31% in US dollars as at the year-end.</p>
          <p>The Retail and Corporate segment turned in another steady performance in the quarter, though the result was marred by a few credit loss expenses. We took action to absorb the pressure on interest margins from the continuing flat yield curve in Swiss francs.</p>
          <p>Revenues before credit losses were up CHF 22 million, as trading revenues and fee income recovered from the low levels over the summer. Expenses increased, but mainly as a result of increased IT and finance costs. The cost/income ratio for the quarter was 55%, a little higher than the average for the year of 53%.</p>
          <p>Revenues in Wealth Management Americas improved by 3% on the third quarter, notwithstanding our 4% fall in the average value of the dollar in the period. The improvement in local currency was 7%. And this was driven by higher managed account fees and overall transaction-based fees, partly offset by a fall in revenues from municipal securities trading.</p>
          <p>Recurring income was 62% of total operating income, in line with the prior quarter. And the annualized gross margin improved by 3 basis points to 80 basis points.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increased by 2% quarter-on-quarter. As mentioned before, litigation provisions were CHF 152 million. Personnel expenses rose in dollars, reflecting higher amounts of grid-based compensation for FAs, partly offset by slightly lower bonus accruals. And the number of financial advisors increased slightly in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Net new money inflows were CHF 3.4 billion, a 10-fold improvement on the third quarter, assisted by another quarter of same store net inflows. Under the US convention, where dividend and interest income were included in net new money, we recorded net inflows of CHF 8.8 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Invested assets ended the quarter at CHF 689 billion, CHF 4 billion lower than at the start. This was despite strong market performance, which added CHF 27 billion, and net new money adding the further CHF 3.4 billion. The net reduction was driven by the 5% depreciation of the dollar over the period, which took CHF 34 billion off the balance in Swiss franc terms.</p>
          <p>Revenues in Global Asset Management increased 15% on the third quarter result. All business lines saw an improvement. Performance fees were up strongly, reflecting good performance in several strategies, but principally in A&amp;Q, in Single and Multi-manager products and in Global Real Estate.</p>
          <p>Personnel expenses rose by CHF 38 million on higher bonus accruals that were mainly driven by performance fee sharing arrangements in A&amp;Q. We also took a severance charge &#x2013; a CHF 9 million severance charge in France.</p>
          <p>Net new money inflow were CHF 1 billion. Despite this, invested assets fell by CHF 8 billion to CHF 559 billion, as negative currency impacts more than offset good investment performance.</p>
          <p>The overall gross margin for Q4 was 39 basis points per annum, up by 6 basis points on Q3.</p>
          <p>In Fund Services, we saw net inflows of CHF 16.5 billion and assets under administration ended the year at CHF 390 billion.</p>
          <p>The IB's reported result, a pre-tax profit of CHF 75 million, was disappointing and falls far short of our ambitions for the division. The improvement over the loss recorded in the third quarter was mostly driven by an uptick in revenues in IBD, especially in equity capital markets.</p>
          <p>We took a charge of CHF 509 million from our own credit as our cash curves tightened. Although the change in debit valuation adjustments on our uncollateralized derivative liabilities were immaterial in the quarter, as our CDS curves closed the quarter largely in line with where they'd been at the prior quarter end.</p>
          <p>We incurred a net CHF 108 million credit loss expense. This was mainly driven by permanent impairment charges taken on assets held in certain private US student loan trusts, where we hold auction rate certificates.</p>
          <p>Non-personnel expenses increased as we took an additional provision against demands to repurchase certain mortgage loans in the USA.</p>
          <p>Revenues in equities improved slightly, although in a very weak third quarter. Cash trading revenues did improve somewhat on better volumes of client orders.</p>
          <p>In derivative trading, we saw modest improvements partly as a result of new business activity. Prime brokerage revenues were marginally down quarter-on-quarter, though we saw a slight pick-up in securities lending income. ETD revenues fell on lower commission levels and lower net average spreads.</p>
          <p>Revenues in FICC, although slightly improved, remained disappointing in markets that were affected by uncertainty about the peripheral Eurozone countries and the effects of the second round of quantitative easing in USA. This seemed to keep client activity subdued.</p>
          <p>Revenues in credit fell quarter-on-quarter, though we saw strong results from client flow trading. Client demand for structured credit product was muted following an active third quarter.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets had another weak quarter, perhaps reflecting reluctance on the part of our clients to take on risk. Better results from FX and structured product sales were more than offset by weak performances in emerging market trades and emerging markets' credit.</p>
          <p>Other FICC revenues were negative CHF 52 million compared with negative CHF 127 million in Q3. Overall, our legacy books contributed positive revenues of approximately CHF 100 million, largely stemming from the release of credit valuation adjustments to replacement values on swaps with the monoline insurers. The balance of other revenues was driven by a small negative impact from DVA on our negative replacement values, and predominantly by losses on hedges held at fair value.</p>
          <p>Client revenues in IBD and global capital markets increased to a little over CHF 1 billion, a 75% improvement quarter-on-quarter. The performance of equity capital markets was particularly strong after a weak third quarter. We increased our advisory market share and improved revenues by 19% over the previous quarter on billings in relation to several large transactions.</p>
          <p>The client revenues were tempered by a mark-to-market charge on the hedges we hold against our franchise lending book, following a general contraction in corporate credit spreads.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel II basis was 17.7% at the end of December, on risk-weighted assets of CHF 199 billion.</p>
          <p>From the 1st of January this year, we're required to report to FINMA on a Basel 2.5 basis. Largely as a result of the incremental risk charge and the incorporation of stress loss factors into regulatory VaR, the Basel 2.5 risk weighted assets at the end of December were approximately CHF 70 billion higher than they were under the Basel II basis. Combined with an incremental Tier 1 capital deduction of CHF 1 billion, our year-end pro-forma Basel 2.5 ratio was 12.7%.</p>
          <p>Now, notwithstanding our regulatory capital shortfall against the proposed future Basel III requirements, it's our intention to approach FINMA during the coming quarter, to request permission to call for redemption the US$500 million hybrid Tier 1 instrument that becomes eligible for redemption on the 26th of June this year. We increased our core Tier 1 capital over the quarter to CHF 30.4 billion, and it now represents 15.3% of our Basel II risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>This slide contains the movements in the quarter in our IFRS consolidated book equity. We saw negative movements across all of our OCI accounts. The foreign currency translation account was mainly impacted by the fall in the value of the dollar against our reporting currency. Our portfolio of US and some UK government bonds held as available for sale were also negatively affected by FX moves and in particular, by the fall in the market value of US treasuries.</p>
          <p>The portfolio of fixed receiver swaps that we predominantly use to manage interest rate risk on our deposits in Wealth Management in Swiss Bank, and for which we obtain effective hedge accounting treatment, were adversely effected by the steepening of the yield curve in US dollars in the quarter. This reduced the replacement values of those swaps. And the change in their fair market values was deferred into our equity account through OCI. The replacement values were also reduced in Swiss franc terms by the appreciation of our reporting currency against the swaps currencies.</p>
          <p>Overall, not withstanding the net profit of CHF 1.3 billion generated in Q4, our equity attributable to shareholders fell by almost CHF 1 billion to CHF 46.8 billion, the vast majority of the decline attributable to the two factors of the steepening of the US dollar yield curve and the rise in the value of the franc against the other major currencies. However, over the year, we increased our book value per share by 14% and our tangible book value per share by 23%.</p>
          <p>I'd like to conclude with a few remarks on our funding position for 2011. In the course of the year, approximately CHF 10 billion worth of senior bonds are set to mature. In addition, we plan to call a US$1.6 billion lower Tier 2 issue, whose first call date is in April this year.</p>
          <p>To replace maturing debt, we plan to issue new bonds to the tune of around CHF 15 billion. Two weeks ago, we successfully issued $1.75 billion of fixed and floating notes into the US domestic markets. We will issue opportunistically for the rest of the year in markets whose terms are attractive and in currencies in markets that diversify our self funding sources. This overall volume is in line with the volume of issuance in 2010.</p>
          <p>As part of our plans for 2011, we will also look at the covered bond issuance markets in euros and US dollars, again subject to market conditions. We will continue to make good use of the structured note market. We would expect to issue in excess of CHF 50 billion of new debt under our MTN programs, again roughly in line with 2010's volumes.</p>
          <p>Now that concludes my presentation. But with that, we have some time, as Caroline said, to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, John. Now go over to the questions on the telephone first. Telephone operator, do we have any questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>First question from the telephone is from Mr. Kinner Lakhani, Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Yeah, first question was on the Wealth Management recurring margin, down a basis point versus the prior quarter actually, expected a slightly better performance there. So, maybe if you could just provide some color on that?</p>
          <p>Second question, just on the FICC business. As Mr. Gr&#xFC;bel said, clearly we're going to be operating in an uneven playing field. How does your FICC business then compete effectively if we do have an uneven playing field and Switzerland clearly being at the sharp end of that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Wealth Management margin, we must not forget the strong effect we have of the Swiss franc strengthening there, and also that the quarter was a little bit better in transaction volumes, but not as good as the first two quarters. We still have our target to achieve a minimum of 100 basis points there. And I think, with a little bit of general trust coming back by the clients into the market environment, which is not yet there as I mentioned, I think we should get there. And if there's never FICC competition, how can we compete with other countries who have much lower capital requirements? That clearly is one of the questions we have to solve and in the next few years because these capital loans certainly will come into force in the next five year and so. But I think that &#x2013; think that has to do with the structure of the company. And also I think the investment banking business probably generally will change a little bit and will not necessarily be the same in five years time as it is today. So, it is too early to give you any exact guidance on &#x2013; some guidance in that respect. Then, John, do you have anything to add there?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't, I don't think so. I think that's a fair response. It's &#x2013; the Swiss capital ratios are definitely higher than most other countries are demanding and we have to get smarter about how we make money in fixed income.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Two questions, please. Just the first one sort on following on from the previous question. I know you've got this 100 basis point target for the gross margin in wealth management, but how quick can you get there through, for example, pricing actions without affecting your net new money inflows?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just a general one on capital management. I know you've reiterated in the report that you don't want to pay dividend for some time to come. But given the rate of Core Tier 1 accretion, and I know currency helped this quarter, can you be &#x2013; give maybe a little bit more color about when you think you might return to a dividend? Or what else you might use the capital for? For example, the staff fund. Or what level of Basel III Core Tier 1 you might look to run at in excess of the 10% minimum. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First is the wealth management margin and I'll leave the second question to John there. I think we should be able to reach our goal during the course of this year actually and &#x2013; but the market and the activity, market activity is very much depending on that. But the measures we have taken and we &#x2013; and the services we will transfer to or we'll be offering our wealth management clients this year, I think we should make it possible to reach the target. John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, I think on the second point, we show you group consolidated capital figures &#x2013; and you are right, from a group consolidated number, it looks relatively strong. But I think our view internally is that we need to have regard for where the capital sits within our group as much as the overall consolidated picture. And at the moment, there is still too much regulatory uncertainty as to how much capital we may need with the business model going forward, whether remote booking of a lot of our investment banking business and our core booking center in London will remain, what the impact of the Dodd-Frank Legislation in new asset is and whether we would need more capital in subsidiaries of the group?</p>
          <p>And so we think that it's prudent for the time being to hold back on dividend payments, even relatively small ones, and to accumulate as much capital as we can, as soon as we can, such that there will come a stage when we feel that we are adequately capitalized and the capital is sitting in the right places. And then we can resume dividend payments at a rate that keeps us happy that the company is probably capitalized but properly divides the returns the company makes between all of its stakeholders and particularly gives a reasonably good yield to the shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-on from that, I notice your Basel 2.5 risk-weighted asset, you described it CHF 70 billion or little bit more than the CHF 50 billion you told us last quarter. Is there any reason for that change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it will fluctuate quite significantly quarter-on-quarter, depending on the mix of business we have in our books that constitute the regulatory VaR and the incremental risk charges.</p>
          <p>Generally speaking, credit trading is a little more expensive and so the more &#x2013; proportionately more credit trading we have on the books in a quarter, the bigger the increase between Basel II and Basel 2.5 would be. But it's within the range, it's slightly wider, I agree, than the number we guided a year or so ago, but it doesn't come as a surprise given the mix of business we had on the books during Q4.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. One question, really, there is a bit of concern in London this morning, I fear, that the FICC and the equity's revenues are effectively rebating. There is some voice saying, "Well, it's going to be very difficult to go above CHF 1 billion of FICC or equities revenues." So in that extent, isn't the target at this stage way too ambitious? Not really your fault, but really the way the market is evolving, the way &#x2013; the fact that you have the same pie, which has to be shared by all these banks.</p>
          <p>And a follow-up to that question would be your regulator has been quite public about these doubts about your long-term targets. So, do you believe that in light of that, you would have to revise these down some extent in the near future? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jacques-Henri. I don't think we have to revise any target at the moment and which we just confirmed in November and looking forward to see you in November again this year, and then we can talk about that.</p>
          <p>I think in revenues, in fixed income trading or in equity we must not forget that during the year, during 2010 we made a lot management changes and hired a lot of people. Until that all smoothly functions &#x2013; it takes some time. So I would expect that we are during the course of this year, take some market share back. John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would agree with that, Jacques-Henri. I'm not sure about fixed income revenues at all. It's more of an argument in relation to equities, which used to earn twice what it earned from a similar market share pre-crisis, but in fixed income, I still think there's an awful long way to go.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. You've talked about a cost reduction plan in the investment bank. Could you give a bit more sense about how material this would be? Is this so &#x2013; a matter of trimming expenses across the board or are there certain businesses likely to be reconfigured or de-emphasized?</p>
          <p>And then number two, any update on whether you have any plans to buyback the Stability Fund from the SNB, and whether that's possible for later on this year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the second question, the SNB fund, again we have agreed with the SNB that we leave the situation unchanged at the moment, and there is really nothing further to say, neither from us nor from the SNB.</p>
          <p>John, on cost reduction in the IB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on cost reduction in the IB, we &#x2013; the focus this time last year was very much on recruiting, rebuilding fixed income and a push for revenue recreation across the Investment Bank. And I think now has come a time of consolidation. Costin is issuing some notes internally, saying that the focus is now back on the cost/income ratio. It's not to say there was no cost control, but we were looking to rebuild, and I think we're moving into a consolidation phase.</p>
          <p>I think strategically, we always need to look at the detailed business mix, whether individual business lines down to an individual desk can be successful, whether the market supports our presence. And so there will be constant recalibration on a desk-by-desk basis of the businesses that we're in within fixed income and even within equities. But I don't think there are any major moves planned. It's more a consolidation of what we've built to-date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. Next question, please.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Kian Abouhossein J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I've got a few questions. First of all, in Wealth Management, how much of your assets would you say are now in cash? Wealth Management International.</p>
          <p>The second question is more on cost. The CHF 20 billion cost target that you achieved this year, should we assume it's reasonable to assume a similar number for next year? And in that context, how are you looking at staff numbers, both in the group and in particular within Investment Banking developing in 2011 relative to 2010?</p>
          <p>And the last one is related to cost in the IB. It looks to &#x2013; what is &#x2013; assuming revenues do not improve, and we have again a tough environment in fixed income equities, what is Plan B to bring your comp ratio more in line compared to your peers? What would you discuss in November, if you're having a similar year as this year in revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, on Wealth Management Assets, in cash, it is roughly between 20% and 25% at present. And so &#x2013; but it could be that there are a lot instruments &#x2013; cash equivalent investments, so. But actually in cash we have around 20%, 25%.</p>
          <p>CHF 20 billion cost target, we will continue. We will not let up and lean back and so on. We will continue clearly to make sure that throughout the bank, we will become more efficient, and so personnel costs most likely will go up because there's a clear trend in the market on higher salaries, because bonuses are coming down. And there's very little we can do about.</p>
          <p>But fixed costs, we will continue to find better solutions, run the bank more efficiently. And I would think with what we still have to do there, that we can stabilize cost or even lower going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And there is not much to add to that. We would expect that the cost base this year would run at &#x2013; the overall cost base would run at around about the CHF 25 billion mark. The medium-term targets are therefore predicated on us making something of the order of another CHF 8 or so billion in revenues per annum. We've got some flexibility on the cost base. But as I mentioned earlier, some of that flexibility is gone, given the amount of bonus that we defer in accounting recognition.</p>
          <p>I think on the non-personnel expenses, the only question mark really would be on litigation charges. This would &#x2013; all our litigation expenses in the fourth quarter relate to our businesses in the US, and that's, to some extent, not a number that's entirely within our control. But otherwise I think we've got the lid on most of the non-personnel expenses.</p>
          <p>And then on the personnel front, we do what we can to keep the number low, but we need a performance pool, and that performance pool will only exist if the company performs. So it goes hand-in-hand with revenues.</p>
          <p>But we think the CHF 25 billion rough overall expense base is something we can manage, but it means we need to target for the medium-term revenues at CHF 40 billion and upwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you comment also on the IB side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think a lot of it, we made &#x2013; what &#x2013; before own credit, about CHF 32.5 billion in revenues last year. And I think a large proportion of the GAAP to CHF 40 billion, say, should be made up by revenue generation in the Investment Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but that's a revenue call. Assuming that revenues don't improve, then you will end up assuming a similar yield, with the highest comp ratio in the industry. What would be Plan B?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we need to look at, given there's relatively little flexibility in the cost base for the current configuration of businesses, we'd have to look to emphasize and de-emphasize certain business lines within the Investment Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think also, on what you call Plan B, then we have to cut very quickly expenses, and I think we are much &#x2013; in a much better situation today than we had been before to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Jeremy Sigee, Barclays. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, thank you. Just a couple of quick questions, please actually.</p>
          <p>Just on your capital requirements, I think FINMA's been clarifying &#x2013; so sort of cash grew you two to five banks for the sort of mid-size and smaller banks.</p>
          <p>In terms of your future capital requirements, could you just &#x2013; I assume you're still expecting the sort of 13% equity plus six of CoCos. So is that still the case? And secondly, what's the sort of timing and the process from here through parliament for that to be confirmed?</p>
          <p>And then second question, just coming back again on sort of IB head count, which is down 1% in the quarter. Just I may have missed, but I don't know if you said what you see the outlook for IB head count from here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think with the capital, clearly certain businesses you cannot do at &#x2013; certain plastics &#x2013; capital requirements. And certainly investment banking business. So if we want to continue to do them, we have to find a separate solution for these businesses and a separate company, and outside Switzerland, very clearly.</p>
          <p>But I think that will go through parliament &#x2013; what has to go through parliament during the course of this year. But I don't think there will any changes on that. We don't expect that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the head count, Jeremy, the IB head count should hover around the 17,000 mark. You are right, it was down by 1% in the quarter, but that's well within the tolerance of normal turnover in the IB.</p>
          <p>And in the fourth quarter, we try very hard not hire people because there is a tendency for those people to want to be paid by us for having worked somewhere else in the year. So the fourth quarter is not a big hiring quarter.</p>
          <p>We don't have massive hiring plans anyway. We've pretty much built the infrastructure that we need. So I would expect head count wouldn't change very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I agree. And I think we have probably the right size, considering what is happening in the industry there. And you see there reductions really in most investment banks on head count, and I think we are in a good place.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Derek De Vries, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a few questions.</p>
          <p>But maybe just to start, could you come back &#x2013; can we come back to that comment Mr. Gr&#xFC;bel just made about some businesses can't be done at 13 plus 6? Are you implying that you would sell some businesses? Or are you talking about setting up some sort of complicated structure? That'd be my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question, you've talked a few times &#x2013; and your outlook statement was full of some pretty positive statements on client activity levels and wealth management. Net new money. I'm just wondering what indicators do you look at to come up with that sort of positive outlook? That'd be helpful, so we can do it ourselves, I guess.</p>
          <p>And then the final question, you've touched on your fixed income build-out being essentially complete. I was wondering if you could kind of quantify. Are you sort of 98% done in terms of head count and maybe 80% done in terms of systems and technology? Or if you could kind of quantify where we stand on the fixed income buildup, that would be, from a cost perspective, very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cleary, on the capital question, first, for that business if we decide to stay in these businesses, which has these high requirements, under the Swiss rules, then we have to change the company structure for these businesses and have to use them out of another jurisdiction, very clearly. And in a separate subsidiary. So, it's logical. Otherwise, you &#x2013; there is no other way to escape that.</p>
          <p>And in Wealth Management, why I am so positive on client confidence is coming back into UBS. We have good signs that that is the case. And in order to make sense from the timing point of view, and enough time has passed, and we also &#x2013; the bank as such behave properly, and we build its capital, and has, as we've seen, in a global comparison, a high capital ratio, which is good for Wealth Management.</p>
          <p>And we improved management in Wealth Management. We improved all the compliance and more functionality there.</p>
          <p>So that's &#x2013; these are the main reasons why I am pretty confident that now, after we had the stabilization in net new money, that we can look forward in 2011 to see some increases in net new money, and to go back to more to business as usual as it is supposed to be.</p>
          <p>The FICC buildup. Where we are we? Are we 80% done? Are we 90% done? There are certain areas, relatively smaller areas, where we should put &#x2013; be doing more. We're probably not yet finished in areas like emerging markets and some other small areas, where we should improve. But I would think it is more about improving than re-entering again.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Christopher Wheeler, Mediobanca. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning gentlemen. Couple of questions.</p>
          <p>First of all, on net new money, clearly you washed your face in the fourth quarter in wealth management. But you mentioned that there was a CHF 10 billion inflow in Asia. So obviously, internationally, it looks like you had about CHF 11 billion of outflows elsewhere. Could you perhaps talk about that, give us some clue? I assume London and Germany were the sort of key areas.</p>
          <p>And secondly, similarly, you said ultra high net worth, CHF 10 billion of inflows, which obviously would again suggest CHF 10 billion of outflows in the sort of high net worth and sort of affluent areas. Is that something that you're pursuing in terms of actually trying to not &#x2013; to shed unprofitable money as well as obviously losing money that's just moving away from you? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second one related to that. Your target for the financial advisors, 4,700, reasonably ambitious, but how long do you think it will take you to actually get to that number?</p>
          <p>And then finally, John, the 20 tax guidance, I think you've been saying 20% to us, which clearly is an interesting number, given again today's credit. Any views on where we might look on that? Or are you still sticking to 20% for the next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, the &#x2013; on the net new money figures, the CHF 10 billion net inflows from Asia and the CHF 10 billion from the ultra high net worth, they were annual figures, not fourth quarter.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But they were relatively steady businesses across the year.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, I don't think we said much more, other than there is the normal disclosures splitting the Swiss clients with the non-Swiss clients. And Swiss clients had an inflow, a net inflow of CHF 1.1 billion in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>It really was in onshore and offshore markets within Europe that we saw the net outflows. Everywhere else, I think was either neutral to net inflow. And it's really the confidence that we have around the situation in Europe changing and improving that gives us confidence that we'll see net inflows in the coming quarters.</p>

          <p>The financial advisor number there, 4,700, that is a multiyear number, and it won't happen overnight, it won't happen next year. And it will probably increase faster, as asset inflow is increasing during the year, faster and slower, if it &#x2013; if asset increases are slower, as well. But we think, going forward, that is the target number for the next two, three years.</p>

          <p>Tax rate, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax guidance &#x2013; I don't want to get too complicated on this.</p>
          <p>We have a deferred tax asset now on our balance sheet of CHF 9.5 billion. And still a large proportion of that relates to Swiss tax losses. And we have provided about as much as we can against Swiss tax losses, so we can't really provide anything meaningfully more. And we don't expect to make losses in Switzerland going forward.</p>
          <p>So that will amortize, and that amortizes at the average Swiss tax rate, which is between 20% and 22%.</p>
          <p>The rest of the deferred tax assets, by and large, relate to the US. And in the US, the tax rate is higher. But there we have plenty of scope for replenishing those assets as we use them.</p>
          <p>And so the guidance I would give for the overall tax charge &#x2013; last year, it's about minus 1% tax charge. We essentially net-net charged the P&amp;L with no tax at all. We had a small credit.</p>
          <p>That could be the case next year. But it will only be the case if we perform better than we performed last year. Meaningfully better. Because it will mean that we'll be able to re-measure our deferred taxes towards the end of the year and determine whether we can justify creating further deferred tax assets.</p>
          <p>If we perform in line with last year, then the guidance &#x2013; the best guidance I can give is that, on average, we will pay tax at around about the Swiss rate. There are markets in Asia where the tax rate is lower, and in the UK, it's moving towards 24%. In US, it's higher. So on average, best number I can normally give is 20 to low-20s percent.</p>
          <p>But if we are able towards the end of the year to justify, looking again at our deferred tax assets because we are making steady sustainable profits, specifically in the US, then there may be the chance that we can look at the deferred tax asset again and credit ourselves with the creation of some new assets. And that would bring down the net charge for the year.</p>
          <p>So I would expect, certainly in the first couple of quarters, to have a roughly 20% run rate. And then maybe Q3 or Q4, towards the end of the year, when we see how the performance for the year is turning out, and we look at the sustainability of our profits, specifically in the US, there is the possibility &#x2013; but I would say no more at the moment than the possibility &#x2013; of re-measuring our deferred tax asset upwards, which would bring down the overall rate for the year.</p>
          <p>But count on 20%, if that's clear.</p>

          <p>John, thank you very much. That's helpful. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Can we have the last two questions on the phone, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Mr. Robert Murphy, HSBC. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. First of all, in terms of the Wealth Management inflows, would I be correct in assuming that Q4 is normally seasonally weaker, if you look to a sort of a normal situation?</p>
          <p>And my second question is, again, in terms of client confident. What are the clients actually saying and doing now? Are they moving more into equities? Are they talking about selling bonds, or what are the clients actually saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the client confident question first.</p>
          <p>The clients are not so happy yet, even if the equity markets are going up, but it looks like &#x2013; and certainly from our point of view, that they are more institutionally driven than they are driven by private clients. And they are not trusting the market yet because it takes them probably a little bit longer to move into markets again. And it has less fear around than there was two years ago, when everybody was thinking the world is coming to an end. So &#x2013; but to change from these extremes, to go from total fear into total bullishness again, that takes a little bit longer.</p>
          <p>And on Q4, seasonal what was it seasonal -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, it's always difficult to tell because you never know what it would have been if we hadn't had Christmas. But generally, Q3 and Q4 are a little bit weaker than the first two quarters in the year. First quarter is normally the strongest, that's for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there is no particular reason that the fourth quarter &#x2013; the third quarter normally is weakest because -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>of the summer months and &#x2013; but no particular reason that the fourth quarter should be substantially weaker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Could you say what the gross deferred tax asset reserve is now that you are carrying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gross on the balance sheet is CHF 9.5 billion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that cash will be the sort of the reserve that offsets against the sort of gross decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yeah, that's not really a reserve. It's not on the balance sheet. That's &#x2013; the amount of tax, we have not specifically provided for on the balance sheet. The tax losses in the US are still more than we could possibly ever use there, so CHF 50 billion plus.</p>

          <p>Last question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question from the telephone is from Mr. Cormac Leech from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi there. I had a just couple of questions, please. One is, if I look at the unrecognized tax loss carry forward, just following up from Robert's question at the Investor Day, I think you referred to it at about CHF 21 billion or it could have been dollars. Could you talk a little bit about the factors limiting utilization of that whole tax loss carry forward? Is it simply a matter of generating, I think it worked out as something around CHF 60 billion of profit in the relevant subsidiary over the next, as you say, 17 years. Or are there some other issues that we're not aware of, at least I'm not aware of, that could prevent you from recognizing all of that tax loss carry forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your numbers are about right. The 20 &#x2013; CHF 21 whatever it is &#x2013; billion is just the US tax rate today times the losses available. And that would be the amount we could book up. The factors are, I suppose there is also always the macro factor of legislative change in the US that could take away the ability of any company to use tax loss carry forwards. The big question is really the taxability in the US. We tend not to show taxable profits arising and we don't really show a very good regional breakdown of our &#x2013; where our profits occur. Needless to say though, we need to make profits within our US tax group to use these losses.</p>
          <p>So I think the only &#x2013; the principle criteria and by which we determine whether to book up deferred tax assets or not, is our assessment on a very conservative basis, because the test within IFRS is a very strong test that we are confident that we see sustainable profits, which we can use against the loss carry forwards. And at the moment, we see some scope. We've limited that scope given the stringency of the tests in IFRS. But if we did see better quality, higher and more consistent profitability in the US, then it will give us more confidence to book up more assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I suppose, just a follow-on, on that then, is there anything preventing you from re-allocating some of your more highly profitable activities into the relevant subsidiary to benefit from those tax losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the taxability of a banking business generally is driven by where its written, as opposed to simply moving things underneath American subsidiaries to create profit. So there's very little flexibility, if any in fact, we wouldn't do anything just to create tax profits within the group. We really are charged on the revenues and the expenses that are related to our US site as business, so very little scope to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a second question &#x2013; I think you referred to CHF 152 million of litigation cost in the Wealth Management Americas business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To what extent should we think about those litigation costs being a one-off or do you have any visibility on perhaps some of that recurring on a future basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, litigation is a big business in the United State of America, so I would be very cautious about suggesting litigation expenses will be a one-off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Now we go over to questions here in the room. Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Matthew Allen from Swissinfo. I'd like to go back to a comment made by Mr. Gr&#xFC;bel about moving &#x2013; maybe moving some businesses to different jurisdictions, regarding the regulations, Swiss, Finnish regulation. I mean what businesses are you talking about being most at risk, not being able to live with the Swiss Finnish and what jurisdictions might you move into? Did I hear you right when you said that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, clearly, these are businesses which are in Investment Banking and which probably in future will carry a much higher capital requirement than now. And if in other countries and in the main countries, let's say the UK and the US for example, the capital requirements are only half of what they are here in Switzerland. And we think we have to stay in these businesses to serve our clients, then clearly we have to do them out of these countries, which we already mostly do today. But on a branch basis, so today we're doing it on a branch basis, in future then, it probably have to be on a subsidiary basis.</p>
          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Keegan Meyer, NTP. You clearly stated that you're not in a dividend paying modus already. But given the currently ongoing discussions at many Swiss companies about the potential of paying out tax-free dividends out of actual, did you have your tax guys having &#x2013; doing some work on that? And probably can you quantify the potential out of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did look at it. I think the maximum scope, if I'm not mistaken, that we have is to pay CHF 0.10 as a one-off dividend and that would be it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not referring to nominal value but rather to additional paid in capital so-called actual, which going forward might be paid out tax free as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take a look at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the idea behind that is and purely from logical point of view, it doesn't make any sense to us 'til we have reached the required capital levels, which we have to go to, which regulators are demanding then &#x2013; to payout dividends. It just doesn't make sense. In one hand, you pay out capital, in the other hand you want to take it in again at a higher cost. It doesn't make any sense for shareholders whatsoever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought you answered it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. <mark type="inaudible" /> I have two questions. First of all, I just wonder you mentioned capital out &#x2013; money outflows to Europe. Could you be more specific on that one? So for Q4 and 2010. And to your capital base, what's you common equity based on the definition of Basel III? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can't be more specific on money outflows because then we have to break it down country-by-country and we haven't done that and don't do that. But it is, as we said before, it's mainly European countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on our capital base on Basel III is still pretty much in line with the disclosures we gave in November. So, we take the core capital and the two big deductions for us would be the deferred tax asset and the prepaid pension asset. The reason we are reluctant to give Basel III detailed disclosures is that it's not introduced until &#x2013; in full force and effect until 2019, by which time we would hope to have amortized a large proportion, if not all, of our deferred tax asset. We wouldn't have booked it up if we didn't think we could use it within a relatively short timeframe.</p>
          <p>And in fact, we set ourselves a five-year limit on utilization of future tax profits in booking up deferred tax assets. So at the moment it would be roughly CHF 30.5 billion of core capital, less the deferred tax asset, which is CHF 9.5 billion, less the prepaid pension asset, which is around about CHF 3 billion. There are some other small adjustments, but they almost even out, and by 2019 they wouldn't be around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason Rhodes, Reuters. You said that working on the cost income ratio in investment banking is a priority this year, but you're going to keep headcounts roughly the same. So, how are you going to work on the income side as well as the cost side to improve the situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We clearly have room on the fixed costs, and &#x2013; yeah, really fixed cost will make the difference. Also, I wouldn't say that necessarily on the compensation side you have no room to move there. We measure much better now, and in future we'll continue to improve the measurement of performance by each individual. And therefore, can allocate the bonuses much better than in the past. And I think that kind of efficiency also will lead to cost savings going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-on from that. You were talking about the new bonus scheme, how is that resonating with staff? Some staff are going to lose out here, presumably that's not very popular with them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say lose out so, are you arguing that people are losing out because we are allocating bonuses more accurate and to be &#x2013; to make sure that actually people are getting paid who have performed and have at the right performance. I don't think you can say losing out. I'm sure people think and you might right there, that some people think it's a God given right to get a bonus even if you didn't perform, then yes, they might lose out.</p>
          <p>Do we have any further questions in here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, may &#x2013; two different ones. Your competitor growth just came out with the observation that the euro crisis may be mainly over from their point of view. I just wondered whether you would agree on that?</p>
          <p>The second on, you said you would stay on board at UBS until the bank is back on track. Given what you just said today, it seems to be there is so much work to do that you're going to be there for couple of more years. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You figured it out. There is a lot of work to do, but if you want to do things well, there is always work to do. The euro crisis being over or not &#x2013; the crisis is over when nobody recognizes it as a crisis anymore. But you have a crisis when everybody thinks there is a crisis. So the question is, was there ever a crisis or was it just one's pound the about the state of finance of the European states?</p>
          <p>So, yeah, we call it a crisis and the market has called it a crisis. And I think for the time being, it looks like everybody had enough of a crisis and everybody lost enough money, so the euro is still around and compared to few months ago, when nobody believed it will be around in the short term anymore, and things are getting back to the normal way that &#x2013; that are extended.</p>
