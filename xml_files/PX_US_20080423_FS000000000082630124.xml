          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2008 Praxair Earnings Conference Call.  At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.  We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of today's conference.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Please proceed, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Good morning and thank you all for attending our first quarter earnings call and webcast.  Pat Clark, Vice President and Controller; and Liz Hirsch, Director of Investor Relations are with me this morning.  Liz will review our first quarter results and afterwards I'll discuss our business outlook and our earnings guidance for the second quarter and the full year 2008.  We'll then be able to answer questions and when the question period comes I'd appreciate it if you would limit your questions to one question with one follow-up and not three or four follow-ups.  Liz?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jim, good morning.  Today's presentation materials are available on our website at www.praxair.com in the "Investors" section.  Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 3 for a summary of our first quarter results.  The discussion and presentation of our first quarter results including the quarter-over-quarter comparisons exclude the impact of a $17 million pension settlement charge related to lump sum benefit payment made to several recently retired senior managers in accordance with FAS Statement 88.</p>
          <p>The after-tax impact of this charge was $11 million or $0.03 per share.  You will recall that our first quarter and full year earnings guidance which we gave you last quarter excluded this charge.</p>
          <p>Praxair had a very strong first quarter.  We achieved solid year-over-year growth in sales and operating profit in all our geographic regions.  Net income and diluted earnings per share grew 20% and 22% respectively.  We are continuing to see moderate growth in our U.S. based business despite mixed economic conditions and new business activity is strong.  Growth in Asia and South America continues to be very robust.</p>
          <p>Sales grew 22% to $2.66 billion.  Currency appreciation contributed 7% to sales growth, but underlying organic growth was a solid 11% from higher volumes and higher prices.  Volumes grew versus the prior year in all our geographies with Asia and South America producing the largest increases.</p>
          <p>In addition, the impact of several acquisitions which we made last year added 3% to our sales growth this quarter.  Globally, sales growth was highest to the energy, general manufacturing, and electronics end markets.</p>
          <p>Adjusted operating profit was a record $499 million, 24% above the first quarter 2007.  The faster growth in operating profit as compared to sales was due to good control of fixed expenses including SG&amp;A which declined as a percent of sales versus the prior year.  Adjusted net income was $318 million, 20% above the prior year quarter.  The slower growth in net income as compared to operating profit reflects two factors: First, higher interest expense due to higher debt levels resulting primarily from acquisitions and our common stock buybacks; and second, a higher effective tax rate of 28% versus 26% in 2007.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.99 as compared to $0.81 in the prior year.  EPS grew 22% from the strong growth in net income and fewer average shares outstanding due to the stock repurchases.  EPS would have grown 26% with an equivalent tax rate in both years.  This demonstrates that we continue to achieve strong underlying operating leverage in the business.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations of 379 million in the quarter increased 81 million versus 2007.  This increase was primarily a result of higher net income.  Capital expenditures were 344 million in the quarter, most of which financed on-site production plants for customers.  We invested a small amount $40 million in acquisitions primarily two packaged gas distributors in North America.</p>
          <p>We also made additional stock repurchases net of issuances of $227 million.  We have now completed 838 million of the 1 billion stock buyback program we announced last July.  Our strong cash flow, a result of our high return on capital has allowed us to accomplish this alongside a record level of capital investment in new customer supply system.  Our overall debt increased slightly and our debt-to-capital ratio this quarter was 45.2%.  After-tax return on capital was 14.8%, a bit lower than last quarter due largely to the higher tax rate.</p>
          <p>Please refer to pages 4 and 5 for our results in North America.  Sales in North America were 1.45 billion, 21% above the prior year quarter.  Several acquisitions which we made last year contributed 6% to sales growth.  Underlying growth from higher volumes and price was 10% versus prior year.  This growth reflects strong sales to our energy, manufacturing, and chemicals end markets.</p>
          <p>In the energy sector, we had strong demand from refiners for hydrogen.  Sales of nitrogen and carbon-dioxide to the oil well services market were strong in U.S., Canada, and Mexico.  High natural gas prices have continued to support robust oil and gas well drilling activity.  Sales to chemicals were up, partly a result of better customer operating rates.  Our sales to manufacturing markets were 8% above last year, excluding any currency or acquisition effects.  Some observers may find this surprising given the reported slowdown in U.S. industrial production, but there are many segments of manufacturing that are growing nicely including for example agriculture, energy, and mining equipment, where customer demand is still strong.</p>
          <p>Our business in Mexico had a very strong quarter with sales up 23% versus 2007.  The acquisition of Linde's industrial gas business last year contributed 10% to sales growth, but the underlying business showed strong growth.  On-site and merchant liquids grew from new business and oil well services, oxy-fuel combustion applications, food and metal.  On-site sales were 32% above the prior year driven primarily by hydrogen sales to refining customers.</p>
          <p>Our Gulf Coast customers are running well and refining large amounts of middle distillates due to strong demand and higher margin.  The refining of these heavier fuels is very hydrogen intensive.  Volume growth in on-site atmospheric gases, oxygen and nitrogen was 8% from solid demand from chemicals, refining and primary metals customers.</p>
          <p>Merchant liquids sales grew 13% from moderately higher volume and higher pricing.  Production capacity still remains tight in many locations particularly for argon, helium and rare gases such as xenon.  Helium demand is strong for electronics and health care applications and global supplies are limited.  As I just mentioned, we had a strong quarter in oil well services so Canada is now in their seasonally slow period due to the warming weather.</p>
          <p>We expect this business to stay strong throughout the year because of high demand and prices for natural gas.  Liquid nitrogen and oxygen volume growth is also coming from new business and new applications in food, metals and manufacturing.  Argon sales continue to be strong for stainless steel and welding related to non-residential construction.</p>
          <p>Business in Eastern Canada is soft due to weakness in the automotive industry and the strong Canadian dollar.  Overall sales of packaged gases in North America grew 21% from the prior year.  Acquisitions contributed 14% of this growth.  In PDI, our U.S. and Canadian business same-store sales growth was 6%.  Gases growth was 9% versus prior year, but hard goods sales were softer in both the U.S. and Canada.  Specialty gases are growing nicely with sales up 20% from last year.  Overall volume growth in the U.S. is steady.  The pockets where we have seen some weakness are automotive, transportation and construction, but offsetting this has been growth and new business in agriculture, equipment, energy, mining and metals.  We announced a price increase last week to keep pace with rising distribution and fuel costs.  And we also closed two small acquisitions this quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in North America grew 21% to 262 million, an 18% operating margin on sales from volume growth and higher pricing.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page six to review our business in Europe.  Sales in Europe of $390 million grew 18% from prior year with currency appreciation contributing 13%.  On-site merchant and packaged gases all showed moderate underlying growth.  Reported growth was muted by fewer working days this quarter versus 2007 due to the timing of the Easter holidays.  Our on-site and merchant sales to steel and chemical customers along our German pipeline grew.</p>
          <p>In Italy, the outlook is improving a bit and merchant volumes were up 7%.  In Spain, overall gases sales grew 6% ex-currency.  Our homecare business showed strong growth.  Operating profit of 87 million grew 21%.  We are working hard to stay ahead of power cost increases and higher transportation cost with our prices.</p>
          <p>On April 1st, we closed the sale of our joint venture in Israel.  This will reduce Europe's segment sales by about 27 million annually with an immaterial impact on operating profit.</p>
          <p>Please look at page 7 for our results in South America. Sales in South America were $466 million this quarter, up 34%. Ex-currency growth was 15%. Domestic demand is accelerating across South America from strong industrial production growth.</p>
          <p>Brazil's IP growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 was historical high and is expected to continue to be very strong. In South America, merchant gases sales grew 23% excluding currency effects and packaged gases sales grew 25%, fueled by strong consumer and industrial demand and new applications across the spectrum of end markets.</p>
          <p>Growth in onsite sales is currently more moderate, limited by our large customers in metals, petrochemicals, glass, and paper who are operating near-full capacity because of strong demand from domestic and export markets. Many of these industries are planning to add capacity over the next few years.</p>
          <p>New investment in refining and petrochemicals is forecasted to be $90 billion through 2010 and investment in primary metals $27 billion. These projects will require industrial gas supply, and we're bidding on a record number of new business opportunities in the region.</p>
          <p>Projects in our backlog which are currently under construction will support strong sales growth in 2009 and 2010. Our LNG business with Petrobras continues to grow as we contract with more customers for liquid gas, and we're also moving rapidly to develop the market for packaged natural gas or CNG.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of 89 million grew 35% from prior year. Strong productivity results and pricing initiatives continue to exceed cost inflation.</p>
          <p>Page 8 summarizes our results in Asia this quarter. Asia's results were strong. Sales of $211 million were up 26% from last year's quarter driven by strong volume growth. Onsite sales in China and Korea were strong and merchant and packaged gases grew across the region. Electronic sales rose 38% on strong demand for helium, specialty and rare gases like xylene and xenon for the flat panel display and solar module manufacturing markets.</p>
          <p>Outside of electronics, we are growing sales for a variety of merchant applications such as water treatment. We recently announced two contracts with the Municipality of Beijing to supply oxygen for waste water treatment as well as to supply an ozone system to replace chlorine, thereby improving the quality of drinking water in the Beijing area. We believe that environmental applications will provide strong future growth for gases in Asia.</p>
          <p>We have a large number of projects which will start up in Asia in 2008 and our pipeline of new onsite projects is strong in China, India and Korea. These opportunities are quite diversified by end market and continue to support the infrastructure build out in the industrializing economies.</p>
          <p>This quarter we added four new projects to our backlog in the region including two new oxygen plants for Meishan Steel. Operating profit of 37 million grew 37%, improving the operating margins to 17.5%. Sales and OP comparisons with the fourth quarter typically reflects the seasonal slowdown due the Chinese New Year holiday.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 9 for Surface Technologies. Surface Technologies sales grew 14% to 142 million and 7% excluding currency effects. Coatings for industrial gas turbines and oilfield drilling parts and components continued to be strong. Coatings volumes for next generation aircraft engines were slower than expected, but we expect this will pick up. Demand in Europe for general industry markets, such as printing and textiles, is soft.</p>
          <p>Overall, energy and electronics markets present opportunities for new applications development. Operating profit grew 14% to 24 million. Operating margin dipped sequentially from the fourth quarter due to lower volume.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn this over to Jim who will discuss our global end market trends in more detail, our business outlook, and our updated earnings guidance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Liz. Please turn to page 10 which highlights our sales growth in the first quarter for our principal end markets. Sales to the energy sector continue to be strong and were up 39% in the quarter, excluding the effect of higher natural gas price pass-through in our Hydrogen business.</p>
          <p>The growth is largely from higher sales to refiners in North America. As Liz mentioned, our oil well service business in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico was very strong as well. $9 natural gas prices and strong demand for drilling activities are helping us a lot.</p>
          <p>We expect that we'll continue to see very strong growth from this market. We'll be bringing new hydrogen plants on stream in 2009 and 2010 and are optimistic that some of the gasification projects under feasibility studies by our customers will result in significant opportunities for us.</p>
          <p>Global electronics was also very strong this quarter and our longer-term outlook is positive. Sales growth was 20% driven by the startup of two plants in Asia, one with SMIC in Shanghai and one was Samsung in Korea, and then another startup supplying a polysilicon producer in the United States. Industry forecast for chip production this year are trending down, but we're seeing strong demand for gases from the flat panel display manufacturers in Asia. And the solar cell market is relatively small today but growing rapidly.</p>
          <p>We're also developing deposition materials for this market. We've signed a number of new contracts, including a contract to supply gases equipment and gas management services to Sil Fabs solar grade polysilicon manufacturing in Italy.</p>
          <p>Sales in the chemical sector were up 19%. Growth was strong in all regions. Our U.S. customers were operating better than a year ago. Sales in Germany along our pipeline were very strong. And in Asia we're ramping up sales in the two chemical industrial parks that we supply in Shanghai and Diobay. We expect future growth will come from new investment by customers in China.</p>
          <p>Sales to the metals market were up 15% in the quarter, mostly from higher sales in South America. U.S. volumes were steady and in line with overall steel production. Brazil, India and China are all adding to production capacity as they are advantaged globally in production costs. Steel and non-ferrous metals are large users of oxygen for combustion and we're seeing an abundance of new business opportunities in the sector.</p>
          <p>Manufacturing was one of our strongest markets this quarter with sales up 32%. This growth included some acquisitions and currency, but you should know that our organic growth underlying pricing volume for manufacturing was 11%. It's a strong number with growth above 20% in emerging markets and holding about 5% in the United States. Growth is still coming from government and business capital spending, infrastructure spending and so forth.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., transportation and nonresidential construction are a little weaker than a year ago, but are still experiencing pretty good growth for us and we're looking at winning new projects and applications.</p>
          <p>Global healthcare sales grew 10% coming from our businesses in Spain, Brazil, and our U.S. hospital business. U.S. homecare business remains under significant pressure from rate cuts, but our people are operating it very well and it's doing quite nicely.</p>
          <p>Sales to aerospace were flat this quarter reflecting the lower-than-expected volume of coatings work, by our Surface Technologies business for the next generation jet engine manufacturers. We expect this business to pickup substantially in 2009 as Boeing brings deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner on and we will be providing coatings for both engine manufacturers that will go on to this plane.</p>
          <p>Food and beverage market continues to be very resilient and non-cyclical, and we're signing new business in food freezing, beverage in all regions and geography.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 11 for our financial outlook and earnings guidance. For the balance of 2008 our outlook is positive in a mixed global economy. U.S. fundamentals are reasonably strong particularly in the markets which we serve like energy, mining, equipment and infrastructure. We expect moderate growth in our base business in North America, Europe and augmented by new project startups and new business from merchant applications. In South America and Asia, we expect strong double-digit growth to continue.</p>
          <p>So, for the second quarter our earnings guidance is a range of $1.02 to $1.06 per share on a fully diluted basis. This represents 15% to 19% growth from the second quarter 2007. For the full year, we now expect year-over-year sales growth to be 13% to 16%. This increase from our prior guidance is based on the stronger underlying business trends we've seen and the currency appreciation over the past two quarters. The reason that our full year sales guidance growth percentage on a comparable basis is lower than what we reported in the first quarter is a fact that our currency benefit of 7% this quarter and acquisitions of 3% this quarter get lapped over the remaining three quarters of the year. The acquisitions get lapped in the second quarter and the currency appreciation in the third and fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We're raising the upper end of our earnings guidance for the full year of 2008 by a nickel to a range of $4.10 to 4.25 per share excluding the $0.03 pension settlement charge in the first quarter. This is 13 to 17% above 2007. The earnings guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 28%, 2% above we had in 2007 which is a $0.12 negative impact for us year-over-year and without that we'd be talking about 16 to 20% EPS growth.</p>
          <p>Our CapEx forecast is 1.5 billion based on new projects which we continue to win at good returns and which will support future revenue and earnings growth. We're staying focused on simultaneously achieving our two financial goals, higher return on capital and high growth, as we believe, this will continue to produce significant returns for our shareholders. We're executing well in the marketplace. We're winning a high percentage of business at good returns in the geographies where we're focused. And we're generating strong cash flow which will fund the record number of projects in our backlog that will come on stream over the next three years. We're confident in our ability to produce strong double-digit earnings growth for this foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>And now, I'll open this call to questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, you mentioned that you have an active pipeline for acquisitions for the U.S. in merchant business.  Can you help us to understand the amount of firepower you have over there &#x2013; or the likelihood of deals that you see in front of you and timing for those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sergey, do you mean packaged gas acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; we'll continue to be looking at packaged gas acquisitions in other places, but we won't put them into the forecast until we've actually closed them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And so, on your taxes, your guidance the past quarter was 26.8%.  So you're still within this range but it's on a high, and what are the factors that drive you to the high tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to try to explain it in a nutshell, we have a kind of finite size of deductions, but our taxable income is growing and so we're really kind of growing out of those deductions. And so it looks it will be around 28% for the year, and next year as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Jim, can you give us the large project backlog, what was added, what was started up in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We had talked about 42 projects in the backlog which are under construction and under contract.  That's now moved up to 43 with 6 projects starting up in the first quarter, and 7 new contract signings in the beginning of the new projects.  And I will tell you that the capital in the new 7 is double the capital in the 6 that came on stream just because they're larger projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jim, on the 1.5 billion of CapEx, how much is for growth, and what are the returns in either in the backlog or the CapEx projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right; well, the way we look at the returns in the backlog are basically about 16 to 18% IRR after tax. But that's an IRR discounted cash flow type of number.  And that represents only -- that represents about 1.1 billion of the total CapEx with the other 400 million going into cost reduction projects and maintenance.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good morning.  Another question on the pipeline. Would you say that about half of your pipeline is related to energy?  And then can you just give us a breakdown of how much is it related to metals, particularly steel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a large portion that's related to energy; that would be the number one.  Second would be probably metals if you include steel and copper projects in metals.  There are quite a few copper projects.  And then there is a couple of handfuls, maybe 5 or 6 semiconductor projects, and then a handful of all kinds of others.</p>

          <p>Okay.  And you sounded more positive on this call, Jim, compared to your fourth quarter call when you talked about the slowing economy; was this change in your tune intentional?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean we had a strong quarter, and we saw good volumes pretty much everywhere where we operate. And it's -- I'm definitely more optimistic at least for our business.  The economy has -- it's a mixed economy now.  There were some big holes in the economy, obviously in banking, housing; automotive off about 12%, appliances off 15, textiles off 15, and retailing off.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand there are some industries that are doing very well; business, IT spending up 10%, communications equipment about 10%, metals, energy, drilling and all that up about 10%, and airplane deliveries up about 10% and set to grow faster going forward.  So, it really depends on, I think, what industries are in, and we have some sales into the losing industries but not that much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  This is Amy Chasen sitting for Bob.  I have two questions, the first one, the Asia margin showed some pretty encouraging rebound in first quarter '08 versus 1Q '07 also last quarter, perhaps the highest level since the beginning of '07.  And then -- but if I look at the sales trends this quarter versus last quarter, essentially it is flat.  So I'm wondering what's the drivers there for this margin out-performance for this quarter. And also, do you think this margin level is sustainable throughout this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to bounce around, because this business for us is still really a kind of a startup business.  It's relatively small.  And we're adding projects at a rapid pace.  Thirteen of the projects in the backlog are in Asia, and so as we incur startup expenses for those and fixed costs for those, that's going to hurt the operating margin.  As a startup, most of them will be in the 20s to 25% operating margin.  So, it will bounce around. But ultimately we'll be doubling the size of the business there very quickly.  And then it will be more stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the second question, can you just give us a little bit more color on the margin trends both on a year-over-year basis and a sequential basis regarding your margin in the pipeline businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I understand the question.  You want to know the margin in the pipeline business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the margins &#x2013; on margin and also the top-line business on both year-over-year basis and also on a sequential basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, I just want to know is there any contraction on a year-over-year basis or sequential basis or do you still see expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, we don't report the margins on those businesses by region.  And the thing about it is that almost all the merchant product comes from the onsite plants, okay? And so you could make that margin by whatever price you transfer in your calculations or your accounting from onsite to merchant, you could shift that margin back and forth anywhere where you wanted to.  It doesn't make sense to be quoting a margin separately for the onsite business and separately for the merchant business, because they're on the same plant and the same production cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning.  In terms of pricing, for the total company, continues to be pretty strong here.  Are you getting any incremental pricing there to profitability or is that &#x2013; or is it most of it to cover increasing costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are getting incremental pricing above cost.  For example, our average electricity cost was up about 4%, 5% year-over-year.  And we got more pricing than that year-over-year.  And then, in the particularly scarce project products like helium, prices up 20%, argon, prices up very significantly, because we're having to put people on allocation for these products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then shifting real quick to PDI, continues to perform pretty well &#x2013; or very well, considering the environment.  Do you expect that same-store sales number to sort of stay at around the same level?  You have seen a lot of price increases.  Maybe that increases that? And on the hard goods side, metal prices are going up, can you pass on those consumables &#x2013; I guess metal-based consumables when they go up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can and we do, absolutely. But looking forward I think the same-store sales number will be going over, because we have both hard goods and gases in the same-store sales number. And the hard goods was really very low, 1 to 2%, and the gases was very high.</p>
          <p>And what we're seeing as we move along is that people are buying less hard goods.  People are not buying welding equipment and capital equipment in the hard goods areas and so we will pretty quickly see, I think, negative growth in hard goods on a same-store sales basis, okay?  But we are starting up sales and making acquisitions and so forth, and that will keep the top-line and the operating profit growing.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Jim.  My question is on South America.  At your Analyst Day last month, you were looking for South America to grow about 12 to 15% ex-currency to 2010.  Does this target look conservative now?  It sounds like you do expect the onsite growth to accelerate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about where we think it will be, Tom [sic] (Ed). The economy &#x2013; the consumer part of the economy is accelerating right now.  And there's a lot of goods being consumed there, and there's a lot of factories and production equipment that's being built there. But actually I think the limiting factor just may be the available capacity and just how quickly you can get projects built there.  We've got 8 projects in our backlog in South America, about half of them in Brazil and the other half outside of Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And your volumes are already growing about 9% this quarter and you're getting pricing on top of that.  Could you quantify what those additional projects in '09, '10 is going to be additive to volume?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning.  Jim, you mentioned the U.S. homecare business remains under some pressure from rate cuts; it's been a factor for everyone in the industry.  Can you give us an update on the strategy there and will you be amenable to a strategic combination to take costs out of that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer it this way.  We're committed to the business.  The &#x2013; it has an inferior pricing model to the rest of our business in the sense that the rest of our business we have a lot of influence on our price because we contract it, whereas in the homecare business the price is dictated to you.  So it's just an inferior business from that revenue model point of view.</p>
          <p>And the other thing that's different about it is that it's really a people business.  Your success in this business is all about how good your people are and how you manage your people. And that's really where our focus is, more than anything right now.  And unfortunately, we've looked at other industry combinations, but the combination with somebody else would just be bringing a bigger black hole in; so we're not going to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood.  And then the second question, if I may, on foreign exchange.  What percentage of your international contracts are dollar indexed?  I wonder if I could take your 7% top-line impact and try to do some math and come out with a bottom-line impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that the 7% &#x2013; well actually it's embedded in the 7% top-line number, because the index contracts to dollars, so, for example, the Reais getting stronger, but we're paying in dollars.  We wish in second thought we hadn't done that, but it's a way of hedging the currency.  But it shows up in the sales line. So you don't need to do any different than the 7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So I can just flow that through and come up with maybe something like $0.07, maybe $0.08 on the bottom line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Exactly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning.  You can tell by the quality of the questions that people are somewhat satisfied with the quarter.  But I'll ask something &#x2013; how about &#x2013; just could you tell me what's the &#x2013; things seem to be going pretty well, what's the most major threat that you guys can see on the horizon?  Is it the fact one of the competitors might be bidding irrationally and have you seen any of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not &#x2013; there's obviously competition in the industry.  There's competition in every industry. All it takes is two competitors to compete. And so that will always be out there.  But I think there is enough business out there that we're not getting crowded out.  We've got a much bigger backlog proportionately than our competitors do and that's a sign that we're winning more business and have better returns.</p>
          <p>So, it's really about execution.  It's really about being very disciplined in how you price, how you build the contracts, how you execute in terms of bringing the project in on time and on schedule and getting the on time very close to a 100%.  So it's really about execution.</p>
          <p>And we depend on our people; we have very good people.  We depend on them a lot.  A lot of them are stretched because of the amount of work that we're doing, but I don't see that as a threat, either.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Jim, just a question on sustainability of the strength you're seeing in the U.S. merchant business.  You've commented that obviously that different industries are seeing different growth rates.  But I'm wondering in your more traditional sort of metal fabrication customers, or general industrial customers, is oxy-fuel combustion still a strong driver of merchant volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well oxy-fuel combustion is actually probably more in onsite than merchant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I was thinking more just using liquid oxygen as an alternative to atmospheric air in a wide variety of combustion processes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But you're using generally a large enough combustion processes at a VPSA plant or an onsite plant rather than a merchant plant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So that's really not a factor in your merchant strength then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then on the energy side, you had very strong North American energy volumes.  Just wondering is this &#x2013; are these relatively easy comps since I guess you've got the Mexican &#x2013; the Pemex start-up which would certainly benefit both volumes and I guess even more so on margin.  And then BP, I guess had easy comps a year ago just &#x2013; so is this a comp issue or just &#x2013; I'm just wondering exactly what's driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two huge projects come on stream during the year, the Valero Refinery and the Pemex project.  And in addition to that, the cavern that we built is getting very actively used by the refiners.  And what it allows them to do is to, at the drop of a hat, request a big boost in their supply of hydrogen, and they pay a premium cost for that.  So, that's also helping the sales out down there.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Good morning.  I guess first of all just a question on the backlog on the CapEx spending. You've been increasing the CapEx budget by slightly more than 200 million a year for the last several years.  As you look at the current backlog, would it be reasonable to assume that your CapEx spending is going to sort of accelerate a little bit over the next few years rather than just maintain that trend line?</p>

          <p>And I guess, secondly, in the last couple of conference calls, you've been highlighting sort of the helium, argon, the rare gases, the specialty gases, the scarcity in all of those. If you took those as a bucket, I mean how much does that represent of your overall business?</p>

          <p>No, Europe is not &#x2013; Europe is just not used to putting through price increases.  And so, as a generalization, it's hard to get people to do price increases in Europe.

          <p>Okay.  And I guess just lastly, can you give sort of an update on your thoughts on possibly extending into additional geographies, beyond the geographies that you are currently in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are looking at a couple of other geographies.  We, as you know, extended into the, into Norway with the Yara joint venture. And we're looking at a couple of other geographies right now, but I can't tell you specifically what they are.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. A couple of things; one, when the Dreamliner finally begins to ship in quantity, can you give us any idea of what kind of boost in PST sales and earnings we might see from the higher activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't give you a specific idea, but I would like to see PST growing at 15 to 20% a year.  One of the problems, though, is that the aerospace only represents about 40% of the business; energy represents another 20 to 25.  Those are great, but the rest is in printing and textiles and things that are actually going down in terms of their industry economy.  So we're always going having to have this negative drag from textiles and paper and printing going down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I want to come back to the refining question, particularly with very high gasoline prices it sometimes seems as if refining operating rates are not what they should be and they are not providing enough supply.  Going back to BP, is the crude throughput about what it should be, it's just a question of the sweet sour and when could they get more sour and therefore consume more hydrogen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know the answer to that.  The only thing I can tell you is that refinery margins are squeezed right now, because cost of crude is going up more than the retail gasoline price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But one way to solve that is to acquire lower cost crudes, i.e. heavier....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I totally understand that.  But I can't speak for BP, and where they are sourcing their crude and what capacity they're running the refinery at and so forth. I just don't know.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning.  I was wondering if you could talk on the PDI side. You mentioned hard good sales pretty weak in the 1 to 2% range.  Was that across the board or were there some regions maybe where the weakness was more pronounced than in others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were definitely regions.  Ontario is the worst, because Ontario is the home to a lot of auto parts manufacturing. So, Ontario is the worst, and then pretty much strong in the &#x2013; in the South is very strong, the East is kind of weak, the Midwest is strong and the Pacific Northwest is strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, as you look at how PDI appears to be performing, I'm not going to speculate whether we're already in a recession or not, but how it's performing relative to past recessions.  Can you give us kind of a status report maybe with particular regard with &#x2013; to how pricing is holding up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this recession is very different from the one that we went through in &#x2013; 10 years ago, in 2000, 2001, and 2002. And it's also very different than the one we went through in 1992, because this one is basically being caused as much &#x2013; it's the banking sector which started the recession, okay. That wasn't what happened before. It was industry and consumer demand which started the recession. So, the banking industry started the recession and the question is how much does that spread to the rest of the world. The other big difference is that we have limits to growth in energy and raw materials now.  And so, for us, a recession which has a huge amount of growth in energy and raw materials isn't going to be so bad, as it was when we had a recession just because consumer demand was off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, I was also hoping you could address, in a little more detail, your comments about U.S. non-residential construction being a little bit weaker than a year ago.  Is that a reflection of just the general economic slowdown, are you seeing maybe some infrastructure projects getting delayed or canceled, or is it possible that maybe there is additional competition there and maybe you're even losing some share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in fact, I don't have a hard number on that. I am just kind of going by gut feel on it, because obviously residential construction's in the pits but business capital spending and business equipment is strong. What's in the middle I think is commercial construction, strip malls and stuff like that and I just have to guess that that's getting weaker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then, the last question I had on the compressed natural gas business in South America, can you talk about how the economics of transporting natural gas compared to other packaged gases, is it something that you can feasibly transport over longer distances or in the future are you going to need to build out your liquification and cylinder filament network in order to improve your geographic coverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, it's really about the same process in terms of transporting liquid, transporting natural gas versus transporting other gases.  It's not &#x2013; the cost structure is not all that different. And, but what does go on down there is the alcohol is also a substitute fuel down there. And so, if alcohol is cheap, people use less natural gas in their cars and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what kind of pricing dynamics have you seen between the two recently, is &#x2013; presumably natural gas is quite a bit more expensive relative to alcohol?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's actually a seasonal effect if you really want to get into it.  Because they harvest the &#x2013; they harvest the cane and the alcohol in their summer which is our winter, and prices are low.  And then you get to the other half side of the year, our summer their winter, prices of ethanol tend to go up. So, it's hard to follow.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Jim. You obviously reported a splendid quarter, your volumes are up and your pricing was very good. Your gross profit margin was down a 100 basis points, why is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is just purely because of the mix of hydrogen in the sales.  Because as you know we sell atmospheric gases, we have a very, very high gross margin, because we don't have any feedstock costs. In hydrogen business, you invest $1 of capital and you get $2 of sales, but $1.80 of those sales is just passing through the cost of natural gas in the contract to the customer, so those hydrogen sales just have much lower gross margins than atmospheric gas sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that. For my one follow-up, your minority interest number is, I think, up about 65% and your equity income more than doubled. Can you count, can you comment on that and talk about the sustainability of those trends for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure that they'll go up that fast for the year, but we've got the Yara joint venture, which we don't consolidate, and that's equity income. We've got the Shanghai joint venture, which is growing very rapidly, which comes in through equity income. And then on the minority side, we've got a couple of things, if the business is growing that you got a minority on, then your minority is going up, so it, they should be going up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, why did equity investment double, equity income double?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yeah, it could do that.</p>
