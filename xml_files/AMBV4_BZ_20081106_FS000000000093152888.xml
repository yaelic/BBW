          <p>Good morning and thank you for waiting. We would like to welcome everyone to AmBev's Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Today with us, we have Mr. Luiz Fernando Edmond, CEO for Latin America; Mr. Graham Staley, CFO and Investor Relations Officer; Mr. Jo&#xE3;o Castro Neves, CEO for Quinsa; and Mr. Bernardo Paiva, CEO for North America.</p>
          <p>We would like to inform you that this event is been recorded and all participants will be in listen-only mode during the company's presentation. After AmBev's remarks are completed, there will be a question-and-answer section. At that time, further instructions will be given. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the Safe Harbor of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1996. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of AmBev's management, and on information currently available to the company. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, because they relate to future events and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.</p>
          <p>Investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future results of AmBev, and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Graham Staley, CFO and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Staley, you may begin your conference.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Maurine and, good morning, good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today again to discuss our 2008 third quarter results. As usual, I'll start the call by sharing a brief overview of the quarter and then Luiz Fernando, Jo&#xE3;o and Bernardo will provide you with an overview of our results in Brazil, HILA-ex, Quinsa and North America. I will close by providing more specifics regarding the third quarter financials. Before I start I would just like to remind you that numbers are in Brazilian GAAP and that the percentage changes used in this call are on an organic basis, and that's otherwise stated.</p>
          <p>So, turning to the results, during the third quarter, our consolidated EBITDA reached more than R$2 billion, which represents a 6.4% growth when compared to the third quarter of 2007 and was driven by strong results in the Brazilian soft drinks and Quinsa businesses. Brazil EBITDA grew by 8.8%, behind a very strong quarter from our soft drinks operations. Brazil beer volumes closed the quarter up 1.1%, while Brazil CSD &amp; Nanc volumes grew 14.8%. Luiz Fernando will be providing you with more details of the drivers in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA margin in Brazil continues to recover from the poor first quarter start, increasing by 120 basis points in the third quarter, behind good top line growth. And as expected, a good performance in both cost of goods sold and SG&amp;A. Our Quinsa operations continue to deliver very strong results with EBITDA growing 37.2% from beer volume growth of 14.2% and CSD &amp; Nanc volume growth of 11.2%. In North America, third quarter volume grew by 2% accompanied by market share growth again although EBITDA declined by 5.2% as a result of anticipated commodity cost pressures.</p>
          <p>Net income increased in the quarter by almost 61% and is 24.4% higher than last year after nine months. Earnings per share excluding, goodwill amortization grew by 46.2%, and is up 24.7% year-to-date. I will comment further on net income at the end of this presentation.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Luiz Fernando as we start to take a little deeper dive into the results of each of our operations. Luiz?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you Graham and good morning everyone. Hi, there. Before I discuss the third quarter results, let me make a quick comment on ITI and <mark type="inaudible" /> since I know it's a subject which interests you. And we were still waiting for our final decision regarding the recently proposed tax changes in the beer and soft drink industries in Brazil and expect the tenants to be effective from the beginning of next year.</p>
          <p>At this stage there is very little new information to report and we cannot estimate how increase would impact the industry of AmBev, until the facts of work is determined how the tax will be regulated. We continue to believe that the government will not make unreasonable changes to the current tax levels nor jeopardized its tax provision controls during the regulations process.</p>
          <p>Let me now discuss our performance in Beer Brazil. Our third quarter volumes is very strong. The continued pressure on consumer spend from food inflation and more importantly food industry volumes in the month of September due to cold and wet weather in the main regions in Brazil resulting in volumes growing by only 1.1% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>After losing 70 basis points of share in July, we recovered 60 basis points and 40 basis points in August and September respectively. And we are now at 67.5% year-to-date which is flat against last year. We are particularly pleased with our share performance in Rio, where we have seen share gains for each of the last four months. Our focus will remain on improving our market share as we head into the summer.</p>
          <p>Our innovations in the skill portfolio namely the 630 ml, the one liter bowl and the multipack that we introduced during the year are performing well and contributing not only to the equity of the brand but also to our market share performance. We are also very pleased with the progress of <mark type="inaudible" /> which according to Neilsen has now around 0.7% share despite being sold only in markets of the North and Northwest region.</p>
          <p>Our beer net revenue spread here in Brazil grew 3.1%, when compared to last year. This increase partly reflects our price increases in December and February as well as an increase in the scope of our direct distribution network. In particularly, to aggressive price by our competitors, we were forced to pull back most of our Quinsa pricing as the year progress. Year-to-date we have grown net revenues per hectoliter either by 4.6%, which we believe is a very credible performance, given our competitors having reported flood pricing year-over-year and moving vastly into market.</p>
          <p>The growth in our beer COGS per hectoliter continues to decelerate as expected increasing over 3.6% when compared to last year due to our current hedges and efficiency projects. We expect this trend to improve in Q4 at the time when we expect our competitors will definitely increase pressure from the strength of the dollar. Beer SG&amp;A excluding depreciation and amortization grew by 6.9% due principally to inflation, volume growth, increases in direct distribution and target investments to help recover share. Beer's EBITDA finished the quarter 3% above Q3 last year, with EBITDA margins flat compared to 2007 for the first time this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to Brazil CSD &amp; Nanc, we had a very strong Q3 with volumes increasing by 14.8%. Our market share reached 17.8% for the quarter, 80 basis points higher than last year. It was encouraging to see our organic performance so much better than our main competitor in both volume and market share. Our successful innovations are the main reason behind this improvement and we continue to see greater opportunities in the CSD business both from a market share and profitability perspective.</p>
          <p>CSD &amp; Nanc net revenues per hectoliter grew 4.9% in the beer as a result of pricing in selected market, markets and easier comparisons to 2007. We'll continue to track and monitor pricing opportunities closely. Soft drinks cost of goods sold per hectoliter fell by 3.5% in the quarter despite after comparison as all hedge gains in sugar and currency continue to benefit us. This trend will continue in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Soft drink's SG&amp;A expenses excluding depreciation, amortization declined by 6.1% in the quarter due to tougher comparisons from higher spend in Q3 last year. CSD delivered a lot of strong EBITDA results, 53% higher than last year, with EBITDA margin improving by 950 basis points to 43.4%. As the summer draws closer here in Brazil, all of our beer mcf plans are in place and there are people who have spoken on ensuring, we outperform our competitors at point of connection.</p>
          <p>Turning briefly to HILA-ex, we continue to face challenges in the region, with an EBITDA loss of R$22.8 million for the quarter. Here volumes declined 6.4% in the period, despite stronger performance in Peru and Ecuador both of which grew volumes by double-digits and grew market share. However, our challenges in Venezuela continue to significantly impact the overall performance for the region. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to pursuing our long-term goals in the region.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to 2009, the current global financial crisis and economic slow down effects and poses challenges for everyone. It is impossible to predict the future but then I'm more opportunistic about the beverage industry than I'm about other industries. Beverages have proven to be resilient in the past and I believe they will be resilient in the future. At difficult times like this our brands, our people, our management systems are put to the task and I'm confident that they are well prepared to meet this challenge.</p>
          <p>And before I pass it to Jo&#xE3;o, I will like to comment on the recent announcement and also management changes in AmBev. I'm sure you have read the detail of the changes which will take place following the closing of the <mark type="inaudible" /> transaction. Jo&#xE3;o, Bernardo and I will be taking on new challenges and Marcio Froes, who joined the company as a trainee in 1993 will become the new Head of Labatt as he's spent the last three years working in Canada. I know I speak for all of us, when I say we are all excited about our new responsibilities, and we remain 100% committed to delivering against our remaining 2008 plans.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call to Jo&#xE3;o who will talk about our Quinsa business.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luiz. Good afternoon, good morning to everyone. Well, our beer and soft drinks operation continue to deliver outstanding results both in terms of volume growth and EBITDA with double-digit growth in every market where we operate. This happened in spite of a tougher scenario in some of the countries within the region. Consolidated volumes increased 12.9% organically in the quarter based on the excellent performance of both the beer and the soft drinks business. Our volume growth was 14.2% in the case of beer and 11.2% in soft drinks.</p>
          <p>Solid market growth across the region and higher market shares in Argentina and Chile were the main factors for the significant growth in volumes. We continue to be successful at introducing innovation and expanding the beer category against wine. Our actions include the launching of dark premium beers, first in Argentina and Chile and now also in Hawaii. And in general, the focus on the premium segment across the region. We were very active in the marketplace supporting our brands, sponsoring music festivals, and  building effective and long-term relationship with the sugars and point of connection.</p>
          <p>Net revenues per hectoliter grew organically both in beer and soft drinks as a result of higher price across the region, focused revenue management and strong performance in our premium brands. In the light of individual beer markets, Argentina had another quarter with outstanding growth, based on marketing expansion and higher market share. The company performed very well in the premium segment through Estella to <mark type="inaudible" /> and the recently launched <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>The position of the business continue to post strong growth rate despite an uncertain environment that resulted in severe confrontations during the last couple of months. Our performance was based on market growth with our market share remaining stable. We focused also on some product innovations such as <mark type="inaudible" /> to keep strengthening our core brands. Our key operations for the another quarter of both market to grow in a market share gain. We performed particularly well in the supermarket and tradition distribution channels helped by promotion and innovations as such Barma Boc, Stella Artois, Becker Amberlager.</p>
          <p>The beer market in Paraguay continued to recover, which allows us to show another quarter with important fundamental growth. The company was very active in the marketplace launching promotional activity, light programs to obtain market share in corporate beers. The beer brand had an excellent result again getting market share and becoming the most significant penetration of our global brand within the region. Our beer business in Uruguay has also benefited from market expansion in premium segment growth. Our premium brand Previd&#xEA;nci showed impressive performance gain market share and contributing higher profitability. We successfully aimed our efforts at increasing beer consumption in the winter and introducing Dark Premium beer to further develop the beer category.</p>
          <p>In soft drink, also a very good quarter in terms of volume and net revenues, with market share gains both in Argentina and Uruguay. In Argentina all of the Pepsi brands grew within their segments, while the A segment as a whole gained market share versus the B brands, explaining a great part of our outstanding performance. We outperform our competitors with Pepsi, 7UP, Mirinda, in our <mark type="inaudible" /> (15.20) stores. H2O products also continued gaining market share within the flavored waters, having recently launched the apple and orange flavors.</p>
          <p>Regarding our costs and SG&amp;A expenses, we are introducing the initiatives within our control to mitigate the negative effect of higher cost of raw materials fundamentally soft drinks, transportation and labor, with strong focus on achieving debt transfer and efficiencies and also the deconsolidation.</p>
          <p>Solid growth rates in all the markets where we operate together with focused revenue management and the cost initiatives have resulted in the EBITDA organic growth of 37.2% in the quarter with a 41.1 EBITDA margin.</p>
          <p>I'll like to end my comments by congratulating my team for succeeding on market execution and financial discipline and fully adapting to the AmBev opportunities results, has enabled to over perform in the region that has been unstable and threatened by diverse conflicts during recent months. We're in good shape to face the coming challenges with solid fundamentals to maximize our top-line, adequate to become more cost efficient, in effect corporate to protect ourselves from situations in commodities and currencies.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to invite Bernardo to literally take over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joao. Hello everyone. The third quarter was a very challenging one for AmBev. We posted our organic EBITDA decline of minus 5.2% in the quarter, driven mainly by the cost as we anticipated. On the other hand, I continue to be pleased with our quarter results on top-line, driven by market share growth and by net revenue growth. I remain strongly confident on our dream to deliver full year EBITDA growth with no loss of our market share.</p>
          <p>Our top-line showed very healthy growth in the quarter; driven by industry growth of 2.8%, share growth of 10 basis points and by the net revenue per hectolite initiatives. Moreover, our market share gains were consistent. And for our overall the strategy and focus on fewer brands. I'm happy to say once again that Budweiser and Bud Light <mark type="inaudible" /> (17.21) Stella Legere grew their share in the quarter and the year-to-date as well.</p>
          <p>On the bottom side the industry growth and share gain helped us, but was partially offset by the discontinuation of Lakeport contracting volumes and by a decline export volumes outside of US. Excluding this Lakeport issue our domestic volume grew by 3%.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, as anticipated, our cost per hectoliter Lakeport posted an increase of 15.9% which was higher than Q1 and Q2. As you saw in the market the price of many inputs, featured in the second quarter, but as the purchase of inputs allowed us to delay the heat until the third quarter. This heat was partially offset by year-over-year efficiencies in our brewers and by improvements on quantity. I believe that there is some softening on price to help us to deliver bad results in cost per hectoliter in Q4.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A excluding the depreciation showed a year-over-year increase of 4.9%. This increase is driven mainly by the transportation cost as a result of fuel price and by saving capture in our sales and marketing expense. Cost management remains a strength of Labatt and this excluding these two items, we once again showed a year-over-year reduction on operating expense.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, as we close out '08 we will continue to focus on few and big things. I reinforce that I am very confident on our top-line strategy of focused investing in key brands, disciplined revenue management, straight performance, that deliver market share., each dollar that goes to the market has to return in market share, and obsessive sales execution is paying off.</p>
          <p>To support this strategy, we have been put in place, for us to be the world class sales business here and marketing skills, focus and discipline to ensure consistent and sustainable brand strategy. On the cost side, COGS per hectoliter continues to be a concern. Although I do expect that worst of the cost inflation is now behind us. In addition of driving EBIT figures on American dollars, we will continue to work on revenue management opportunities including pricing increases in specific regions and we expect some better net revenue per hectoliter in Q4 to partially offset this.</p>
          <p>I continue to fully work hard to deliver the '08 results here in Canada and I remain very confident in our ability to deliver the full year EBITDA growth. We will deliver that with no loss from market share. That's the dream that I share with you in the start of this year.</p>
          <p>So, that's it. Now I would like to go back to Graham.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bernardo. In this final section before the Q&amp;A I'll like to guide through the mainline to into reported EBIT of over 1.6 billion reais and the net income of nine time of 49 million reais disclosed on page 17 of our release. Although operational income and expense with a net expense of 78 million reais in the quarter significantly lower than the expense of 335 million reais in the same period last year. The main reason for this decline was translation gains from our equity investments as a result of the strong depreciation of the US dollar in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our net financial result with an expense to 286 million reais, down 8.5% when compared to 313 million reais in Q3 last year. Our net financial expense for Brazil including local and foreign currencies denominated debt was fairly stable in the period despite changes in exchange rate as a result of our hedges. Our effective tax rate in the period was 28.2% compared to 38.5% last year despite strong improvement in our earnings before taxes. This improvement is a result of non-taxable translation gains recorded in Q3 this year compared to non-deductible translation loses recorded last year.</p>
          <p>At times like this cash is certainly king. And our strong cash flow generation, cost and working capital discipline, plus geographical footprint will prove to be valuable assets. Of course the uses of cash going forward will depend on the changing economic and financial environment. We have not faced any liquidity issues during the recent crisis, but nevertheless, we want to retain flexibility and therefore are likely to hold on to slightly more cash than normal going forward, giving the continuing uncertainty in world markets.</p>
          <p>The distribution of excess cash in 2009 is still under review and the balance between dividend, interest on capital, share buyback and possible retirement of inefficient debt has not been determined at this stage. So far through the end of September 2008, we have distributed to shareholders 616 reais million by the way of share buybacks and 2.05 billion reais in dividends and interest on capital.</p>
          <p>We also paid a further $840 million reais as dividends and interest on capital beginning on October the 13th.</p>
          <p>In the light of recent events in Brazil, I would like to take this opportunity to make it very clear that AmBev has a clear and conservative financial risk management policy in place and that this policy does not allow us to enter into any speculative or exhaustive derivative contract. I can also confirm that in terms of commodities we have already covered our estimated exposure to the price of hedgeable commodities mainly, sugar, aluminum and barley for the full year of 2009. We have also covered our estimated US dollar exposure for both hedgeable and non-hedgeable commodities for 2009. The average rate for our 2009 hedges in Brazil is 1.88 reais to $1 compared to an average rate of 2.00 in 2008.</p>
          <p>In closing, AmBev once again reported EBITDA growth in the third quarter with good performances in Brazil and another very strong performance by Quinsa. We have our best business plans in place for the summer season, adjusting volumes and market share growth and we'll be leaving heavily on our strong execution capabilities and the qualities of our people.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand back to Maurine and open up for questions.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Good morning everybody. Graham, I'm aware that you don't want to address dividends and buybacks, but as you look at your debt amortizations going forward, right, you've got a very admirable balance sheet but you have 4 billion in short term debt, right. 2 billion in cash before the payment of this last dividend, and I was curious as to what your plans are for your short-term debt? And with respect to the remaining cash on the balance sheet, I was wondering how much if any of it is pledged as collateral, or is it all unencumbered so you have a little bit more flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob. These are difficult unusual times, and therefore, it may sound unusual that we haven't made any final decisions on how to distribute our cash in 2009. We would obviously like to continue with a mixture of share buybacks and dividends and as you say we do have 4 billion of debt that is due during the course of 2009, which under normal circumstances one should be able to replace that with other short -- other debt as well.</p>
          <p>So this point in time we haven't made any decisions. We do want to retain all the flexibility we can. Let these markets settle down a little bit longer. So, I mean another month could make a huge difference to the status of the credit markets, money could free up again at sensible prices.</p>
          <p>Alternatively they could time, non one knows. So that's why we are fortunate to have good strong cash flow and while we want to, as I say hold on to slightly more cash in the near future, benefit in near future with the next two or three months unfold, it should become a lot clear.</p>
          <p>Some of the cash balances are as you say pledged. I can't give you the precise number here, but there are obviously some balances that are underpinning our derivative positions. But I think going forward we will be holding something between 800 and 1 billion in cash balances as a normal ongoing level of cash. Obviously at certain points in time that will build up as we come up to a dividend payment. But the underlying balance will be between 800 million and 1 billion I would say.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask a question on Brazil Beer. You were successful, which is great in terms of gaining back your market share. But I guess it came at the expense of some pricing actions. So can you just comment a bit on how you see the competitive dynamics into the market? I assume the year-end maybe challenging, I don't know that's a fact given what's going in the economy. And this morning in the call, <mark type="inaudible" /> mentioned that you'll pass on whatever excise tax increase, it would get pass. Can you talk about what gives you confidence on the 2009 pricing outlook when the 2008 pricing environment has been a little bit sort of tough and go.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with regards to the competitive scenario what we've seen so far is of course we maintain our discipline in terms of our pricing. So beginning of the year we passed the inflation into our prices for both. We're on and off trade and returnables and non-returnables. Usually as you are used to our competitors follow our prices in 45 to 60 days, not necessarily 100%, not necessarily. We use exactly the same strategy. What I believe given the positive scenario that we have in the past, markets are still growing and of course opening the gap, the price gap against those would benefit volume growth and our competitors are perusing more market share strategy than necessarily really trying to deliver bad results year-on-year.</p>
          <p>What happened is, basically our competitors gave a price and opened the gap against us. We try to maintain the gap with all brands and reinforce investments in our brand, reinforcing our trade programs. But at certain point, you don't resist and the gap is two much for the brands to resist.</p>
          <p>And I'm very pleased that the brands resist before and year-to-date we are able to maintain the share. But of course the results that we have in July kind of put a red line -- red light on us and we decide it was time to react and to demonstrate that we'll not give up our share in the market, our participation in the market just because in the short-term we would be under pressure in our profitability, in our price strategy.</p>
          <p>So we put in place several initiatives both for the top-line and the bottom-line. So we've been trying to capture as much as we can. Now I would say the moment is more in our favor since demand is constrained I think would be easier to negotiate with our suppliers and implement some of the initiatives, the cost related initiatives going forward. But also in the top-line we continue to implement programs in the market and accelerating some of the things that they were planning to do ahead of us. But also we had to close gap in the off trade. The off trade is something that is more price sensitive than other channels since distribution skills and execution doesn't make that much difference as it does in the on-trade segment.</p>
          <p>So we had to give up some of the price that we put at the beginning of the year. And of course on top of that we had launched at end of last year, the beginning of this year some price pack initiatives, so we had to rollout of our 18, 24 pack, can pack as our competitors launch same kind of innovation and this is not something that you really can maintain for a long time if you are successful. It's not that difficult to copy.</p>
          <p>They not only launched innovation but they brought prices down. And when we introduced the packs in the market what we did is, we managed in a way that we could increase prices and maintain share. So it was a not a sheer strategy. What we did was that could be opposite, they launched at a lower price than they have in their regular pack. So that put a lot of pressure on us and we had to react. I think this is the main reasons for that and of course the volume of the market, the market growth didn't help us this year. But of course it didn't help anyone this year. So we are suffering both in share and market growing below our expectations.</p>
          <p>We have several big initiatives in place. So we're rolling out the <mark type="inaudible" /> in other North and Northeastern regions, very successful in that market above 4% in most of the states now. If you look at Brazil, it's 0.7% share in the brand that we launched only one year ago.</p>
          <p>The leader is being rolled out into all of this in South regions of Brazil. Of course it takes time until it becomes relevant but its implemented everywhere in the key regions. But the scenario remains tough. I'm very happy to have the 3% growth on the net revenue spread here when I compare to what happened with my competitors. You would probably have seen that, both <mark type="inaudible" /> and Samsung announced results for year-to-date. They say that they haven't increased net revenue with respect compared to last year.</p>
          <p>And we did 3% in the quarter and 4.5% year-to-date. So, I think we are in better shape to face what is ahead of us. But I can guarantee you that we have even stronger market plans and investments in our brand very, very efficient to be put in place and of course our innovations pipeline is very strong and will be implemented, short and long-term.</p>
          <p>So we will defend the health of our brand, our share in the market, but we try to keep the price discipline as long as we can. I hope, going forward, our competitors will be more rational given the pressure they have in costs. I'm not sure if they have the same hedging policy as we have. We suffered from that in the past. Because of course dollars had been hedged in the past but the trend was negative so we had it at the higher price than the spot market in the country every year. But we did that to protect our pricing strategy going forward and of course for next year, we should be in better shape, at least they would be in my view more under pressure than they were this year. That doesn't mean they will increase prices ahead of us. But at least they will do more rational. That's my feeling.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just a quick question on your price gap. And I'm thinking particularly going into the next year. The price gap versus competition obviously could be affected by the change in the tax regime. And if you go little current tax, I know it's not finalized, but as you look at the current tax of NP436, it looks as if this is going to be a lot more proportional taxation than advent taxation. So effectively you will be penalized. And the question is if you have to choose between increasing your price gaps versus the competition to account for a higher taxation for you -- for competition, will you do that or will you just take a hit on your profits in order to maintain the price -- the price tag stable for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you recall, as I said in my speech, we're don't expect the government to be too aggressive on that. Of course, they will implement changes. It's early to say exactly how the changes will impact and how much they will impact. Again, they will impact beer and soft drinks in different ways. We are the price leaders in soft drinks. We are in beer. We always defend our cost stability, but we always defend long-term of the company. So price is something that we'll manage short and long-term as we did this year. We tried hard to pass prices to consumers. We would have been able to keep the prices that we implemented as our competitors have forced. I don't expect that the changes in IPI to be more relevant than inflation for example and more relevant than price pressures for example. So yes you're right, but you have to consider other factors. And on top of that, as we believe the government will not only maintain the discipline in pursuing competitors not paying taxes, I think they will also implement more initiatives to reinforce the system -- when you compare what you should be pay with what is really paid. That doesn't mean that increasing our excise more than our competitors means that proportionally we will pay much more, because you should make them pay, than its much that -- I would accept very well an increase in my tax if we have 100% share, playing field in terms of taxes in Brazil. So we still have competitors not paying taxes and we hope that government will implement more, even more initiatives and strong initiatives to stop it. So I mean, there are pros and cons both in the beer and soft drinks side, but its too late. We'll try to maintain the discipline. We will maintain the discipline. Of course, we expect not to have a significant impact in the ITI next year. We believe government will be rational with that. It's not a time to implement things that will impact consumers negatively. So we're still waiting, but we are prepared with not only the pricing strategy, but also with initiatives. If we have to implement behind brands and behind trade programs to compensate for that, we'll be ready.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi everyone. I was hoping you could talk a bit more about the current consumer environment in Brazil. Obviously, you mentioned pressure at the consumer level due to food inflation. I was just hoping if you could give us a sense over the last few months, have these pressures become tougher for you. And also more specific to your beer division, have you changed -- seen a change in trends be it trading out of premium brands, shipping and channels maybe more on premise versus off premise or vice versa. What are you seeing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Overall, consumer behavior I would say is different in different industries. So as I mentioned, if you go back two or three years in Brazil, you would see some of the durables growing very, very fast car industry, metals and construction everything growing very fast, much ahead of us, given all the credit -- the new credit facilities that were put in place in Brazil. So these industries probably are suffering more in the short-term than we are. There has been for last few years a shift between durables and non-durables and the country people are taking more credit and therefore having less money to consume the non-essentials, let's put it this way. And what we see now is that these areas where we're growing more in the past are suffering more in the short-term.</p>
          <p>In our case the industry performance is more related, and believe me or not, that the weather conditions that we had in the country this year. So in 10 months -- I think seven months out of 10 were worse than last year in terms of raining and temperature. And of course that impacts a lot of the beer business and not as much in the soft drinks business. That is more related to real income and real prices than beer. So of course consumers will be impacted at some point. But we believe that beer industry is more resilient, especially in Brazil. You don't see those big variations and not up and not down. So I mean difficult to predict, difficult to say exactly what -- how people will change their behaviors. But short-term what I can tell you is that -- I would say in Brazil people are probably less concerned that on average when you go other countries. But of course they are changing the short term -- the credit taking and of course not committing for long-term investments in fixed assets specifically.</p>
          <p>So, this is one thing. In terms of the premium, that as you asked. Of course premium brands are suffering more. However, it's difficult to say right now how much of the premium is because of temperature, because you got <mark type="inaudible" /> beer, which is one of the premium brands. As you know it's a very strong on-trade consumption and we have these wrecked weather, we lose some performers. So, this year has been the case so far. How much is of course consumption restrictions in terms of purchasing power or how much is in fact of the drink and drive restrictions that were implemented during the year that this department is more related to the on-trade than people could be compensating more with the off-trade than on-trade. So, we're following that very, very closely. But it's very, very soon to say exactly what kind of long-term behaviors will change and how that would affect our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess just a follow-up on that whole drinking driving and the change that we've seen over the last couple of months. It seemed last quarter you didn't think there was a significant impact, has any of that changed? Or is it still manageable to you, are you seeing a lot of less traffic as a result of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, last time people learn how to deal with that. So I think the behavior is improving in terms of both, how to compensate the restrictions having a friend driving the car or planning somehow to go by taxi or any of these -- or the trade itself implementing initiatives to drive you back home or to drive your car and then go back with a motorcycle or anything like that. So there are several initiatives in that sense. So there was a lot of pressure how to educate people at the very beginning and now I think people are learning and acting accordingly. And we have let's say less impact in terms of the consumption because people educate themselves, and if they want to go out and have beers they do that in a more organized way and also because we are implementing the initiatives to compensate for that and to help the consumers act accordingly. And of course there is a benefit of that because traffic accidents have come down. So, I think net-net it's the right thing to do as we said, and we're in the right direction.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. You talked -- I think a couple of times -- couple of you have referenced that you're very committed of course this year -- this year's is delivering -- this year's full year '08 targets. But your allocations for profit sharing and bonuses is down substantially from last year's. I'm just wondering, was the expectation always for a lower level of achievement relative to last year not that you wouldn't achieve, but at a lower incremental level, therefore bonuses should have been down by that amount or was the idea that the fourth quarter is critical to achieving that target for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Celso. Obviously AmBev is made up of different business units. And I think you probably know our bonus plan is geared very much to individual targets within business units and targets for market share, volume cost, et cetera, et cetera. And clearly different zones are having a different experience this year.</p>
          <p>We set aggressive targets, and clearly in Brazil where we're not doing exactly what we would have liked to have done. We're not hitting the targets that we would like achieved. It's clear we would have liked to have had more beer volume growth from 1.1% in the third quarter for example.</p>
          <p>So the provision we have represents how we think the year will finish. It doesn't necessarily mean that it will be a disappointing year in overall result. But it just means we won't be hitting some of those really stretched targets that we've always set for ourselves, and in the future we'll continue to set for ourselves. It's our philosophy. It's alignment with shareholder expectations and we'll continue to set targets that are really demanding.</p>
          <p>I don't know if Luiz has anything else to add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the bonus provisions is difficult to go into details for that because if you take <mark type="inaudible" /> for example the Quinsa operations, we are doing very well in Canada, very well too according to the targets.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, the soft drinks business is doing well. But the biggest business is the Brazilian beer business, and of course we're now happy with the results that we achieved. So, we are expecting industry grow more than we're having. We expect our share to grow; we are under pressure with that. But we expect our net revenue spread will be able to go ahead of that.</p>
          <p>So as I said, industry is not helping us this year, and on top of that our competitors decide to be more aggressive in price. So this is just a kind of reflection of our decision to maintain our long term commitment with all markets, with all brands, and not just to push the company too hard to deliver a target that in the year, and then compromise our future. So I think that's where we have to read that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow-up, if I could. I guess no one asked because I thought that they would have. Obviously lots changed in the last several weeks and that probably will change going forward. Can you give us a bit of an update -- we see that weather was quite bad and days of rain again in October. So doesn't seem to be that trend improving, very much at least in Brazil. Can you give us an update on how volumes performed not just in Brazil actually but also in Argentina given some of this news we've been reading and things like that, at least thus far this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, I don't want to get into forward-looking forecast. I think it's a dangerous thing to do. So, but we have no comment on that at this stage of game. But your observations are correct and reinforced by Luiz's comments on Brazil climate in the last nine months or so.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I wanted to thank you for taking in the follow-up. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the hedging and I don't want to get the specifics as you say. But I just want to understand a bit more sort of what exactly you're hedging. I mean you mentioned, when you're talking about Canada that the peak of the barley cycle was in the second quarter, and you felt it in the third quarter, but you're expecting to get better into the fourth quarter. And I guess if you locked in most of your supply, I guess I'm surprised that a move in the spot would affect your costs in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.</p>
          <p>And I guess similarly, philosophically, if I think about what you've done for '09 and let's say in Brazil, you clearly locked in a much better currency level versus what you would get now in the spot. But I would presume that you've locked into some of the commodities of higher levels than you were today. So could you help us understand how to reconcile that, at least philosophically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Complicated subject Lore. We've talked about this in the past. We talk in terms of hedging our hedgable commodities. We always talk in terms of aluminum, sugar and barley which are the main ones here in Brazil. But in Canada for example, some of those commodities are not hedgable, based on drinks for example in many cases are controlled by the Canadian government in terms of pricing. So, we can't always hedge. So when we talk specifically about the COGS improving in Canada in the fourth quarter, it's because those contracts are not hedged and therefore we know what the likely prices will be in the fourth quarter, and we can anticipate some improvements.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, in Quinsa, we have different hedging protocols. And so as you well know the whole of 2008 has been locked in Brazil for aluminum, barley and sugar, and it's been locked for 10 months now. So we are very clear on what's going to happen in Q4 in terms of those commodities and I've said many times in Brazil, cost of goods will be continue to improve as we get towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Brazil was 93% costs of goods per hectoliter increase in the quarter and its only 5.1% for the full nine months. And that's against an inflation now for Brazil, which is more like 6.2, 6.3. So we are very pleased with what's happening in Brazil, and as I've said because of strong currency and sugar hedges Q4 will continue to improve.</p>
          <p>In terms of our hedges for next year, the same profile. We've now locked for Brazil. Our expected aluminum, sugar, barley and associated dollars. Of course, this is not a science, it's an art. If we all knew what the prices, what the volumes are going to be next year and what the mix is going to be, we can do a perfect hedge, but we always have to use estimates and anticipate those exposures and we like to get better and better every year, and we think we're getting better. But it's still at the end of day the best estimate we can come up with.</p>
          <p>We've allocated -- we hedged our aluminum in both Canada and Arkansas. So we covered those both. And we've taken also some other hedges out in Canada on other products that are hedgeable, small items in the context of the big scheme of things, not very significant. So I think you also mentioned the dollar, yes, we hedge the 188. It was an interesting spend the last couple of months as we were closing out 2009 for the Brazilian business. But the average for the next year is 1.88 and it will vary considerably. As you know, one point spot in Brazil was totally 1.55, 1.56 at some point. So clearly when we were putting in those forward hedges, we were getting very good rates. So the phasing next year will be quite, quite dramatically changed month-to-month as we go through the year. But 1.88 is the average for the year. And yes, we also hedge the commodities at the time. We can have a little bit of variation between when we hedge in commodity and when we're hedge the associated currency, but generally speaking, we hedge at the same time. So we lock into better currency rates, but of course, you lock into a higher commodity rate. Looking forward into 2009, commodities certainly are going to be under a lot of pressure. We expect to see them easing to the right deal and so that's positive news for the industry and a general comment on COGS for next year, very difficult to predict because the world still is changing. But I think we had so many discussions about commodities and costs in '08 versus '07. It was a big issue both for ourselves and obviously for investors. I think as we look forward to 2009, it's certainly going to be a less impactful year in terms of commodities, based on what we see at the moment. And we all know what can happen in two months, but based on what we're seeing at the moment, 2009 should be a less impactful for COGS than 2008. Just one other point we're talking about commodities, I think it was Bob Ford, who asked the question about restricted cash. I think I gave a number of 450 to 500 million for our restricted cash. I was actually thinking at that point about cash, we'd also got on deposit in terms of our legal deposits that we have to place security against losses et cetera and tax matters here in Brazil. So I was including about 450 million of legal deposits, which actually are not cash. They're held on our balance sheet as an asset. So just to re-state what Bob was asking me, I think probably we're looking more like R$150 million of cash allocated to our derivatives trading and the rest is at first cash that we used within the business, working capital et cetera. So I just wanted to clarify that before we end the call.</p>

          <p>Hi. I had a quick question for Jo&#xE3;o. I mean, the way your volumes have been increasing in Argentina, it's a matter of time, you're all too short-term probably, but you're going to run out of capacity in Argentina and I was just wondering, I mean whether what do you do about this. Do you keep on increasing prices as it has been or do you have the chance potentially to buy some asset such as the <mark type="inaudible" /> plant that has been for sale for years? Is there a possibility to buy that plant without buying the brand, which only you would not be allowed to buy? But in general, how do you expect to solve the capacity versus pricing problem in 2009.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Jose. Well basically, for this summer season, for example, I mean we still have the contract brewing that we had when we sold the <mark type="inaudible" /> okay. We have this contract for last summer season and we have renewed it for this summer season predicting that we would have a good summer. So we are okay for the summer season and when you look at the next summer season then I think it will depend how strong the market continues to be and, of course, the maintenance offer much higher market share for than we have for last year. We were like three points above what we were. So I think for next year, it will be a combination of again trying to renew this contract braking which should be a problem. There is not a lot of other options. I mean there is little bit of <mark type="inaudible" />. I don't think they are using back, it's a open for that sort of off situation. But we have been able -- I think what's interesting is that we have been, in the last couple of years with very little investment to increase our capacity a lot. And I think we still have a few weeks here and there to not having to overspend in CapEx and continue to sustain on important growth going forward. So there is the of combination this contract backing agreement that we have as well with minor investments or the minimum level possible for CapEx will allow us to continue to grow at the mid type of growth, not double-digit growth, but mid single type of growth for next year. Without having to use the price value, to be quite honest, what you see in terms of price, of course the price level is always something that you can try to use to regulate. I think our strategy that you have known for years is the same one that we have use here, being growing prices in line when inflation sometimes is likely to be low, given the ramp up of inflation. And I think this has been the right strategy, because I mean given the cost efficiency that we have, that both we have for VIC and VVB has allowed us to move us pretty much in line, but gaining a lot of share and putting pressure on the cost side of competitor. So I believe we're going to be able to repeat this strategy going forward without necessarily needing to over invest or to build the same new plans or anything like that.</p>

          <p>No, I don't think they are open for one or the other. That's my view on this. It's always -- I'm not pretending but given the contract that we already have in place and plus that infrastructure, the footprint that we have, I feel that we can continue to sustain a mid singles growth type of situation without needing to buy that of course -- that's meant for sale. Of course we will be after that. I don't think that is the case.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. My question was to do with the base growth of beer versus soft drinks. I wondering if you can help us understand better, I mean why is soft drinks growing so much faster than beer. I know that something has to do with the base of comparison, which is much smaller in soft drinks. There also seems to be a big discrepancy in terms of the beer -- I am sorry in terms of the pricing that you see into two categories and they seem to be much more aggressive on pricing of beer rather than soft drinks. Which other elements should we consider when trying to understand these different pages of growth in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First, let me explain you how it works. In beer, there are three major levers to impact the market. You have the real disposable income, you have real prices to consumers and then you have weather. So the weather variances, they are very well relevant for the beer business. Since Brazil is too have a relevant market that is on-premise market and the tradition, the occasions that people use beer is more an on-premise kind of a consumption than the off-premise. Then when you have such a bad weather, as you had in Brazil this year, there is a huge impact over the users.</p>
          <p>The second is, in soft drinks, we implemented innovations last year, very, very strong and successful innovation basically in the 3.3 liter pack that gave us more ability to play with price positioning. We have the Guara innovation which is big with a new occasion, a new segment that we call in Brazil, fortunately we still -- because of the legislation we call it CSD, but it's not -- it's a flip of water, but it's inside business and complementary add to the business. We had the great innovation that as the business became more profitable, we could introduce other flavors that we were not competing in the market and very successful in innovations.</p>
          <p>So, therefore we gain a lot of share this year. So when you look at the 80 basis points that I said when you compare to 17% share, that represents a loss in terms of the growth. So the share gains driven by innovations are the main levers for the share. And then, of course, you have the market that is less impacted by the weather condition that we're facing this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of the pricing, we have different dynamics in terms of the way we implement prices in beer and soft drinks, because, of course, in beer we are the leaders, in soft drinks we are the followers. And as the off-trade is more, representative for CSD, price points are kind of markup of the price that we sell to the trade, to the off-trade and is a more a percentage business. In beer when you go to the on-trade, the $0.10 multiple in the price that we sell, if you loose control of that and then the prices instead of growing 10, it grows 20. There is a negative impact in market share. So we prefer to have less price increases in beer than in soft drinks. In soft drinks, you forget Q3 -- our NCO per hectoliter grew 4.9% versus 3.1% in beer. And year-to-date, we are pretty much in line, 4.6% and 4.7%. But if you look at margins, soft drinks are increasing faster just because in the NCO you have a negative impact of mix shifting towards more the PET than cans, and cans are much more profitable but, of course, volume is flat. It's not increasing. So in terms of price, both pieces are pretty much in line, but there is a negative effect in mix for soft drinks. This is again compensated by lower cost and then we have a positive impact in margins.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for picking up the question. I just would like to -- if you could discuss a little more regarding Venezuela, what's going on in that market, the industry volumes, your main competitor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, several things some of them are our responsibility, some of them are more market conditions. So we introduced some initiatives in Venezuela that didn't work. We didn't manage the best prices in a good way, before we lost share, a significant lost share in that country. Of course, the share base is low and any 100 basis points that you loose; there is a huge impact in volume. So part of it is because we didn't manage our business well in that country. We lost some people there. We had union problems. So we are implementing several management changes in the country. We did at the second Q this year, to recover. But on top of that you have a country that is struggling to fix itself with some problems or restrictions and initiatives.</p>
          <p>It's very difficult to say what will be the scenario going forward since you have all the desirable -- and the currency variation, so you still have lot of controls in terms of the currency in the markets. So, very difficult to say what will happen, but I would say that such a bad year like we have in Venezuela couldn't be worse going forward.</p>
          <p>So the other thing that we did there, including pricing business, closing some gaps that we had and our competitors continue to push prices ahead can help us in the future. So I think now we are in a much better shape and going forward you should see not necessarily in the fourth Q but next year you should see results improving again.</p>

          <p>No, no, not you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are not discussing leaving Venezuela. We want to succeed in that country. We have been there for a long time now. We have a strategy in place in the country. It's the highest beer consumption, but tact consumption that we have in the region, is a profitable margin. And of course, it's not -- sometimes it's distressing. I guess everything that you know from the way the country is operated. But we are committed to that market. We believe we have a good plan going forward. We have the very bad year; we were improving to next year. So I think we are not leaving unless we have very, very, very good reason for that and we don't have today.</p>
