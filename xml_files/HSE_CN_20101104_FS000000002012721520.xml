          <p>Welcome to the Husky Energy Third Quarter 2010 Conference Call and Webcast. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode, and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Rob McInnis, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our 2010 third quarter results. I'd like to take a second to introduce myself. My name is Rob McInnis, and I am the Manager of Investor Relations for Husky Energy. With me today are CEO, Asim Ghosh; CFO, Alister Cowan; COO, Rob Peabody; and Vice President of Midstream and Refined Products, Terrance Kutryk.</p>
          <p>In today's call, Asim will provide an overview of Husky's strategic direction. Alister will discuss the company's performance. And Rob will provide an update on our upstream operations, while Terrance will provide an update on the midstream and downstream activities.</p>
          <p>Please note that today's comments contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risk factors and assumptions that are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings, which are available on SEDAR, EDGAR and our website.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Asim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thanks for being on the call. I guess, before I get into the quarter, I just want to recap very briefly to what we said when we released our second quarter results, which was my first call with you guys. And basically, the simple theme I spelled out at that time was where I saw Husky was, we were long on long-term opportunities, but we needed tweaking to correct the fact that we were short on short-term opportunities.</p>
          <p>In summary on the long-term opportunities, we are extremely well positioned for the long-term, those are the growth pillars, which are identified as the Oil Sands, Canada's offshore East Coast properties, and Southeast Asia. But we recognized that we needed to take action to stabilize our production in the short term and that would come through both organic and inorganic i.e., acquisition opportunities.</p>
          <p>And if I now were to summarize the quarter, I would basically say, from our perspective, we executed a solid quarter and delivered on the early milestones on the plan we chartered out for you. So just let's get into some of the actions that we did take.</p>
          <p>So I'll start with the acquisitions. And again, I'll refresh your memory on something that I've said. I think &#x2013; I believe it was during the quarterly call, or it might have been in subsequent analyst meetings, but we are not, as we execute our acquisition plan, interested in trading dollars for barrels.</p>
          <p>In other words, I'm not interested in just getting production for the sake of headline production. We are interested in financially accretive production, acquisitions that offer an attractive rate of return. And I believe I used the words strategic contiguity, i.e., the way we can leverage our existing infrastructure, our existing human resources, and set the company up to be repositioning of Western Canada with resource plays.</p>
          <p>So to that point, we had announced that we signed a purchase agreement in September to acquire natural gas properties in west central Alberta, which adds about 65 million cubic feet per day of natural gas production, about 11,000 boepd. And it's adjacent to our &#x2013; it is part of our core Ram River Gas operation, where we actually have an existing gas plant.</p>
          <p>So both in terms of metrics and in terms of the basic qualitative criteria we set out, it's an acquisition bang on strategy. I am unfortunately not in a position to comment on the purchase price, but I can assure you that we have a rigorous set of criteria for evaluating these acquisitions. And this acquisition will earn us returns on par with some of the best gas resource plays that are out there.</p>
          <p>So it's an underlying theme of financial discipline that I hope you will continue to hear from us, as we roll this canvas out. Now, we are not done on this theme by the way. We are looking at some other opportunities, and we will move forward on those in a disciplined manner, provided always that they meet our rigorous criteria, which I've just outlined.</p>
          <p>Now, the second thing is on the inorganic part. We talked of a measure of reprioritizing our capital to meet our strategic needs both of shorter-term production and of building critical mass as we reposition Western Canada for resource plays. So to that end, we did increase our capital expenditure for the year from 3.1 billion to 4 billion.</p>
          <p>A significant portion of that increase has been targeted at accelerating projects that can deliver near-term production and returns in excess of our VAC. And really, I mean, by near term, I mean stuff that we will see results on in the next 12 to 18 months, not in the next &#x2013; and I'm defining as two to five years as medium term, anything past five years is long-term. So really I'm talking stuff that's in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
          <p>And very specifically all of this increased investments that I'm talking of in this context are our bread and butter opportunities in Western Canada where we have a rich portfolio of oil, heavy oil and gas assets. Rob, later in the call will be telling you more about this investment.</p>
          <p>The bottom line is that we have made significant progress towards stabilizing production and production was almost 289,000 barrels per day in the quarter, up from 284,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. But I'll again emphasize we don't want to overstate our case. This is the beginning of our journey. We are pleased that we met the early milestones, but we also recognize there's more work to be done.</p>
          <p>I would be amiss, I guess, if I just &#x2013; remiss, if I just spoke about the short-term and did not tell you that we have not taken our eye off the fundamental longer-term tasks that's why we're here, which are the growth pillars. So while we have increased our focus on boosting the near-term production, we continue to make good progress on our mid- to long-term growth opportunities. And again Rob and Alister will provide more detail later in the call.</p>
          <p>But I just wanted to take a minute to update you on couple of our growth pillars, Sunrise and Southeast Asia. On Sunrise we made substantial progress on advising &#x2013; on advancing the Sunrise Energy Project. We believe based on our bid process so far it remains on sanction for &#x2013; project sanction in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>On Southeast Asia as well, we've made substantial progress. We received 20-year extension to the PSC in Madura, which is &#x2013; those of you who would be following our Southeast Asia business, its offshore Indonesia. We've also made progress in advancing the Liwan gas development project in South China Sea, which is offshore China and we are tendering equipment and installation contracts for the project as we speak.</p>
          <p>I think I should speak to one of the points on Southeast Asia. We told you earlier in the year that the Board is evaluating whether a separation of our Southeast Asia assets is the best way to maximize shareholder value for the company. That is an important decision, a strategic decision for a company and the work of the Board is still underway and following when that rigorous review is done, we will be in a position to share the results with you.</p>
          <p>But you'll recollect, I said that there are pros to a separation and there are cons to separation, so it's a complex decision. We don't have decision yet, but as soon as we do, we'll be in a position to share that decision with you.</p>
          <p>So as we move forward with our business plan, we remain focused on business fundamentals. I am very clear in my mind that we are &#x2013; this is not the old economy equivalent of a dotcom business. This is &#x2013; we are in this business to get a return on capital. So therefore I just want to refresh your minds on stuff that I've said in various meetings with some of you on what drives our thinking on the business.</p>
          <p>No, we're not interested in trading balance for dollars, we're interested in financially accretive production, whether it's organic or whether it's through acquisitions. We're focused on capital productivity and all of it within the context of safety. I know this is a quarterly conference call and we will have opportunities to get into more detail very soon. So we are in the midst of a rigorous planning process for 2011 and out years.</p>
          <p>And I guess we have set up for Investor Call which we've advised many of you off on the 1st of December and I do hope we'll be that &#x2013; that as many of you who can attend we'll be glad, so we will be able to give you &#x2013; flush out more details on our direction for the future at that time. But I just want to give you a reassurance that in all of our thinking at the end of the day capital productivity in the context of safety is what our mantra is.</p>
          <p>On that note, I'll hand you over to Alister to take a closer look at the quarter's financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Asim. What I'm going to do is make a few comments on the highlights of the third quarter and then discuss the increase in the capital spending program for the year. In looking at the overall results, we found that was a solid achievement, particularly in light of the economic environment and the impact of the Enbridge Line breaks.</p>
          <p>The results also did reflect our product mix, which many of you know is approximately 70% oil and 30% natural gas. During the quarter, our production was 288.7000 boe/day, which was up from 276.2000 BOE per day in the third quarter of 2009 and slightly up from Q2 2010. This production was in line with our guidance that we laid out last month on the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now cash flow from operations in the third quarter was 811 million that was significantly higher than last year's 452 million comparable to Q2 2010. Net earnings of 257 million were comparable to the last quarter even with an estimated negative impact of 36 million after-tax relating to the Enbridge shutdowns of Line 6A and 6B.</p>
          <p>When I look at our pricing, an upstream realized pricing improved slightly compared to last year and was comparable to Q2 2010. However, our realized pricing for medium, heavy oil, and bitumen production was adversely affected by the significant increase in differential for most of the third quarter as a result of the Enbridge shutdown and we do expect that there's going to be some continuing lingering pricing impact of our shutdown into beginning of Q4.</p>
          <p>In our U.S. downstream business, the weak economic climate continues to impact market crack spreads with New York Harbor 3:2:1 $8.62 per barrel in the quarter compared with $10.44 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010. Realized refining margins did improve slightly quarter over quarter as a result of FIFO accounting impacts on crude oil, purchases notwithstanding the market crack spreads.</p>
          <p>On capital spending, as Asim noted earlier, and in support of our strategic direction, we've increased the capital spending for 2010 to 4 billion from 3.1 billion and the majority of additional funds have been dedicated towards upstream organic projects and acquisitions that will deliver production over the next 18 months. These organic growth projects are primarily oil, heavy oil developments and liquids-rich gas resource plays. Rob is going to talk a bit of that more detail about these later in the call.</p>
          <p>As Asim mentioned earlier, the acquisition we recently announced offers synergies with our existing operations, provides immediate production and rates of return on par with some of the best shale gas play. We did also make some strategic large acquisitions in areas that provide the opportunity to expand our existing line positions in those areas and that will allow us to create some additional value from having a larger contiguous position.</p>
          <p>From a balance sheet perspective and funding, we have been and will continue to be financially disciplined. That's a hallmark of Husky. Our debt to capital of 22% and debt to cash flow of 1.3 times remain below our targeted range and amongst the lowest of our peers. We generated cash flows, as we mentioned earlier, along with our strong liquidity position and lower leverage provided the flexibility to continue to prudently invest in growing our production as Asim has outlined. Finally our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm now going to hand you over to Rob to talk a bit about our upstream operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alister. First as always I want to start with safety. We've just completed an extensive series of plant turnarounds including the SeaRose, the Upgrader and we are just about finished with Lima. In total these involved an additional 4,000 contractors working on our sites.</p>
          <p>Turnarounds require careful planning and execution and always involve tight risk compared to normal operations. I'm pleased to say that with our strong focus on contractor selection and training as well as strict adherence to process and procedures, this work scope has been done without any major incidents. This is also reflected in our recordable rate, which remains at our target of one for the year.</p>
          <p>On the production side, I would like to share with you where we are investing capital to boost short- term production. In accordance with the strategy that Asim talked about at the start of the call and laid out in Q2 we have taken action to rebalance our portfolio from one that is long term opportunities but short on short.</p>
          <p>In Western Canada, we have a rich inventory of heavy oil, oil resource and gas resource properties in our portfolio and plays where new technologies such as horizontal multi-stage fracking are having a dramatic impact on our ability to economically retrieve more production from our reservoirs.</p>
          <p>Just to put some perspective on this opportunity, we have a heavy oil resource base in Lloydminster area of around 10 billion barrels in place using traditional Cold Heavy Oil Production With Sand or CHOPS, we've recovered about 700 million barrels of this to date. Using new technology such as horizontal wells and thermal processes, as well as CHOPS, we expect to potentially increase the recovery rate from 7% to about 12% for an incremental 500 million barrels.</p>
          <p>So we're confident about our ability to create more value from heavy oil going forward. And this is one of the areas where we're investing additional funds this year. To put some numbers on it in 2010, we plan to drill 291 CHOPS wells and over 100 horizontal wells compared to 175 CHOPS wells and 27 horizontal wells in 2009.</p>
          <p>Looking at our gas resource play activity, Husky continues to accelerate its resource play work. We have expanded exploration and development drilling in the natural gas liquids-rich area of Ansell and we drilled seven exploration wells during the third quarter with five of these wells soon to be brought on stream.</p>
          <p>We're also accelerating drilling in the Bivouac and Galloway areas with an additional six Bivouac wells and four Galloway wells to be completed by the end of 2010. Production is expected to come online in 2011. In terms of our oil resource play, evaluation and testing activity in Western Canada in third quarter, three Vikings wells were placed on production in Southwest Saskatchewan.</p>
          <p>Eight Vikings horizontal wells were drilled at Redwater, Alberta and an additional seven wells were planned &#x2013; are planned for the remainder of the year. Additional oil resource play wells are planned for the Lower Shaunavon and Southwest Saskatchewan, the Bakken in Southeast Saskatchewan and evaluation wells are underway to assess the Cardium zone at Lanaway, Alberta.</p>
          <p>Looking at the East Coast now, we continue to ramp up our production in the third quarter at the North Amethyst satellite oil field with the completion of the second horizontal producer. That well is now on stream producing about 3,000 barrels a day without any water injection support.</p>
          <p>An additional injection well will be on schedule, should be on stream in December and then we'll be able to ramp up production from that second production well to about 20,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>A total of 11 wells are planned for North Amethyst with drilling continuing through 2010 and 2011 and it continues &#x2013; North Amethyst continues to be a good story for Husky and we expect production to reach gross peak rates of around 37,000 barrels a day by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We also received regulatory approval and have commenced &#x2013; have already commenced drilling the first well on a two well pilot project into the West White Rose reservoir during the quarter. These wells are drilled from the existing infrastructure in the main White Rose field and information from these wells is going to help us develop the long-term development plan for West White Rose.</p>
          <p>But these initial &#x2013; the initial production well will also come on stream in early 2011. The impact on production of the activity I've just described about is &#x2013; will become more evident by about mid-2011 and accelerate over an 18 to 24 month period.</p>
          <p>Turing to 4Q production, there are just two events I want to give you a heads up on and the first of those being the October turnaround of the Sea Rose that actually was &#x2013; is already complete now. It was planned for 16 days and it was completed on schedule.</p>
          <p>The impact on the month of October's production was about 10,000 barrels a day. And then the second event is just we expect to close the Ram River acquisition sometime in the fourth quarter and when we close that acquisition that will add about 10,000 barrels a day to our production immediately.</p>
          <p>So just turning back to some of the medium and long-term projects that Asim referred to earlier in the call as well, at the same time as we've been putting our efforts on accelerating these near-term opportunities, we still are working on advancing medium and long-term opportunities.</p>
          <p>In heavy oil, construction of eight &#x2013; of the 8,000-barrels per day South Pikes Peak thermal heavy oil project is progressing on schedule and we expect first production in the first half of 2012. In the quarter, we also received approval for a safety pilot project at Rush Lake and this is a follow-up project to South Pikes Peak in the next stage of our heavy oil thermal development.</p>
          <p>On Sunrise, tenders for major engineers and construction contracts for the project were received and are under review. We're focused on ensuring that the delivery of Sunrise will come in on budget. And to that end our contract strategy is to secure very high levels of lump sum and unit rates within our key contracts. This removes the exposure to Husky for labor rates and productivity during project execution and we're making excellent progress of meeting that goal.</p>
          <p>In addition progress was made on Madura and Liwan, as Asim described earlier. As you can see, it's been a busy quarter on the development front.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn you over to Terrance for an update on midstream and downstream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. As Alister mentioned earlier, a significant factor in our third quarter results were the effects of the Enbridge pipeline disruptions. Now notwithstanding those challenges, it was a healthy quarter for our segment with our midstream business providing a means to mitigate some of the impacts to company. And despite these issues, throughput is stable at 236.2000 barrels per day compared with 235.5000 barrels per day during the same period 2009. Now without this disruption throughput would have been higher by approximately 12,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Quarterly downstream earnings were reduced by $20 million as a result of the Enbridge Line 6A/6B breaks. In our midstream segment, the Lloydminster Upgrader began its planned five-year turnaround at the start of September. This is the largest turnaround in the facility's history and it was completed on budget and on schedule. During the quarter we also finalized agreements with Enbridge, Keyera and Inter Pipeline Fund for pipeline dealing with terminal services for the first phase of this Sunrise Energy Project.</p>
          <p>In the downstream, a 40-day turnaround recently commenced at Lima as part of the five-year maintenance schedule that they for the facility and only about a third of the refining will be involved with a modest impact on closure volumes anticipated.</p>
          <p>On the retail front we continue to make steady progress and converted the 98 stations purchased in the southern Ontario market over to the Husky brand and we have currently rebranded 73 of the sites with the remainder to be completed in the fourth quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Asim for closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, all. So just let me again summarize where I think we were in the quarter. There were a number of external challenges in the quarter, which we've already mentioned and this being notable among them. Notwithstanding these factors we executed a solid quarter. We stabilized production. We are on our way to executing on our strategy to accelerate near-term production, both through acquisitions and through organic investments. And we have prioritized our capital assets to protect as we manage this portfolio both for production as also to gain critical mass and settle for the good properties. And we have made progress in advancing our medium to long-term growth pillars in the Oil Sands, the East Coast and South East Asia.</p>
          <p>So I guess the best description I can give of where we are is that the course has been set and work is underway to deliver on the growth strategy. Rob, do you want to let them screen us now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. That concludes the opening part of the call. We'd be pleased to answer any questions you might have. I'll now turn it back to the conference operator for questions from our participants starting with analysts and then from the media.</p>

          <p>I am just looking for a little bit more color on Liwan. In terms of &#x2013; what are the next steps that we're looking for here? It looks like you're pretty far advanced in terms of defining the scope and scale of the project. When &#x2013; maybe you can give us a little bit more color in terms of what you're seeing right now in terms of project cost and what you're envisioning in terms of size for the first phase of the development.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Asim. Andrew, good question. We're currently completing all the work around those questions that you asked us. As I said, we're ready to tender on some of the major pieces of equipment. Once we have those tenders in we'll be in a much better position to talk on the call and once we get through project sanction. So our intention will be to give you all an update on that once we've been through that process. It's a little bit early for us at this point in time.</p>

          <p>Good morning, guys. First question on Sunrise as we look for sanction coming this quarter, I think the most recent numbers we have there is $2.5 billion for 60,000 barrels a day, is that still a reasonable number for us to be thinking about on that project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this &#x2013; this were 2009 dollars. So I think when we actually get to announce it, you'll have to <mark type="inaudible" /> benchmark of 2011, but I would simply say, trying to say that you're in the ballpark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we will be in a position to announce it. Yes. We're well into the quarter already, so you won't have to hold your breadth for too much longer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. The other question I had was with the extension of the Madura PSC. Would that allow you to move those resources back into the reserves category at year-end, and can we expect a sanctioning decision on that some time next year? And I think in the past it's been thought sort of three to four years after government approvals that would be coming on stream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would confirm that. We would be with the &#x2013; receiving incentive to the PSC. We'll be looking at fixing some reserves on Madura and timing wise, we're probably looking by 2014 for that to come on stream.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. The question is around the &#x2013; Asim, you've talked about your focus on near-term production growth. So just wondering if you can speak to broadly the types of opportunities you're seeing that would allow you to both grow production and grow production in a profitable manner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, as I said there are two broad planks, there is an acquisition plank, an acquisition that is strategically contiguous, I think it's the basically &#x2013; completely synergistic with what we got. And there's a &#x2013; the old bread and butter hard work of drilling bore wells and applying new technologies. So those are the broad areas.</p>
          <p>Now on the acquisition part, we already outlined a gas acquisition where you can actually track the metrics. It is unfortunate that confidentiality agreements precludes me from giving you the specific figures. But I would say &#x2013; as I said, it's on a par with the best shale gas plays that are there. We are looking at a couple of other opportunities, which meet similarly attractive financial criteria.</p>
          <p>On the inorganic front it is really not a simple broad brush answer, it is a whole bunch of very targeted high return rifle shot opportunities we are looking at in terms of infills, in terms of applications of new technologies in heavy oil as we move from CHOPS to some Site B projects, some horizontal wells in terms of new gas resource plays. And that is my overall description in the qualitative sense and I think, Rob already turned on some of the, specially on the specifics in his part of the conference call. But I'll let Rob speak further to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I just add a couple of points, really. And that is, I think, the Western Canada Basin is a mature conventional basin. But what we're seeing in the Western Canada Basin, as I'm sure you're all aware of, is new technologies that are really making a difference in terms of the returns you can earn and the opportunities available. And Husky has a good land position over the whole Western Canada Basin clearly and we have actually also been acquiring lands where we think there's a lot of prospectivity with the new technology.</p>
          <p>So in broad categories, I mean, I do go back to Lloydminster first, there's a big resource there, horizontal wells are a new technology that we've only really been applying there for the last couple of years. They're opening up new horizons in Lloydminster, some of the thinner sands that you couldn't get after with traditional CHOPS methodology but have extensive resources in those horizons. So we can apply that technology to earn good returns in Lloydminster. Again, gas resources plays our focus there. We feel we have a pretty good portfolio of liquids-rich gas resource plays in Western Canada, enough to keep us going for quite a while here, and our economic <mark type="inaudible" /> gas prices because of the liquids components in them, although clearly we'd like to see higher gas prices going forward. So I mean just that's just a little more color on Asim's point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I just want to make one point, there's a sort of a theme running through my part of the spiel on financial discipline. And one of the things that we have started doing as we evaluate projects is we're not simply looking at IRRs, but we're looking at return on capital employed on a year-by-year basis. So if I can get an IRR  coming out of a hockey stick or I can get an IRR coming out of more immediate returns.</p>
          <p>So we have put our various projects in various baskets, so clearly if I want to look at a long-term project like a Sunrise or the East Coast, I have to look at an IRR and I know I'll have negative returns in year one and maybe breakeven in year two on a Sunrise. That might extend up to 2, 3 years on breakeven. But on a Western Canada type of what I call incremental activity, we want returns in the first year itself or at most in certain cases like horizontal drilling or the thermal projects no more than year two. And we are starting to apply that financial discipline and are changing our planning processes to reflect the demands of specific capital profiles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to add one specific example of that, that's one of the reasons why Ansell is very attractive to us as a gas resource play is because the infrastructure is already in the area and we can tie it in quickly and bring production on quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So which is &#x2013; when we are looking at projects, at some of these infill projects, we are looking at &#x2013; we are demanding ROAs that are in the high teens, in some cases even 20% at today's pricing in the next couple of years. Remember this is only part of our capital. I don't want to mislead you that you are going to get that kind of return on the entire capital and that's not the intent either, but I just want you to get a sense of how we are approaching this problem solving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot. And so when I look at the 590 million of incremental capital that you're deploying, so it's fair to say that we'll see the returns on that capital in terms of production growth and all that within the next 12 months so to speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that capital is about half and half. Okay about half of that is immediate production and half of it is to pull out sort of gaping holes in a particular existing land bank, and then once we get that land bank complete, that gives us something to work with in terms of monetizing. So basically you go to look at half and half, half of it is actually to flesh out the portfolio; that gives us currency to work with in the future in terms of when we can start the development, we can &#x2013; whatever. Okay, so I think we'll have more color on that in the investor day presentation in the beginning of December.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more into Liwan and I guess to some extent just the gas-in-place numbers you're talking, 2.6 to 3. Is that still related to the greater Liwan area or is that somewhat more ring-fenced to some of the drilling you've done so far, I'm just curious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Greg, I'll take that one. The earlier estimates that we had &#x2013; that were out there were &#x2013; they were older, were based on variable methods of drilling. So as you know over the last couple of years, we have done extensive exploration, delineation and appraisal drilling on the old Block 29/26. And we'll be keeping you and the market apprised of the results of that through quarterly reports. The current estimate we've got of 2.6 to 3 bcf of petroleum initially in place, that's based on those drilling results that we've now completed, it's really for the Block 29/26 and that covers three fields, the Liwan 3-1, the Liuhua 34-2 and the Liuhua 29-1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, that's great. And just, I guess, just to come back to the phase in terms of Sunshine, then just BP will fund the first 2.5 billion of this. What are just the next steps that you need to take? How much do you plan to talk about this? I think, you kind of answered &#x2013; in addressing Mark's question, you're sort of alluding to the fact you'll probably talk about it on December 1, but what are the next steps we need to see to get more granularity and what the project looks like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the first immediate step is to complete the negotiation, which were down to the very last strokes of, and when we get the approvals of the respective joint venture boards, so there are two separate agreement channels involved there. And then announce it to you, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're are &#x2013; I mean that project is right at the starting line. I mean, clearly, you've seen the announcements around the midstream. We've got all the agreements in place in the midstream to support the project. As Asim said, we're very, very close to the award points on the central facilities, on the field facilities contracts. We have a very clear project schedule. So before the end of the year, I expect to be able to share a extremely detailed schedule of just how the whole project will be executed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fantastic. And I guess just a clean up question then, on December 1, do you also expect then just to release your 2011 guidance? You may have answered that already, but...</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Kam Sandhar of Peters &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have a couple of questions. First of all, just wondering if you could walk us through how you plan to prioritize production growth and then obviously the results of that would be higher capital spending. And how you would balance that with your dividend?</p>
          <p>And then I guess related to that is have your, I guess, maximum sort of debt target levels changed when you take that into account. And then when you're looking at that and you're looking at capital associated with Sunrise and some other longer term projects, are there any plans to do any sort of hedging going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first part of it first, so, really, on the dividend issue it is something we have told you before, we actually look at it every quarter. We look at it quarter-to-quarter and every time we make a decision, we believe we make a decision because it is affordable at that time.</p>
          <p>But let me put a larger perspective on that. While we've increased the capital it's because we have a conservative balance sheet and that balance sheet allows us to do that and Alister in his part of the conference call alluded to some specific metrics around that.</p>
          <p>The second part of the balance sheet, we didn't talk about as explicitly during this call, but I did talk to every one of the analysts I've met over the last several months is that we had a very, very rich resource portfolio. And so, yes, we have a financial balance sheet but we also have a resource balance sheet.</p>
          <p>And that in terms of &#x2013; so the extra capital, we've been able to do so far, we've been able to do comfortably within our existing balance sheet because we were underleveraged. And it was a very conscious part of our taking on more leverage to improve our VAC as one would be crazy not to take advantage of the present borrowing environment to take advantage &#x2013; by taking on more leverage well within the realm of financial discipline. But going forward, we also believe we have the opportunity to monetize some of our resource base to bring in partners to be able to mobilize development capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I guess, a follow-up to that would be when you say monetize resource base, I'm assuming you're referring to potentially looking at JV some of your opportunities within that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that would be one of the strategies. There's a broader strategy of monetize resource base but a specific sub-strategy would be JVs, there could be others. We may have properties that are more valuable to others than they are to us. So it could be some minor divestments et cetera et cetera. So I don't want to box myself into a corner in specific approach. But broadly speaking, it's basically property is more valuable if it's developed earlier rather than later. It's a simple NPV calculation and there's no point sitting on what you consider family silver in the vault, it is just locked up in the vault and tarnishing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just another question on when you're looking at acquisition opportunities, I guess, is your plan to continue to focus on Western Canada or do you view the U.S. as an area where you would look to expand that resource base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I spoke &#x2013; I used the same old strategic contiguity in the last &#x2013; let me amplify on that. And then I'll give you a bit more color on this. By strategic contiguity, the simplest explanation would be something adjacent to what you have, something that uses your existing facilities, existing using manpower resources et cetera. So that would be the tightest definition of strategic contiguity. But the reason I use the word strategic contiguity as opposed to synergy was because if you have a very specific knowledge base that you think you can use gainfully elsewhere, we will do that. So, therefore, if there was something that we have a very specific area of expertise such as for example as we do in CHOPS technology. And if you were to find a CHOPS field in the U.S. where we can apply CHOPS technology, then that would fit our criteria. But having said that clearly, the tighter the better, but I don't want to rule out something that really builds on a very exist &#x2013; very &#x2013; on a competitive core competence of ours. But broadly, I would say, the prime focus is Canada.</p>
          <p>Now, there is a caveat to that. If I were to get something, this is in the area of incremental investments and that's all we are looking at and that's what we are focusing on. So at this point in time we are sticking to the knitting because we've got a job to do here now. I don't in the longer- term want to rule out something defining and something bigger and that then the rules change because it will have to have a different set of strategic criteria. But that is not the intent at this point in time. Okay. So I hope that answers your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One other &#x2013; just a &#x2013; I want to get your comments on hedging and what your view is on that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Broadly, we have not been historically been hedging oil and we believe that if you're in the business you ride the cycles of the business because you &#x2013; at the end of the day hedging is a cost, okay, and so you have to &#x2013; somehow you have to assume that you're smarter in terms of predicting the future than somebody else. So that's a broad answer.</p>
          <p>Having said that, there are some specific exceptions and we have an open mind to that but we haven't done that yet, and that's to do with the things like forward steps on gas, et cetera. But clearly, this is the wrong time to do that. So I would broadly say we're inclined not to hedge, but if there was some very specific, our refinery strategy and our upgrader strategy is our way of hedging on differentials for example. But that's an operational hedge as opposed to financial hedge.</p>
          <p>But if the &#x2013; we would consider hedges in some specific instances. For example, we'd consider hedging in the context of a major acquisition to assure returns for the short term. And we would &#x2013; when the strips are light on gas, we would consider it. But at this point our broad strategy is hedging has to be an exception rather than the general rule. Alister, do you want to speak further to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's a fair statement. And clearly if we are, as Asim said, if we are embarking on major acquisition then we would like to try and assure ourselves whether the cash flows is coming in or not in the first few years. And so that will be the general feeling, not something that we would typically do. It's an exception to the rule.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Three quick questions. The first one is, you identified that again your leverage was currently below your target and that you wouldn't mind considering increasing your leverage. Could you just remind me what your leverage target is at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're looking at targets of leverages 25% to 35% debt count. For debt to cash flow, it's 1.5 to 2.5, I think.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And the second question is would you be willing to sacrifice your current debt ratings as you pursue your acquisition strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, we've said before and we'll say it again as we are very conscious of the benefits of having a strong balance sheet, credit ratings and so investment grade credit rating. It's clearly <mark type="inaudible" /> that we have to place, and certainly from our perspective, it's preferable to maintain the strength that we have today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the third question is you identified that you're still considering the disposition of the South East Asia assets and in that process are you considering in the either spin-off or IPO or whatever form it takes, disposing off those assets with leverage or without leverage on a plain basis?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think what I said was it is a subject the Board is considering. There are pros and cons and when the Board has a point of view, we will let you know. So I think to say the Board is considering the pros and cons is a different to ask from saying that they're considering the spin-off. Because that implies that we have a mind made up and we're predisposed to an answer, the short &#x2013; the real institution is, we do &#x2013; it is simply a matter of examination. We're not predisposed to either answer at this point in time.</p>

          <p>Hi. EOG Resources had said that it's reached agreements to sell a substantial amount of shallow gas assets to three different companies. I was just wondering if Husky is one of the buyers and if so, if you could share some of the details?</p>

          <p>Well, when we make a material acquisition, we will make an announcement. And we will not comment at any point in time as a matter of general policy in any work-in-progress anyway. So basically, all I can say is you know what we know and what we're in a position to tell you.</p>

          <p>Hello, I was just wondering in terms of the extra capital spending that you have for 2010, how much of it is related to additional growth and how much is related to higher costs, if that is indeed the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I've missed the last part of it, how much related to additional growth and how much related to what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Cost, higher costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean. The short answer is it's all related to growth. We haven't seen any escalation in the cost, our unit cost of doing things. There's pluses and minuses in that, but overall...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On balance, none of it is related to higher cost.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
