          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Rio Tinto Half Year Results 2009 Conference Call. My name is Stey, and I'll be your co-coordinator for today's conference. For the duration of the call, you will be on listen-only. However at the end of the call, you will have the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I'm now handing you over to Tom Albanese to begin today's conference. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator and thank you all for joining us, and good morning and maybe to some, good afternoon to all of you. Our presentation slides are available on the homepage of our website, and while I won't be running through those right now in detail, you may like to have them open on your screen as I talk through the first-half highlights.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I'd like to say a few words about our four employees who have been arrested by the authorities in China. I am personally concerned about them, while I want to stress that we do respect the Chinese legal process. I know this topic is of interest to all of you, but you are appreciated we can't get into much detail on the subject.</p>
          <p>Our first priority is the duty of care to them and their families, and that we do not say anything that could be negatively affecting them. We are pleased they've been treated well, are in good health, we have families of legal teams in place. We welcome the fact that grounds for the rest do not seem as serious as early reports had suggested.</p>
          <p>Rio Tinto has taken swift action in response to the global economic crises. Although I'd say there is much more work to do, I believe we've already emerged as a stronger fitter business with renewed capital strength and a linear cost base. The success of our 15 billion rights issue has allowed the Group to reduce net debt by 14.8 billion, and pay down two thirds of the Alcan facility payments, leaving us with no significant debt repayments in the next two years. We are now working closely with BHP Billiton to conclude the binding agreement for our iron ore production joint venture in Australia where we're confident to realize synergies in excess of $10 billion.</p>
          <p>So, turning to today's announcements, we've reported resilient results in the phase of a challenging first half, tough markets with substantially lower commodity prices than we've experienced for most of 2008. This reaffirms you with top quality assets and we've taken swift and decisive action to manage the business in the phase of a worst recession since 1945. I am pleased to note the recent uptick in global economic conditions that we've been seeing in the third quarter, which is perhaps stronger than most expected although considerable uncertainty remains.</p>
          <p>We've had a good operational performance in production and costs. So despite the unquestionably higher levels of corporate activity, our business and our results reflect the fact that focus of management has not strayed on straightaway from getting on with the business of the business. Certainly we're delivering on the promises we made in December 2008 to cut costs and CapEx and push on with the divestment programs.</p>
          <p>The weaker trading conditions are reflected in the first-half results with underlying earnings down 54% to US 2.6 billion, and EBITDA down 47% to 6.1 billion compared to the first-half of 2008. But the Group has continued to generate strong cash flows at $5.5 billion. If current markets are any indication, I expect to see more stable and possibly stronger trading conditions in the second half.</p>
          <p>Last December, we said we'd take tough actions to reduce our debt, cut operating costs and capital expenditures and continue to divest non-core assets. We are delivering on those promises. We said we'd cut operating costs by 2.5 billion annualized in 2010 and we're targeting &#x2013; we are in target for that with controllable costs down by $770 million over the first half. We've taken out 16,000 rolls including contractors, which is 2,000 more than previously announced.</p>
          <p>We've also announced plans to reduce capital expenditures, which was nine billion in 2008 to reflect market conditions, but still maintain growth options. We've in fact cut first half CapEx by 22% to 2.8 billion and expect CapEx for the full year to be around $5 billion. We've had offers or agreed sales on nearly $6 billion of assets this year to date, including the binding offer this week from Amcor of $2 billion for the majority of Alcan Packaging. And of course, we strengthened our balance sheet through the rights issue, which enabled us to play down a large part of the debt.</p>
          <p>Once again, our biggest contributor to earnings have been iron ore and the operations continue to run full capacity to meet the strong demand growth in China. We have agreed to a benchmark settlement with major customers in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, while we've not yet achieved a benchmark settlement with Chinese customers, we've continued to make deliveries to them.</p>
          <p>At present, these are priced primarily on a provisional basis equivalent to the Japanese settlement. In the Pilbara, we've achieved record production in the second quarter of 53 million tons and the current run rate is in excess of 200 million tons per year.</p>
          <p>In June, we announced the iron ore joint venture with BHP Billiton and I'm very enthusiastic about the value this opportunity offers to shareholders with synergy estimates of more than $10 billion. Detailed agreements are being drawn up with BHP Billiton and subject to regulatory approval we aim to finalize the joint venture in mid-2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to aluminium, Rio Tinto Alcan was impacted by very difficult trading conditions as a result of the dramatic decline in demand and prices in the first half of 2009. In response we've aggressively curtailed production at our highest cost operations and expect 42% of our smelting capacity in the upper half of the industry cost curve to have been curtailed, divested or idled by the end of the year, which is in line with or better than our peers. Cash costs have declined 27% in the last 12 months and we expect further declines in the second half.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, the first-half earnings were resilient in the face of challenging market conditions, reflecting the quality of our assets. The success of the rights issue in July has allowed us to pay down just under 15 billion Rio Tinto of debt. Rio Tinto is now a stronger fitter business and we look to the future with a higher level of confidence.</p>
          <p>There is evidence of recovery in China, although the constraints of weak OECD demand growth will take some time to abate. And we do expect to see the global economy stabilize and strengthen in the second half.</p>
          <p>For Rio Tinto, my own priority going forward is to continue to drive and focus on the business of the business. And by that I mean, driving through operational improvements and cost reductions to improve our competitive position, to complete the excellent progress that we've already made with our iron ore joint venture with BHP Billiton and pursue and deliver on our divestment strategy. Certainly from a more personal perspective, I'm also committed to building our relationship with China, which is of great importance to Rio Tinto.</p>
          <p>So thank you. With that, I'll now be happy to take questions. And I'll pass it back to the moderator for the first question.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question comes from the line of Tony Robson at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, good morning or good afternoon to you. Thanks for the opportunity to ask you a few questions. I wonder if you could give us a &#x2013; I understand that you don't want to comment much further on the four employees arrested. But in terms of the commercial aspects, could you discuss your sales penetration into China and whether you're maintaining or winning or losing market share there please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Tony, we are running at full capacity. And I think that that tells really the bulk of the story. Most of this would be to our long-term customers or long-term contracts on provisional pricing basis. So again, I think that it is fair to say that as the Chinese steel sector continues to expand, we are supplying to it.</p>
          <p>Now of course as we look ahead, we have to consider what can we do beyond that capacity and one of the items as we've said we've focused on debt reduction, focused on bringing down our OpEx, and focused on sustaining capital that gives us the ability to look at the most opportune aspects of growth in the near-term. And one of the things that we've been looking at would be to bring our mining capacity in the Pilbara from its current 200 million tons of capacity to be more aligned with our infrastructure capacity of 220 million tons. And recently we have sanctioned Rio Tinto Iron Ore to start spending more money on the mining to bring that 200 up to 220 and think that, to some extent, reflects our confidence in the Asian steel sector and our intention to keep delivering to the Asian steel sector.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for that. Given as you noted in your release, with the rights issue and the asset sales, which has been great to date. You have $14.8 billion of debt. If you look at it a year out, I could see as little as say $7 billion assuming the JV on the iron ore with BHP Billiton goes ahead. Would you take a more aggressive stance say a year from now in terms of your growth capital projects, I do note it in the release some of your projects today as you mentioned have been curtailed or delayed a little bit? So would you look at a more aggressive stance further out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Tony, and foremost I want to make sure that all of our businesses are focusing on preserving cash flow and looking at bringing down sustaining capital, but of course being very mindful of the need to ensure process safety and the integrity of our underlying assets in our underlying facilities.</p>
          <p>But that being said, we want to have the ability to prioritize development capital to those highest value projects. And generally we've been looking at it of indexes that are based upon present values as a multiple of capital costs. Now that tends to buy us a toured projects at the moment where either the construction is well advanced and we really need to look at just forward-looking costs, absent those past sunk costs to complete them and bring them to revenues. And to some extent that's why we've continued with Clermont, Kestrel and Yarwun 2 during the course of this year, which would not have been part of that four billion number we would have flagged back in December of 2008.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead we will continue with that approach. And again as we continue to make progress with debt reduction, we have more free board to keep focusing in that direction, but we do very much recognize, Tony, that everyone's interest is bring down the debt and to improve the overall balance sheet, which again provides us more flexibility as we go forward. But as you can imagine, we have not necessarily put out any debt reduction targets except that we were going to bring down debt by more than $10 billion this year, which we have over delivered on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sunil Gathader at Sentinel Investments. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Tom, can you just give some sense about the situation in China, because last year those things happened. A lot of rumors coming out that the second half 2009 it's not going to be as strong as the first half of 2009. You're operating your <mark type="inaudible" /> mines at full capacity since the demand for iron ore from the steel remains very strong. Could you give your thoughts on what do you see whether things are likely to be sustainable in China or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Sunil I think the question for the second half in China compared to the first half is not so much totally economic activity but growth rates. I mean we had a tremendous increase growth rate in the first half. We had expected to see the stimulus kicking in the second half and certainly we are seeing the full benefits of that. I do think we're all seeing signs that may be the sort of the opening up of the debt markets maybe pull back a bit, but I think still you see continued efforts to expand infrastructure, to build on the residential sector, and that's been certainly helping our sector.</p>
          <p>To look at just the absolute levels of total steel production and if you look at the months of May, June, July continues to be quite strong. Now obviously over the past couple of days, we have seen a dropping off of spot iron ore markets and we are all looking that closely. I'd say that has to do with the combination of some pull back on recent increases in steel prices. I think though that it would probably also reflect the supply side, and to the extent that we're probably seeing the market anticipating the end of the Indian monsoon season, and I think we should also realistically expect that with these higher spot prices that that itself becomes a catalyst for more domestic production out of China, which will then come in and that should again bring that spot price down. So I think those are all having the effects of it.</p>
          <p>From my perspective, I think we are certainly seeing all efforts by all aspects of China from a political and an economic perspective to drive the growth rate even in that 8% range. Of course, as we've seen, before the middle of 2008, once growth rates starts getting beyond that, you start creating the risk of bubbles, start creating the risks of over-hyping the economy or inflation. And so I wouldn't be surprised to see some monetary pull back just to create some type of balancing as they try to manage the economy to what they would see as a long-term sustainable level of GDP growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And outside China, have you seen any signs of pick-up in any kind of demand for the commodities or it's still kind of limiting at a lower level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Sunil, we're seeing some signs at a customer-by-customer basis that there is sort of a return to more normal inventory levels. There was a tremendous destocking in the fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year, sort of rebuilding for that anticipatory buying in advance to say four, five months out. So, but we have to remind ourselves that much of the OECD remains in recession. And again, no matter how important China is for us, half of our markets still would remain under the OECD. So that's why we will continue to be circumspect, we like what we see in the third quarter so far, but we do need to be circumspect about the broader market conditions and broader trading conditions as we look ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We have a question from the line of Terence Ortslan at TSO &amp; Associates. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Just back to divestments, so far 3.7 billion. What percent or how much of it do you expect to close before the year-end, which plays out to the next question, I think your final dividend, you indicated will depend upon how much of it is done or completed this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that the divestments we've had so far this year would be, the 3.7 plus of course, the recently announced binding offer from Amcor of about two billion. And those &#x2013; and looking at those, we would hope to get through the bulk of the various regulatory approvals by year-end. But of course, we're dealing with a combination of regulators, we're dealing with in some cases work councils, et cetera that are all part of the planning process.</p>
          <p>In addition, as you know we've recently announced that we will be intended to go ahead with an IPO on Cloud Peak, which is our U.S. coal business. We will be looking at the progress on all of those as we look at our overall funding and debt level performance at the end of the year. We don't want to be any more specific than we already have been in terms of that final dividend, but we have said quite clearly providing more clarity when we said in the past and that we do intend 2010 going forward to basically stick with the long standing aggressive dividend policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. You've taken the borates off the market, I can't remember the reasons for that, whether you disclose it or not, but given the market conditions are changing, anything else that would be coming off the market instead of the previous divestment programs that you had in detail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that &#x2013; I just want to talk about borax a bit. And in general that's one of the businesses that has lagged some of our other sectors would be &#x2013; some of those industrial, mineral physicists like borates. As you may know the largest market for borates would be for the production of insulation fiberglass for homebuilding. And so that really much is driven by the state of affairs of the US housing and homebuilding sector. So still we see that recovering. We will not necessarily see the volumes that we like to see in that business. So we've had to pull back &#x2013; capacity pull back sales in that area and to some extend buying interests at this time reflects that fact.</p>
          <p>In borax given that it's a very strong market condition, in a sector that with a resurgence in a post recessionary world, I would see that to be a good business. This would not be the necessarily the time to be selling it. So that we did pull up from the market on that basis. And of course, we are looking at everything and testing on a case-by-case basis as we go forward.</p>
          <p>But as we said earlier today, if you look at those items that we very much see on the divestment plate, I would see us working to complete those things that have been announced, work the binding offer with Amcor. There is a small part of packaging within cosmetics that we would see as clearly non-strategic and we'd be looking at that as a disposal.</p>
          <p>And of course the engineered product business very much see that we are not the rightful owner for that. We want to see that really move into probably somewhere where it will basically more naturally fit, which is not in the portfolio of a mining company. And I would say that engineered product is probably the greatest priority as we go forward for the next level, next stage of divestments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question on Simandou, thanks. What happens next with respect to discussions and expecting the land tenure and all with respect to gaining? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Terence. On Simandou just again reminder for background, it's a fairly large lease position, typified by a southern lease and northern lease. All of our current work and all of our resources have been in the southern lease. And we are currently continuing to do exploratory work, albeit at lower levels now given the state of the market. The real disputes have been in the northern lease. We pulled out our equipment from there. We don't have any resources from that, but we will continue to work and tell to the government on that as we go forward. I think that we will be in the mean time focusing our evaluation efforts on the southern lease.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from the line Tony Robson at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, thanks for letting me ask another question. Pulling up from Mr. Ortslan's questions, in addition to what's &#x2013; you've announced today the 3.7 billion in the packaging. So other than Cloud Peak Energy and engineered products, it would be fair to say that you're probably through the majority of the bulk of your divestment program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that if we look ahead I'd say that completing the cosmetics component, the packaging, EP and Cloud Peak, there are some smaller things that we've been talking about, which we will continue to look at as we go forward, but that the priorities will be in those that you've just mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just a follow-up question if I may, and I may have missed sort of the early conference call today, was there a figure of $0.5 billion mentioned for Cloud Peak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, just to be quite clear because we have announced our plans with an IPO based upon SEC regulation, we are in a quiet period. So we have not said anything further or anything that from what we've said before. There have been some analysts that would have speculated, but I would not want to comment on those speculations.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Well, thank you very much. I do appreciate you calling in, when you could have been on a beach somewhere this summer fine summer day. I do think these have been a good set of results, resilient results in the face of what have been some of the most difficult market circumstances that any mining company certainly any industry would have been seeing for a long time. And it does really reinforce the strength of Rio Tinto's assets and the strength of Rio Tinto's organization and I'm pretty excited as I look forward to the coming months. So thank you very much.
