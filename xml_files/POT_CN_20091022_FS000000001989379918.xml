        <plist>
          <p>All right, Denita, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Potash Corp.'s third quarter conference call. Although the unprecedented challenges of 2009 continued this quarter, we see encouraging signs of a return to a more normal environment, and we appreciate this opportunity to share our views with you.</p>
          <p>The conditions we faced in the third quarter can be traced back to the onset of the global economic crisis. Initial collapse in commodity markets had a negative impact on both crop and nutrient prices. This severely disrupted normal market activities and caused fertilizer dealers and farmers to become very cautious with their capital. The agricultural industry has not yet broken free of this uncertainty. Farmers in the Northern Hemisphere relied heavily on nutrients stored in the soil to feed this year's crops, while south of the equator they appear to be under-applying in their current planning season.</p>
          <p>Fertilizer dealers around the world emptied their warehouses and avoided the inventory risk that led to previous write-downs and losses largely associated with nitrogen and phosphate. As a result, our sales volumes for all three nutrients, most notably in potash, were significantly lower on a quarter over quarter basis. Prices for our three nutrients were also lower compared to last year's third quarter, though to a much greater degree in phosphate and nitrogen.</p>
          <p>We reported third quarter earnings of $0.82 per share, which compared to $3.93 per share in the same quarter last year. Gross margin of $346.2 million was down from a record 1.7 billion quarter over quarter. Potash delivered 73% of our gross margin this quarter, demonstrating once again that it can deliver stronger and more stable gross margin than our other nutrients. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and cash flow prior to working capital changes were both considerably lower on a quarter over quarter basis. In general this quarter showed the gap between the more normal buying conditions of last year's third quarter and the extreme caution prevalent this year.</p>
          <p>Our company has seen choppy waters in the past, and we know how to navigate through them. When the Soviet Union collapsed and potash producers from that region flooded offshore markets to raise hard currency, people wondered whether our industry would ever recover. At Potash Corp. we did what was necessary to get through more than a decade of tough conditions and opportunistically invested in other global potash businesses along the way.</p>
          <p>While the current deferral of demand has none of the long term characteristics of the FSU collapse, our handling of that situation should provide assurance that we have faced tougher and far longer lasting challenges in the past and turned them to our advantage. Admittedly, this trough has cut deeper and lasted longer than we initially anticipated. The under-application of fertilizer, however, is not agronomically sustainable.</p>
          <p>We have always stated that potash is a long term business and encouraged our stakeholders to take that view as well. We operate with strategies designed to withstand volatility in turbulent times and maximize growth when demand is high.</p>
          <p>We match our potash production to meet market demand, something we have done for more than 20 years, and the benefit is evident in our potash gross margin this quarter. Our track record on producing to meet market conditions is clear. This quarter we cut production by nearly two-thirds and saw sales volumes reduced to almost half the total of the same quarter last year, but we maintained strong per ton gross margin.</p>
          <p>Executing this strategy is not easy, but it is logical. Ore bodies are finite resources, and we won't devalue our resources by running full out when the market doesn't want them. This protects the value of our potash assets, both for the long-term needs of our customers and for the owners of our company. We stand by this approach, and if you look at the factors expected to drive potash demand, it is easy to understand why we remain so positive about the future.</p>
          <p>The first key is to step back from the past year, which we will state with confidence is an anomaly, and look at long-term trends in food production and the macroeconomics of global development. In the past two decades, the world's population has grown by 28%, from 5.3 billion people to 6.8 billion. Much of that growth has and will continue to occur in Asia and Latin America, regions that have become economic forces.</p>
          <p>Even with the challenges of the past year, the International Monetary Fund is projecting the economies of China and India will grow by 9% and 6.4% respectively in 2010. In those countries, the first priority is to improve the quality of life, not with luxury items, but with better food. For many people it is the first time they can afford a balanced diet with protein from animal sources and more fruits and vegetables. That puts pressure on the world's farmers to produce more food, essentially from a fixed base of agricultural land. To achieve this, they need to consistently improve their agricultural practices, including their fertilization programs.</p>
          <p>Over the past few decades, the world made significant strides in this area, especially in potash use. The impact was evident in steadily improving crop yields, with farmers producing record harvests in the majority of years over the past decade. Those big production numbers, however, hide an underlying reality. Record crops draw more nutrients out of the soil, and if you take more out, you need to put more back just to maintain productivity. This, combined with continuing growth in global food demand, make it clear that more fertilizer will be needed.</p>
          <p>In the past 10 years, global grain consumption increased by roughly 320 million tons, equivalent to the size of the entire U.S. corn crop. In the next decade we expect that world demand is going to grow by a further 350 million more tons of grain. The ability to increase food production by increasing the amount of arable land anywhere in the world is extremely limited. To meet this growing food demand, it will be imperative to replenish nutrients in the soil and maximize yields. Farmers know this, and they will start feeding their soil again.</p>
          <p>The question is not if it will happen, but when the rebound will begin. Everyone would like to know the day or the event that will signal the return to more normal market conditions. We believed that India's potash settlement in July would be the catalyst, establishing a benchmark price and easing the uncertainty of fertilizer buyers. That did not happen.</p>
          <p>Many fertilizer dealers and farmers are currently wary of fertilizer pricing, and with the precipitous drop in phosphate and nitrogen prices late last year, their cautious approach is understandable. So without a compelling reason to immediately rebuild their own stockpiles, many continue to wait. Most Northern Hemisphere farmers are between planting seasons, and the late U.S. harvest is expected to cut into their fall applications. Buyers see higher producer inventories and have a perception that supply will be readily available when the spring rush begins.</p>
          <p>A few things are likely to lift farmers and fertilizer dealers out of their malaise. The first is that support of crop prices must be maintained to encourage farmers to get back to applying enough fertilizer and maximizing yields. With less-than-perfect growing conditions in some parts of the world in recent months, crop prices have returned to healthy levels.</p>
          <p>Second, a spring season will soon be upon us. The process of moving fertilizer into position for the Northern Hemisphere spring planting season will have to start early in 2010. The logistics of moving significant volumes across continents and oceans takes time. There are a limited number of trains and ships. To wait until March to begin refilling the supply chain would create an immense logistical challenge.</p>
          <p>The third factor is China. Many buyers have been watching for contract settlement. And some have viewed China's deal as a bellwether for potash prices in the past. A contract would trigger renewed demand elsewhere, but in China the more pressing issue is food production. There is evidence that China's crop yields are beginning to suffer, and its government does not want to increase its reliance on foreign food producers. Over recent months, China's domestic prices for grains, fruits and vegetables have continued to rise. Last week the Chinese government set higher minimum prices for wheat and announced plans to do the same for rice. It recognizes the need to encourage production and is taking steps to motivate farmers to plant more and maximize yields. Fertilizers, especially potash, are part of that equation. Agronomic science firmly states that farmers have to replenish nutrients in the soil, because food production is too important to put at risk.</p>
          <p>At Potash Corp., we have always been a patient company, and we are preparing for demand growth, knowing it inevitably returns. Over the past five years, the potash industry completed its transformation from one defined by excess capacity to one that is likely to operate at or near its productive capacity for years to come. That is not lost on potash buyers, who were on allocation for the better part of two years. At Potash Corp., we are continuing to work on brownfield capacity expansions in Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. These projects allow us to build capacity more quickly and cost effectively than anyone can bring on a greenfield mine. We expect to raise our annual operating capacity from about 12 million tons in 2010 to a net of 18 million tons when these projects are fully ramped up by the middle of the next decade.</p>
          <p>We do know that factors driving potash demand are very powerful. Growth never follows a straight upward line, but the need for more potash in the future is undeniable. Others have taken notice of this as well, which is why there's a lot of noise about potential new players or greenfield projects in the industry. It seems this speculation changes almost daily on who will be starting a new project tomorrow. We understand why this business is attractive, but we also know the hurdles that continue to keep speculators from putting shovels in the ground.</p>
          <p>We estimate that a new 2 million ton greenfield mine in Saskatchewan would cost over $4 billion when you factor in the infrastructure costs outside the plant gate. More importantly, it would take at least seven years to bring a new mine to production. That is a large and long-term commitment. If someone is looking for a fast return, this is not their industry.</p>
          <p>For Potash Corp., our investment is already in place. If demand is slow, we have proven strategies to weather the storm and still capture value for our assets. When demand growth returns to its normal trend line, our company, with our new capacity, is going to be in a very strong position. As others have said before, the future belongs to those who prepare for it today. We look ahead to 2010 and beyond knowing we will once again have the opportunity to show the full potential of our operations.</p>
          <p>I'd like to thank you for your interest in Potash Corp. and I'm joined today by other members of our executive management team, and we'd be pleased to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Wondering if you could make some comments about the U.S. corn curve has moved up about $0.60 in the last six weeks alone, and I'm just wondering if there's been any thawing in the, from a demand perspective or anything you're hearing in the channel as a function of those higher corn prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Vincent, thank you, and I will turn that question over to David for an answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you. Vincent, we're in the midst of the slowest harvest since 1985. As of October 18, 17% of the crop had been harvested versus a five-year average of 46%. The crop is only 83% mature, and right now certain consultants believe, with the freeze that we had earlier this month, that around 250 million bushels have been lost, maybe up to 1 billion bushels have been affected. So we'll wait and see how that, what turns out.</p>
          <p>In terms of the corn price, December corn was 3.04 in early September, hit $4 yesterday, so a major contribution impact to the farmer as he harvests his crop here this fall. We have seen some interest from a fall application standpoint. We're hearing reports from across the board that farmers are coming back and using normal fertility for their fall application. Now granted, we've gotten off to a late start. We're going to have a narrow window, so on a year on year comparison it's going to look down, but we're seeing a much better attitude in the field today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Vincent, what I would say is we never really expected much out of this fall, just because of what David said. We got off to such a late planting start, and we knew it was going to be a late harvest, and then you know you had this, while it was an ideal growing season, it hasn't been a great fall for drying down the crop. It's a high moisture content crop, which is going to take some, some cost to either let it dry naturally, because you'll lose a little bit of yield, or you're going to spend it on gas to dry down that crop, so both of those things have been taken into account.</p>
          <p>I just think the window's going to be so short by the time you get it out &#x2013; and of course the psychological cutoff date is U.S. Thanksgiving &#x2013; that we're just not going to have much of a fall, which is going to put even more pressure on the spring than we're accustomed to, because we just won't have the usual split between fall and spring application, which combined with some of the other factors I talked about with our international business looking brighter, we're just going to see more pressure beginning in early 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. A couple of accounting questions on the potash business, with respect to the net realized prices, how much did the leased rail cars and warehousing fixed costs, which were absorbed by fewer tons, impact those net realized prices in both the domestic and export markets? And the on the cost side, your costs have varied all over the place as a function of operating rates. When you're back to the &#x2013; when you ramp back up to the 2 million to 2.5 million tons a quarter operating rate, do you expect your unit cash costs to fall back down into that 70 to $80 a ton range, or are labor rates higher now, which would affect that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Steve, I'm going to ask Garth Moore to comment on your operating cost question first, and then we'll move on to the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Steve. We think that the operating costs &#x2013; or we know that the operating costs will fall back down to the normal values once we get back up into our normal operating rates. What's happening now, as you know, with the low production, the unit costs are just kind of bouncing around on us, and &#x2013; but once we get to continued production again, they'll be back down to normal rates and possibly even a little bit lower than they have been because of higher capabilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, David, will you comment on the lease cost impacting us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Steve, from a Canpotex standpoint, their rail car and terminal costs are $20 above last year. And also we have freight management contracts that are at a higher level than spot market that are above market by around $60 million year-to-date. So that will worsen as the year goes on. But in terms of 2010, those freight management contracts are in much better shape. Domestically, I don't have the number today, but I'm assuming it's around $10 from a T&amp;D standpoint from additional costs from rail cars and terminals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, what I'd say, you look at operating costs &#x2013; lease costs, transportation, distribution costs &#x2013; all of that combined, which is much higher than it would be normally, and yet we still are able to maintain potash as a tremendous gross margin business during the worst possible conditions you could imagine. So I think that really is &#x2013; just says a lot about the potash business.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Jacob Bout of CIBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just on your global potash demand estimate of 50 million tons, I noticed you've taken that down now. I think back in May you were kind of at 55 to 60 and then you dropped it down to I think 55 in September, now down to 50. And just wondering, what are some of the moving parts that you're looking at here? What's embedded as far as Chinese, U.S., Brazil demand in that estimate? And what was the moving part from the revision downward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Jacob, that you look at what's transpired here over those months, from May until now, and I talked about the Indian settlement in July, and we thought that was going to be a catalyst, and clearly we missed it. And I would tell you that we've done a, I have personally done a horrible job of forecasting this year. We're seeing a situation like never before. You know there are some interesting numbers out of the IFA. If you look at the first half of 2009, exports of potash globally January through June of 2009 are down 72%. That is by far and away &#x2013; the previous all time record for any six month period was down 27%, so down 72%. The second half of 2008, last year's second half, was down 21%.</p>
          <p>So you're putting these phenomenal numbers back to back in terms of decline in exports and so I would say some of our thinking has been moderated by just those numbers. When you look at where we think we're going to end up this year, in terms of total shipments, we think that number is going to be around 30 million tons, and that's down from 52 million tons last year and 56 million tons in 2007.</p>
          <p>So we think that the best number that we have right now is 50, and the way we get there is we think that the pressure in going to be on for various markets to move here in early 2010. If it's later than 2010, in 2010, if it comes in March, that number will be below 50. It could be above 50 as well as we recover, because the agronomic demand is certainly there. And as we see these grain prices kick up around the world, and I'm not just talking about our focus in North America on corn, wheat and soy beans. But we're seeing improvements in palm oil. We are seeing a phenomenal situation in sugar. These are big potash-consuming crops. And so, as we see that pressure on agricultural prices for these agricultural commodities rise, you will see the incentive for farmers to get back at it.</p>
          <p>And so, there's a lot of different calls. We think 50 is the right number at the moment. And we think this is a multiple year recovery, by the way. This won't be covered off in 2010. You're going to see 2010, '11, '12 because it just takes time to get back to trend line to start refilling that soil base that has been so severely depleted.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Fai Lee of RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Bill, I'm just wondering if you would care to comment on perhaps your expectations and views regarding the Chinese potash contract, particularly with respect to timing and the risk of a price decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Fai. This is one of the areas that I really, when you talk about forecasting, this one was &#x2013; I fell on my face on this one. And I will tell you that we get our information from our partner Sinofert, and I told our partner that he's helped me to look like a jerk the whole year long. And he said well, he's had a very difficult time forecasting as well. And I would tell you around the world &#x2013; in Brazil, we've got people that are long time in this business that have tremendous expertise who all say to me you know I've never seen anything like this before. Well, it's true. And so the Chinese contract we're going to wait for it to finish.</p>
          <p>I do know this. When it gets to 2 million tons of inventory, they'll buy. And we think right now that that will be before the end of the year. And we certainly know that after two years of utilizing all the nutrients in the soil, and I'll tell you what, I asked Stephen Dowdle, who is head of our fertilizer sales on a global basis, reports to David. Stephen, for your guidance, is probably one of the real experts in China. Stephen has lived in China; he speaks fluent Mandarin. He is a Ph.D. agronomist. He headed up the Potash &amp; Phosphate Institute market development program in China in the '80's and worked for Canpotex for about 10 years and all that time focused on China. Steve, why don't you just talk a little bit about China from an agronomic point of view and your thoughts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Bill. You know domesticated agriculture in China traces back 7,700 years. And due to a shortage in arable land, Chinese agriculture is very intensive. Farmers grow two and even three crops per year over wide areas. Due to this long, intensive history, Chinese soils, as compared to Northern Hemisphere, New World soils, are lower in organic matter content and cation exchange capacity. Both properties influence the inherent ability of the soil to supply cations, such as potassium, to growing crops. And if the soil cannot supply potassium, potash must be added as fertilizer.</p>
          <p>As modern agriculture spread in China, starting with the Green Revolution technologies in the '60s, widespread fertilizer applications became necessary, as yield potential increased with the introduction of modern, high-yield varieties. And China started with nitrogen fertilizer in the '60s, because they could build nitrogen plants, and followed with phosphates in the '70s and potash in the '80s, as soil scientists learned from experience that lack of phosphate and potash was limiting yields. The scientists in China today are still aware and promoting more potash consumption, as there is not a proper balance of fertilizer use in China. China uses too little potash relative to the nitrogen and phosphate consumption. In China, yields of many crops, such as corn and soybeans, are far below comparable yields in the U.S., for example. And China will need to continue to increase potash consumption to close this yield gap.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>All right, thanks, Stephen. You know, so as a result, we know they need it. They know they need it, and the Chinese farmer's just been like any other farmer around the world. They were scared to death, too, with this crisis coming. I do find it interesting that GDP growth in China this last quarter, 8.9%, it looks like the recovery is going to be led by China. And we know that that's also going to put more pressure on food production. So our partner says they're going to need more next year. We know they're going to need more next year, and we just think it's a matter of time here. But it won't be long, now finally.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Question, Bill, you talked a bit before about shipments and your outlook there. Maybe Dave Delaney can address the whole issue of consumption, because it would appear that two years ago shipments were well above end market consumption. I think you've talked about consumption being down 30, 35% for potash in the 2009 crop year; obviously shipments were down more. So how do you see consumption? What's your final number for last year? Where do you see it going this year, both in the U.S. and globally? And how do you see shipments rebounding? We're hearing that pipeline inventories are pretty low.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Don, in terms of fertilizer consumption in North America, or I guess in the United States, we're calling nitrogen in '08-'09 fert year, the one we just finished, at 11.6 versus 12.8. Now, in this current fert year, '09-2010, we're saying that's going to rebound about 5 to 10% to 12.5. And phosphate was down last year to 3.3. We're saying that's going to rebound this year 20 to 25% to 4 million nutrient tons. Potash hit a low of 3 million tons in '08, '09. We say that will rebound 25 to 30%, up to 3.8 million tons.</p>
          <p>Globally shipments are down, as Bill indicated, to around 30 million tons. We know the pipeline has emptied around the world. I would say potash consumption is probably around 35, maybe as much as 38 million tons of KCl. We do think inventories in every country are extremely low. If you look at Brazil, for example, they began the year, this year, at 1.8 million tons, and we think this year will be less than 500,000, maybe 300 to 400, so extremely low going into the first quarter. Malaysia and Indonesia also high stocks, they're out today. So really if you go around the world, it's the same scenario.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Bill, you mentioned in the press release that you do some labor contracts. You may build some potash inventory in the fourth quarter. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Hi, PJ. We do have different labor agreements at individual mines. I'm going to let Garth just speak to that a little bit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>PJ, how our labor agreements work is for various lengths of the inventory control shutdowns, we're required to give various notice periods under the different contracts, and it varies anywhere from two weeks' notice for two weeks shutdown to eight weeks' notice for indefinite shutdown and up to any length of shutdown. So they vary according to the contracts, and as we evaluate our needs and our market demands for the various products and our product mixes, we make our plans accordingly and give the notice that's required. So sometimes &#x2013; that's why we've been up and down with our production so much this year, is because we were waiting for the market to open up, and it's been slow coming, so we've had to take some shorter shutdowns as we go along, and it will continue through the fourth quarter and somewhat into the first quarter as well as we work the inventories down at our plant sites.</p>

So there's a lot of sacrifice involved, and Potash Corporation has sacrificed tremendously here during this period of time, and I know that some of you may not appreciate the human part of it, but it's real.</p>

We reduced our price July 1, let's &#x2013; for example FOB Saint Louis to 525, and the market's been under pressure, with India's settlement coming in July, that price has trended down to about 460 a short ton. So we're holding stable there today. People are buying. We're seeing more and more activity. So I think our fourth quarter number will be similar to the third quarter, maybe down a little bit. It just depends on our T&amp;D cost, where we're shipping to, product mix, that type of thing.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Bill, I was wondering if you could help me maybe focus on something a little less short-term oriented, and that is the concept of a mass balance around crop production and then the need to replace nutrients. I guess when I was looking at the U.S. industry over the last 20 years, I think production yields have gone up something like 40%, yet potash applications, excluding this year's anomaly, aren't any higher, maybe even a touch lower. So what is the science behind that that allows increased production but not increased application over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at what's happened since really almost going back to 1980, Bob, in the U.S. &#x2013; and the U.S. of course, keep in mind, is the most developed market of them all in terms of agronomic practices. But just the efficiency of cropping systems are so much improved. This is one of the things that certain people who talk about the environmental degradation of potash or nitrogen or phosphate or GM [genetically modified] seeds, this whole scare tactic about food production around the &#x2013; they don't realize how efficient we have become. And we are &#x2013; when you talk about site-specific application of fertilizers, where we're banning fertilizers right into the root zone, the addition of no chill, low chill agriculture; what that has done. The crop population spacing, the genetic improvements of having corn ears, the leaves of corn plants point to the sky and allow sunlight to come in at the root systems. Just so many things that have occurred that have allowed us to become a super-efficient industry. And when I look at other industries, they should model themselves after agriculture, because we have really shown the world how to be efficient.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Quick question on phosphate. Can you tell us what you see in there? I mean it seems like almost two or three weeks ago, Mosaic was suggesting that volumes seem to be &#x2013; would turn into near normal levels. But recently of announcements by you don't seem to indicate a return to near normal levels. Can you give us some color on the phosphate market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Edlain. Thank you. I'll ask David to respond to that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Edlain. The phosphate market has been pretty difficult this year, too, really supported primarily by India's importation of DAP and phosphoric acid. We've seen a lot of caution really around the world; most countries buying hand to mouth. Pakistan did come back in this year. But again, in Brazil, Argentina, they've been extremely cautious. Their imports year-over-year are down. So the market I think hit a low of 270 a metric, Edlain, this summer; then went up to 320. And November, December look fairly slow right now. India's backing away from the market, and the market has declined to 295. And believe me, that hurts, because ammonia prices are at 355, up from the low of around 185 in July. And so our input costs have increased while prices have gone down. So we need some demand to kick back in.</p>
          <p>We do think there will be a bit of a recovery in 2010 for the dry phosphate market, probably increasing from a global trade standpoint by about 2 million tons. So I think once we get through this fourth quarter, the first quarter should prove to be much better, backed up by low inventories around the world and people realizing they've got to get product in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd just follow on that, Edlain, and say that the phosphate business we find one of the most frustrating businesses, because it should be so much better than it is. As Dave was talking about, the supply/demand balance is really in good shape. Inventories are low, and we've had very good demand out of India. You look at those numbers, 5.5, 6 million tons of DAP imported, and growing demand there.</p>
          <p>And yet as David also said, you have raw material increases with sulfur and ammonia, so the margin pressure is increasing, and people don't talk about phosphate rock costs. But phosphate rock costs are also clearly going up around the world as we get farther and farther away from some of these chemical plants with rock mines, and just the transportation costs and the lower quality ore and the higher impurities, and so all the beneficiation costs that you have there. So when you think about it, it just should be so much better. But clearly the underlying problem with phosphate is the lack of production discipline. There's just too much production.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Bill. Just, not to beat a dead horse, but just on China. You mentioned about the 2 million tons expected by 2009 yearend. Just wanted to gauge where you see inventories currently and whether or not you believe it's being assessed better now versus before, if that's possible. Specifically what I'm looking for is the expected China import demand and consumption that you've got in the 2010, 50 million ton forecast. Second question, you mentioned about the restocking supply chain logistical challenges, and that you expect that would be a problem if they all looked for, towards March, 2010. To clarify, are you expecting normalized inventories on the wholesale level prior to March 2010 or thereabouts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If you look at beginning inventory, July 1, in the North American system outside of producer hands, it was extremely low, probably less than 500,000 tons. Third quarter sales, the industry sold, I believe, 850,000 tons. And if we consume this fall 2.5 to 3, that means we begin January 1 empty. Even if the consumption is lower than the number of 2.5 to 3, it's still going to be extremely tight. If we're going to use 7 million tons in this fertilizer year, which is down from the '07-'08 peak, that means we have to move in place 4.5 million tons, January really through April. So that's a lot of volume to get in place, so that's why I think the pressure is on, really in North America, starting at the beginning of the year. Right now people are just buying to put it on the ground. So there will be a rush here, I think, in the first half of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, on the China question, we think the inventories right now are between 2 and 3 million. As I said when they get down to 2 million that's when they buy, that's the magic number. When exactly that is, I said we believe it will be before the end of the year. It might be in November. There's been public press on BPC being close to an agreement with them. You know I don't know any more than that. But I do know the Chinese, we're almost through 2009 here, so to go through a whole year without having any Chinese business is, that's a good part of the storm that we've been going through. In terms of where we see them in the 50 million equation, we think that China is going to be between 8 and 9 million next year out of the 50 million.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon; a couple quick questions. Do you have any sense for kind of where we are globally? And I guess specifically in terms of the Russian producers and some of the Middle Eastern producers in terms of where they are in terms of potash inventories? And obviously you've done quite a bit of work in terms of increasing your size, you have the capacity of 12 million, but what are you sort of thinking in terms of your share? Let's say you're right on the 50 million, what would be the Potash Corp. share, given that presumably there's a lot of producer inventories in other parts of the world as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael. You just asked the impossible question, because I can't give you an answer to that. You're asking me to absolutely predict the future, and I can't do that. What I would say to you is that producers around the world, one thing about potash is you can't store it outside. With one exception, which would be the Dead Sea, we can store it outside, because it doesn't rain there. So there is some inventory there that normally wouldn't be there, but the rest of us have to put it under a roof, because if you don't, it's soluble and it tends to do something other than its intended purpose.</p>
          <p>So that does limit production, and that's why you've had the shutdowns around the world. And you start thinking about where we're going to end up this year at Potash Corporation. We'll take the lion's share of the global shutdowns, but there's substantial, somewhere between 20 and 25 million tons of production that's going to be taken out this year in a market that is normal. Last year it was 52 million, we're saying 50 million for 2009, so that's a lot of production taken out. And that also is one of the reasons why we think that potash recovers quicker than these other nutrients.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. In the U.S. farmers are in good shape and current grain prices are certainly supportive of that.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the &#x2013; in Brazil and Argentina, one thing we know there, the USDA forecast for both countries is to harvest 114 million tons of soybeans; last year they harvested 89. So that's a big increase, and the world's going to be watching how well they do. And even with that big crop, their carryover stocks stay fairly low. The economics, the return is still good, even with the stronger real in Brazil. But there's just been so much caution due to last year the write-down of the nitrogen and phosphate inventory that I wonder if Brazil will truly hit their 20 to 21 million tons of NPK consumption, based on lower potash imports, phosphate, nitrogen, everything's been extremely slow. So for them to yield or to harvest a big crop like they're predicting I think may be a challenge. But in terms of the return on the current prices, it's very good, still very good.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that one of our strengths is our diversity with our Phosphate division. We have the capability to supply the liquid fertilizer, but we have also have capability in animal feed and we have capability in purified acid. So with respect to that, we expect operations say in the fourth quarter to be better than what they were in the third. And we don't &#x2013; we will continue to operate at rates consistent with the market demand. Now, we have taken some steps and we announced at White Springs where we had a reduction in force. And that was really due to the philosophy of just operating to market demand. And our projection is based on what that market demand may look like for some period of time. So from the cost perspective, we pay attention to what each site does, and based on that, take some suitable actions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And what I'd say is if you look at DAP, the dry phosphates, that's the problem area. We've been operating at a very low level of capacity, because we feel that we ought to match supply to demand. The problem is we're not big enough in phosphate, in dry phosphate, to carry the day, because in potash, we certainly are, and we really can make a difference there. It's part of, as I said earlier, part of the frustration that I have with phosphate. Because really it should be a terrific business right now, and it's not, and we're hoping that that changes.</p>

And I'm wondering, is this maybe going to be the new reality going forward, given how weak the distributors are after some of the big write-downs and what they got stuck holding? And if that is a possibility, would that suggest that we're going to see a restructuring of the distribution system for potash? Is that something you think about in terms of how we're moving forward?

          <p>Yeah. I think that, as I said, we believe that this year is an anomaly. And we think that you're going to see this market turn. You're going to see demand come back in the system. When you go from 52 million tons down to 30 million tons, you get all sorts of crazy things going on. And people get real nervous and even some of you guys get nervous. You've got to think about the long-term fundamentals of our business. And it's going to come back, and the confidence levels will come back, and you're going to see the demand for food increase. And all the fundamental things that I think when I read a lot of reports, and I'm just like, you know, you throw the baby out with the bath water. And I don't understand that. It just doesn't seem to be very thoughtful to me when the fundamentals are so clearly obvious. And if you look at it from any perspective, and I get criticized sometimes for not appreciating the fact that some of you folks are judged on a shorter time period than I am. And I do appreciate that you've got quarterly requirements that you're judged by. But we sure as heck don't want to run our company that way.</p>

          <p>Hi, yes, thank you. A couple of quick questions, I just wanted to ask a little bit about industrial demand for nitrogen and phosphate. I know the phosphate demand was down by about 20% this quarter. How would you sort of characterize the outlook for this? And I'm just wondering is it just simply an economic uptick sort of a related issue, or do you see other factors that affect industrial demand? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question relates to price leadership. And in, and that question I wanted to ask was particularly for the Indian contract and now the Chinese contract, both these countries are negotiating with someone other than Canpotex. And I'm just wondering under that scenario, what kind of leverage does Canpotex have to sort of set prices going forward? I know you have the ability to sort of take down volumes, but how do you influence price when your key customers are negotiating with other players, presumably weaker players, in the potash marketplace?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the industrial ammonia demand year-over-year is going to be down about two million tons, and that's primarily related obviously to low operating rates of the acrylonitrile, caprolactam business, the polyurethane business. DAP operating rates early in the year were down. We are seeing an up-tick here in the second half. DAP operating rates around the world have increased. We're seeing higher industrial output in Europe and Asia, and also slow ramp up here in the United States. A lot of our industrial customers are indicating higher run rates here in the second half and improvement in 2010. Our purified acid business has been slow this year. Also we've seen a lot of competition from imported Chinese phos acid that we have refused to compete with. So part of it is the market in phosphate, part of it is cheaper Chinese phosphoric acid.</p>

          <p>Hari, in terms of price leadership, in a weak market like we've had this last &#x2013; what, almost 15 months now &#x2013; you get a lot of, as I said earlier, a lot of silly things happening, and so you get &#x2013; it's hard to see price leadership. But there are some subtle things that I would point out to. If you think just our operating philosophy and the way we've taken hit for a lot of our customers, early in the year when they were taking write-downs for nitrogen and phosphate because of disastrous happenings in those prices, we had a lot of customers come to us and ask us what our approach is going to be. And they were literally in certain cases begging us not to lower the potash price and &#x2013; because they were going to have to take big write-downs. And we stood by, and so we took the hit for them. And I can tell you, many, many people have told me that if we hadn't done that, they would have gone under, because they couldn't take the nitrogen and phosphate write-downs plus potash. So there's a little bit of leadership there. And again our operating philosophy, if we didn't operate the way we do, I can tell you that any price levels that are being discussed out there in the global marketplace by BPC or anybody else wouldn't be even close to where they are today.</p>
          <p>Canpotex is clearly the leader in the international community. The fact that they pick other players like a BPC or someone else to negotiate with should tell you how strong Canpotex is as a marketing organization. I just think they do a superb job, great management, very knowledgeable, and is the most reliable supply source. If you take Agrium and Mosaic and Potash Corp. combined in Canpotex, and you see there our joint capability, the reliability that we have, the long-term contracts with a frame of people willing to tie up with us for years out in the future, because they know we're all solid companies and strongly in support of Canpotex. There's just no doubt who the real leader is. In times of weakness and short-term issues like we've had over the last year, you'll see some things that might lead you to think otherwise, but the truth is something entirely different.</p>
