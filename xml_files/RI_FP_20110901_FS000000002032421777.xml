          <p>[Foreign Language] I'm going to give you presentation, the consolidated results for the Group for the period of 1st of July 2010 (sic) [July 2011] (00:07) to &#x2013; well, the full 12-month period. After which we will have a Q&amp;A session up until 10:30. As is now customary, we will alternate between questions from the floor here and questions [ph] people out (00:22) following us on the Web, so a busy morning.</p>
          <p>I'm here to give the floor straight away to Pierre Pringuet and of course after to Gilles Bogaert.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So, good morning everybody.</p>
          <p>We're going to talk about these results, which I think I can qualify as excellent, no two ways about that. This is a good reflection of how dynamic our business has been with the sales of 7% and, of course, a very strong level of profit from recurring operations, up 8%; group share of net profit, up 10%, not overlooking the significant reduction in net debt to &#x20AC;9 billion. Now, I'm going to give you a more detailed commentary now.</p>
          <p>Indeed, we have exceeded the guidance we gave. First of all, we said plus 6% and plus 7% of sales with profit from recurring operations, even grew 8%. Now this, first of all, is a reflection of our brand strategy, our strategic brands as we call them, because the top 14, if you look at the volumes, this is an all-time high for the top 14 and seven of these top 14 brands are now at all-time highs in terms of sales volume.</p>
          <p>Of course, we have focused a lot of means on these brands, three quarters of our A&amp;P. And of course, quite a number of innovations and new initiatives taken in respect of these brands. We'll see this when I &#x2013; we talk about the financial results.</p>
          <p>Now, sales of &#x20AC;7.643 billion, up 8%; that's internal growth of 7%. If we now look at the top 14, volumes were up 6%; revenue, up 10%. So we have created value here. Secondly, the emerging markets, up 17%. The emerging markets and so called mature markets, that's broadly speaking, the western world, western world has seen its sales rise by 1.5%. Virtually all our markets were up.</p>
          <p>The gross margin has improved. Again, a reflection of the share of premium brands, because the gross margin was up to 60.3% from 59.6%. A&amp;P expenditure, up 11%. Remember, we told you that we'll be close to 19% of sales. Well, the figure is actually 18.9%, so I think we have kept our word, bearing in mind that 73% of these A&amp;P expenses are devoted to our top 14 brands.</p>
          <p>Now, of the top 14 brands, the ratio of A&amp;P expenditure to sales is 25%, 24.3% to 24.7%, more precisely. So we have continued to invest strongly and this is clear evidence of the fact that we are focusing our investments on these strategic brands.</p>
          <p>So profit from recurring operations of &#x20AC;1.909 billion, up 6%; that's internal growth of 8%. Remember, our guidance was plus 6% and plus 7%. Then, group share of net profit from recurring operations, &#x20AC;1.092 billion; that's up 9%. And the group share of net profits, &#x20AC;1.045 billion; that's up 10%. In fact, it's the first time, we have reached the &#x20AC;1 billion mark for this net profit or our group share of net profit.</p>
          <p>As for debt reduction, we are down to approximately over &#x20AC;9 billion; that is down by &#x20AC;1.546 billion. And our ratio of net debt to EBITDA is 4.4; that was the multiple at June 30 compared with 4.9, 12 months previously.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a closer look at the sales. Let's begin with the zoom on our &#x2013; focus on the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter rose 6%; that's organic growth of 6%. Forex impact was negative. I'm sure everybody will have noticed that the US dollar experienced a number of weaknesses toward the end of the year, so the changes in scope of consolidation where we sold of entities in New Zealand and Spain. These are rectifications as we call them, portfolio rectifications because we have to dispose off 17 or 18 aquavit brands, which were certainly not profitable and declining over time. This is perfectly in line with the full year.</p>
          <p>Organic growth of sales for the fourth quarter, you've plus 6%, plus 4%, plus 5%, plus 6%, so very, very even. As for the top 14, in the fourth quarter, the growth was 8%, and the emerging markets grew 20%. So these are very even levels of performance over the full year.</p>
          <p>Again, if you look at the full year here, organic growth of 7%, the Forex impact over the full year was positive at plus 4% because the dollar weakened towards the end of the year, of course and group structure effect was negligible because it only accounted for 2%</p>
          <p>Now we're going to take a look at the breakdown by region. I think our geography is something of a great interest to a lot of you. Well, the four regions you're now familiar with, Asia-Rest of the World, then America, Europe and France. On the left-hand side, you have the growth figures, the sales growth for the financial year 2009, 2010. On the right-hand side are the performance we just achieved for 2010, 2011.</p>
          <p>So we've improved in all four regions. Asia up with 9% growth to 15% growth, double-digit growth. The Americas improved from plus 4% to plus 5% organic growth. Europe improved significantly because it was down 5%, it's now back to breakeven point or, let's say, zero growth. And as for France, growth has gone from flat growth to plus 4%, which means at a group level, organic growth has improved from 2% to 7% over the two periods.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a closer look at all of the regions. Asia-Rest of the World, 19% sales growth, up 15% organic growth, that's factoring in Forex impact. Martell had a wonderful performance with 26% growth. The cognac market is very, very profitable but, more importantly, Martell has yet again improved its positioning, particularly in China. We now believe that we have become not just the leader in terms of value, because we were already value leader, but also the volume leader in the Chinese market.</p>
          <p>Second growth driver is our top 14 Scotch whiskeys, which rose 16%.</p>
          <p>Finally, a remarkable performance on the account of Indian whiskeys, which posted growth of 30%. Thanks for our Indian whiskies, India is now in our top five markets. It can now be said that Indian whiskeys have become of strategic importance for the group, not forgetting, of course, Absolut, Jacob's Creekand Champagne, which all drove growth, all very promising for this region.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a closer look at individual countries. China, very strong growth of 23%. We believe that China has become the market leader or the leading market in terms of cognac. We are clearly the leader in the scotch markets, 55% market and we have, in fact, bolstered our market share. We are the absolute leader in China in imported products, of course, but there is no doubt about whatsoever.</p>
          <p>India, very strong increase of 33%, of course, largely due to Indian whiskeys, which I've just mentioned, but also thanks to the great ramp up of the Chivas and Absolut, which both achieved a significant growth, excellent scores.</p>
          <p>Other fast expanding markets include the Vietnam, which was 50% starting from a low point admittedly but year-on-year, the growth is becoming quite substantial. This is a country with over 80 million inhabitants and a very strong economics.</p>
          <p>Africa and Middle East rose 24%. Taiwan, growth in the region of 30% unless I'm mistaken. Duty-Free markets up 21% and despite the tsunami, which, as you know, has an impact on sales, certainly the Japanese went traveling and then it had an impact on the Japanese market as well, but duty free was still very profitable.</p>
          <p>South Korea is the market that has disappointed us. Now we did achieve 3% growth. This, I think, is a reflection of the fact that despite the economic pickup, this is the first time that we have seen the whiskey market not on a par with economic growth. Economic growth is very good, but our market only grew by 3% as did the market as a whole.</p>
          <p>Thailand is the only market in which we had a disappointment in Asia-Rest of the World and disappointment because of 100 Pipers even though in Q4 there was a pick up. Now, the top 14 did improve well, but broadly speaking Thailand was down 2% in terms of the sales and this is our area for concern in Asia.</p>
          <p>And while Australia has had its seven Egyptian plagues, so to speak, earthquakes and goodness knows what, but Australia has picked up well. As for Japan, well, I think everybody was terrified by the series of disasters including human disasters with the Fukushima power plant.</p>
          <p>Well, our fourth quarter was impacted. Our business was down 7%, but it's still much better than we expected. More importantly, I think we can say that since June &#x2013; I'm sorry, July, and indeed August, as far as we know, it's really back to business as usual in Japan. Gradually getting back to business as usual and this is one of the great qualities of Japan, which can not only handle a disaster, but reorganize itself very rapidly.</p>
          <p>We did not, in fact, lose one day of sales. Our team continue to build everyday. Even though at one point in time the Japanese government told the inhabitants of Tokyo not to leave their homes, well, our Japanese team sent a squadron to Osaka where there were no problems, to ensure that our invoicing would continue to be done uninterruptedly even at the peak of the crisis. I think that's a performance that really should be underscored.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the Americas. 8% growth of sales, that's an organic growth of 5%. The Top 14 was more energetic with a 7% organic growth, which is up from the previous period where the organic growth was 7%. Jameson, in particular, performed particularly well, as did Malibu. I think we now have the ingredients to get this brand back to growth. Good performance from The Glenlivet as well. Excellent development of Absolut in Brazil and of Chivas in the Duty Free markets and Latin America and of course, Havana Club in Cuba.</p>
          <p>Priority Premium Wines did not do well particularly, the Australian market did not do well in the &#x2013; the Australian wines, should I say, did not do well in the American market. Local brands in US are not working that well. Seagram's Gin was down 12% and broadly speaking, the US market is now looking to premiumization again. I think special mention would be made of the excellent performance of Passport 16% and Orloff which is a local gin in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Now focusing on the US, a second, the market trends are good. 12-month Nielsen figures are plus 4% likewise in July and NABCA figures are plus 3%.The return to premiumization has been confirmed and I think the growth rate of our super premium and ultra premium brands are in the region of 7% to 10% growth, so outperforming the market very clearly.</p>
          <p>We've also had confirmation of a very good performance in the on-trade sector. Remember in times of crisis, Americans do not frequent their favorite bars. We have seen very good performance, plus 5% to 7% during the last few months in the on-trade sector which I think is reassuring.</p>
          <p>The intensity of promotions has decreased. We even passed a number price hikes on Jameson or The Glenlivet. With these price hikes coming to effect on the 1 of August, we benefit, of course, from our premium positioning because while our organic sales growth was 2% in the US and our Top 14 saw its organic sales growth achieved 5%. I will give more detailed figures concerning Absolut and Jameson. Absolut is growing, very clearly growing and we are on par with our objective of plus 2% to plus 4% for Absolut. That's what we were hoping for. Maybe I should also remind you that the brand's growth is in double digits outside of the US.</p>
          <p>As for Jameson, well the figure is depending whether you look at depletions, Nielsen and NABCA figures, well, we're looking at between 25% and 30% growth. So this is a marvelous success story for the Jameson brand, which exceeded the 1 million case mark in the US.</p>
          <p>At this level, there's a natural trend for growth to gather pace, so we are very, very confident about Jameson's future, not just in the US, but elsewhere in the world too. I've also mentioned on the bottom The Glenlivet, Malibu, Mumm, Cuv&#xE9;e Napa, not to mention the pickup of Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t.</p>
          <p>As for the other countries and the Americas, that's Latin America, particularly Brazil posted strong growth of 12%, which reflects a decline in certain lesser brands but our Top 14 were up 41% in Brazil, particularly Absolut Vodka and Scotch whiskeys.</p>
          <p>Mexico posted good growth of 7%, thanks to the great development of the Scotch whiskeys market. In Canada, the country where growth is always slow, we've already had a growth of 2%, maybe 3%, but I could mention a whole series of countries where we are posting growth.</p>
          <p>The only country that is in any difficulty is Venezuela. There's nothing new about that. As you know, our access to currency is limited. The impact is only 0.5% of the Group sales. As I say, shortage of products where were not investing. So in terms of profits, I would say that we have not fared too badly. This brings me to Europe, excluding France, 3% fall off because of the sale of the disposal, should I say, of aquavit in Scandinavia, a number Spanish brands as well. On the whole, it's otherwise stability across the board. This compares with minus 5% during the previous period.</p>
          <p>Now the Top 14 as you can see actually achieved 4% growth driven by the brands listed here, in particularly Jameson, Absolut, Beefeater, Havana Club, Mumm and Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t. So Champagne is picking up very clearly. We've also mentioned the problem of Greece and of course the issue of Chivas in Greece and Ballantine's in Spain, which are the two, I'd say disappointing performances in Europe.</p>
          <p>Priority Premium Wines are back to growth, up 2%. I will come back to this a bit later on, but we have a value strategy. And of course the contribution of our brands is increasing. I'll give you details a little bit later on. However our Polish vodkas and the Scandinavian aquavits have declined somewhat, but in Poland, we have become the leaders in Scotch whiskies, Ballantine's being the top brand in Poland.</p>
          <p>So Western Europe, so its sales dropped by 2% but it's still better than last year. This, of course, has been largely because of Spain where the market was down 5%. Greece is only a very small contributor, less than 1% of our sales in the region. So Spain is really the dark cloud on the horizon. Elsewhere Germany, the Top 14 rose 11% driven by Havana Club, which is an extraordinary brand in the German market, driven also by Absolut which performed very, very well.</p>
          <p>Now we increased Absolut prices substantially to position us as a premium vodka. UK was down 1% which is a big improvement on the minus 10% of last year.</p>
          <p>Ireland is a small market in terms of population, but big consumers. The market was down 1%, but again, a big improvement on minus 6% the previous year. So the trend is good in Western Europe. As for Central and Eastern Europe, well, we completely reversed the trend. It was minus 9% in 2010, we're now a plus 9%.</p>
          <p>Russia posting growth of 17%, 30% up for the Top 14; Ukraine up 19% and Poland, well buying Polish vodkas always faring well because the Top 14 rose 32%, Ballantine's increased by 49%. So our Polish team has performed extremely well. In fact, I'm convinced that Poland is one of the big markets for spirits in general, but it would probably be one of the big markets for Pernod Ricard in the years to come.</p>
          <p>In France, the situation was flat. It's now at plus 4%, thanks to all categories, Ricard, Scotch with Ballantine's in particular, but also Chivas, Mumm, Havana Club, of course. Havana Club posting growth rates of 30% to 40%, quite extraordinary. Mumm and Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t which, I think are a good reflection of the pickup in the champagne market. A pickup that is a volume recovery first of all, but now prices are recovering as well, not overlooking of course, Jameson and Absolut in France.</p>
          <p>Ricard rose 5%. It was of course the impact of our new bottle that we introduced to you through last January, which of course, I think has helped to boost the sales of Ricard and of course Champagne, as I said has picked up both in volume and in the value.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to take a look at the brands in main categories. The Top 14 has accelerated its growth as you can see three columns here. First of all, the percentage of sales in the left-hand side, that's the percentage over the Group sales. In the middle column, you have the organic growth of sales for the &#x2013; for fiscal '09, '10; and the latest figures for 2010, '11, on the right-hand column.</p>
          <p>So, 58% of our sales in Top 14 with growth up from 4% to 10% over the two periods. Priority Premium Wines have seen their growth improve from negative growth of 2% to flat growth. But their contribution has increased by, I believe, 6%. And the 18 key local spirit brands have remained stable. Quite a strong contrast between different brands because of course, the growth is driven by the Indian whiskeys.</p>
          <p>And then the other brands which account for 20% has improved from minus 3% to plus 1%, largely due to the fact that driven by selling off the local brands that haven't been performing well, we end up with brands that are of better quality, now the overall quality of the portfolio improves.</p>
          <p>Broadly speaking, sales growth on other &#x2013; on our products as a whole rose from plus 2% to plus 7%. Premiumization is still very much the strategy with strong growth for premium brands representing 71% of sales.</p>
          <p>Okay. The Top 14, volume was up 6%, sales were up 10%. There's a price effect as well as a mix effect that are favorable. Now if we walk through the &#x2013; our products in the portfolio, you have a bunch of medals here on the left. The medals we awarded to our brands and for historical records. You see that seven brands Absolut, Chivas, Jameson, Havana Club, Martell, The Glenlivet, Royal Salute are average all time highs and overall the Top 14 has reached an all time high as well. Then you have volume, net sales, so overall, if you can see the price/mix effect pans out at 4% which is quite positive for the Top 14. And you see that virtually all the brands, I like to say all the brands have a positive price/mix effect.</p>
          <p>As far as Malibu is concerned, we launched a line up of cocktails that has proven very successful in the US. The price/mix effect is somewhat negative because of affordability and also Cuba has grown for Havana Club and so, and Germany is also good. So, you see a slight deterioration in value in Germany for technical effect I can explain later on. There we go.</p>
          <p>Okay now, let's walk through the various brands. Regarding Absolut, volume grew 6%, so did sales with a 2% in the US in volume and a 9% growth outside the US. The price/mix effect is once again positive while it was once again positive in H2; it was slightly negative in H1 due to the price adjustment that we implemented in 2009 in the US. And as you can see there was very strong growth in the list of countries you have here. You see there are Western as well as emerging countries in this list.</p>
          <p>Chivas also reached an all time high, plus 7% in volume and as you can see Chivas 18 year old achieved 23% growth and so did Chivas 25; 70% growth with Chivas 25. So it's fair to say that all the regions contributed to Chivas's volume growth, Asia, Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe. So you see a very good performance for Chivas indeed.</p>
          <p>Ballantine's, plus 7% in volume but there are pluses and minuses for Ballantine's. Obviously, Spain remains the dark cloud on the horizon as mentioned, minus 8 in the case of Spain. But performance, however, was very good in Europe. We sold over 1 million cases for the first time in France. Poland, has become the third global market for Ballantine's and once again, we have become the leader &#x2013; became the leader in the summer. And also there was very strong growth in the aged product line-up because Ballantine's 17 year old and older grew 21% overall, obviously driven by Asia.</p>
          <p>Ricard now. Ricard recorded minus 1%, overall plus 5% in France. It was launched a new bottle, market share gains here and there. There was somewhat of a slack in Spain which kind of account from the minus 1%.</p>
          <p>Havana Club, double-digit growth for Havana Club. Let me remind you that Havana Club has been recording double-digit growth since the launch of the JV 18 years ago, and all markets grew with two exceptions, Greece and Spain, and Germany has become the foremost value market for Havana Club.</p>
          <p>Malibu. Malibu recorded a 6% jump in the volume, 3.5 million cases sold. The only message I have to convey you is this. Let me remind you that we told you that Malibu is a brand that was a little bit between a rock and a hard spot when it was being managed by Allied Domecq, and it was somewhat tricky for us to find the right ingredients to get this brand going. Now, we launched a number of innovations with Malibu Cocktails, Malibu Black, which is a 70-proof rum, and other products that I cannot mention today. So, anyway with all those innovations and initiatives, I can tell you that Malibu is back on the growth track again.</p>
          <p>Jameson, 17% growth, over 3 million cases sold, and a strong double-digit growth. In the case of Jameson, this is definitely the way Jameson is going. Beefeater plus 3%, very good performance particularly in Spain, 3% growth in Spain, we're outperforming the market there, and we also experienced very strong growth on emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Kahlua. Kahlua recorded minus 1%. Kahlua is not yet a shining star in our portfolio, a minus 1% trend for two years going. But I'm rather confident. I believe that the new Delicioso advertising campaign and the initiatives we've taken should deliver significant improvement of Kahlua's performance. Kahlua was the second dark spot in the Allied Domecq portfolio we inherited. So, we succeeded with Malibu, we shall succeed with Kahlua. I'm confident.</p>
          <p>Martell, extraordinary performance; 22% of volume growth for Martell. That's a 22% of sales growth, excuse me. And of course you see the numbers for XO and Noblige; they're quite self-explanatory. Obviously the growth is primarily driven by Asia, but there was good performance in Latin America and Martell is pretty strong in Latin America.</p>
          <p>So the Glenlivet plus 6% &#x2013; plus 13%, plus 7% in the US. The brand is internationalizing and Asia with Taiwan and other markets is becoming a market of consequential, of significance for single malt whiskeys. Champagne, well, back on the growth path in volume and in value and in Asia we for instance recorded 31% growth. In the case of Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t, very good performance in here.</p>
          <p>Let me close with Royal Salute. Royal Salute, plus 24%, Royal Salute sells for at least $100 a bottle, 21 year old whiskey, here this is &#x2013; we're talking Prestige here and Prestige products are doing very well indeed.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Wine now, volume shrank 1%, sales inched 0.4%; the contribution was plus 6%, a fine demonstration of our value strategy, right there for Wine.</p>
          <p>Then we move on to the 18 key local brands, plus 6% volume growth, plus 3% sales growth. In actual fact, there are two brands that are negative, Seagram's Gin in the US and 100 Pipers in Thailand. But most other brands are contributive and Indian whiskies grew 30%; and this has become of strategic importance for the Group now.</p>
          <p>We have been used to presenting you with marketing issues by brand. Now we're going to give you a cross-cutting view of our innovations. Let's begin with product innovations. For example, regarding Absolut, you can see new flavors that were released. They're quite innovative because there was Wild Tea, Berri A&#xE7;a&#xEF; and Orient Apple. So you see it's not just lemon or orange vodka here, these are indeed very new innovative flavors and there's Elyx. Elyx has been market tested on five markets and we're extremely happy with the performance of Absolut Elyx. It sells for twice the price of ordinary Absolut. It's a super premium vodka. You should drink it straight, not in a cocktail. And now we're going to introduce Absolut on to 28 markets in this coming fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Malibu, I mentioned the initiatives such as cocktails which have been extremely popular in the US Malibu Fresh which is mint-flavored. This was launched on the French market. And there's Malibu Black and as I mentioned, there are other Malibu initiatives in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>Below you have plenty of other products. We mentioned Royal Salute 62 Gun Salute. There's A Tribute to Honour. We're prepared to take your orders but it's &#xA3;150,000 a bottle. Ladies and gentlemen, it's one bottle per person, of course. There's plenty of other initiatives, but I won't give you the details of.</p>
          <p>Now there were new packagings that were introduced. The new Ricard bottle is the most emblematic example thereof. There's Martell VSOP as well.</p>
          <p>But there is Mumm. Mumm now has the expert range. Obviously, Mumm de Cramant, Mumm Grand Cru, these are all champagnes that sell with this very distinguished bottle here. And they sell for over &#x20AC;40 a bottle. Some of them sell for a more than &#x20AC;100 a bottle depending on the position of the line-up. You see the new Havana Club bottle and The Glenlevit line-up. You have the whole line-up here, the packaging of which has been facelifted.</p>
          <p>Limited editions were also introduced. I won't walk you through every single one, but you see that one of our features is that we work with designers such as the case for ABSOLUT Watkins, CHIVAS Lacroix, or CHIVAS with Vivienne Westwood. So you see this co-design between a Pernord Ricard brand and a designer has been a successful trend and it is indeed our stock in trade, our hallmark when it comes to new products with limited editions.</p>
          <p>On this slide here you have a number of on-trade and off-trade promotions that we unleashed over the period. For example, for Beefeater 24; Beefeater 24 by the way is the upscale &#xA3;25-a-bottle product. The range you see the Caf&#xE9; Society or &#x2013; and the other products we have there for promotions.</p>
          <p>And let me go wind up with sponsorships, the South Korean Ballantine's Championship. Four of the top five golf players were sponsored by us and this South Korean event has become of major importance. There's the Cannes Festival where we're &#x2013; where we are an official partner with Chivas 25; Polo, where the royal family honors us with its presence to support Royal Salute. Not overlooking, of course the World Rugby Cup with Brancott Estate from New Zealand. So you see we're very active on the sponsorship front. Then we have digital initiatives that are many.</p>
          <p>And it's fair to say that digital is now in the fabric of what we do. Digital is here to stay, for sure. And there are new ad campaigns as well. They're extremely creative. As you can see, there have been many and more often than not, they are different according to the various markets. They're launched on in order to really be designed and geared to consumers, local consumers. So you see that in terms of marketing, we've been successful, creative and all this explains why we invest so heavily in our brands. It takes resources, but these resources are used to serve innovation, growth and value because as you may have gathered, our profit has grown faster than our sales.</p>
          <p>So with no further adieu, I think, I'm going to hand over to Gilles, who's going to give you the financial details of all this. He's going to give you a number of excellent figures.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pierre.</p>
          <p>So from marketing to finance, there's just one short step, but far fewer photographs. So these figures are self explanatory, but I will make some comments. As Pierre said, we had strong growth in profit from recurring operations. As you can see, we're back to strong growth. We were 2% growth. Actually now, we're back to 7%, and we're back to the pre-2008 numbers. Gross margin shows good numbers as well with the favorable price/mix effect. We continued to invest in advertising and promotion, which is definitely a driving force for our top line growth.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. Okay. Now, moving on to Forex and group structure effects on PRO. There was a &#x20AC;49 million negative group structure effect, due particularly to disposal of operations in Spain, Scandinavia and New Zealand. Next year, the scope effect should be minimal minus &#x20AC;7 million is what we're expecting given the disposals we carried out to date.</p>
          <p>Regarding Forex, there was a &#x20AC;25 million Forex impact. It was positive overall over the fiscal period. We saw quite a few increases. You will see that the dollar was worth $1.36 to euro versus the $1.39 last year. And there were rises in a number of other currencies. Now it's a question of phasing between H1 and H2 because, in fact, the effect was very favorable in H1, &#x20AC;98 million, but it was untoward in H2, minus &#x20AC;73 million.</p>
          <p>Gross margin after logistics costs. Now, as you can see, once again, it was a strong increase in the ratio, gross margin over sales plus 75 basis points. We're looking at a 200 basis point increase over a period of two years. It improved essentially due to a mix effect that's been favorable.</p>
          <p>First of all, there was growth in Top 14 sales was higher in the group growth. As you know, our &#x2013; gross margin of over 70% for the Top 14 higher than the group average and on a brand-by-brand basis as we've seen. There was a strong increase in the superior qualities of products such as Martell, Ballantine's or Chivas.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we increased prices for the Top 14. There was a 1.5% price hike in fiscal '10-'11, and we have contained our cost of goods sold. The average rise was a mere 1.5% over the period.</p>
          <p>Regarding A&amp;P spend, as announced, Pernod Ricard significantly stepped up its spend for its brands, plus 11%. The ratio has jumped from 17.8% to 18.9%. As Pierre mentioned, a significant chunk of that is due to the rise of the Top 14 in overall sales because we invest more heavily in the Top 14.</p>
          <p>24.7% of sales is what we invested in the Top 14 brands. Three quarters of the investments focused on our premium strategic brands. And as far as the geographic distribution of the investments is concerned, over half of the growth in investments can be ascribed to emerging countries. And this of course is in line with market potential.</p>
          <p>Regarding structure costs, you see that the rise was 5% organically, below that of sales. The structure costs over sales ratio dropped 15 points on a like-for-like basis, but the reported number is 10 basis points, due to the impact of disposals.</p>
          <p>Regarding the distribution of resources, based on percentage of a market growth, on the one hand, there's the offensive aspect of our action. We beefed up our efforts to tap into potential on emerging high potential countries.</p>
          <p>There are four that are quite emblematic. The BRICs obviously. Structure costs rose 24% in China, 29% in India, 23% in Russia and 17% in Brazil. So you see we have more people out there on the market to serve the growth of our brands. Moreover, we decided to create a subsidiary in Vietnam to support the strong growth of the Vietnamese market. And in the longer-term, we have decided to create a region for Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
          <p>Conversely, and this is a defensive aspect of our action, on more difficult markets, we've showed a strong discipline in structure costs. Because in Western Europe, there was a slight decline in structure costs, with more significant declines on markets hit hard by the crisis such as Greece.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, we saw 8% PRO growth, twice the performance of last year, more than what we guided you to at beginning of the period. We said plus 6 in February, said plus 7, and we're winding up with plus 8.</p>
          <p>Operating margin is at minus 38 basis points. Like-for-like, it's up 28, in spite of the strong surge in the A&amp;P over sales ratio.</p>
          <p>If you look at the breakdown by region, now Pierre told you about the business activity, I'm going to talk to you about the economics. In terms of profit from recurring operations, all regions contributed to our growth, with very, very strong contribution in Asia and the Rest of the World at 20%, a 3% growth in Americas, 2% in Europe outside of France, and indeed, 2% in France.</p>
          <p>Taking a closer look at Asia and the Rest of the World now. This is the most dynamic of our regions, and indeed in the sector as a whole. Our profit from recurring operations rose by 20%. This was, of course, driven by business growth of 15%, <mark type="ph" /> sales growth ratio (40:43).</p>
          <p>We substantially increased our A&amp;P by 19%. Of course, our structure costs and commercial staff costs, which rose 20% &#x2013; we have very clear objective of consolidating our development in Asia and the Rest of the World, and with a view to bolstering our leading role in Asia. We have the biggest market shares, so it's only natural that we allocated a lot of means to Asia and the Rest of the World.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Americas where our performance was very good, organic growth of 5%. Here again, we've decided to beef up our A&amp;P expenditures. We have increased our A&amp;P expenditure by an organic 10%, that's twice the organic growth sales. Particularly in the three most strategic markets in the region, mainly the US, which saw its A&amp;P expense up 9%, Brazil of 46% and Mexico up 17%, which is perfectly in keeping with our objective of accelerating growths in a region where our market share is lower than in the Europe or in Asia.</p>
          <p>As for structure costs, while the increase was moderate, particularly as we have to considerably bolster our structure costs in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Europe, excluding France &#x2013; well, sales growth was flat. It was minus 5% last year, if you recall, but as Pierre said, this is a considerable improvement over fiscal '09, '10. The situation has improved both in the east and in the west.</p>
          <p>As regards A&amp;P expenditure, again, in keeping with the dynamics of the region, we have increased our A&amp;P expenditure moderately by 2%. The expenditure is down on some markets, such as Greece. And core structure costs have risen very slightly, 1%, mostly to our priority markets in the Eastern Europe, but broadly speaking, our structure costs declined.</p>
          <p>This gave us an internal growth of PRO in Europe, outside of France. This is a nominal drop of 5%. This is due to &#x2013; this decrease was due to disposals in Spain and in Scandinavia.</p>
          <p>This brings to France, which continues to grow. Since the onset of the crisis, France has always grown its profit from recurring operations. It grew by 2% this year. We've also increased our A&amp;P with the launch of the new Pernod Ricard bottle in Q3. In France too, we were very disciplined about structure costs, which we reduced by 2%.</p>
          <p>Well, the logical upshot of all that is the fact that sales and profit from recurring operations have improved by region. We now have a substantial presence in all regions, in Asia and the Rest of the World accounting for a 36% of our profit from recurring operations, thus beefing up its importance within the group.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the emerging markets. This is an increasingly important growth driver for the group, accounting for 36% of our sales &#x2013; percent of our profit from recurring operations. I apologize.</p>
          <p>Remember that per capita GDP are less than $10,000 &#x2013; countries like South Korea are not included in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>I think at this time, we're already very well-established in emerging markets, and of course, the contribution of these markets to group's sales and PRO will increase in the years to come.</p>
          <p>Coming down below the profit from recurring operations, beginning with financial income from recurring operations. Well, financial income was an expense that has been decreased from &#x20AC;497 million to &#x20AC;469 million.</p>
          <p>Average cost of debt was kept low at 4.7%. It was 4.3% in fiscal '09/'10 and clearly below the target we informed you about earlier in the year of 5%. I think the effect of debt reduction on our average cost of debt offsets the increase from 4.3% to 4.7% in the average cost of debt.</p>
          <p>Other financial income and expenses improved from minus &#x20AC;51 million to minus &#x20AC;23 million. This was largely due to the decrease in net financial costs due to pension liabilities. So our objective for the fiscal '11/'12 is to maintain the average cost of debt at a level close to 5%.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow is one of the important aspects of the year. We continue to reduce our debt through generating a lot of cash. Our free cash flow from recurring operations was almost &#x20AC;1.2 billion, up slightly from the previous year. This stems largely from the growth in profit from recurring operations, but also from a good control of our working capital requirements, which were down &#x20AC;15 million, despite sales growth.</p>
          <p>Now on the one hand, ageing inventories grew moderately. And we have to &#x2013; this is of course for our key brands. It's &#x20AC;85 million. And as for operating working capital requirements, well, they declined significantly about &#x20AC;100 million, thanks to a whole series of initiatives, particularly optimizing customer payment terms and better management of our inventories of dry raw materials and finished goods. Capital expenditure was kept well under control and stable at around &#x20AC;183 million.</p>
          <p>From the previous chart, you have that free cash flow from non-recurring operations progressed negatively. This was largely due to unfavorable comparatives, and remember that last year we had to &#x2013; we had &#x20AC;105 million tax refund in the U.S., something we did not benefit from in fiscal '10/'11.</p>
          <p>Now the consequence of all that is the change in net debt, which is down sharply, down by over &#x20AC;1.5 billion, of course we did benefit this year unlike last year. We did benefit this year from the positive parity. That's the euro/dollar at 1.45 where it was 1.23 at the end of June 2010. So we benefit from the better exchange rates. We also reduced our debt by &#x20AC;640 million, thanks to very strong performance in terms of free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Well &#x2013; thanks to good growth, thanks to good profitability and net reduction. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio has dropped significantly once again. I'll let you look at the right-hand column here which is the average rate which converts debt and EBITDA at the average rate, which is the economic synopsis. At the start of the year, the ratio was 4.9, that has been reduced to 4.4. That's the multiple as we told you last February. Since the start of the year, the margin on our &#x2013; the spread on our syndicated loan has been reduced by 100 basis points. It was in fact &#x2013; sorry, reduced to 100 basis points from 130.</p>
          <p>As for debt refinancing, fiscal '10/'11 was a very active year. We've made a lot of progress. We made two bond issues at attractive terms and conditions, one &#x20AC;1 billion issue in March and another $1 billion issue in the following month. It's the first time we've made an issue in the U.S. It went very well, very good conditions and was subscribed by top ranking investors. We also carried out two bilateral financial packages for a total of &#x20AC;300 million in December 2010.</p>
          <p>The upshot is at the end of June 2010, bond debt represents approximately half of our gross debt. We're ahead of the plan that we announced, plan to achieve bond debt of 50% of our total. Now no reason why we shouldn't go beyond 50%, but we'll see. Now the success of our inaugural issue in the U.S. market enabled us to broaden our investor base. We have a euro market and a dollar market that are both there. This will help us secure our refinancing maturities in the future. We have also smoothed all our maturity dates over the future.</p>
          <p>Here you have the debt maturity chart, about &#x20AC;800 million in cash at present, &#x20AC;1.5 billion in undrawn credit lines. No major debt maturities before July 2013. There's debt by currency and by type of rates. We have a debt in dollars about 53%, 47% in the euro-denominated debt, which I think is a good reflection of our EBITDA write-down by currency. Even though it's divided over more currencies than simply the dollar and the euro, but we believe it's a good natural spread with natural form of hedging. 37% of our debt is at variable run rates, very much in line with our objective of approximately one-third. This means that over a substantial amount of our debt, we still have low interest rates and we'll continue to have low rates for a certain amount of time.</p>
          <p>Income tax now; the effective rate of tax is 22%. This is within the bracket of 22%, 24% I mentioned earlier in the year. It's up slightly on last year when the rate was 20.9%. As for non-recurring tax items, well, the net expense is negligible.</p>
          <p>On the consequence of all that is that we have Group share of net profit from recurring operations that has risen by 9%. It is the same percentage increase as the diluted net earnings per share from recurring operations. Because of these good results, we would be proposing to our AGM that it approve a dividend of &#x20AC;1.44 per share, that's up 7.5% over the previous period. This too is in line with our customary policy of a payout ratio of approximately &#x2013; a cash payout ratio of approximately one-third of profits.</p>
          <p>Non-recurring items now, if we could have that slide. Capital gains and losses on disposals and asset valuations. First of all, on disposals, there was a positive impact of &#x20AC;19 million. That's the capital gains on our various disposals in New Zealand, Spain, our 1% stake at Suntory. The loss of value on the impairment tests led to deprecations totaling &#x20AC;42 million, particularly on certain Polish vodkas that we inherited from Vin &amp; Sprit.</p>
          <p>Restructuring costs amounted to a net &#x20AC;17 million and other non-recurring income and expenses were an overall expense of &#x20AC;16 million, giving us a total other operating income and expenses of minus &#x20AC;56 million. As for non-recurring financial items, that is &#x20AC;11 million in other financial income. This gives us a Group share of net profit after recurring and non-recurring items that posted growth of 10%.</p>
          <p>Let me give the floor back to Pierre for his conclusion and a few words about our prospects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Gilles, as you can see, the figures are self explanatory and you actually explained them very, very well by the way. So, a few words of conclusion. Let's begin with a summary of the year just ended.</p>
          <p>I think these are results that are not just remarkable in terms of the figures, but they're remarkable in terms of what we've achieved. We have reinforced our market positions in most markets and particularly in the emerging markets. Now, the emerging markets are really, I think, our growth vectors. We have continued our strategy of innovation and premiumization, thanks to A&amp;P that I will not repeat.</p>
          <p>We have improved our financial performance be it through the gross margin, or percentage of gross margin, all through our profit from recurring operations where we have more than exceeded our goals. So we've also continued to reduce our debts. So I think there you have the fundamentals of the year just ended.</p>
          <p>That's the basis from which we are viewing the future with I think a great deal of serenity. First of all, we have a business model that works. In particular, our decentralized organization is evidence of the fact that this is a magnificent machine that enables us to grasp opportunities in all sorts of markets. This is something, a business model that we're not going to change in any way.</p>
          <p>Our strategy, which consists in focusing on premium brands, has also proved its efficiency. So for the current year, that's fiscal '11/'12, first of all, the start of the financial year, it confirms that our markets are very resilient. The trends are very much in line with the preceding months from now. Our ambition is very clearly to continue to grow. Thanks to our brand portfolio. Thanks to our distribution network and of course, thanks to the powerful leverage of the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>We will also continue to reduce our debt and we'll continue to optimize management of our financing. This is something Gilles has already mentioned. We're not ruling out another bond issue and confirming our objective of a net debt to EBITDA ratio of close to 4 by the end of June 2012.</p>
          <p>So that's how we see, foresee things over the next year. Of course, we will give you guidance as is now customary when we publish our sales figures for the first quarter. So we will give you guidance on the 20 of October next.</p>
          <p>That brings us to the end of our presentation. Ladies and gentlemen, I think you have a reminder of our next rendezvous, but we will now give you the floor for your questions. Maybe we can have a little more light in the auditorium.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antoine Belge from HSBC. I have three questions.</p>
          <p>First of all, I'd like to come back to growth in the Americas in Q4. That's 2% organic growth in the Americas in Q4. As this region also includes Latin America, does that mean that the U.S. figures were down? Which would seem somewhat strange in so far as you mentioned the sharp pick-up in the on-trade sector. So if you tell us more about the U.S. performance more specifically in Q4.</p>
          <p>Second question, you mentioned that your priority premium wines now account for 5% of your total sales, and that their contribution after A&amp;P had risen by 6%. Could you give us some idea of the rate of this contribution? I think, for the Group as a whole, it's 41.5%. So if you could give us some idea of the profitability of your priority premium wines.</p>
          <p>And third and final question, Diageo has proposed to increase its operating margin by 200 basis points over a three-year period. Now this involves a number of restructuring operations. First of all, do you believe that Pernod Ricard could outperform Diageo over the three-year period? And secondly, do you believe that there are potential restructuring operations, particularly with regard to your operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me begin with the U.S. The U.S. in Q4.</p>
          <p>As you know, the U.S. is a very singular market so far as we do not sell directly to our clients. We sell to wholesalers. So the best way of measuring the business in the U.S. is through the various panels, be it Nielsen or NABCA.</p>
          <p>And there has been no sign of a slowdown in the U.S. market whether you look at the panels over a 52-week period or over 13 weeks, three months, four months, whatever. And the last &#x2013; latest panel figures are for July, but &#x2013; so the market growth is in the region of 3%, 4% in volume and 3%, 4% in value as well.</p>
          <p>So, the interesting thing here is that the super premium and ultra premium categories are posting much stronger growth, because their volume growth is in the region of 10% in terms of value. Even for the prestige brands, we're looking at growth in the region of 30%.</p>
          <p>As for the on-trade sector. Indeed the two figures I quoted for May and June suggest that the on-trade growth is in the region of 5% to 8%. Now there may be a phasing issue with the sales, but I think the market figures are in line with the panel figures.</p>
          <p>And if you look at Pernod Ricard's, how they're perceived through NABCA or Nielsen panel, I don't think there's any reverse of the trend whatsoever. On the contrary, the market is definitely headed in the right direction.</p>
          <p>On the premium brands, Gilles, maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our strategic or priority premium wines, the gross margin is lower than on the spirits. At the end of June, it was 35%, that's gross margin. Thereby, half of the gross margin we have on our Top 14. It was slightly over 30% last year, so the gross margin on our premium wines has improved nonetheless. The four brands account for 5% of the Group sales.</p>
          <p>Operating margin, while we're at it. Yes, operating margin. One of our strategic objectives over the future is of course to increase our percentage operating margin. We must increase our gross margin. And of course our gross margin has continually increased in recent years, as you've seen. We have definitely decided to increase our A&amp;P expenditure at a higher rate than sales growth, but in the future, I think that the growth or the continued increase in A&amp;P expenditure as a percent of sales should, if anything, slow down and even tail off. So structurally, in the medium term, our objective is to increase our percentage operating margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning your operating methods, I think Diageo has highlighted a certain number of potential savings in its structural costs or fixed committed costs. Do you believe that you've optimized your operations and that there is no reason to proceed with restructuring of that type, particularly in more mature markets maybe, where Pernod Ricard's growth is very weak? Even in other markets, such as Spain, where our figures are declining?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we tend to not so much talk about what we do. We just tend to do it. We have a great support from our staff, and of course, have a number of voluntary departure plans in countries like Spain and Greece. That's perfectly clear. Gilles mentioned a few figures regarding our structure cost in Western Europe, which I think clearly show that we have been achieving savings on structure cost.</p>
          <p>We're very disciplined about this, while continuing to invest in emerging markets. Because when you see the overall trend of Pernod Ricard structure cost, you'll see that there are savings in mature markets, but on the other hand, we're investing more in a number of countries, be it the likes of Mexico, China, Brazil where our sales growth is in double digits. Also because we are investing in sales forces and marketing people.</p>
          <p>But maybe I can come back for a few seconds on the rule we applied for ourselves. First of all, the gross margin for Pernod Ricard has been increased by 200 basis points over the last three years. So intrinsically we have that performance encapsulated there.</p>
          <p>But also we have clearly decided to invest to support the premiumization and innovation strategy. So from this point of view, over the last two years, I'm sure you have noticed that we have increased our marketing A&amp;P expenditure by almost 200 basis points as well, from almost 17% to almost 19%. So this is a tweaking that really seeks out growth and innovation.</p>
          <p>What Gilles has just said is that we now believe that we have, if not altogether optimized, we are well &#x2013; are certainly heading for a period where the growth of our A&amp;P expenditure as a percentage of sales, that is &#x2013; will be more moderate and eventually tail off. So, true. Over the last two years, we have been tweaking the Pernod Ricard machine with a view to growth and innovation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pierre, if I just add a technical matter to what you said about the phasing of growth in the Americas. Remember, we had 11% growth in Q3. Obviously, lower on Q4, with 5% growth for the full year, which I think is the average over the full year, and a good reflection of annual growth.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., there's always a disparity between shipments and depletions. As far as depletions are concerned, we were up 2.3% over the full year. In the first and second quarters, likewise. So the underlying trend, as Pierre has said, in terms of the consumer panel figures, is unchanged and certainly headed in the right direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Morning, Gilles. Morning, Pierre. Trevor Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Two questions for you, first.</p>
          <p>Pierre, in the past, you've commented that you could see a day when India would become the fourth largest market in the Group. I was just wondering did that actually take place this financial year or is that still to come in the future?</p>
          <p>And the second question is one of your major competitors, regarding China, has said he expects to see a slowdown in the growth of international premium spirits in China, as the effect of rolling out to new cities slows down. Do you share that perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>India, While I said it's part of the Top 5 league, in fact, it's number four in terms of sales and number five in terms of profit. And with the current dynamism, I mean there is no doubt that this year, it will be in the top four.</p>
          <p>Regarding China, no, sorry, I haven't seen any sign of slowing down. I mean the &#x2013; just to characterize our performance, in terms of cognac, we gain market share on a growing market and in the &#x2013; and the market grew, according to our estimation.</p>
          <p>As you know, there is no sort of Nielsen or any reliable numbers. What we do is, in fact, we make an in-depth analysis of the wholesaler at the true level. I mean, first primary wholesaler and secondary wholesaler. So at the end, it's a pretty good coverage. And I wonder if not even more accurate than any Nielsen numbers.</p>
          <p>So we gained 2% market share in the cognac, if I'm correct. I mean, we went up to 42% in volume compared to 40%. So we &#x2013; and the market grew by 13%.</p>
          <p>On the whiskey, yes, the whiskey was probably negative, in the range of minus 3% against the market. But we grew &#x2013; we were stable because we grew our market share by four percentage points, if I'm correct, to 55%.</p>
          <p>Definitely, I mean, we are the leader in this market, and so we benefit from our size of organization, from our dedication, and maybe <mark type="ph" /> the disorganization (1:07:47) as well, because the team is highly motivated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Pierre.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Simon Hales from Barclays Capital. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning everybody. A couple of questions, if I can.</p>
          <p>I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about price/mix. It looks to me that in Q4, you saw some accelerating price/mix on some of your key top 14 brands. Specifically Chivas Regal. I'd be interested in your comments around that. And perhaps also your specific comments on pricing as we look into fiscal 2012.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just going back to China, obviously you've been managing to a degree the supply of cognac into that market into the second half. How should we think about how you'll manage the supply of cognac looking forward? I mean, should we be thinking that we'll be seeing perhaps greater pricing going forward and less volume, as you restrict overall supply there?</p>
          <p>And maybe just one final quick one, again. Going back to your comments again, Pierre, on A&amp;P spend. Obviously near 19% of net sales at the end of this year. Are you suggesting that that will be pretty well the peak level, and you won't rise necessarily above that in fiscal 2012? Or in the very near term, should we still expect to see A&amp;P as a percentage of sales continue to edge forward this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For price/mix, the &#x2013; I'll probably let Gilles give you some data. Just to say that for instance, in a market like the U.S., we're pleased to see that far less promotions. And we've been able to make price increases &#x2013; in particular, at the beginning of August, for two brands &#x2013; Jameson and The Glenlivet. And we do not rule out to make any further price increases either on these brands or others. And maybe to allow Gilles to look at it in more detail.</p>
          <p>China and cognac. Well, the good news with cognac is because of limited supply, you're pretty sure that no new entrants can appear on the market, and you can defend your prices. I mean we have had double-digit growth for our prices in cognac. So that's the good news of the limited supply.</p>
          <p>Having said that, what we have secured is to ensure a double-digit growth rate for the next coming years in China with Martell. That's the way we organize our supply. We could sell more obviously, but of course we want to have relatively smooth profile of the growth on this market.</p>
          <p>A&amp;P in percentage of net sales. No, I didn't say that 18.9% is a sort of peak. What I said is that over the last two years, it was almost one full percentage point, year-on-year. And for this year, it will be probably &#x2013; it could be more moderate evolution in terms of potential of net sales. But it's a bit too early to exactly fix a target for that. We will <mark type="ph" /> probably comment (1:11:13) that later on.</p>
          <p>Gilles, maybe on price/mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on price/mix, on the Top 14, just having a look at Q4, volumes were up 4.4% and net sales were up 8%. So I would say that the price/mix was 3.5%, which is more or less in line with the 4% we have for the full year.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> It says that (1:11:30) for Chivas, it's a bit higher in Q4. We had a price/mix was 5%, but it's largely linked to the mix of growth by country of Chivas in Q4. In China, Chivas volumes in Q4 were up 16% and obviously has a positive impact on the mix of the brand. So that's the main reason.</p>
          <p>So I would say that Q4 has not changed the trend in terms of price and mix across brands and geographies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Ian Shackleton from Nomura. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the debt side, when do you expect the debt rating agencies to move you up to investment grade? Is that something that's becoming imminent?</p>
          <p>And the second question was around stock levels, particularly the wholesale channels. Where do you see those levels are, both in the U.S. and in some of the European markets? And is there scope for those stock levels to come down, if there's a slowdown in trade, particularly thinking about the holiday season in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know that our objective is to become, again, investment grade. Even it's our bond issuances, I would say, show that the markets already, I would say, price us and recognize us as an investment grade company. We're not yet investment grade company seen by the agencies.</p>
          <p>Obviously it's not up to us to decide. I can just say that I think what we've done in the last two years in terms of deleveraging, in terms of decreasing net debt, in terms of EBITDA growth, I think we've done, I think, all that we could to go in the right direction. So, hopefully it could happen in the near term but again, it's not up to us to decide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frankly speaking, I think it's a bit too premature to speak about the holiday season in the U.S. We'll see in due course.</p>
          <p>But I insist. So far the market is still growing in the U.S. And with the positive sign like on the &#x2013; in terms of price bands, and the premium products are behaving pretty well, and the on-trade also being positively oriented. So that's very much what we see today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe the point on the stock levels in the trade. I would say that, as you know, after 2008 there was a strong decrease in the wholesale inventory in the U.S. It has not gone up then. So we have today a lower level of inventories at the wholesaler level in the U.S. than we had three years ago. And I would say that in the other countries, wholesaler level is at a normal level. That is to say a low level.</p>
          <p>And speaking about the retailers, during the last crisis, they have decreased a lot their level of inventory. And we believe that they are today working at very low and minimal levels of the inventories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Xavier Croquez from Cheuvreux. I have a couple of questions, one on growth, one on the U.S.</p>
          <p>Regarding growth, regarding Kahlua and Malibu, you stated that you've cracked the nut, as the marketers say. What has been the Q4 growth of these two brands to try to illustrate that?</p>
          <p>And regarding the growth in your brands, I looked at your H1 presentation for the 18 local priority brands. You made a few comments on some brands that you did not mention this time around. Can you tell us about Wyborowa, Montilla, and Becherovka, the brands you mentioned in the H1 presentation? That's my question on growth.</p>
          <p>Now, I have my question on the U.S., a typical analyst question. You just said that the market grew 3%, 4% in volume over 52 or 13 weeks. And that the depletion trends were 2.5 or 3 for Pernod Ricard. So market share volume being flat, it seems a bit strange. Is that fair or is there something I missed out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, now regarding Kahlua and Malibu, Gilles will find the right numbers for you.</p>
          <p>Regarding Malibu, I did say, well, yes, we believe that we have everything we need all the ingredients we need to make the cake rise, and that the brand will grow from now on. That's quite clear.</p>
          <p>Now regarding Kahlua, I wasn't quite as adamant. I said I'm confident, but it has not yet materialized. But the Delicioso campaign that was presented here, I believe, has been acclaimed. And we have other initiatives in terms of advertising and product launches that are in the pipeline, which is why I'm quite hopeful, I'm quite confident about Kahlua.</p>
          <p>A word about the organization. As you may have seen, we transferred the responsibility of these two brands to Absolut, to The Absolut Company, TAC. And based on the fact that these are brands and products that are geared to similar consumers, and it's virtually the same type of consumption &#x2013; mixed liquor in high-energy places, locales that are youthful, if you see my drift.</p>
          <p>Now through &#x2013; so our marketing teams were extremely creative, and the fast pace of all these initiatives has been even faster over the past year, because the transfer took place one year ago. So that is what leads me to say that for these two brands, we have good momentum and high hopes.</p>
          <p>Regarding the 18 key local brands, Gilles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me supplement on Malibu and Kahlua because there was question on Q4. Once again, it's just one quarter. Value growth from Malibu in Q4, 16%, but if you take the annual 3% you have the trend for the year, but indeed the trend is improving quite sharply for Malibu in terms of innovation, but 16% does not reflect an annual trend. And by the same token for Kahlua in Q4, we're looking at 7%, virtually stable, slightly dipping for the full year, and that 6% is not &#x2013; does not really reflect the annual performance.</p>
          <p>That being said for Kahlua we have hopes with this campaign which we'll launch in H2, but it's too soon to tell that it's definitely growing right now. We have to be a little bit patient now. Wyborowa, Becherovka, Montilla, the 18 key local brands, I apologize. I don't know all these numbers by heart.</p>
          <p>I do know them for the top 14 but not for the 18 key local brands. Let me make a comment though. Regarding Wyborowa, without a doubt, the brand is suffering on its home market i.e. Poland. Unfortunately, there is a price war that's being waged on vodka in Poland and there are casualties. And Wyborowa is no exception because we do not want to bring our prices down. So volume is shrinking and we're accepting that.</p>
          <p>On other export markets, the brand is doing well. But unfortunately, it's not enough to offset the dire situation in Poland. But at the same time, we have very strong growth on imported products in Poland. And Poland, as we see it, has a vodka market that's not very attractive for Polish vodkas, but conversely, we have strong ambitions with Absolut and imported brands are going to drive our development in Poland. It's a country of over 40 million people, the economy is recovering, we're very happy with Poland.</p>
          <p>Now in value, Wyborowa minus 12% for the year, Becherovka flat for the year, and Montilla minus 4%. Montilla suffered a surge in excise duties, with a 20% rise there, but the trend is becoming more stable now.</p>
          <p>Okay, now regarding the United States, and market share, our analysis is correct. But you have to consider things through segmentation. Our performance is not very good with Seagram's Gin for instance nor is it very good with our Cordial brands.</p>
          <p>The standard portion of our portfolio is not doing too well, but if you take the top 14, 5% growth is what we have and that shows that our market share and positions have strengthened. This is clearly the case with Jameson, a brand which is quite outstanding. If you recall the presentation we made in New York, Jameson's growth rate is picking up in the U.S. and often it is said that when a brand reaches 1 million cases, the 2 million cases mark is within reach. And we're very happy with our accomplishments with Chivas. Things are improving from the past. The Glenlivet is a no nonsense brand that's been growing steadily. It's the leader in the single malt category. And regarding Malibu, once again, the various initiatives we unleashed are rewarding and bearing fruit. As you know, Malibu is considered as a rum and we've strengthened our market share there. It's a liquor in Europe, but it's considered in the rum category in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Yes, anyone else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Laetitia Delaye from Kepler Capital Markets. A tough question on taxes. Announcements were made by the French Government last week. Could you give us some additional information given that what we've read in the press wasn't clear nor were the Government's statements? We recall what happened in 1993, the impact on Pernod, have you crunched some numbers as to what to expect next year?</p>
          <p>Another question, against a backdrop imbued with debt-ridden countries, have you heard of any other tax hikes that could be possible in the U.S. or elsewhere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, regarding tax hikes in France, you say it's a tricky or a tough question, well, let me tell you this, we're not surprised. The government is trying to harness as much money as it can and alcohol, liquor is often hit first. They say that the concern has to do with public health or everybody else's money and therefore strong liquor is going to be taxed. What's the difference between strong liquor and liquor? And spirits account for 20% of the consumption of the French. So it doesn't really make sense because you're pulling others in the concern. I mean, what's the story? What's the deal? Either it's a budget concern and you should call a spade a spade.</p>
          <p>Anyway, regarding the impact of the tax hike, I shall be very brief about this. There's no impact this year, because whether it be a seasonal impact, there will be stocking, replenishment and so on. But for fiscal '11/'12 there will be no impact on Pernod Ricard and then it's a 15% rise we're looking at.</p>
          <p>In 1993, as you suggested there was a similar tax hike. It was 16%, quite similar indeed. The hike had led to a 7% market shrink in the year after the tax hike and then it picked up again. And for Pernod Ricard at that time, there was a 3%, 3.5% dip because &#x2013; we're on higher end because remember, if you take Chivas, the rise &#x2013; the tax hike will be 3%. The impact of the tax hike will be 3% for our consumers, VAT inclusive, so it is quite marginal.</p>
          <p>Anyway, Pernod Ricard is far more premium in France than it was in 1993. At best, let me give you a ballpark and guesstimate at worse case scenario, we're looking at &#x20AC;15 million, maybe &#x20AC;20 million in profit impact in fiscal '12/'13, hard to tell though, but of course we're going to take measures. We're going to jack up our prices and so that should offset partially or fully that impact. So in other countries &#x2013; regarding other countries, there is one country that makes the headlines, Spain. Well, we talk about it and the rumors of tax hikes in Spain every now and again and the tax authorities feel that since the market isn't very good, it may not be appropriate to come up with another tax hike because what matters is bringing in money for the government, right? Bringing in money for the state. So it's a major source of income in Spain. Everywhere else, well I can tell you that there is no tax hike waive on the horizon so to speak. That's our perception. That's what we have on our radar. So once again in France, no impact this year apart from stock replenishment between H1 and H2 and the impact will be quite marginal in fiscal '12, '13.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nicolas Ceron from Soc Gen. I have two questions. Mr. Pringuet, you are very firm about the deleveraging last year. Could your tone change in any way if a strategic opportunity were to arise?</p>
          <p>My second question concerns Indian whiskies. Do you think that in due course you'll be a significantly increasing your A&amp;P expenditure in the Indian market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, concerning deleveraging or debt reduction, we haven't changed our tone in any way. Clearly, debt reduction is our goal and the ratio target is a multiple of four by the end of June next year. So there's nothing new there. Well, you are right. And I think our recent endeavors have demonstrated that you're right. That is we're not ruling out what we would call a tactical moves. Strategic opportunities, no, but tactical moves, yes.</p>
          <p>In July with Avion, well, the move was interesting from two points of view. First of all, we captured an ultra premium tequila that is particularly interesting and then sales are between $40 to $60 a bottle. Now, Avion is also a startup. This is part of our innovation policy, remember. Within the innovation policy we will be able to manage this type of startup program that we can help foster.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the quality of the innovation is even better within small structures within small entities. So the agreement with Avion is very interesting because we are have big stake in a minority stake, but we'll look after distribution. Now we're contributing what they're lacking that's the clout of our distribution network. And of course, we have provided a mechanism whereby we will in due course have an option on full control over the company in accordance with terms and conditions that have been agreed, but that I cannot reveal here.</p>
          <p>And about Indian whiskies, we will increase our A&amp;P expenditure of Indian whiskies market. Well, our investments in Indian whiskies is increasing on par with sales, so a sharp increase. I don't know if we have figures to bear that out. But, yeah, broadly speaking on the three Indian brands, investment ratio is less than 10%. It's much higher on Royal Stag or other premium brands. We are gradually increasing the ratio particularly on premium brands, because we do need innovation for these local brands as well. Given the sharp increase in volumes with the Royal Stag for instance we have increased our expenditure by over 40% in the last 12 months which is &#x2013; was a lot more money to help develop the brand.</p>
          <p>Remember that the profitability of these brands is also increasing very sharply. What we're doing is we're premiumizing our portfolio. Royal Stag has nothing to be ashamed about in terms of its contribution by comparison with other top 14 brands. So, a very, very profitable growth here with Royal Stag.</p>
          <p>If I could just come back for a second on innovation and marketing. We are investing considerably in India on imported brands. Our brands, our scotch brands in particular, first and foremost of which Chivas and Absolut.</p>
          <p>We're preparing for what we believe to be inevitable that is the fact that the Indian markets will open up. In other words, taxes on the imported goods will have to decrease. There have been negotiations ongoing for a very long time and there is ultimately a reason to believe that there will be free trade agreement between Europe and India. This is what we're preparing for by investing in our premium brands in India.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, that brings us to an end. We will finish on a very, very positive, hopeful note. I think we've gone by 10:30 deadline. So, thank you all for attending be it in the room here or over Internet. We will meet next on the 20 of October for our Q1 sales figure for the current fiscal year. Thank you.</p>
