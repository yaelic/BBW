      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to be here again with you discussing results of the exceptional year of 2007 for Petrobras when we're able to give a total return to our shareholder greater than 130%, so the exploratory results that was the greater responsible for such a success of the company was really a very good year in terms of exploration. But let's begin by reviewing some of the major factors that drive our results year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter starting with production.</p>
          <p>Next slide. In this slide, you can see that production of oil during the full year was virtually flat. The contribution from the new production systems added 109 to 2,000 barrels to, but this was offset by our natural decline rate leaving production growth for the year at less than 1%. As you know, the fourth quarter saw the introduction of four new systems, but they had little impact on the year's averages adding only 10,000 barrels per day. While not shown here, production of natural gas was equally flat.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, you can see that these new units were not enough to offset the natural decline during the period. Production from P-52, P-54 and the FPSO-Cidade de Vit&#xF3;ria has only begun to ramp up this year. The sum of current daily production from these units is currently around 150,000 barrels per day. As these units increase production, we expect to see health growth for 2008. As you know, we produced over 2 million barrels per day on December 25th, a very nice Christmas present.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, we published our reserve figures for the year ended December 31st, 2007. As you can see, we have again profitably replaced our Brazilian reserves both on an SEC and SPE basis. Interestingly, SEC reserves grew more than SPE because the ANP indicated that we could expand our production in particular blocks as a condition to make additional investment in that block. This allowed us to book additional reserves. This is a very positive precedent.</p>
          <p>Regulatory changes in Ecuador required us to take additional write-downs in these countries, thus reducing our international reserves. We still have a very health reserve to production life of 18.9 years on the SPE basis and 14.5 using SEC criteria. As an oil company, we are fortunate and somewhat unique in that our challenge is not replacing reserves, rather it is in developing proved reserves, appraising new discoveries with massive potential and exploring in promising frontiers that had not yet been drilled.</p>
          <p>Turning to production costs in the slide five, you can see that US dollar lifting costs rose by $0.95 quarter-over-quarter. Including government participation, the increase was $3.03 per barrel. At the same time, the price of oil rose by almost $14. Almost half of the increase in lifting cost is attributable to the valuation of the real. Lifting costs as a percentage of the price of barrel of oil declined during the period. These costs now represent less than 10% of the price of a barrel of oil. Lifting costs when expressed in reais were up $0.58 per barrel. The incremental cost of the new production units plus FPSO Cidade Mateus added $0.21 of real per unit to fourth quarter lifting costs. In other words, the new units were responsible for one-third of the increase in reais lifting costs. As these units increase production, unit costs will decline.</p>
          <p>Refining costs, as you can see in the next slide, have been increasing the cost because of the reevaluation of the real and the addition of complexity of our refineries which require greater amount of catalysts and other material to process our heavy crude oil, while meeting stricter health, safety and environmental standards. In the fourth quarter, the rise was particularly dramatic because of program stoppages in the Reduc lubricant train. For 2008, it is expected that refining costs will be more in line with the average for 2007.</p>
          <p>In slide seven, you can see the price of oil rose continually during the year and even accelerated during the fourth quarter. You will also see that the value of our relative heavy crude is now valued at around $12 discount to the price of Brent versus 10.5 in the prior period.</p>
          <p>Turning to refining output in slide eight, you can see that throughput declined slightly during the quarter as a result of the programmed stoppage. Production of domestic oil also declined as it was more economical to export larger volume of heavier domestic oil and import lighter oil. Higher activity in some of our domestic production also reduced throughput of domestic crude.</p>
          <p>Sales of product in domestic market continued to increase with diesel improving by 33,000 barrels per day and accounting for almost 70% of the product sales growth. This growth was satisfied by an increase in imports. It's important to note that our throughput of domestic oil is still up versus one year ago following completion of the <mark type="inaudible" /> In 2008, we expect to complete the upgrade of Reduc which will enable us to convert 36,000 barrels per day of fuel oil into diesel and other light products. This will have a positive impact in our refining margins.</p>
          <p>The next slide illustrates the effect of maintaining gasoline, diesel and LPG stable in real terms in the domestic markets during the fourth quarter. The strengthening of the real and the biweekly adjustment in price of our industrial products caused the average realization price to increase by $8 per barrel, which was less than international product price which spiked by $11.</p>
          <p>In the slide 10, you can see the impact of stable oil production, relatively stable oil product price, and higher costs on our results. Revenue increased by 928 million reais. This was more than offset by higher import costs and higher lifting and refining costs. Operating expenses also increased sequentially during the quarter by 579 million reais as a result of higher G&amp;A, higher exploration costs, especially internationally, and impairment on our Ecuadorian assets.</p>
          <p>On a sequential basis, these additional costs were offset by provisioning of 705 million reais related to the pension plan in the third quarter. It is worth mentioning that our net income for the full year in reais under Brazilian GAAP declined by 17% relative to 2006. Net monetary and exchange variation was the principal cause for the decline. We have tried to improve the market understanding of these by breaking out the assets and liabilities that contribute to the valuation during the period.</p>
          <p>This you can see in the page 36 of the financial market report, especially higher net assets subject to monetary variation have increased as we fund our offshore subsidiary for capital investments that will be used both abroad and in Brazil. Combined with higher appreciation of the real in 2007, net monetary exchange variation increased by 3 billion reais. This effect is not in our US dollar financial restatement. Net income under Brazilian GAAP declined by 20% during the first nine months of 2007 we achieved to the prior year, while during the same period income in US GAAP increased by 2%.</p>
          <p>Turning to our principal segment, you will see in slide 11 that earnings in our E&amp;P segment increased by 7% as a result of the higher price of oil, partially offset by the small decline in production and the increase in costs. Slide 12 illustrates that our downstream segment was affected by stability of gasoline and diesel price in Brazil. Higher price for our other product was more than offset by the rising cost of crude and imported products as well as higher refining costs.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, international results were adversely affected by the 495 million reais of dry hole expense and another 401 million reais from impairment of Ecuadorian assets. The positive effect from increased sales volume was more than offset by the increase in cost from those sales as downstream sales with a lower margin grew at a faster rate than upstream sales that typically enjoy higher margin.</p>
          <p>In slide 14, you will see the total capital expenditure and acquisition totaled 45 billion reais during the period, an increase of 34%. The acquisition of Ipiranga and Suzano contributed to this increase.</p>
          <p>In slide 15, please, turning to this slide we see the finance &#x2013; how we financed our investment plan in 2007 as well as pay dividends of 7.5 billion reais. We used internal generated cash flow and reduced our cash balance by 27 billion reais at the end of 2006 to 13 billion reais at the end of 2007. Our net debt to the net book capitalization ended the year at a healthy 19%. Our targeted net debt to the net book capitalization is 25 to 35%. So we are still below our target range.</p>
          <p>Looking to the future, you will see in slide 16 that we have another three platform with a total of 460,000 barrels per day of capacity and another 25 million cubic meters of gas capacity coming on-stream during 2008. In the case of P-51 and P-53, physical completion is more than 80% complete.</p>
          <p>I would also like to draw your attention to the three new units that were contracted to be built since our last conference all. You may remember that the original bids for P-55 and P-57 were originally cancelled because they were too expensive. After redesigning the units and rebuilding, we were able to reduce the cost quite substantially. In the case of P-56, for example, it is being designed as built as a clone of P-51. The cost saving on each of these platforms as a result of this effort is approximately $600 million per unit.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. And keeping a look on the future, you can see the pre-salt cluster where we have drilled in most of the blocks, but during 2008 we intend to keep the effort on the area to better evaluate and having the first oil being produced by beginning of 2011.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. Total shareholder return. This is very important. Finally, I would like to conclude with a review of the appreciation of our share price and the total return to the shareholder in 2007. The increase in value was the result of a combination of exploratory success, operational success as well as positive development in Brazil and the oil markets. We think it also reflects the market's recognition of our enormously positive long-term prospect as we continue to reinvest in our enormous opportunity set.</p>
          <p>Thank you. We are now open for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Paul Cheng of Lehman Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon gentlemen, three quick questions. One, wondering if you can talk about your drilling program for the next six months in the sub-salt area? Second, any comments related to Tupi given one of your partner BG in their conference call talking about over 10 billion barrels, even higher than the range that you guys given, any comment on that? And lastly then, any comment on the well that you drill on the BMS-10? I think you already announced 9 as the discovery, 10 has been drilled for a while, maybe I missed it, but I haven't heard what is the result on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Paul. I will have my colleague from E&amp;P to help us on these answers. Please Molinari.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding Tupi, what we have <mark type="inaudible" /> is not for the next six months. We have an extended well test for 2009 and we have a pilot system of 100,000 barrels per day at the end of 2010 or beginning of 2011. And this is our plan for this area. Of course, there will be other exploratory wells drilled in Tupi area. What was the other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. For Tupi, actually, your partner, you were discussing about higher reserve potential perhaps is higher than your initial wins. Wondering if there is any comment that you could add? And also when talking about the drilling program, and not really just focusing on Tupi but also &#x2013; but more on the <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, we are not &#x2013; we are planning new exploratory wells in the area and what we can say at the moment is what I have said is the extended well test and the pilot system and other exploratory wells in the area. And regarding the announcement of BG's gas, which they used a different criteria based on the oil in place, so their number was higher, but is not a recoverable volume. It's oil in place. So if you convert it into recoverable volume, it will be about the same as Petrobras disclosure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are still going to stick with in the meantime that the 5 to 8 billion barrels of the recoverable reserve that you have in place you have previously disclosed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's 5 to 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent of recoverable volume is not reserves yet <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand on that. And then my last question is any of that &#x2013; any comment on the Block BMS-10 that you have drilled over there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes BMS-10 is <mark type="inaudible" /> It was the first one to be &#x2013; that was drilled in the area. There were RJS-617 and like the others we have used that to evaluate the area of Tupi because BMS-10, BMS-9 is close of the Tupi area, and we have drilled and passed two wells, RJS-628 and RJS-446, and we have also tested this BMS-10 and BMS-9 well. We drilled one well in each of these blocks and tested as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any rough idea what is the reserve potential in the Block 9 and 10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have to drill further. We have to drill other exploratory wells to evaluate these areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when are we going to drill the additional wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we &#x2013; I cannot anticipate that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from Marcus Sequeira of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello gentlemen. Good afternoon. I just have three questions. One on production growth for this year, what sort of production growth you're expecting relative to 2007? Second question, lifting costs, I'd just like to check with you if your estimate for average lifting cost in 2008 is more close to $7.60 per barrel? And last on your discount &#x2013; on the discount of your international oil price, should we assume a similar discount for the rest of the year or do you have any new increase in light oil production that should bring this discount down? Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Molinari, can you help us please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With the lifting costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, with the lifting cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, our lifting cost, the average for 2007 was $7.70, and we have a plan to reduce that to $6.10 per barrel in 2012. So we have a target. We are going to see the lifting costs going down from the end of this year on. And if the real is more and more appreciated than it is at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But for 2008, what would you be targeting for average lifting costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't publish yearly lifting costs only. What we have is a target for 2012 as I mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you. And then on production growth for this year, what sort of targets or plans are you guys working with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the production growth for this year, we have the Roncador P-52 which now is producing 60,000 barrels per day with three wells. We have P-54 both in the Roncador field. P-54 is producing 46,000 barrels per day with the three wells same. And we have three new oil systems going on-stream in the end of this year. P-51 is a semisubmersible platform. It was the first one that was entirely built in Brazil. It's going to come on-stream in November this year with 180,000 barrels per day. Then we have Marlim Leste P-53 in September. It is also 180,000 barrels per day and then we have Cidade de Niter&#xF3;i entering on-stream in December this year. These are the oil systems, but we have also Camarupim is on FPSO Cidade de S&#xE3;o Mateus starting production also in December this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And for the P-52, 54, do you expect peak production by when, by mid this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The peak production will be on the second quarter of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect, and the last one on the discount of your oil to international price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, it's not the second quarter, second half. Second half, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's okay. Thank you. On the discount of your oil, the discount has increased this quarter, should we expect this discount to remain the same or increase or even decrease in the &#x2013; what should expect for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The discounts have improved compared to spread you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As I mentioned in the presentation, we have increasing production of acids oil in Brazil, new production. Part of it comes with high acidity and a part of this production is being exploited. What is giving us an increase in the discount compared with the Brent. Last year was 10.5, this year was 12 &#x2013; about $12 discount. We expect to be in this area, 10, $12 in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. It's Marc McCarthy. I wanted to ask you just a few easy questions. First of all, Almir, I suppose you're the best for this. You've got a tremendous natural gas growth program over the next several years. You've got now the discovery of Jupiter. Needless to say you have a lot of natural gas. Will you or will you not continue to sign the contract to import and renew the contract with Bolivia in 2017, and if so why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marc, I believe it's too early to discuss this renewal of contract. That is going to happen not &#x2013; if it's going to happen, <mark type="inaudible" /> '17 but '19.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>But is it fair to say that sort of development of Jupiter and the signing of the contract sort of our &#x2013; it's almost one or the other, right? They are competing against the same market. They probably have similar scale, if not Jupiter being even larger?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are &#x2013; at this moment, we are evaluating the different alternatives to produce the gas from the pre-salt cluster. As you know, it's far from the coast and there is still some problem to be better evaluated. And it depends on the solution, I believe. According to the solution, we are going to find the best way to use the excess, if it happens to have gas we are going to produce in Brazil. As you know, there are other countries that is in need of more gas. We can do some liquefaction of gas to export. We have a lot of alternative, at this point in time we don't have yet a final solution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The other question was oriented to the downstream business. I figured there would be plenty of questions for Tupi and the upstream program, which has been the case. Assuming that you showed in your chart, I think it was on page 9 of your presentation where it shows the average realization price in Brazil. You are very slowly getting squeezed and thank goodness for the strength of the Brazilian currency which has continued to make the purchases of the expensive oil actually not as negative. But to what extent &#x2013; it's going to come in two questions. First, have you hedged at all your very substantial fourth quarter inventory balance given the fact that it's a distinct possibility that either you will need to raise prices into the first quarter or you're going to be very close to breakeven? And then the second question is, what is the level of spending in 2008 on the downstream upgrade program, because I believe you need to meet the fuel specification requirements by &#x2013; I don't know if it's '08 or '09?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't if we have the total investment for 2008 in the downstream, because what I have, Marc, is the total. Probably, you know of CapEx for improving the quality of oil reserve, almost $9 billion. But this expense...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if I remember, it's very front-end loaded because the fuel specification targets occur in 2009, if I recall?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But we are going to deliver the oil &#x2013; specified oil for the domestic markets because, as you know, to use better quality and have a better result, you have to change the engine of the trucks. It's not only a matter of having the right fuel, but you have to adjust the frac as well. We are doing our share and we believe that this is going to grow from 2009 as new engines come to be available in the market.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is not our policy. We don't work with hedge, except for very special transactions where we do sell or buy according to the transaction itself, but not for the company as a whole. We work with the marketplace.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if I could, just let me take one last question and that is, you changed the accounting process for the transfer of natural gas to commercial &#x2013; to the gas and power segment awhile back, a year ago or so, which has in essence forced the gas and power business into losses. How much of the eliminations &#x2013; the negative that was produced actually came from gas versus refining?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> could you help us in this question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat, Marc.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Can't hear you, <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, Marc. Could you repeat the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry. The eliminations loss during the period is made up of sales of oil for the upstream and downstream and from gas from &#x2013; the upstream to the gas and power business, if you could just give me a basic percentage of how it's broken up. Was it largely in refining or was it at all within gas and power?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understood your question, we had some effects among the areas depending on the level of supply of inventories and the tendency of price between the periods, okay? In terms of elimination, these two variables can affect the number in each period, okay? And the higher effect in this kind of transactions occurs between E&amp;P and supply area because the inventories of the supply area is so high, okay? Almost 6 days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it basically 90% of that impact or was there any from gas and power?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think &#x2013; yeah, mainly because in terms of transactions involving natural gas, we don't have inventories of natural gas. They are the most &#x2013; almost every effect is coming from the transactions between E&amp;P and the supply area.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Almir, I have a couple of questions here. Let me start with probably the easiest one. I was curious about that comment you made about the SEC reserves and the SPE reserves and the growth on the SEC reserves being related to contracts or indications that the contracts might be extended. I just wanted to know two things on that front. The first one, has everything that you could get in extensions already been incorporated into this new SEC number or was it a partial or a small event? And number two, has the ANP done something that is binding and that they cannot back away from or was it just some kind of lose indication for now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me have here Molinari to say it if we incorporated all the additional reserves or if there is still some blocks. Molinari, can you help us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this incorporation was due to the expansion of concession contracts, provided we make the investments required to do so. But that was in specific &#x2013; I don't know the fields now that we have granted the extension. It's not for all the concessions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So this is part of what you could have booked for this kind of a theme and the extension was already officially granted then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's officially granted. Otherwise, we could not book SEC proven reserves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My second question, I was actually looking back at your presentations all the way back to 2004 or so, and this relates a little bit to the margin squeeze that Marc was mentioning on the refining front. One interesting curiosity was that, looking back at the price increases that you guys granted in 2004/2005, what we usually saw was a situation where every time the average realization price in Brazil broke below Brent for one month or as much as three months in one specific case, the price increase would come. I just really wanted to understand, has anything in the policy of the company changed or are we just waiting and see like we did in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have no formula. So it does not fit to your conclusion. Our behavior does not fit to your formula conclusion. Really we do not have this with &#x2013; we are not guided by this kind of thinking or proceeding. As you mentioned, we follow long-term price. And at this moment, as I mentioned earlier, there is a higher possibility of having lower economic increase in the world, worldwide, mainly in the United States. This may reflect in lower demand for oil. Yes, it's true we are living at this moment with higher price since November/December. But there is a very, very high, very, very strong indication of recession and the first consequence will be lower demand and lower price. So we don't &#x2013; we are not convinced that is the moment to increase the price yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my last question, just a very quick one. When you're looking at the gas and power business, what we see at very least is a very, very poor performance from that unit that has continued. This quarter, in particular, I was surprised to see that the revenues actually fell on that one. I just wanted to have an idea from the management, now that you are putting so much money into pipelines and now that we are going ahead with Camarupim, Uruguay and all those gas or non-associated gas fields, how do you see this playing out over the course of next couple of years. Is this a unit that we should be considering as a negative EBITDA maker for a couple of years or is it ever going to be improving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are frankly improving. As you know, in January, we delivered 32 million cubic meters a day from domestic production and this is an increase of about 7 or more million cubic meter per day in the southeast of Brazil. And as you mentioned also Camarupim and other gas field or associated gas producers is going to come on-stream. We are finalizing a lot of new pipelines being able to deliver this gas through the right market and we are seeing the future as better than the past in this area. We hope in may be one year or so to start changing the situation we faced so far. I have a colleague from gas and energy here. If you want to add something else, please do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About one part of our loss in the period was due to penalties that we had because we don't have &#x2013; we lack about some logistics that we're investing on and some lack of supply of gas that it is reverting now. So another way to think about it also was the loss from the changing of the methodology of conceived price from ANP. So if you consider that, in fact, it reduces our loss in comparison with last year. And forecasting about gas and energy is a better <mark type="inaudible" /> We're now reverting some kind of loss that we had in the past. And like Petrobras has had, we think that we're going to about one year or two here max revert this loss in gas and power business unit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Barbassa, hi. Good morning. Two quick questions here. First one, I want to relate to the slide number two, in which you show the mature field decline. And I see here the percentage in terms of '06 to '07 is north of 10%. Now, in the past, Petrobras has guided us in terms of the decline of mature fields between 7 to 10%. And I was just wondering if you're speaking with that range of target or you think that something has changed in the last couple of &#x2013; two or three years that might consider revising this range upwards. And more of a qualitative answer on that issue is related to the production targets, that's something that's not new. It's something that happens with other companies worldwide. Companies are having difficulties in meeting their production targets. But from a qualitative perspective, would you be able to tell us whether that difficulty is really coming from the new production facilities, which are coming at a delay from its original schedule or it's something related to the difficulty in lifting the same or maintaining the same productivity on the mature fields or in other words improving the recoverable oil? And the second question is related to the Jubarte field. I understand &#x2013; and correct me if I'm wrong &#x2013; but the first pre-salt area on a commercial basis will come on-stream in say 30 or 45 days in the Jubarte area. It's going to be a small production, but I wanted to have again an analysis of whether that area, to what extent could you consider it as a proxy for the Santos Basin in terms of technological difficulties and, two, in terms of the economic feasibility of that area? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll have Molinari to answer these questions now. Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the decline in rate, we still consider 10% the average decline in rate of Petrobras for the coming years. <mark type="inaudible" /> we are connecting a pre-salt well, Espirito Santo <mark type="inaudible" /> to the P-34 platform in May. May is the soonest that we can do and we want to test this well, and we are using the same FPSO that is producing the other Jubarte wells and we'll collect more data on the speed &#x2013; in the pre-salt <mark type="inaudible" /> The pre-salt in this area <mark type="inaudible" /> is not as continuous as the Santos Basin. There are some fractures, so it's a little bit different. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But Molinari, do you think that the horizontal wells you are drilling in the Campos Basin to the Jubarte field could be considered as a proxy from an economic perspective in terms of cost per unit of well in the Santos Basin? Is it totally a different one? The fact that it's non-homogeneous, it's less deep, would you consider it as totally different or you could draw some conclusions from there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is different. Probably the pre-salt wells in the Santos Basin will be vertical wells rather than horizontal wells like we have in the Jubarte field. So we'll have increase in the CapEx, but in the other hand we have a huge volume of oil, so in terms of unit costs may be the same level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's interesting because &#x2013; I might be wrong &#x2013; but I thought that especially ultra deep-waters you improved your recovery factor by drilling horizontal wells, which might be different in this case because of the cost involved. But is there any particular reason why you would go for a vertical well rather than a horizontal one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, that's why we are going to make this extended wells test, but the reason is that in this pre-salt of the Santos Basin, the Santos rock is layered. We have carbonate and the <mark type="inaudible" /> okay, horizontally. So they <mark type="inaudible" /> in the vertical direction is not as high as in the horizontal direction. So a horizontal well may not help to produce more. Did you understand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we could take this more details offline. But so far it's great. And just going back to the first question, do you think that the difficulty the company has been having in terms of meeting its production targets is related to the mature fields, existing fields or rather the new production facilities, just on a qualitative basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the delay of new systems last year, P-52 and P-54 certainly was, I think, the biggest cause. But of course we have a decline rate of 10%. So we have to put one big system on-stream every year just to maintain the production, 180,000 barrels per day platform just to maintain flat production.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
