          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for waiting. We would like to welcome everyone to AmBev's 3Q '09 Results Conference Call. Today with us we have Mr. Jo&#xE3;o Castro Neves, CEO for AmBev, and Mr. Nelson Jamel, CFO and Investor Relations Officer. We would like to inform you that this event is being recorded and all participants will be in a listen-only mode during the Company's presentation. After AmBev's remarks are completed, there will be a question-and-answer session. At that time further instructions will be given. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the Safe Harbor of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1996. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of AmBev's management and on information currently available to the company. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions because they relate to future events, and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Vijay, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to discuss our third quarter 2009 results. Before I start, I would just like to remind that as usual, the percentage change discussed during this call are both organic and normalized in nature. Normalized figures exclude relevant items that are not recurring in nature. As normalized figures are non-GAAP measures, we disclose our consolidated net income, EPS, EBIT and EBITDA on a fully reported basis in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>As usual, I will start the call by sharing a brief overview of the quarter, and then Jo&#xE3;o will provide you with an overview of our results in Brazil, Hila-Ex, Quinsa and Canada. I will close by providing more specifics regarding the third quarter financials.</p>
          <p>Turning to the results, during the third quarter our consolidated EBITDA reached close to R$2.4 billion, which represent an 11% organic increase when compared to the third quarter of 2008. Year-to-date, our EBITDA has reached close to R$7.3 billion, an organic increase of 13.7% versus last year, while our margins expanded on 180 basis points to 44.7%.</p>
          <p>Our Brazil EBITDA increased by 12.6%, supported by a 9.5% of volume growth with our EBITDA margin in Brazil increasing 110 basis points to 48.8%, driven by good revenue and cost management, partially offset by sales tax increase, marketing investments to support our innovations and higher accrual for variable compensation in the period. Year-to-date, our Brazil EBITDA has increased 12.8% in organic terms and our EBITDA margin is 49.3%. Jo&#xE3;o will provide you with more details of the key drivers in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>In Hila-Ex, we delivered a positive EBITDA of R$12 million, compared to a loss of R$10.8 million in the third quarter of 2008, as a result of a gain arising from the sale of our real state property in the Dominican Republic. As good impact of this sale, Hila's EBITDA would remain negative at R$4.4 million, which is too less than half of our Q3 2008 loss.</p>
          <p>Our Quinsa operations have once again delivered strong results, with EBITDA growing 25% despite negative volume growth across the region in the periods. In Canada, volumes were flattish due to domestic decline and market share loss, partially offset by our sales of Labatt brand beer to the United States. Our EBITDA declined by 7.5% in organic terms, mainly due to sales and marketing investments, which had been postponed for the second quarter, as well as due to an asset disposal in 2008.</p>
          <p>Normalized net income totaled R$1.32 billion in the quarter, which was 5.6% higher than last year. Normalized earnings per share increased by 5.2% in the quarter. Year-to-date September our normalized net income is up 16.5% year-over-year, while our normalized EPS is up 16%. I will comment further on net income at the end of this call.</p>
          <p>I will now hand it over to Jo&#xE3;o to start to look a little deeper into the results of each of our operations. Jo&#xE3;o?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nelson, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Let me start by discussing briefly our consolidated performance. During the third quarter, our normalized consolidated EBITDA totaled 2.3 billion, an 11% organic increase, with our margins expanding by 70 basis points reaching 43.9. Industry performance across the markets remain unchanged from first half trends and consolidated volumes delivered solid growth driven by Brazil once again and were 4.7% higher in the third quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>We have once again been able to deliver on our goals of growing EBITDA and operating cash flow generation. Year-to-date, our EBITDA has totaled 7.3 billion, which represents an organic growth of 13.7 year-over-year while delivering a cash flow from operations totaling R$5.4 billion, a 30% increase versus 2008. These results have been driven by innovation and productivity, which I have said since the beginning of the year, would be our areas of focus in a very challenging year for the industry in several markets.</p>
          <p>Now talking specifically about Brazil. The positive macroeconomic environment continues to support the good performance of the industry and our focus on innovation has allowed us to deliver outstanding results in market share. Our normalized Brazil EBITDA increased organically by 12.6%, with markets expanding by 110 basis points despite higher accruals for variable compensation, once again negatively impacting our year-over-year quarterly growth.</p>
          <p>Excluding our incremental bonus provision, our Brazil cash SG&amp;A would have increased by 16.6 and 12% in the three and nine months period ending September respectively, while our Brazil EBITDA for the same period would have increased 16.7 and 16.5 respectively.</p>
          <p>Moving to Beer Brazil, real disposable income growth continues to positively impact industry volumes. At the same time, the success of our innovations allows us to outgrow the industry, and as a result deliver 12.3% beer volume growth in the period. As of September, our market share reached 70% for only the fourth time since the creation of AmBev in 1999 and the first time we achieved since 2003.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, our market share was 69.4, which is 218 basis points higher than last year. These market share gains have been delivered the right way, as our ability to understand and connect with our consumers together with our focus on innovation have allowed us to improve not only our market share, but more importantly every single brand health key performance indicator during this process. The consideration and preference of our brands are also in very good levels, which we believe is key to guarantee our profitability in the future.</p>
          <p>As we have stated in previous calls, our commitment, our commitment is to optimize profitability, while improving our market share. We're very pleased with the performance of our 2008 and 2009 innovations to-date, but more importantly we are working hard to find new ways of connecting with our consumers and continue to enhance our brands preference. As we are looking forward to the summer season, we expect our innovations to continue to play a key role in supporting our growth for both 2009 and 2010.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we launched Antarctica Sub Zero and rolled it out our 1-liter returnable glass bottle nationwide. Both innovations together with our 269-ml slim can, Brahma Fresh and Bohemia Oaken, and to a less extent our 300 returnable glass bottle continued to contribute positively to our result as of today. Our Beer net revenues per hectoliter in Brazil slightly declined by 0.1% when compared to last year. As we have mentioned in our previous conference calls, it is a result of tax increase at rates well above inflation and to a lesser extent our packaging mix. We have already started to implement our price increase for the summer, but it's still too early to say how competitors have or will react in relation to this increase.</p>
          <p>Now talking about our COGS. Brazil Beer continuous to deliver a good performance, giving benefits we have due to currency and commodity hedges, lower corn prices and our productivity initiatives in the period, which were partially offset by general inflation. In that sense, our cost of goods sold per hectoliter declined 1.2% in the quarter and 6.2% year-to-date. We continue to expect COGS per hectoliter performance for the second half of AmBev Brazil not as positive as in the first half due to phasing of our FX hedges.</p>
          <p>Beer SG&amp;A excluding depreciation and amortization grew by 27.3% in the period as a result of volume growth, general inflation, channel mix and higher accruals for variable compensation. Year-to-date, our cash SG&amp;A increased 20.6% versus last year. Normalized Beer EBITDA finished the quarter with growth of 12.8% versus last year, with EBITDA margin expanding seven basis points in the period. Year-to-date, margins are 90 basis points higher than last year with EBITDA growing double-digits at 10.7 in the period.</p>
          <p>Our soft drinks and NANC business in Brazil also performed well and delivered 2.2% volume growth in the period, despite very challenged comparables. Our market share in the quarter was 17.6% for the quarter, 20 basis points lower than last year, but year-to-date our market share is 30 basis points higher than 2008 at 17.9. Net revenues per hectoliter grew 2.7% organically in the period driven by selective price increases in certain regions, partly offset by higher tax and sales.</p>
          <p>COGS decreased organically once again minus 1.9% on a per hectoliter basis as a result of our currency rate hedges, lower PET prices year-over-year and productivity gains. We were partly offset by general inflation, higher sugar hedges in the period. As stated in our press call, we continue to see COGS per hectoliter for the second half of the year at a rate not as good as the first half due to phasing of our hedges, but without crushing gross margins.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A excluding depreciation and amortization increased 12.2% in the period as a result of general inflation, volume growth and higher accruals for variable compensation, partly offset by the timing of certain investment towards the summer. Our EBITDA continues delivering double-digit growth, increasing 11.6% and reaching 290.5 million in the quarter, with year-to-date organic growth reaching 23.8% and margin expansion of 540 basis points.</p>
          <p>Turning to Hila-Ex, despite challenging industry volumes in the region, we continued to show improvements in our gross profit, which increased by 52.9% in the quarter and is up 23.1% year-to-date. In the quarter, we posted a positive EBITDA of 12 million, which is a result of the one-off sale of a real estate property in Dominican Republic. Excluding this gain, our EBITDA in the region remains negative, but at a much better level than last year. Our team at Hila-Ex continues to make important progress towards our long-term goals in each country across the region.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to Quinsa and our operations in the South of Latin America. We are pleased &#x2013; very pleased with our outstanding performance in spite of the industry contraction observed throughout the region. We haven't been able to overcome the severe slowdown in the industry, in gaining market share and introducing specific actions to boost revenues and optimize our cost structure. Our volumes declined mainly in soft drinks, which were offset by higher margins achieved through trade spend, other revenue management initiatives and cost efficiencies.</p>
          <p>We achieved an EBITDA growth of 25% and a margin expansion of 370 basis points. Both for a quarter and year-to-date figures represent all-time records in terms of EBITDA and EBITDA margin. We expect tough scenarios throughout the region and prepared for them. This quarter our volumes were down 5.6%, with soft drinks operations suffering most of the industry contraction in Argentina. We have been able to keep higher market shares in the beer business through the support of our mainstream brands, the solid performance of the premium segment and focused execution in the point of connection.</p>
          <p>Net revenues per hectoliter grew organically both in beer and soft drinks as a result of price increase introduced in line with inflation and focused initiatives in terms of trade spend and revenue management. We aimed our efforts at capitalizing opportunities in the value chain, while forcing our premium brands performance. At the same time, we're supporting in reinforcing our mainstream brands to maintain customers' loyalty and avoid migration through value brands in times of economic downturn.</p>
          <p>Our efforts of reducing cost and expense were successful despite the negative impact of higher labor and transportation cost. We're benefiting from lower prices in some commodities, such as PET preforms, plastic caps and corn, effect of currency hedges and the continuous search for savings through ZBB. We are also in the process of capitalizing synergies in Bolivia and Paraguay through different acquisitions performed in the first quarter. Even though the recession within the region has hit our volumes in this quarter, our team proactively put in place the necessary actions to maximize our performance and results. The challenge is still difficult, but we remain confident on the strength of our team and brands.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Canada. The third quarter proved a tough competitive environment, characterized by a change in the pricing dynamic and continued industry softness. Overall, Canada posted an EBITDA decline of minus 7.5% versus last year, this result from a significant increase in brand investment and the cycling of a property sale in September 2008, which together account for 10.2% EBITDA decline.</p>
          <p>The third quarter was tough on market share with Labatt losing 50 basis points versus last year, driven by segment mix. The core segment where Labatt is strongest declined by roughly 4%, whereas the important domestic specialty segments posted a combined 10% gain. It is this exact  market trend that has got our actions in recent quarters. This year, we have launched Bud Light Lime into the important segment and Keith's Premium White into the domestic specialty segments in order to ensure we have the right weapons to win in this evolving market. To date, this has been among the most successful launches in Labatt history and have both been outperforming our initial expectations.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we have seen a worsening in the competitive landscape as competitors have focused more on volume and share than profitability, which has impacted our ability to accelerate value creation in the industry. Despite this, top lines continued to be a bright spot for Labatt, with net revenues per hectoliter increasing ahead of inflation for the seventh quarter in a row, at 3.7% versus last quarter. This performance was driven by selective price increases in certain regions and the successful launch of Bud Light Lime.</p>
          <p>Although the Canadian beer industry posted a volume decline of minus 0.5%, we're able to offset the domestic volume drop through export operation and posted a 0.3% gain in total volumes. COGS per hectoliter growth in the quarter was 7.4% versus last year. The increase is driven by higher aluminum and currency hedges versus last year, as well as our import mix as imported volumes have doubled in the quarter versus last year. We have been able to partly offset these costs through significant improvements in both energy usage and plant productivities as we strive to deliver again our Company's best better world commitments.</p>
          <p>Cash SG&amp;A increased by 5.8% in the quarter due to the timing of certain sales and marketing investments. We stabilized the supply of Bud Light Lime earlier in the quarter and launched major brand initiatives to ensure continued growth in consumer awareness in Trio, while also executing major events for our flagship brands Bud, Bud Light, Alexander Keith's and Stella. These initiatives are critical to the health of our brands and our ability to charge premium prices. We're pleased that these brands, which represent over 20% of the Canadian market, have steadily grown in brand health throughout 2009.</p>
          <p>Excluding the significant of one-time gain of the sale of a brewery in 2008, Labatt's year-to-date EBITDA is 5.4% versus last year as a result of our core strategy; focused investment in our key brands, disciplined revenue management, smart trade programs, and obsessive sales execution.</p>
          <p>Going back to the overall AmBev business, I wanted to wrap up by saying I'm very pleased with our performance for these first nine months. Our year-to-date normalized EBITDA continue to grow in double-digit at 13.7%. In a year we have taken a significant increase in taxes in Brazil and most countries have a faced volume decline versus last year.</p>
          <p>In the beginning of the year, we, as a team, prepared ourselves for what we anticipated to be a very challenging year and set two clear priorities to reach our goals of growing EBITDA and profitability, innovation and productivity, while maintaining the high levels of engagement in our teams. The quality of our people, together with their ownership culture and sense of urgency demonstrated by our teams across the countries we operate, were keys in delivering these results in all regions even with the challenging industry volume in countries other than Brazil.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, we took full advantage of a better than anticipated industry to invest even more than initially planned in our innovation and even anticipated some of the launches in the marketplace. This has helped us grow market share, and even more importantly, grow brand preference with all of our three main brands. Now our focus is to &#x2013; is on working hard to support our innovation initiatives as we prepare for the upcoming summer season.</p>
          <p>Looking into 2010, innovation and productivity remain two important areas of focus, together with production capacity increase in order to meet demand after much better than anticipated 2009. We want to replicate what we did in 2009 in saving non-working dollars to invest behind our brands, connect our consumers and win in the marketplace, all of this while growing our profitability. That is we work to accomplish next year.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to go to back to Nelson.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jo&#xE3;o. In this final session, I would like to guide you through the main lines between the normalized EBIT of R$2.065 billion and net income of R$1.261 billion as disclosed on page three of our release.</p>
          <p>Our net financial expense reached R$243 million in this quarter, which is slightly better than our Q3 2008 result. This explained by losses on derivatives and non-derivative instruments, which are offset by a lower net interest expense as a result of the retirement of certain debt which matured during the period and that was not renewed.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate in the period was 32.7% compared to 23.3% last year. The main reason for this increase in this quarter is the timing of certain tax adjustments recorded in the periods. Our year-to-date effective tax rate of 26% is a much better indicative of our full year results.</p>
          <p>Our cash generated from operations in the third quarter was R$1.1 billion, which is about 3.3% better than last year. Year-to-date, we have generated R$5.4 billion in cash from operations, a 30% increase versus last year. All of this, while growing our profitability and investing in our brands and innovations, as evidenced by our market share in brand health indicators in our key markets. Our net debt position decreased to R$3.9 billion at the end of September compared to 7.4 billion at the end of December, as we decided not to refinance debt given market conditions earlier this year.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we have been able to have a more clear view on the outlook for the second half of the year in Brazil and also paid our less significant maturity earlier July, both of which have allowed us to pick up our payout rate since then. We paid dividends and interest on capital around R$700 million in July and another R$1 billion on October 2, while also having just recently announced a new distribution of dividends and IOC of a total of R$1.3 billion to be paid beginning December 18.</p>
          <p>That said, our total payout for 2009 will amount to almost R$3.5 billion, which is about 10% higher than 2008 levels. As you look in 2010, we remain committed to improve our cash flow generation, while increasing the level for investment in capacity in Brazil by around 300 to R$500 million, as well as to proactively manage our capital structure.</p>
          <p>I will now hand back to the Operator and open up for questions. Please, Vijay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good day, everybody, and congratulations on the quarter. Jo&#xE3;o, I had a question, and it has to do really with the Brazilian business. I saw some of the news in the press with respect to the price increases and I was looking at your comments. And I was curious as to whether or not you think you have the levers to maybe offset the adverse impact from higher taxes and maybe additionally offset some of the impact on average price per hectoliter with some of the lower priced innovation, so you can not just get inflation in 2010, but maybe a little bit more than that. And then when you budget for some of the impact of innovation and this outstanding volume that you're posting in the current quarter, which seems to have quite a bit of momentum. Could you outline your CapEx investments for 2010 where and how much you plan to add next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bob. Well, if I understand correctly your question on the pricing, on the pricing front, the biggest impact on our net sales per hectoliter, as we just said in the opening speech, is more taxes, let's say, than the packaging mix. For 2009, I mean, when we made a bet on the innovation both on the liquid side and both on the packaging side that, of course, had an impact, as I just said, on the packaging mix. I think I would start saying that we continue to have the same strategy as moving price to consumer in line with the inflation, okay. And every time we can &#x2013; I mean, if we can pass it on some of the tax if we think is the right thing to do, we may do so.</p>
          <p>I think the difference that we have going forward from what we had in the past, now we have, let's say, we have the ability of having a pack price strategy as we do have in soft drinks. So by having different packages, we can probably play around more in terms of revenue management. That combined with a different sort of share level that I have now than I had in the beginning of the year, I think we start 2010 in a better shape to take advantage of those two things when we look at the price. And maybe potentially not have the same impact that we had in net sales per hectoliter in 2009 in 2010. It's very early to build a lot more a lot more on top of that because we have no idea what will be the behavior of the federal taxes for 2010.</p>
          <p>So if we have, let's say, less than what we had this year, this is automatically a benefit from us. If we have an average of inflation, this will also be beneficial for us because that's one-third of what was this year. And if it's zero, like it was let's say during four or five years, then it would be an important benefit, okay.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, I think also we have competitors. Now for next year we &#x2013; the pressure in 2009 was slightly different. I had much more important tax increase than my competitors had. And going on for next year, everybody will be pressured by the tax increase. And I think on top of that, the new SICOBE, or the new beverage control system, introduced by the government, has now clearly had an impact on the players that may be are not as serious or do evade some taxes from what we've seen. So I think also this pressure will also have a benefit from us. So the combination of the SICOBE, the potential of more tax increase, we have a pack price mix and the share levels that we adopted, that we got too given everything that's worked in our favor in Brazil, put us in a much better position for the beginning of 2010 than we were in 2009.</p>
          <p>And regarding cap &#x2013; yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one other thing on the pricing. Is there any indication right now that the states are preparing to use SICOBE for the enforcement of ICMS, because it seems to collect the detailed data that's necessary to ensure better enforcement of the bigger levy, which is ICMS, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We don't have any indication in that sense. What we have, Bob, and I can tell you that we are spending a lot of time on that given the importance tax has. We're meeting on a personal basis with governors and everything to show them. And I'm sure the IRS is also doing that, but we're showing them the positive impact that the SICOBE is having on an national level. We're at least doing our part to make sure that they know and that we are ready to work together with them as AmBev, as the industry also has &#x2013; as most of the important players, the ones that are serious, would be more than willing to work together with them because it helps beer as well as it helps soft drinks.</p>
          <p>What we have already heard from some states is that they will be more serious than ever and are also adopting system to try to make it very difficult. There's a lot of tax evasion possibilities when products go from one state to the next. They have been investing in technology that will be able to automate this evasion when people are crossing and trucks are crossing from one state to the next. So there is the willingness to invest, and we're going to push to make sure that people have that awareness and also we can &#x2013; we'll do as much as we can, but we don't really have any strong indication to say this state will go on January 1, 2010 with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, regarding capital, I think Nelson just mentioned the 300 to 500 million. We &#x2013; the way we see 2010, Bob. I mean, we started 2009 with a, let's say, very cautious outlook. I think we said we changed that to a more moderate or cautious optimistic outlook and we remain in that, but &#x2013; let's say in the upper side of the range. We see this good momentum of the industry, of the share, that combination of also our consumers having more income or disposable income given that they have income and the food inflation is not as important, and as well as the macro indicators in Brazil, we see &#x2013; and together with also the World Cup, we see a potential good 2010. And we are working very hard to be able also to supply this 12% growth that we saw in the third quarter. So we will not be doing our job if we don't prepare for at least a moderate growth in 2010. So I think the levels of CapEx that Nelson just mentioned, 300 to R$500 million, they will make us ready to the sort of growth that we can potentially count on for 2010.</p>

          <p>We cannot give you any specific guidance for 2010. What we can say is that the growth we're foreseeing, it's pretty even across the board. It's not just one region that is growing. So we have returnables and non-returnables growing. We have the South and the North growing. So the investments will be throughout the regions and throughout the different package that we are playing. So that's as much as I can give you, Bob, in terms of details. But what I can tell you is, it's very consistent across the boards in terms of regions and packaging.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the one liter launch. And we saw your revenue per hectoliter decline 2% in the quarter. Can you help us understand how important, sequentially, how important a factor the one liter launch is? It would be helpful to understand some parameters around the size of that relative to your mix, and also kind of what's the per ounce pricing versus the 600 ml please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Lore. This is Joao. Basically, what we said last quarter continues to be true in the third quarter, which believe we said somewhere between 60 to 80 or 75 to 85% of the decline is a combination, first in the beginning of the year was more of the federal taxes. And now we also had the usual delay that you see impacting more the second and the third quarter from the state taxes. So that, let's say, that at least those two-thirds of the impact that you're seeing is related to that, but you do have the one-third of the mix, which is not just a liter, okay, but of course the liter plays a key role.</p>
          <p>What I think we can say going forward is &#x2013; and it relates to in a way to the answer &#x2013; to the question and answer that Bob asked and I answered, is that now we have a much better "portfolio to play with as I move on." Okay, of course, there is still annualization of the things that we are doing, but I think the challenge &#x2013; but at the same the opportunity we have going on for 2010. You have seen how the different SKUs that we have in soft drinks, both us and Coke, allow us to play different prices per pack. So I think 2010 will be the first time we'll have a chance of working in different manners with the different packages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When you say that you enter 2010 with a much stronger competitive position, which is obviously the case with the market share gains, should we read into that statement that it would be acceptable to think about having some of that market share decline during the course of 2010 from the current levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lore, I mean, you've seen in the very many last years &#x2013; I mean I think every year since the AmBev creation and every year since you saw, you have been following us, we always &#x2013; I mean, we have been consistent at least in the past eight or nine years to move price during the summer. And two things happen. Once you have that delay in which competitors follow you, I mean, we have had times where competitors took three, four, five months delay. Sometimes because they were helped by the cost of goods sold, sometimes because they were not as much pressured by the tax collectors, and also because there's a shift from channel mix towards the supermarkets where we have a slightly lower market share. That combination is still there. I don't think competitors will follow us necessarily as quickly as last year. I think last year was probably one of the years where they followed us in a very short period of time because they were really pressured by the higher dollar. But all in all, they also are pressured by tax collectors.</p>
          <p>So I'm probably guessing that we will be between last year and between the average of the last few years, which means that we'll lose some share. I mean, it's expectable that we will lose some share. I think the difference from the past, we have a little bit more room to maneuver given the higher market share that we have and given that we have different packaging mix, but as well a different brand extensions in different areas of Brazil. So you should expect the market share loss, but at least we're better prepared in terms of liquid and packaging, as well as at the higher base.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. Thanks. I just wanted to start off with one quick detail. Could you just give us the Canadian domestic beer volume number to the degree that it was down? And I guess just kind of the first question is on Brazil Beer. You've mentioned this idea of channel shift to the supermarkets. We've been seeing, obviously, this in beer markets around the world, and it's obviously this channel growing faster than the on-premise. I know you, Jo&#xE3;o, have discussed this in front of Abras and some of these other big associations. And it seems like the beer category is losing some shelf space in the supermarkets in Brazil, I guess which are almost about 30% of the sales. But I mean, what kinds of &#x2013; I mean, how strong is this shelf space or the category loss within this point-of-sale that you've seen this year, and to the extent that you can check it, the initiatives that perhaps you're putting in place and thinking about? And it would be great to see if that in the end is that something that you can finance in other parts of the business. Or do we see the stepped up cash SG&amp;A kind of continue at these levels? And on that cash SG&amp;A item, just wanted to clarify, you said ex the variable compensation, that it was &#x2013; the Brazil Beer cash SG&amp;A was up 16 in the third quarter and 12% year-to-date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Alex. Thank you. I'll tackle the supermarket portion, and then I'll ask Nelson to help me with the SG&amp;A details, and he will give you the Canada industry number. We talked a little bit about this last quarter, Alex. Let me give you a few facts to try to put a little bit more color on that issue. I think first, that there are different trends actually going on in supermarkets. When we look at supermarkets, we actually &#x2013; at least we will split those in three buckets. The very small supermarkets, one to four check-outs; five to 19 check-outs; and 20 plus, just to give you a better sense on one way to look at this.</p>
          <p>The one to four checkouts, actually it's usually where we have slightly higher margin when we look at the channel. It's actually growing at a faster pace than the 20 plus, with a very big, big wholesaler "supermarkets" are actually declining in Brazil. One of the reasons is that people are going to supermarkets three to four times a week to do their shopping, okay. They're looking for convenience as &#x2013; in terms of a trend because they're not as &#x2013; of course, money is still very important. But they can go to the supermarkets nearby instead of maybe going 20 miles and there's also the car situation to go for that extra dime. So that's a one trend that's going on.</p>
          <p>It's true that when you look at total off-premise to total on-premise, you probably move &#x2013; although it's not a fast pace, I'm talking about 0.5 percentage points maybe in the last two, three years. So maybe if it was a 10% five years ago, it would be at 13 now to give you a &#x2013; to give an idea. One good thing is that we are the number one supplier to those guys in beer and have a very good a very good relationship. There is always the threat that the category could be losing space. You're right, there could be a threat. Our job as the leader and we have been doing that is making that shop experience a much better one either to gain space ourselves or to stop potential threats from other beverages or other consumer goods that could be trying to tackle that.</p>
          <p>I think one example that we've used in the past, the ones who have visited Argentina, there was a big task, a big challenge we had was to grow the beer category against the wine category, then in Argentina was very strong and we did that by making the beer shopping experience a much better one. We've been copying this a lot and implementing this in Brazil. We already have done many stores and we'll probably do much more also for next year. So AmBev and the industry I think is moving, it's playing its role to actually not just maintain by actually trying to increase categories that actually is very important to them. It is profitable and generates traffic to those guys. And if it was not the case, they will not be gaining that 0.5 percentage points against the own trades that slow shift I would say compared to other place.</p>
          <p>So think it's manageable what we think &#x2013; what we not just think we have to do, but we actually are doing is not just protecting the space, but actually trying to grow that space, working the relationship, working the occasion. Those are very important points of sale before holidays, so we've been activating those channels during holidays a lot and we've had a lot of holidays and still have few in front of us. It will be very important during the World Cup. So I think also we've been learning a lot and also by traveling, by being in other countries, I think we're taking full benefit and becoming a much better operator in that channel. Now I'll pass on to Nelson to give you more detail on the SG&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so hi, Alex. Just starting first with the data on Canada. Our domestic volume in Canada, we had a decline of 0.5%, but a total volume including exports we had a small growth, 0.3% growth in the total volume then excluding &#x2013; including the exports. So minus 0.5 domestic and plus 0.3% in total. Regarding SG&amp;A in Brazil, what we said is when you look at our, for instance, our year-to-date growth of our cash SG&amp;A, is 19.5% in Brazil. But when you exclude the impact of the accrual for variable compensation, because we didn't have it in Brazil last year, so that's why that has comp, the growth by excluding this goes down from 19.5 to 12% so on. For the nine months actually had so far the 12% growth excluding variable compensation impact.</p>
          <p>For instance, I have an idea. If you think of that older equation or algorithm that we use to mention for our SG&amp;A evolution, which is pretty much inflation plus roughly 30% of the volume growth and then one to two percentage points depending on the evolution of the direct distribution and the channel mix. Again, if you apply the algorithm, you should find self between 10 and 11% as a theoretical growth one could expect just by following the algorithm given inflation in this period, the growth we had and then again the increase in direct distribution and the channel mix impact.</p>
          <p>Now, we are slightly above that, we're at 12 versus 10 to 11 that I mentioned. In this, let's say, extra points or so has to do with the investments we're doing to support the innovation rollout and all the new initiatives that we have this year, which are paying off with the extra volume, extra share, extra profit we take out of it. So again the 12% growth excluding the bonus impact is something that is slightly above the algorithm that we have as a reference. And as we stated many times, I think this year clearly we're not being bound by any type of equation or algorithm in the sense that we will and we are pursuing and flow &#x2013; given, I mean, flow to all the great ideas that we have that can increase our overall profitability. So that while we see and there is this &#x2013; there is incremental investment that, of course, is paying off given the top line evolution.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, or actually good afternoon. I just have a tactical question with respect to the one liter, following up a little bit on some of the discussions from before, both in this call and I think on the InBev call. Did I understand correctly that the goal as always is to raise the portfolio revenue per hectoliter roughly in line with inflation? But it sounded like the one liter having been rolled out so successfully and given the strength of wage gains and so forth, that there might be room to narrow the gap between the one liter on a per ounce basis and the overall portfolio such that the increase you might see in the one liter would be above inflation and that might be the bulk of the increase that we see. Is that the right way to think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Celso. I think the question is slightly tactical, but also strategically, in a sense there is a long-term view on this. I think the long-term view and when we look at the SG&amp;A and when we look at the net sales per hectoliter, I think we had the franchise a little bit under pressure. I mean, we're losing share for two years in a row and we thought we have a chance to play on the attack. I mean, it was a crisis year, difficult year. We wanted to make out of this crisis year an opportunity and we wanted to move &#x2013; we said if we saw opportunities to move really fast, we would do so. So, an example, we started by launching Antarctica Sub Zero in S&#xE3;o Paulo, we saw good results. We took it to Minas. We now took into Santa Catarina. So we'll be moving fast instead of waiting, six months, 12 months a budgeting cycle to do things, we're doing things faster, ready to be on the attack when we find a good idea, the same thing for the liter.</p>
          <p>I mean, the introduction of liter was probably planned to be done in two years, three years, and we saw good opportunity to go ahead and be nationwide, almost nationwide as we have done the changes in the plant as quickly as we could to be again nationwide because we saw there was an opportunity. There was a demand from consumers stronger than what we had anticipated, potentially because this is a crisis year and value propositions may be more important in a difficult year, maybe they will be in the next year. I think that's one point. So that's, let's say, the strategic portion of having things to allow you to be at a different strategic position that we think we are, doing at a faster pace which I think we're traditionally trying to do, and then practically which I've have tried to say today and I think you probably heard something similar to that in the InBev call. I think what people are referring to is the same thing that I'm saying when they have a pack price option.</p>
          <p>So let's say I have the liter at X percent discount, let's say it's a 30% discount because the package by itself is a discount, or could be. And if it's not at certain discount, there is no value proposition. You're just selling more for the same price, this is more for less. The more for less could be 25, could be 30, could be 35. We have had this advantage so far this year until let's say mid third quarter to be alone. In the &#x2013; during the third quarter, our competitors have started to sell the liter, so there is the liter introduction by the competitor, which show that the industry is able to have their own bottle, so there's already 200 bottles out there, different from ours. What we're seeing is that now I have the ability to have an umbrella. I can move away, let's say, from a 30% discount on the liter against our own brands to 25, to a 20, to a 15, we will do that for learning with the consumers just to have a value proposition and at the same time looking what competitors are doing. This will be a dynamic tactic if you want.</p>
          <p>So today I'm pretty much alone, although there is some introduction. We're still somewhat alone because they're starting. There is a learning curve. We have had the liter for more than a year now and there was a learning curve for us also finding the right price point. Now I have the ability, so I'm in a good position to find this new level. So there is no exact new level, but what we have to remember is there is no value proposition that it is the same thing as buying 600. So we think there is different occasions like barbecue, like parties in the weekends, there are different occasions in which the one liter it is a good proposition and is actually approaching our consumers through our brands and helping the preference of our brands together with a much better marketing mix and the enhancement of our marketing investments to put them in better shape, not just in the share which is great but also in higher preference.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. Just to clarify, the competitors that have launched the one liter, do they also have a gap on the order roughly of 30% with their own comparable 600 ml or was the gap narrower in their case providing --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, right now it's &#x2013; right now, again, I think it's very early, so soon. I mean, they've been out there for a couple of weeks, but they have not come at &#x2013; I mean, I didn't say we were at 30. I was giving example of the 30, but it's a reference. But when we started, we start at a lower, then we increase as we said at a point in time here. They're probably starting where we started when we started the launch. So I think they're still finding their price point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But they're not at that discount level that I just mentioned. Also because, I mean, little tougher because they're already at a discount, at a important discount. If they come with a very high discount, I mean, we'll see whether the pressure of the tax and this and that, so I think that's something to watch and to learn in the next few months and quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, very helpful. And just if I could follow-up on Canada. Bud Light Lime, I think you referenced earlier that there was some supply constraints at some point. Do you have a sense for maybe since then how much &#x2013; it sounded like those constraints have been addressed since then. But if they haven't or even if they have, how much of that cost in the initial launch, meaning was there a lot more demand than you were able to meet or it was just a marginal issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I think it was an important issue in the launch for sure. It was an important issue for probably a couple of months. Now, it's okay. We don't have. So the &#x2013; I think the initial impact to mention here at the point in time was, the supply issue as well as the higher marketing expenditure when you launch any product as we do here as they do there, but things have now stabilized and stabilized at very good levels in terms of rate of sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would you say the opportunity for Bud Light Lime in Canada is now more of a coverage issue or is it more of a sell-through as in <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I think it's early stages, Celso. It's like if we compare to Brazil the liter Antarctica Sub Zero, I think the first 12 months of a brand are the time period for you to give an idea to really have an idea where it will stabilize. It's true that the concept is closer to more of a summer season than the winter season, so we'll probably see a little bit of a shift during the winter season, and then we will start the warmer season next year and we'll see how it will continue to perform. And then through the cycle the full 12 months I think we will be too early to say that it has reached a plateau.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter, everyone. My question has to do with the net debt to EBITDA. If I'm reading correctly, I think that this is the lowest level net debt to EBITDA that AmBev has had since it was created 10 years ago. How should we think about that indicator going into 2010 and what will be the criteria for using the excess cash that you're generating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, hi, Alan. This is Nelson here. Indeed the net debt to EBITDA ratio that we have right now is one of the lowest, probably the lowest we ever had, I think similar to what we had in Q2 and that's when we compare to the historical ratio that was much less 0.8 or between 0.8 and one. Since beginning of this year we have been facing this &#x2013; we like to see internally this kind of a good problem in the sense that the amount of cash you're generating is &#x2013; is even up &#x2013; was especially when compared to what we had as an estimate for beginning of the year in this, but generating much more cash. Right now, for instance, have 30% higher operational cash flow than what we had last year.</p>
          <p>So this extra cash &#x2013; I mean, that's why we have picked up after the debt retirement that we had so far, especially in the first semester, that's why we picked up the payout lag or the payout rate, and with everything we announced and plan to pay until the end of this year we should be somewhere around R$3.5 billion for 2009. And we as many have being and we will continue to constantly monitor our capital structure bringing our recommendation to the Board, which are generally accepted. We forgot to the best way to manage this capital structure moving on.</p>
          <p>The outlook for 2010, I think is still &#x2013; well, first of all, it still dependent on the performance in overall financial environment for next year and at this point we think it's too early to give any guidance on 2010 payout levels, because we are even concluding our budgeting process. And again if you want me to give any specific guidance on that or you can always assume &#x2013; I'll repeat that just &#x2013; I mean, probably already know that, but you can also assume that you continue to maximize and pay the maximal IOC possible as a primary way of payout given its fiscal benefit and that extra dividend is likely to be required to meet the minimum dividend payout defined in our bylaws, which is 35% of our net profit in the period.</p>
          <p>So, again, probably when you run your model you have on net profit forecast on next year, definitely we will &#x2013; certainly I have to complement the IOC with extraordinary dividends to match the minimum dividend required. Any additional use of cash again depends on the number in my head for next year. Again, it will be decided by the Board in due course. I mean, like you saw in 2009, we have been assessed in the different alternatives, like we have always done, and it's the same way this year. We were able to allocate the cash according to the need, the way you saw. For next year we have some additional capacity needs, so we should be investing 300 to R$500 million more than what we invested this year in Brazil. So the number for Brazil this year should be around R$1 billion, next year should be between 1.3 and 1.5. And the other &#x2013; I mean, theoretically speaking, right, the other alternatives are always the retirement of inefficient debt, which was the case this year. Many projects in the hand, could always take part of it and, of course, additional payout. So in other words, there is no change in our policy. But at this stage I'm not giving any guidance on the 2010 payout levels, since we believe it's too early.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's useful. If I may ask a question regarding the operations and regarding Canada. I mean, if I heard correctly, you saw almost double digit volume growth on the Bud Light family in Canada during the quarter. Could you remind us &#x2013; could you tell us what percentage of your sales right now in Canada are coming from the Bud Light family and what would be the vision or the plan in terms of taking that family of brands as a percentage of your total sales into your Canadian operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. What we mentioned is that the total import volumes, so it's not only Bud Light Lime. It's also Stella, but Bud Light Lime is the one that is really boosting &#x2013; leading the volume evolution there. To-date it's double of what we had one year ago, so out of our total volume 12% is imported and then, of course, 88 is the remaining in the domestic market, due to the 6% of our volumes in Canada last quarter last year, for instance, 6% was the waste of the imported volume, now it's 12%. As Jo&#xE3;o mentioned, I think the brand is pretty much new in the market. We have &#x2013; it's over delivering our expectations since the beginning and we have, I mean, still I would say a couple of months ahead &#x2013; at least two quarters ahead of us so we can have a better view on the full potential of the brand. And again this is not the stuff that we steer to the limited, it is managed by consumers. I mean, that's the evolution we see in the different &#x2013; of the different segments in Canada. We see the import segment and the specialty beer segment growing, outpacing the core segment and that's why this is so important for us.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jose Yordan from Deutsche Bank Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning. My question is on the hedge. I mean, I guess we're entering a period here where your FX hedges are going to be at a significantly higher real, but on the other hand grain and other commodities prices at this time last year had also collapsed. And I guess what I was looking for is, if you can give us a sense of which one of those two opposing effects actually wins here. I mean, what's going to be the direction of COGS per hectoliter just directionally over the next couple of quarters for the entire operation, but any sense on that would be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, hi, Jose, it's Nelson here. Well, we're not giving, of course, specific guidance or specific numbers, but in terms of the trends and the directions that you were talking about, I think we have to split, let's say, Q4 and 2010. For Q4, we should have different than what we hedged so far, which was pretty much I mean negative COGS per hectoliter we saw going down in 2009 versus 2008 for many quarters. In Q4, it's going to be less favorable. So we're going to start facing some tough comps in terms of hedge. You can imagine, I mean, our policy of rolling &#x2013; of hedging on the rolling month base. So the Q4 2009 number was pretty much fixed in Q4 2008, while we saw in the market an important appreciation of the dollar in Brazil. So that's why we are going to probably face the toughest, let's say, COGS per hectoliter still going to be great for &#x2013; still going to have marginal expansion, so that's going to put pressure on our margins this year, but for sure COGS per hectoliter is going to be less a positive news in comparison to previous quarter.</p>
          <p>As we look into 2010 we have pretty much locked our currency exposure at this stage at an average rate of 199, which if you compare to 188 that we had hedged in 2009 is going to imply an increase slightly below 5%, so we can even say that's going to be around inflation or inflation in Brazil, that's the type of pressure we're going to have in this dollar denominated part. In commodities, as you said, we're going to face some positive impact or some positive comps in the sense that we didn't fully capture the downturns of the commodity this year, again, because of the policy we have. So all commodities should give benefit for next year, but sugar, sugar is the one that's going to be a tough comp for this year. But net-net impact of, let's say, higher or negative impact of the dollar, net of the upside, net upside we're going have in commodities, there will be an increase in our COGS for next year, which if you think of our long-term goal of having COGS per hectoliter growing at or below inflation, we are in good shape to get there in the sense that we will not only look into this commodities or currency exposure, but also continue to pursue higher productivity and higher efficiency. But, of course, COGS per hectoliter is not going to be as positive in 2010 like to us in 2009.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Lauren Torres from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, everyone. I just wanted to go back and talk a bit more about your performance with respect to your volume growth in the quarter. If there is any way of kind of breaking down that 12% growth with respect to initiatives that you've been taking with respect to new products and pricing and packages versus just the help of the consumer environment. And maybe I'm just reading into something here, but in your press release you noted that the industry has yet to show signs of deceleration versus last year. I don't think this is showing any change in your outlook with respect to the consumer environment. But has anything changed or has any of this momentum slowed in your mind or are we still kind of status quo with what we've seen these last couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Lauren, this is Jo&#xE3;o. As a bottom point, I would say that it &#x2013; I mean, as you said is a combination. If you look at the Nielsen numbers, there is always a difference between what Nielsen reads as an estimation, doesn't cover the whole country, and the actual industry performance. Though have the Nielsen exactly right in front of me, it's around four and 5% year-to-date. I know I'm not 4.5 or point six, but between four and five. Some people pointed this morning, I don't know where it came from, people are saying nine. I think when you do the &#x2013; when you take the &#x2013; if you take the share gain in the four and five, the math doesn't work. So the math would probably work with the nine, so I believe the market, the industry is growing between 4.5 and nine. We don't have an exact number because Nielsen gives us a 4.5; we have the share, that doesn't totally works. So it's somewhere in there, so still very strong, whether it's a five, or a six, or seven.</p>
          <p>And then we have a big impact, or even it's a eight, okay, we have a big impact from the share. Within the share there's really many things working there. We said at a point in time, it was in the press that Antarctica Sub Zero, for example, had achieved a 1.1 share. You can say is there cannibalization or not, that is a difficult math to say how much was the cannibalization with, for example, Antarctica. But I would say that the 269-ml can helped us, Antarctica Sub Zero helped us, Brahma Fresh helped us, the liter helped us, and still some of the things that we have last year as the 18-pack, the 24-pack, and so is the 300 returnable glass bottle, that combination really gave to us the difference.</p>
          <p>So it's really the two liquids, the two new liquids, Brahma Fresh and Antarctica Sub Zero, of course, to a much lesser extent Bohemia Oaken, because a very super premium. And then all the new packages, especially the 269 and the one liter bottle. And also the industry, not just us, but we and the industry also have more, 473 cans out in the marketplace. So that's not an introduction, but the amount of availability that's in the marketplace has also increased. That whole combination and our participation in those presentations explain the bulk, but not all, of our market share because we also did a lot of work in productivity, sales productivity, which refers a lot to distribution that has also helped us on the share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's fair to say that maybe at least half of that growth that you achieved in the quarter was more just industry-related rather than initiatives, once again the environment still being quite healthy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I think through this morning you threw out to the press that growth next year and looking at domestic volumes up five to 10%, is that something you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, it's &#x2013; what we said, it was about the 300 to 500 million more. And then there was a question whether this 300 to 500 more, which we will confirm in the next few months as we're finishing the budgeting process and we will finish our analysis of the macroeconomic indicators. What was said is, if you do increase the 300 to 500, how much more volume could you be selling more than this year? So if we invest between 300 and 500 more, we could be selling between five and 10% more, not that we expect...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Five to 10%. This is slightly a different, but it always makes a difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there's a difference, okay. And if I could ask just lastly, we talked about Brazil and Canada to some extent. If you could just talk about your other markets, we're seeing still volume declines there. Any hint of those markets stabilizing a bit or trends are just still as poor as we've seen over the last couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I think it is still very difficult to market. I mean, most of them are still very difficult. In a way, what we're seeing is that we outsize in most places financial markets crashing and coming back much sooner, and then real life coming down slow and with a slow recovery. So the view today &#x2013; again, not the guidance, but the view today is that it will pickup starting sometime next year, but I think the difference potentially from other times is that there's a slow recovery. So right now we probably will &#x2013; we are probably back in some sort of a slow recovery sometime next year, very difficult to say whether the slow recovery will start in the first quarter, second quarter. I think we're still in the mid of a downturn in most markets in Latin America, at least with exception of Brazil, with the slow recovery coming back at some point next year, not this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And no new update with respect to breakeven at Hila-Ex?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just to finish on this. What I think what was important, at least, for example, for Latin America and South, the fact that the team there but none of the team really prepared for the situation, although we have the decline, means result is still very good and very consistent, so we're prepared for that. And I think in Hila-Ex, the thing about the breakeven is direction. The fact that we had almost breakeven this quarter at minus four, especially when you compare to minus a lot next year, I think it's a good improvement. But I think more importantly than that, I think what &#x2013; when we look at this definition, I'd like to do that and we'll get there at a point in time. But I think most important is the role of which country we operate. I think there are countries there that we still can play the M&amp;A game. So if I want to play the M&amp;A game, it's about really pressuring my competitor. So if I &#x2013; to pressure my competitor, have a zero cash flow, it's a different &#x2013; it's a difficult game. So I'd rather have some flexibility in the markets where I think I have an M&amp;A possibility, and then maybe not as much in other markets. So I think what we have done is we did the right thing and we're focusing different strategies for different countries. And also we &#x2013; once again as we've done every year, with sizing, right sizing, ZBB, I think we were able to find the right scale for most of the countries. In some countries you'll save those dollars and you take directly to the bottom line, and in some countries you take those savings and you put back in the marketplace to work toward share gains.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking the follow-up. I just want to ask a little bit more about the environment in Canada. From the comments that your main competitor has made, it sounds like the industry pressure is coming from some of the smaller players and that there is a chance the bigger players are going to get sort of pulled into that. Can you comment on whether that's not your way to think about what's happening and whether that implies a more difficult environment into the fourth quarter of the year, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Lore, thanks for the follow-up question. It's a point that we think is important to go over. I think it's partially correct what you said, Lore. I think the portion that it partially correct is, of course, I mean the &#x2013; together Labatt and Molson probably represent 85% of the market. So, of course, there is pressure from this other 15%, that's the part that is correct. But I don't think necessarily the pressure is really coming from that. I think we have been trying to put some price increase in the last few months in the marketplace. And we're really not seeing the market &#x2013; not just the small players, but we're not seeing the market solid up, so we put it, we stay sometime and we come back. I mean, you've seen us do that also in Brazil. We put a price and then if it doesn't work we come back sometime this and that and can sometimes, but that's what's going on in Canada. We're putting price in the marketplace, competitors are not really following, going more for the volume and share, as we said in the speech. We're going for share and profitability. As long as &#x2013; if we see the market is moving, we will be different, but &#x2013; so I think the market &#x2013; the pressure, this price pressure is really coming from the market and not just the small brewers.</p>

          <p>Molson also talked about a lot of volume weakness into the fourth quarter, I guess, based on weather. Is that something do you think the industry is seeing and is that just a temporary phenomenon?</p>
