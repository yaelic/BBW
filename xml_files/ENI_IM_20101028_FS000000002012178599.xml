          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Eni's Third Quarter 2010 Conference Call hosted by Alessandro Bernini, Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>For the duration of the call, you will be on listening-only mode. However, at the end of the call you will have the opportunity to ask questions. I'm now handing over you to your host to begin today's conference. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our Third Quarter Results Presentation. Here with me today are Claudio Descalzi and Domenico Dispenza. We will give you a brief overview of our third quarter results and then we will be happy to answer your questions at the end of the presentation.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter of 2010 the macro environment showed a positive trend compared to the same period of last year. The Brent price averaging $77 a barrel, up 13% compared to the third quarter of 2009. The average European refining margins Brent/Ural was $2.44 per barrel, up slightly versus the corresponding period of 2009 although it remained depressed compared to historical trends and at nearly half the level compared to the second quarter of 2010. Finally, the euro depreciated by almost 10% versus the U.S. dollar compared to the corresponding period of last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to our results, adjusted operating profit in the third quarter amounted to &#x20AC;4.1 billion up 32% year-on-year. These results mainly reflected the stronger contribution of the Exploration &amp; Production, and Refining &amp; Marketing divisions, which was partially offset by lower result in Gas &amp; Power.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net profit for the third quarter was &#x20AC;1.7 billion, up 47.5% year-on-year. These results reflected improved operating performance and were supported by a lower adjusted tax rate, down by five percentage point in the third quarter. The low tax rate registered in the quarter was primarily due to the utilization of previously taxed provisions and the positive contribution to this quarter pre-tax profit of foreign hedging derivatives which benefit from a lower tax rate. The guidance for the adjusted tax rate for the full year '10 is now around 55%.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter of 2010, Eni reported oil and natural gas production of 1,705,000 BOE per day.  Production was largely unchanged from a year ago, when excluding the effect of the updated gas conversion rate.</p>
          <p>Our performance was positively impacted by organic growth achieved in Nigeria, Congo and Italy, held by 92,000 BOE per day of new production from startups and ramp-up of fields which have started from Q4 '09. This increases were offset by planned facility shutdowns in Kazakhstan, mature field declines and lower gas uplift in Libya, down 8,000 BOE per day year-on-year, due to oversupply conditions in the European gas market.</p>
          <p>Third quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;3.3 billion, up 35% compared to the third quarter of 2009. This was mainly the result of higher oil and gas realization in dollars and of the positive impact of the depreciation of the euro over the dollar.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, persistent gas oversupply in Europe and continuing competitive pressures particularly in Italy, continued to affect our performance in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The overall gas volumes sold including both consolidated and associated companies totaled 17.4 billion cubic meters, a decrease of around 17.5% year-on-year. Adjusted operating profit decreased by 38% compared to the same period of 2009. Such a result doesn't include &#x20AC;47 million of gains from derivatives recorded in previous quarters but which could be associated with the sales of gas and deliveries that occurred in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA pro forma <mark type="inaudible" /> includes those derivatives in the reporting period of the relevant effect. Gas &amp; Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the third quarter of 2010 was &#x20AC;675 million compared to &#x20AC;703 million in the third quarter of '09. Adjusted pro forma EBITDA in the marketing business showed a decline with mounting competitive pressure resulting in lower volumes and margins.</p>
          <p>Electricity margins also declined in the quarter. These negative factors were partially compensated by the renegotiation of certain long-term supply contracts, as well as portfolio optimization. The regulated businesses generated &#x20AC;368 million, up 9% versus the corresponding period of last year. The increase mainly reflects the recognition of new investments in tariffs as well as remuneration of fuel gas cost, the higher volumes transported and the synergies achieved from the integration of Ital Diverse Dodge..</p>
          <p>Finally, International Transportation results showed a 16% increase as a result of the return to full capacity of the TMPC pipeline which had been damaged in an accident in December '08, as well as the better performance of TAG related to the auctions of new capacity, partially offset by the accident occurred at Transitgas in July.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Refining &amp; Marketing, utilization rates increased by 6 percentage point year-on-year as a result of lower maintenance activity and improved margins, in particular in lubricants.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter of '10, the division reported an adjusted operating profit of &#x20AC;14 million. This was predominantly achieved thanks to the marketing activities which saw higher volume sales on European network and a less severe rating environment compared to the previous year. These results were delivered despite declining retail sales in Italy, lower <mark type="inaudible" /> consumption and strong competition.</p>
          <p>The improved results also reflected better performance from the refining business which was boosted by cost efficiencies, optimization of supply activities and integration efforts among the domestic refinery units. And its margins also benefited from a slight reopening of the light-heavy crude differentials in the Mediterranean area.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter of 2010, results in Petrochemical business continue the recovery showed in the last quarters reporting an adjusted operating profit of &#x20AC;31 million, driven by stronger volume sold and higher cracker margins realized by the olefine products. This item delivered adjusted operating profit of &#x20AC;316 million, up 18% versus Q3 '09 mainly due to increased activity in the onshore and drilling segments. Other activities and Corporate shows an aggregate loss of &#x20AC;93 million versus a loss of &#x20AC;146 million in the third quarter of '09.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations was &#x20AC;11.6 billion in the first nine months of 2010.  Proceeds from divestments amounted to &#x20AC;900 million including non-strategic upstream assets, the sales of 51% interest in Sale Energia and 25% stake in the Greenstream pipeline. The cash inflows were used to partially fund cash outflows related to capital expenditure of &#x20AC;10 billion and the dividends payments of &#x20AC;4 billion which included the payment of the interim dividend of 2010.</p>
          <p>Net financial debt as at the end of September amounted to &#x20AC;25.3 billion.  In addition to the increase in net debt, group leverage at September 30 was also impacted by the swift appreciation of the euro versus the U.S. dollar during the third quarter. This reduced net equity by around &#x20AC;3.4 billion compared to June 30, and caused the net debt to equity ratio of rise to 0.47 versus 0.41 at the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Assuming the current US dollar/euro exchange rate to year end management forecasted that the ratio of net borrowings to total, the leverage at year end will be at the same level as at 2009 year end supported by measures to optimize working capital. Thank you for your attention.</p>
          <p>And now together with Claudio Descalzi and Domenico Dispenza, I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question comes from Mr. James Hubbard from Morgan Stanley. Mr. Hubbard, please proceed with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Just two questions. The first one gas, you mentioned on your last conference call that you were seeking to renegotiate gas supply agreements with the Libyans, and I think I saw something in the press about that has progressed, have seen some softening in terms there. Could you update us to the extent you can on what's going on with those negotiations, where you are at the moment and how that impacts the talk of Gas &amp; Power EBIT guidance then to come down a little bit which I think was also on the last conference call?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, could you just update us on what you expect to happen in 2011 as regards unbundling of the gas value chain in Italy or not, what the regulators INU or Tralianar what you think they're planning to do in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's true that, <mark type="inaudible" /> This is not only true for Eni, but for many other companies to this difference between the longer term on <mark type="inaudible" /> of the market that were the traffic hubs, we had a meeting in market. And negotiation we lead has been going for that while. We are now at the final stage of those negotiation. I think that signature should arrive in next days. I think it was agreement, a good agreement in terms of that the interest of all the different partners in terms of maintaining production, has been retained and as a result the price of gas would be more in line with the reality of the market of the gas today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as this second question, you raise this concern that there no major changes compared to that position we have already expressed during our last conference call, which means that of course we are expecting the implementation within March, 2011 on Italian Parliament, they told us directive which allows for three option regarding the Italy's gas pipeline system. Then after having approved the third gas directive the Italian government will need to approve a decree determining how we will use disposes namata gas in case one of the option will be identified.  And then finally the government would have to find a way to create a govern share mechanism for as namata gas which comply with European Union laws, which means that so far, nothing new we are exactly at the same position that we already express a few months ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question come from Mr. Alejandro Demichelis from Bank of America. Mr. Demichelis, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Couple of questions just to follow-up on the Libyan renegotiation and so on, should we expect some extraordinary charge on your fourth quarter numbers coming out of this revenue revision of the contract? That's one question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is regarding the gas pipe and disposals that now seems to have been delayed, is there any scope that the due diligence here may result in reviewed price for those pipelines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for the first question, I think that we are not expecting any special charge for the last quarter of this year.  In fact, if this new contract applies starting from October this year we will get a reduction of price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the international gas pipeline disposal process, so far based on the work which has been already done by some entities interested in acquiring those stake, we don't see any reason why we have to change the guidance that we already provided to the market in the previous occasions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Karim Rahim from Barclays Capital. Mr. Rahim, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. I wanted to ask a few questions. The first was on take-or-pay liabilities, seen a very large decline in gas volume sales in Italy. I was just wondering what impact that might have, and any cash provisions you'd have to take with the full year?</p>
          <p>And the second question, was just around the tax rate guidance going forward, if you can provide anything beyond 2010, should we expect a decline going forward given the startup of more Italian production? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, talking about the take-or-pay, as you have already correctly mentioned we expect 2010 volumes sold to be lower than those achieved in 2009 and the estimate take-or-pay which is in advance, and I want to emphasis that this relating to an advance payment  in 2010 to be in the range of &#x20AC;1 billion. The impact of this prepayment is included in our year-end guidance of 46%, 0.46 for year-end. However, I believe that is also very, very important to emphasize that we expect to fully recover the prepaid gas thanks to the fact that we can collect it over the residual life of the contract which average more or less 20 years, and to the fact that we have the option not to renew the long-term contract expiring in the near future. So confirming that we are talking about just an advance payment. As far as the tax rate is concerned for 2011 onward, we are now working on the new long-term plan, and we believe that is not appropriate so far to give a guidance when the exercise is still ongoing. We will provide all the information at the next strategy presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's it. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Jon Rigby from UBS. Mr. Rigby, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. Both on the upstream, two questions please. The first, just noting the success of the third appraisal well on Perla, and just going back to your presentation in the first half of the year, you talked about a bigger, in terms of reserves of over 9 tcf. With three wells drilled, are you able to give an update on that, certainly it's just a range in any case. And do you intend to go ahead with a fourth appraisal well and then onto FID and what the timeline is for that. And then secondly, I guess, unfortunately, we always come back to this, are you able just to give another update on what's going on with Karachaganak again? Obviously high profile in the news at the moment. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was just &#x2013; we drilled three wells. I think that at last well <mark type="inaudible" /> confirm positive results. We are increasing our research but is always in term of gas in place, I prefer to talk about gas in place than research, because research can come. Our reservoir status, we talk about over 14 billion of, or 40, sorry is tcf. So that is a figure that is more or less confirmed slightly higher than what we saw with the second well. The FID, the expectation for the FID for the experimental phase, the early production phase, we opt to pay this FID by the end of this year. Because we try, we want to put in production Perla by 2013.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the Karachaganak, just and update, we are still under negotiation.  As I said, we think that we are very close, we are negotiating in a very good environment and I hope  that by the end of the 2010 we should be able to finalize our negotiations positively for both parties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow-up, can you just run through what the points of negotiation are currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The main point that we are negotiating are, we have to go to arbitration process, one of the tax issue and the second one on the cost recovery, that are the main two points that we are negotiating.  And so I am talking explicitly about that, and there are some other topics around these negotiation that as you saw and then in the newspaper concerning the willingness of the Republic of Kazakhstan to cover its stake in the joint venture, those are the three topics we are discussing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question come from Mr. Paolo Citi from Intermonte. Mr. Citi, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Just two questions. First of all regarding the derivative financial instruments that you book in the quarter, I think 171 million in the P&amp;L.  I'd like to have some disclosure on this figure and also relation to the quite high minorities book in the quarter? The second question is again on the gas sector. First of all, I'd like to understand, how are you going to book your sales to residential clients in the last quarter this year, take into account the decision of the regulator to cut the decore the raw material cost component, and also take it account your recent activity to regional court on this issue?</p>
          <p>And finally, again on the gas, if possible to have an update regarding your guidance on full year regarding adjusted EBITDA. During the last presentation, you've made an indication of roughly 3.6,  &#x20AC;3.7 billion from 4.4 last year, is it possible to have an update on this? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Trying to answer to your first question relating to the use of derivatives. You are right, in the third quarter, derivatives which just for accounting reasons cannot be considered as specific, so derivatives contract which do not meet the criteria established by the international accounting standard have to be valued at their fair value existing at the end of the quarter. Accordingly, the fair value has been reflected in the P&amp;L in the financial side of the profit and loss account, and resulted in a positive gain of  approximately &#x20AC;200 million, which contributed to the achievement of a net financial income for the group of &#x20AC;46 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the second question, we like to mention that <mark type="inaudible" /> energy beside the reduction of this 2e. 2e is complex method by which you fix the price to the retail customers. We are not happy with this decision and in fact we, with many other companies operating in Italy are presented to the regional tribunal some tie to the regional tribunal to amend this decision.  Anyhow, it will affect the price to the customers, it will be added starting since October this year. We will see what will be the final decision of common tribunal. As for the guidance for the 2010 EBITDA I can confirm what has been said before that we think, that this year would be the value of EBITDA will be in the range of &#x20AC;3.7 billion.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just had two questions, the first one regarding Angola, I was wondering after the recent series of positive discoveries in Block 15/06 if you could update us on the amount of reserves that you think that you have in that block? And secondly relating to your CapEx plan, I was wondering if you could give us a guidance for 2010 and a rough breakdown of where you're spending that money? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Angola, I prefer to talk about, before about all the states and not research that come from our case, research studies and we reach now the last important discovery close to 2 billion of oil and gas in Angola and that is the figure at the moment.  And as you know, we try to put in production we have very fast time to market, the first up by 2013, and back to back the second half, so is very successful and now we go ahead with an appraisal phase and also expiration phase on additional structure in the south of this block.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about CapEx, CapEx in 2010 total CapEx are expected to be slightly higher than 2009, and giving a more precise number it would be in the range of &#x20AC;15 billion. Of our total expected CapEx of &#x20AC;15 billion, approximately two-third is attributable to our upstream division, the Gas &amp; Power sector accounts for over a tenth of the total, the vast majority which is in the regulated sector, and then engineering and construction site accounts for another 10% of the total. Geographically speaking, Italy accounts for approximately 20% of the total.  Of the remaining 80%, the high proportion is attributable to higher upstream operation in North and West Africa.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a question following on, on the EBITDA guidance. Back in February, when you updated the business plan to 2013 you gave guidance on the pro forma adjusted EBITDA to average I think 2009 levels, about &#x20AC;4.4 billion per year.  Obviously there's been some tough trading since those targets were issued. Do you still think it's reasonable to hang on to that target and if you were to revise it knowing what you know today, what might be a more reasonable level if there is cause to revise it? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, off course, we are currently updating our business plan for the next couple of years looking what happening in the market, what we think we will happen next year. Of course, we have not yet finished with this exercise, and the moment we do, we will announce our target in our strategy presentation that normally we hold in March, 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but is it fair to say that conditions have materially deteriorated since that was issued, things are tougher than you thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, the competitive pressure is increasing with respect to what we have foreseen in the last plan. The bigger question a market question, not only for ourselves but it tend for all the gas available in Europe is when demand is going to recover, then all the gas that will be produced <mark type="inaudible" /> they find access to the market and the consequence when the difference between the oil class index the prices and the prices [indiscernible[ will decrease. We expect this could happen in the next two, three years, but of course yet we don't have a clear full view what we think will happen, so really [inaudible] to our strategy presentation for me to give you a proper guidance on this.</p>

          <p>Okay. And can the outcome of the renegotiations on the long-term contracts also have a material effect on how the market firms up?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, this is one of the main issues now at stake. Unfortunately you cannot ask revision of price at any date, but only when the contract <mark type="inaudible" />. So we are already have a negotiation going on, some other will be open next year 2011, and then in 2011 most of our contracts will be under renegotiation.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon gentlemen. I'd just like to go back to the gas business if I can.  Firstly in terms of gas sales outside Italy, they're down 15% down year-on-year this quarter, but I think they were up slightly in the second quarter. I was just wondering if you could give us some color on the reasons behind that deterioration? Secondly, you mentioned that a proportion of your long-term contracts were expiring in the near future.  Are you able to tell us with which counterparties those contracts are, and also what gas volumes they represent? And thirdly, if you could give us an update on the state of renegotiations with Algeria and also the second around of your renegotiations with Gazprom? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, very interesting questions, you're rightly noted that in fact, recovery of demand in Italy has been quite good in the past six months of this year.  In fact if you look to the figure from 2009, to 2010 between 2010 and 2009 the decrease in sales overall in Italy has been in the order of around 10%. If we look to boarding not corrected for the terminal effect. A large part of this <mark type="inaudible" /> been recovered at least mainly in the first of six months of this year.  In August and September the recovery has been slowed down and this the reason we expect new correction in the market.</p>
          <p>For these renegotiations of contract, what I said before is that now we're renegotiating all our contracts.  We start all to Algeria with some meetings, that negotiations will go for sure for many months still. And the same will apply to Gazprom. I don't think that I should mention exactly which contract when this will expire because <mark type="inaudible" /> we serve a very important commercial side.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I have a question on your corporate cost because I have seen decline, a reduction in corporate cost. I wonder if this, is that a temporary impact of, or if it is linked to some structure reduction? And the second question is still on the gas market, and if you could elaborate a little bit more also on the performance in some market such as Turkey for example, it was quite weaker while the economy should have been more buoyant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well corporate cost depends if you, whether are you analyzing these element at gross margin, at EBIT level or net margin level.  Because of course, depending on the level of result you are analyzing, there are other elements which could affect the results of the period.</p>
          <p>If you refer to the corporate cost, the corporate result, what we attribute to the corporate at measure at EBIT level, they are not very different compared to the other quarters. Of course there are some finish-off cost then, since the valuations which could affect the intercompany profit or losses realized between group companies are attributed and eliminated during the consolidation process, to the corporate segment, the level of prices and the quantities existing by the end of the period in our stocks could affect the results of the period attributed to corporate, which means that in terms of fewer costs are in line with the previous quarters, the fewer costs. The results identified as corporate are significantly higher because the variation in the stock including the third quarter has cause positive adjustment in the period.</p>

          <p>For the question on gas, it is true that after the crash in demand in year 2008, recovery in different countries have been different. For instance, Germany recovered all the demand that had been lost. Italy is mid-way as we said before, other country like Spain <mark type="inaudible" /> are still at the beginning the process of recovery. So we have a different situation in different countries <mark type="inaudible" /> the situation on the market in terms of price is really the same everywhere, for this excess of supply that is arriving in European market across maintaining the price <mark type="inaudible" /> as we said, the negotiations with all the suppliers, all of the provider of gas.</p>
          <p>There is special case is Turkey, where not withstanding a good economy, as we say the amount of gas had been very, very low, so the exposure took a fail decrease of consumption in Turkey is quite high and of course because we are selling <mark type="inaudible" /> gas in Turkey these is affecting around overall sales.</p>
