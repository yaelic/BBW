          <p>Good morning, everybody. Always that  hushed silence. Good morning and welcome to the ANZ First Half 2012 Results briefing. We've got participants joining us here today from the ANZ offices in Sydney, here at the ANZ center in Melbourne, and by phone and, of course, on the web.</p>
          <p>As usual, this morning to present the results, our CEO, Mike Smith, and our CFO, Peter Marriott. They're joined in the audience in Melbourne by our incoming CFO, Shayne Elliott, and hosting the room in Sydney today is our Deputy CEO, Graham Hodges. Mike and Peter will present for around 30 to 35 minutes. I'll come back then and take you through the housekeeping for Q&amp;A. Thanks, Mike.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well many thanks Jill, and good morning to everybody. As well as Peter and Shayne, I have most of the management board here in Melbourne or on the phone to help answer any questions you may have later. Let me start by saying that ANZ has produced a solid financial result in the first half. It's in line with the key trends we outlined in our February update and it demonstrates continued progress with our supraregional strategy. I think it's clear to everyone now that the world is in a very different place. The global financial crisis wasn't just a blip on the radar screen. It really was a game changer. And the global economy is probably only about halfway through what I now think of as the workout phase of the crisis.</p>
          <p>That's why from the time I joined ANZ, all of us here have been on a journey to make ANZ a stronger bank, to build a real exposure to the growth opportunities being created by the Asian century, and to systematically respond to the more constrained environment for banking in our major domestic markets. Given the scale of what we are doing, building management experience and capability, establishing new and expanded banking licenses and building the IT and risk systems that underpin it all, this can't happen overnight. This takes time. Having said that, our financial results are really starting to demonstrate the differentiation that comes from connectivity and from diversification, the two pillars our supraregional strategy is built on.</p>
          <p>As you can see from our scorecard, we're delivering by geography, we're delivering by customer segment, and we're delivering by product. And the capability we are building is providing a stronger foundation for future growth with more options for ANZ to deliver differentiated returns than with a domestic only focus.</p>
          <p>In this half, we're seeing this in the strong results that we have delivered from outside Australia, in Asia-Pacific, Europe, and America and in New Zealand, and also in the performance of Institutional with its international focus. In Australia, however, while we have grown market share and our customer satisfaction remained strong, our financial performance was subdued due to the impact of the declining margins and the structural shift that's occurred since the GFC, which has seen lower demand for credit. These challenges are now an ongoing part of the Australian banking landscape, and as I said at the February trading update, this shift isn't new, but its effect I think is now very apparent.</p>
          <p>The implication of these divergent trends is twofold. First, with what's happening in the world, it's clear that our superregional strategy makes more sense than ever. We're now seeing higher growth businesses and higher growth geographies emerge. And given the capacity we've created in the bank over the past four years, we now have the opportunity to accelerate the execution on our strategy.</p>
          <p>Second, the domestic outlook means that although there are still growth opportunities, we need to continue making the decisions that are necessary to reshape our large domestic businesses here in Australia and in New Zealand for the future.</p>
          <p>So this result demonstrates that we are continuing to deliver against our promises. As you will have seen, ANZ's statutory profit was $2.92 billion, underlying profit compared to the last half was up 5% to $2.97 billion and was 6% higher than the first half of last year. We increased the interim dividend by 3% to $0.66 fully franked. And I'll just remind you that we have historically applied a lower payout ratio in the first half.</p>
          <p>Turning to our performance in our key geographies, in Australia, we delivered market share growth in both Retail and Commercial. Deposit growth was strong, up 6% while lending grew 4% mainly due to mortgages. While asset and liability volumes were reasonable, the issue in Australia was continued margin pressure, driven by higher deposit pricing and higher long-term household funding costs.</p>
          <p>Over the half, the difference between the Reserve Bank's cash rate and the average amount we pay ANZ's 2.9 million retail depositors in Australia was up 28 basis points, while the average cost for Australian term wholesale funding increased by 15 basis points. The bottom line is that despite our core franchise performing well, profit declined 7%. The 13 basis point reduction in Retail and Commercial margins impacted income, which declined 2%. And we have taken action to partly address this in February and in April by adjusting rates.</p>
          <p>Costs were up 3%, which reflected some seasonal factors, including the annual wage increase under the EBA that was effective in October. The underlying issues in the Australian market were also apparent in wealth, where profit was down 9%. We've responded to this environment by carefully targeting investment at growth opportunities and through a productivity focus that creates a more sustainable cost base and a simpler more customer focused business. These productivity programs are well advanced and the benefits are expected to drive lower cost growth in the second half.</p>
          <p>This reflects an ongoing focus on operational efficiency in Australia and indeed across the Group, including stronger disciplines around the use of our operations and technology centers. Over the medium term, our aim is for these centers to create a competitive advantage on costs and to give us access to talent and to improve service levels for all our customers.</p>
          <p>We're also dealing with structural change in other ways. For example, our monthly interest rate review gives us more flexibility to manage margins in Australia over the longer term. And we've shown that we are willing to use it. But in the meantime, we still remain competitive.</p>
          <p>In New Zealand, we increased profit by 11% in New Zealand dollar terms. This was helped by good cost management, a 14% reduction in the provision charge and a reduction in the corporate rate tax late last year. Income was up 3% largely on margin improvement from product mix benefits and disciplined deposit pricing. And expenses continued to be well managed.</p>
          <p>Lending growth was flat with retail and commercial customers continuing to deleverage, but deposits grew 4%. The business simplification program is progressing well and it's delivering some early cost improvements, for example, by reducing the number of retail products and by establishing a more integrated management structure in both Retail and Commercial banking.</p>
          <p>And the migration to a single IT platform will assist further productivity gains in 2013. Obviously a highlight of our result continues to be the performance of Asia-Pacific, Europe and America. U.S. dollar profit was up 21%. Customer deposits grew 17% with lending up 12%. Jaws were positive with income up 11% and expenses up 6%. The value diversification brings is highlight in the double-digit revenue growth we're seeing in a range of markets, including China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia and Greater Mekong.</p>
          <p>Offsetting this, partnership profits fell 29% mainly as a result of an impairment charge on the carrying value of ANZ's investment in SSI in Vietnam. But as you saw with the sale of our stake in Sacombank in January, we continued to actively manage the partnership portfolio.</p>
          <p>APEA revenue was 16% of total revenue in the half. In addition, Australian and New Zealand revenue sourced from APEA contributed a further 4% to the Group. So we are still on target to derive 20% of Group revenue from APEA this year.</p>
          <p>Finally, our Global Institutional business, this is another success story and you know what state the business was in in 2008. Institutional profit increased 24% driven by earnings growth in global markets and transaction banking, particularly in priority products linked to our supraregional strategy like foreign exchange, trade, cash management, which all saw strong double-digit revenue growth.</p>
          <p>And in customer segments such as resources, infrastructure and financial institutions, where again revenue growth was very strong. Customer deposits grew 5% and lending was up 7% on an FX adjusted basis. Jaws are positive, income increased 16%, while expenses are now trending lower, up just 3%, reflecting the productivity initiatives which commenced last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to Group credit quality, this continued to stabilize in the first half. The total underlying provision charge of $565 million was down 14% on the same period last year, although 3% up on the last half. And we remain appropriately provisioned for this point in the credit cycle.</p>
          <p>Looking at the balance sheet, as you know, over time we have been increasing the proportion of funding from customer deposits to minimize our reliance on offshore wholesale funding. Combined with a relatively smaller domestic mortgage book, this has resulted in a structural funding task that is much smaller than our domestic peers.</p>
          <p>This smaller wholesale funding task allows us to take a more flexible approach to raising funds and in difficult market conditions, it means that we have more choice about which markets we go to and when we go. So far, we have already completed around 80% of our 2012 wholesale funding task. So the bottom line is that these results demonstrate that we're in a very strong position financially and, perhaps more importantly, a very strong position strategically.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me comment briefly on the outlook. We are continuing to manage the bank in a way that reflects the very significant economic and political uncertainties that exist in the global economy. The situation is obviously more acute in Europe and to be realistic, this is going to cause volatility in global markets for many years. On top of that, the world is going through a once in a century shift in the global economic order towards Asia.</p>
          <p>Our strategy is allowing us to respond to these shifts and it is seeing a competitive advantage emerge from customer and product connectivity and from diversification to higher growth geographies. Nevertheless, we recognize that getting ahead of the game in this environment also creates major challenges. For example, our recent decision on interest rates for customers in Australia and on employment within the Group reflect the need to reshape our business. Clearly though, we need to work harder to find new ways of responding to customer and community concerns about banking, and to the changes that have been brought upon the banking sector by this environment.</p>
          <p>However, I'm still optimistic about Australia and New Zealand as well as the growth businesses we have created in Asia. So while there is a great deal more that needs to be done at ANZ, we have made good progress and this gives us confidence that we can deliver on expectations for the year as a whole.</p>
          <p>In closing, I do want to acknowledge that our results are the work of 48,000 talented and professional people at ANZ. People who have been working hard to support our customers and I'd like to thank them for their continued support. Now for the last time, let me invite Peter to talk to the results in a little more detail.</p>
          <p>As you know, Peter is leaving ANZ at the end of this month to move to a non-executive career. Peter and I have actually presented 10 results together of the 30 that he has done in his 15 years as CFO at ANZ. And somewhat like Black Caviar, it's a record it's unlikely to be broken. I said at the trading update that there is a lot of comfort that comes from working with Australia's best CFO. And I know that this is just as true for the analysts and for the shareholders who've come to know Peter for his insight, his diligence, and I think most important, his integrity. And we all owe him our thanks for an extraordinary period of service.</p>
          <p>So, Shayne, these are very big shoes to fill &#x2013; well literally, but also professionally. But Peter, over to you one last time. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thank you very much, Mike, for those very kind comments and in particular I'd just like to say it's been a true honor to work with everyone in this room and also the people in Sydney over what has been a period actually of 19 years, plus of course 15 years as CFO. So this is actually my 35th results announcement if I include the ones when I was financial controller.</p>
          <p>But to the results and more important matters, let's go through and have a look at what some of the key drivers are and some of the factors behind these numbers. Mike's explained that we've had a 5% growth in the underlying profit and what you'll see in this result is a number of offsetting factors and that's why I want to try and drill into to help you understand some of those factors.</p>
          <p>So we will see in terms of that profit before provisions growth that has been basically a very strong trading balance sheet outcome, but a weak margin outcome within the Australian business. And likewise, when we look at provisions, we'll see that the IP charge which is perhaps higher than what you thought, but really it's been the workings of the collective provision coming through and we'll explain that in more detail. Just whilst on this chart as well, the non-core items, I won't say any more on this other than to say that they are exactly what we said they would be in terms of their composition. There's nothing new in there. There's no surprises in there. And we gave an update to that at the trading update, and they're all the normal things. I don't think they require any further discussion.</p>
          <p>So 4% growth in profit before provisions, driven by 4% income growth and 3% cost growth. So first of all, let's have a look at that 4% income growth or 4.1% FX adjusted. You find that in fact 63% of that came from the rebound in the trading and balance sheet earnings. And so when you strip that away, you've got 1.5% income growth excluding trading and balance sheet. And on this chart on the right hand side, we gave the breakdown of the individual divisional contributions to that.</p>
          <p>And you can see that the Institutional business in particular, notwithstanding the strong trading earnings, it still had a very strong result boosted by that the growth in sales income, being up 16% in markets, the very strong transaction banking outcome with good margin performance and volumes, all leading through to even when you strip away the rebound in the markets, there was a 7.1% income growth. In APEA, it's 5%, held back a bit by the write-down to SSI, that Mike also mentioned. It would be more like 7% if you adjusted for that.</p>
          <p>New Zealand margin improvement and relatively modest volume, but in the sort of the New Zealand environment that almost 3% income growth is very good. And then Australia, of course, has been knocked by that 13 basis point margin reduction. And, of course, to put that into context, that wipes out almost 4% &#x2013;  3.7% of Australia's total income, so hence ending up with a negative 1.8%.</p>
          <p>So just looking at what happened within the global markets business and as we're explaining, you can see from the chart in the bottom left-hand corner, clearly the rebound in the trading and balance sheet has been the main driver, but the gold in this business is the sales. 16% growth, continuing momentum in that business, that's the example of the supraregional strategy. I think it worked as well given that 38% of those sales are now actually coming out of APEA, so supplementing the earnings we get in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
          <p>Also, consistent with the theme of us trying to diversify the earnings from this business and our other businesses, you can see we're progressively reducing the reliance upon fixed income with foreign exchange and commodity earnings growing consistently from half-to-half. But, clearly, the main thing which has influenced the result has been the margin and so it's worthwhile going through and decomposing that margin. Not surprisingly from this chart, the principal thing which has impacted the margin and caused that reduction in the ex-markets margin of 5 basis points has been funding costs and deposit costs.</p>
          <p>And also consistent with the last few halves, it's by far the deposit costs are the main driver rather than in the funding costs. And if you look in that deposit reduction of 4.5 basis points at the Group level, you've got 3.9 of that coming from Australia. And then, of course, that flows through into Australia's margin, and about 0.8 coming out Insto.</p>
          <p>The assets number actually hides our pluses and minuses. Within there, there's been very good performances in transaction banking in Asia where margins actually went up, added around one basis point to the Group. Cards has been good, but mortgages &#x2013; there's been pressure on the margin within mortgages and also within global loans, particularly in Australia where &#x2013; and we'll talk more about that one later on, but there's been a new trend emerging within that part of the business. And in other there's a series of a smaller items, a lot of them are frankly associated with impaired assets and interest calculation changes which I'll touch on later.</p>
          <p>So let's look at interest margin at the divisional level. And I think this chart is somewhat consistent with the earlier charts we've given in prior years in terms of the &#x2013; clearly the volume growth is coming out of the Institutional and APEA business, more modest volume growth coming out of Australia and New Zealand and hence the focus upon the Institutional and particular APEA side of the business.</p>
          <p>Clearly, despite good volume growth in Australia, that reduction in the margin wiped off about 5.2% of that interest income growth. Within Institutional markets, very strong volume growth &#x2013; Institutional ex-market showed a very strong volume growth at 9.9%. 60% of that came out of Asia where the volume growth was 17%. So you can see the value of that.</p>
          <p>That margin reduction is probably lower than what you expected and it's even lower than what we expected. And as the half progressed, the competition in that market became more and more fierce. In particular, it's been the inability to pass on the higher funding costs and the lowering in fees that has progressed. I think at the time of the trading update, we said this was steady. We were thinking it was more noise, but as the half went on, it become more and more clear that there was some underlying changes taking place.</p>
          <p>In that 10 basis point reduction, there is 2 basis points which is more of an accounting adjustment related to the effect of lower risk in the book because of resolution of some of the legacy issues, meaning less capital has been allocated. So, if you like, there's a real 8 in there, if you want to look at it in that context.</p>
          <p>New Zealand, margin improving by deposits and loans and other factors, so it's &#x2013; not much volume growth, but the margin story has improved although as we'll touch on later, it's probably now peaked at that level.</p>
          <p>I'm sure all of you have got your calculator out and said, wait a minute, hang on. At the time of the trading update, you said margins down about one basis point, but it ended up five down. So it must have been a pretty tough Q2 and indeed it was. Now some of it is just the inevitable quarter-on-quarter volatility, but we've decomposed the factors here.</p>
          <p>Within Australia, the out of cycle changes, it was 6 basis points, which took place in the middle of February, so there was only the six weeks benefit of that. That and some other asset changes were still swamped by deposit pressures. So a couple of basis points net negative.</p>
          <p>Then unfortunately the problem of looking at quarterly results, they're very susceptible to one-offs and there was a one-off interest adjustment in the first quarter and a one-off interest adjustment going the other way in the second quarter, meaning that swinging around that margin in the Australian business and the volatility of looking at these things over short time frames.</p>
          <p>APEA, it's more been a change in the mix, the focus upon low risk business, which is the lower margin. Institutional has continuing pressure from deposits/global loans on pricing pulled off a point at the Group level. And then finally, of course, the first quarter had the dividend. We had the benefit of the free funds effect, earning the cash, building interest on that and then, of course, that was paid at the end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So let's look now at jaws and in particular looking at jaws as we strip away the effect of the rebound in trading and balance sheet income. And you can see that whilst the jaws were positive at the headline level, when you strip away the effect of trading and balance sheet income, they ended up being negative. But as we go through the individual divisions, New Zealand is positive. APEA, if you adjust it for the effect of the trading and balance sheet, that income number comes more like 7%, also allowing for SSI. So it's still positive. And Institutional 16% comes down to about 7%.</p>
          <p>So all of the New Zealand, APEA, Institutional had positive jaws adjusting for trading and balance sheet and the issue comes back to that 13-basis point margin reduction in Australia. You can see from the chart at the bottom right-hand that within APEA and its total of the costs are coming down, Australia has its normal seasonal kick up in the first half, largely driven by the wage increases that comes through on the first of October. But, also, of course, that's driven actions towards trying to address those costs and you'll see a lot of media attention about that.</p>
          <p>That then flows directly into the next chart, which is a substantial ramp up in the level of restructuring activity this half. And the P&amp;L includes some $74 million of above the line restructuring cost including in underlying profit. And you can see the breakdown of that, Institutional being a large component of that as well and &#x2013; but Australia being the largest one.</p>
          <p>Now it doesn't directly impact Australia's cost growth, because it was offset by industry wide GST refunds, you'll see coming that through all the results, and some existing provisions. But nonetheless the net impact on the first half was around $31 million of higher costs net of those one-offs. And you'll see still see further restructuring cost in the second half. So this is &#x2013; there's still more to be done here, again taken above the line.</p>
          <p>Because of that, the profile of this chart, which I think we've shown for the last couple of halves, is a little bit different, much more spending there on that productivity investment and those realized productivity benefits you'll see increasing into the second half as the change programs, particularly in Australia, start to actually flow through, because the exits have been either towards the end of the first half or during the current half.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of growth, you might say it's relatively small, but remember, it's off the back of a $269 million increase in growth investment last year. So we've sustained it; we haven't cut back on some of those growth programs. Indeed, we've continued to grow them in APEA and Insto, pulled them back a little bit in Australia and New Zealand, but certainly in the APEA and Insto has continued to grow.</p>
          <p>That hen moves on to the next offsetting factor type, if you like, type item within the P&amp;L and that's the provision charge. You will have seen that the overall provision was up only about 3%, but there was &#x2013; IPs up, CP down, and these charts are going to demonstrate that that was simply the CP doing exactly what the CP is supposed to do.</p>
          <p>As you know, we've had a number of exposures that had been identified, and we said that, look, whilst they are not specific at this point in time, it was appropriate to hold various overlays for those until such time as they're crystallized and a number of those have actually crystallized. And as a consequence, the corresponding CP, therefore, has been released. And you can see that set out on this chart and that includes securities lending, stock exposures, floods, earthquakes, PSA, virus, some of those factors that we've holding CP for.</p>
          <p>Likewise, there was one single name that's long since being closely monitored, it's been longstanding account that was impaired &#x2013; went to impaired status, this half and there was the CP related to that and some derivative exposures related to that release. So that's just simply the CP doing what the CP should do.</p>
          <p>So when you then look at the individual provisions themselves and take out that effective transfer, you can see the trends here. Australia, an improvement in general across most of the businesses. I think the only business whose IPs actually went up was cards and that was from a merchant exposure. Within New Zealand, downward trends across the businesses and very small numbers, obviously, coming out of APEA.</p>
          <p>In Institutional, that increase was simply because of lower recoveries. You probably recall that the IP charge in institutional last half was very low and that was because of a large number of recoveries and so our recoveries and write backs have actually fallen from what was last half $176 million to only $73 million this half. And so hence it wasn't case of more problems, it was more the lower recoveries.</p>
          <p>That then flows across into the collective provision charge itself, which you saw is as being $152 million release. You can see most of that is that orange part we spoke about before. And then there's a little bit of release from the overlays mainly in the flood provisions where clear experience coming through from the floods has been less than expected, and you can no longer defend those provisions.</p>
          <p>In terms of the normal charge, it was a balance between charge because of growth in the balance sheet being offset by the risk reduction and, in fact, the risk reduction was even more than that. And rather than taking that to the P&amp;L, we actually transferred $60 million of risk reduction across into the overlays. So the net result of all of this is despite that $152 million CP release, our overlays only went down by $55 million and still stand at the $457 million. So we thought that was the appropriate thing to do.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the impaired assets, you can see they are down by, like, by 4%. As you look at those net impaired assets &#x2013; sorry, impaired assets and the net impaired assets, you'll find that approximately 23% of them are agri exposures across Australia and New Zealand, personal exposures are around 19%, property is only 18% of those exposures, and then the next industry it falls back to was construction.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the arrears, the 90-day arrears numbers you see disclosed are only up by just over 2%. And in fact, as you run it along business by business, there's really only one business with  commercial exposure within Australia where there was one client, well secured but nonetheless in arrears, that drove the increase in the absolute dollars.</p>
          <p>From the new impaired assets point of view, again down across most businesses with the exception of two names within the Institutional business. One was an infrastructure construction project that has been on our watch list for quite some time and finally reached the stage where it was transferred to impaired status. And so it wasn't new in that sense.</p>
          <p>And the other one was a power construction project, which has got very strong off-take arrangements, but the construction is running behind time and the loan needed to be rescheduled and hence gets classified as restructured. They together aggregate to $625 million. So the impaired asset position is in general improving reflecting the asset quality position, I think, overall has been stable to improving.</p>
          <p>So that then leads us on to what I think is probably a lot of people's favorite slide, is the outlook slide, and let's go through the, I think, probably the four principal variables behind the outlook. And the first one obviously is the interest margin, and it's &#x2013; particularly with the events of yesterday, there's obviously a wide range of factors that will impact the margin outlook for the second half, which is going to make it difficult to be definitive, but let's give a few observations around that.</p>
          <p>If you look at that 2.7% exit margin, if you like, in the second quarter, remember that from the Australian division's point of view, it doesn't include at least very much of the effect of that 12 basis points of out-of-cycle moves. It had six basis points for essentially six weeks. So there is a positive influence for that to come through, but we obviously have to keep our eye on what happens to deposit competition and what happens to the whole BBSW cash spread, but nonetheless there's a degree of tailwind there because of the recent out-of-cycles.</p>
          <p>In terms of the New Zealand business, as I said, just starting to flatten out and probably see a slight reduction. The APEA business, I wouldn't expect much of an influence on the Group's margin, but in terms of the Institutional business, particularly here within Australia, some further reduction likely to come through on the global loan side of the business because of the same factors that we mentioned before.</p>
          <p>So you've got &#x2013; subject to the workings of the Australian market, likely it'd be some improvement in the Australian margin from the level in the second quarter, some reductions coming through in the Institutional and New Zealand. So, again, perhaps that leaves us about square, but there's obviously a lot of variables that I'm seeing within all of that.</p>
          <p>In terms of expenses, you will see that that 3% cost growth will be materially lower, significantly lower in the second half, but nonetheless there is still an estimated $50 million, $60 million of restructuring charge in the second half to come through. So that will neutralize some of the benefits that are coming through, but nonetheless substantially lower than what it was in the first half.</p>
          <p>From a market's revenue point of view, I think one would be being quite optimistic to assume the trading and balance sheet performance could be repeated and that's obviously the one that's hard to forecast, but there's some good solid underlying momentum in the sales figures.</p>
          <p>Then finally from a provision point of view, I think we said the same thing at the trading update. We would think that the provision for the full year would be similar to 2011. That obviously implies it's mathematically an uptick in the second half. And that's often the case because of seasonality, and I think that's probably when you look around at the general state of the economy, that's probably sensible position to be. So provision charge similar to 2011 for the full year.</p>
          <p>So with those comments on the outlook, Jill, I'll hand back. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Matt Davison from Merrill Lynch. And firstly, congratulations, Peter, on your career. My question related to APEA. You're starting to see a pretty good growth in the underlying earnings number and the NPAT number, but you're still seeing very strong growth in risk-weighted assets, up 35% year-on-year. So I'm just interested in the outlook in terms of that return on risk-weighted asset in Asia and whether there's a bit of an abnormal this year with the growth in that balance?</p>
          <p>And just a related question; the Institutional NIM is down 30 bps ex-markets year-on-year. Peter, I think you've alluded to that being more Australia. I'm just interested if that is really in line with expectations or came in more disappointing than what you thought six months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the RWA growth in Asia-Pacific, that has been primarily as a result of driving the trade book. So it's high quality assets and also short-term. And that was done for a very deliberate reason in terms of the funding requirement. So it's much easier to fund that sort of short term stuff, but the quality is very good. That meant a slightly lower return on those assets. In terms of &#x2013; what was the second part, the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next one is about the Institutional NIM, but perhaps I might further comment on terms of the ROE because it certainly was obviously a focus of discussion of the last trading &#x2013; sorry, last results announcement.</p>
          <p>And you've really got to look at the average risk-weighted assets and you got to bring in all the deductions, it's a hard number to derive from the results announcement itself. But if you look at the ROE of the Asia business, Asia-Pacific business, on a regulatory capital basis, it's improved about 1% since the last half. It's floating at the moment around about 11% on a regulatory capital basis. And when you drill into that, the Retail business is around 12%. Now there's some one-off positives in that number, but the Retail business is a long term outlook business. So you shouldn't be expecting strong returns in the short term. Partnerships run at about 11% and the star performer in there is the Institutional business, which runs about 16%.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously in terms of capital consumption, because the risk-weighted assets are growing so fast that you have a lot of capital, but we are on a regulatory capital basis getting reasonable returns and improving returns on that and that is the ongoing focus for the business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the NIM, I have to say that the adjustment in NIM in the global loans area was the real surprise. I mean, I think the competitive pressures that came through though that wasn't expected. Well, the scale of the adjustment wasn't expected, and it was on both sides of the balance sheet. It's incredibly competitive on the assets side, particularly this is Australia in particular, and &#x2013; but also on deposits. And that, of course, is across the board. That moves also into Commercial and to Retail. Anything you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll just echo what I said in the presentation that I think at the time of the end of the first quarter, it was off a little bit and we all saw it as broadly stable. We knew couple of basis points of that was just capital, and there's always timing issues around fees and these sorts of things, and &#x2013; but no, the trend continued. And so in that sense, yes, it was a surprise and a vote of confidence compared to where we were three, four months ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we should tell you what we're doing about that. Alex, would you like to &#x2013; I'll throw you to the lion, okay &#x2013; yeah. On the NIM, yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just broadly on the NIM, we have a number of actions, which will use some of our liquidity from offshore to try and restrict the margin compression from the liabilities side. So we're looking at opportunities that frankly are arbitrage opportunities. We're also looking at moving our book more towards the short term, which I think while it won't fix the NIM issue per se, it will give us a lot more flexibility in the balance sheet. So similar to what we did in Asia a year ago, year and half ago, will bring much more short term nature.</p>
          <p>We also feel that that's probably got an easier ability to price up than some of the term stuff at the moment where the market seems to be just very, very &#x2013; in Australia and New Zealand very, very tight and not moving at all. And we have a number of other activities as well. The fundamental thing is that the NIM in Australia in the Institutional side has come under a lot of pressure from both sides of the balance sheet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Jon Mott from UBS. A question about the margin in Australia and I can understand all the moving parts that Peter has highlighted as always, but if you step back and look at it, the Australian mortgage business is growing at twice system levels and you've got to fund it with pretty expensive deposits. And at the end of the day, the margins has gone down from relative to peers 2.58% to 2.45% is still substantially higher than where the rest of your competitors are in Australia. So in reality, is this just a case of the Australian margin rebasing down to more realistic levels with where the competition is in Australia and this could be an ongoing structural issue rather than anything more symptomatic of few moving parts and deposits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Jon, that we can do more to manage the margin. You've seen those two out of cycle increases. That's going to have a flow-on effect as it moves through. The growth of two times system in mortgages was &#x2013; the guys got a little excited when they got behind system growth at the beginning of the year and probably pressed the throttle a bit too hard. So what we're still aiming for there is growth of about system, just over system, which I think is appropriate because, as you rightly say, the issue with mortgage is how to fund that and the liquidity aspect around it.</p>
          <p>But in terms of the question about the structural change, I think the structural change that's coming through is on the deposit side and deposit cost. Quite clearly, with the situation in global credit markets remaining pretty uncertain and very volatile at best, all banks are going to be looking at deposits &#x2013; domestic deposits to fund their operation. And, frankly, that's good banking actually. So I don't actually see that as a major issue. What we have to do is manage that margin, and we've got to take some tough decisions around that. Phil, do you want to add something to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just add to the point Mike made that the deposits is the important piece of that, and it's been a core part of our strategy that we grow at better than market in the household deposits sector, which we've consistently done.</p>
          <p>It is true we do get a bit ahead of ourselves in terms of the mortgage growth and we certainly never intended to grow twice system and we'll be coming back from that. But we do see it's a longer term strategic positioning, it's more driven by our ability to continue to grow household deposits faster than the rest of the banks, which we've done now for number of years, because that gives us the feedstock in a sustainable way to be able to build share on the asset side of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So the margin issues, I think, will &#x2013; it's hard to see that we are materially different from what the rest of the sector has gone through. The composition of our deposit growth is such that it's less concentrated on term deposits. So we would expect that to have more of a muted effect on margins than perhaps some of our competitors as well.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. Mike, having heard everything you just said, I was just wondering is there anything that you can actually on the deposit side to perhaps to improve the spreads there? Obviously, everyone seems to be focusing on the assets, I'm just wondering if there's anything that you can do to help improve deposit spreads?</p>
          <p>And just one for Phil, just trying to get a bit of an idea as to the run rate cost savings for your business moving into the second half of the period. Obviously 3% growth in the first half probably a little bit disappointing given the revenue growth,  just a bit of an idea as what we can expect in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, James, so I mean, I think the key there is to really push CASA on both Retail and Commercial and Institutional business. And, of course, the investment we've made in our cash management system is completely aligned to that. So there are things we can do. And we do need to become more competitive in that lower cost area, which I think you'll see the results of that coming through in the next couple of years. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the costs, Peter had a chart earlier on that showed our first half cost growth had been 3% last year and then second half at 1%. We had 3% growth this year in the first half. It's hard to be specific about these numbers, but it'd be fair to say with the head count reductions we're going through, it's likely that our second half cost growth will below the 1% of the previous year. So broadly speaking, we'll be looking to flat if not declining nominal costs in the second half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Shayne will hold him to it. Most important thing. Yeah, it's also important to appreciate because in terms of the exits are later in the half/beginning into the next half. So, the full momentum won't come through until 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the head count reductions that we've announced, I think, there are only a couple of hundred had gone by the end of March. There's a number that will be leaving during April and May and June. So as Peter said, there'll be a benefit in the second half from that, but there is obviously then a kick-on benefit into the first half of next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. Continuing on the theme of margins but moving across to APEA, six months ago we saw a gapping down of margins in the region for the second half and at that time, I think the outlook for margins into FY12 was one more of optimistic rebound driven partly by trade finance margins, yet in the first half we've seen APEA margins come down again. And I think Peter's outlook statement was for a small decrease in margins into the second half. Just wanted to know what changed from the outlook back at the full year 2011 result and what the competitive dynamic in Asia at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might start and then Alex might want to make some comments, but APEA is a complex beast from a margin point of view, because there's very higher margin businesses like the credit cards business and lower margin businesses like trade, and so you get massive mix effects.</p>
          <p>Certainly, I think everything we said was going to happen happened and that the margins in trade were very, very strong in that month &#x2013; in the period, but the growth mix meant that there was &#x2013; the growth was in the lower margin business and less growth in some of the higher margin business. Alex has been rebalancing the portfolio, reducing some of the high risk parts of those credit card portfolios, for example.</p>
          <p>So you're always going to have this mix effect coming through. It didn't flow though into having an impact on the group margin. It was more what it did to APEA's margin in isolation. So there was no surprises really in that. It's just a question ultimately around what is the mix effect in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, Jarrod, there was quite a big change in the market and what had happened to trade margin, it had increased quite significantly because of the lack of availability as the European banks had pulled back at the time, the first business they pulled back on was trade finance because that was short term, it was running off, they didn't get back into it. The LTRO changed all that. They're back with a vengeance. So there has been a fundamental shift in the market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs. Just in regards to the Institutional division, can we get a sense of the cost levels in that business? I mean, there's always been a very high level of investment embedded in that cost base already. We've seen over the last half the cost growth was actually quite slow despite the quite strong rebound in the markets related income.</p>
          <p>Can we just get a sense &#x2013; with the cost outlook for that, there's talk about some restructuring benefits as being a benefit in this half. Is that just something that we continue to expect relatively lower levels of cost growth compared to what we've seen previously, which we saw much, much higher cost growth in the Institutional business in past periods.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's a question of priority. It's an issue of where we should be putting our investment dollar. And basically we should be putting those in the areas that actually create biggest return for us. The cost initiatives and productivity initiatives that were undertaken in Institutional at the end of last year obviously came into &#x2013; started to benefit the business. And I think we shouldn't be seeing huge cost growth in that business. But, I think it's probably fair to ask Shayne who was responsible at that time for initiating this issue, how you see it play through, and he of course has now turned gamekeeper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a chart in the page actually that showed that cost growth was coming down from 10% to 8% to 5% to 3%. So I think there's been a focus on driving down the cost growth over that period of time and that's really driven by a couple of things. One, the big ticket investment programs that we've had, whether they were around remediation or whether they were around investment, and investment bank primarily in transactive end markets.</p>
          <p>The big weight of those investments are behind us, and so the ongoing investments will be lower, and we start to get the benefits through of those investments either on the revenue side or on the cost side. So there's that.</p>
          <p>Plus secondly, there has been a &#x2013; now that we've simplified the business within Institutional and made it more focused around where we had competitive advantage, we start to drive that productivity much greater. So just in terms of core BAU business, absolutely there's productivity coming through in the business. So I would expect those businesses to continue to trend down to be very, very low single digit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd like to just comment, going back to what you said there, Ben, as well as and I think we undertook this to you, was not allowing the business to re-spend the rebound. That you got to look through the rebound in the trading and sales business and the &#x2013; even within that 3% cost growth in the first half was $15 million of restructuring spend, which will then flow through into benefits in a future period. So a lot has happened in that business after &#x2013; I guess to be fair, record growth in cost got ahead of the record growth in revenue, so pulling it back into line now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Victor German from Nomura. Throughout the presentation, there is a theme around deposits and your relative position or relative stronger position on deposits, which I guess no one will argue is not a positive. The question that I have is that your deposits are relative to peers overweight in the Institutional space. And as we all know, not all deposits are created equal and particularly as we go towards 2018, it'll be this long time wait in that stable refunding ratio environment. Institutional deposits will get lower weighting. I'm interested to hear your thoughts about your strategy around deposit growth, whether there is more focus on more stable deposits? And also if you could give us a split in terms of margin pressure in Institutional business, whether it's coming from lending or deposit side, what the split is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Victor, it sounds like you want to apply for a job with APRA, but yes, you're right. There is always a difference in quality of deposit and we are well aware of that. But this is again going back to the issue of our cash management business. Once you pickup cash management mandates from corporates and from other financial institutions, it is a much stickier deposit than actually many retail deposits would be.</p>
          <p>So I wouldn't accept that all corporate or institutional deposits are not as sticky as retail. Having said that, we do accept that the retail deposit base is very important for our future and, as you saw, we grew retail deposits by 6% in the half, which is a good outcome. We're also continuing to build up the retail deposit base in Asia. Now, we accept that that is a small business now and is something we have to continue to invest in, but at some stage it is going to be an important part of our funding and that will be &#x2013; that is a long term goal.</p>
          <p>So I take your points, but I don't think we are positioned badly. In fact, I still think we have a competitive advantage around our liability mix and we will continue to watch that and build as much sticky deposit as we can.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>There's a split between &#x2013; I'm safe now. The split between &#x2013; the split in the margin reduction within Institutional between what was from deposit side and what was the asset side. And if you look at the waterfalls we've given you within the slides, you see them in there, it actually shows that's all funding and deposits, it's not asset. But that's one thing is the old problem that on the average it's not assets, but within assets, it says it's a small factor, but it's actually &#x2013; from a margin point of view, the competitive pressures on the global loan side meant that there was &#x2013; that cost the business through fees mainly five basis points, but they made up five basis points on transaction banking. So the net-net assets were zero. The transaction banking did very well, but there was five on assets side coming out fees and loans.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. Mike, you said in your presentation that you're continuing to actively manage the Asian partnership portfolio. Could you expand on that statement? Could you comment on the prospects for a change in your ownership interests in Indonesia and Malaysia? And could you also let us know how you think you're going in terms of building the Asian retail franchise more broadly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll give you some broad comments then I'll throw it over to Alex, but we manage the partnerships as we always have in the last four years, which is basically as a strategic initiative into the country which, when possible, moves into an organic business. And when those partnerships no longer give us strategic value, for example Sacombank in Vietnam, we'll dispose of them.</p>
          <p>If we can find ways to increase our ownership to a controlling stake, then, of course, that's also something we would look at. The difficulty in a couple of the cases you mentioned is that quite clearly the other shareholders have to be at the dance with you and, of course, the regulatory impositions may restrict us from moving to larger stakes or to moving to larger stakes that we would like. But we're very pleased with the relationship we have with AmBank in Malaysia and with Panin in Indonesia. As I say, Sacombank bank we exited from. And, of course, the holdings we have in the two banks in China are restricted by regulatory limits. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Sorry, what was &#x2013; on the retail, the retail side, that's going relatively well, really it is being built off the base of the RBS business of the old ABN Amro business that we bought in Asia. We have restructured it somewhat and it's much more based on affluent and wealth type product. It is not pretending to be mass market business, I mean the cards business is slightly separate, but again we are focusing that more on the affluent side as well.</p>
          <p>But that build as I said earlier is a long-term build and really the value of that is to create a deposit base, a sticky deposit base, and we have to accept that our competitive advantage as ANZ in this market really is geared to people who have a connection or an interest in Australia or New Zealand or perhaps somewhere else in the Pacific. But so far the strategy is on check, but I'll pass it over to Alex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And just in regards to the partnership question, the only thing I would add with some of the partnerships we have very good interconnectivity of business flows, particularly with AmBank on the market side and also introduction of clients from both sides. We have also just recently announced the introduction of clients, but also the &#x2013; on the Retail side, but also the establishment of signature priority within Malaysia as well as they start to bank on the affluent side and we help them with that and obviously that with our business in Singapore helps our business in Singapore develop.</p>
          <p>Relative to your question on the Retail side, I would class it as we've now got our head above water very well. We have &#x2013; for the first half, we've now acquired more customers in those that we have deliberately exited, and I'm quite happy to go through that with you when I next see you. We have continued to grow deposits in wealth management products, the growth in both those areas have been very strong, some 20% growth in deposits from the Retail side. And our mortgages business, which is becoming an important product relative to the affluent space, the larger mortgages, is now starting to get off the ground and starting to get momentum.</p>
          <p>Counter to that, as we move segments, our consumer finance business which includes cards, is changing quite dramatically and we are specifically focusing now on the card side at the affluent and emerging affluent and slowly moving out people below those levels. You are seeing that revenue is flatting off in those areas as we do that, as we change more from a model of revolvers to a model of actual utilization of a card. So you can expect going forward that to be a slow growth business, while the other three components that I spoke about in terms of product groups will be more bigger in growth as we start to acquire &#x2013; continue to acquire more and more customers and the dilution of the exit slowly works away. But I would agree with Michael that it is a longer term business for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. Two questions, if I may, what is the dollar value in U.S. dollars that's been streamed down in excess deposits from Asia into Australia? And the second question is on slide 29 and I think I asked this question the last time around, but I never got my head around it, is why is the Institutional margin higher than the Group margin, given that that's a business when you think about banks really don't have a competitive advantage over the corporates themselves. Why is the APEA margin which has excess deposits, why is it actually lower than the Australian margin, given that when you speak to the rating agencies, they'll tell you that Asian portfolio ratings overall are lower than the Australian? So you've got an excess of deposits, you've got a higher credit risk and yet you've got a lower margin overall. So the streaming and just an explanation of the Institutional margin and the APEA margin relative to the Group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Brian, in terms of the streaming, there is about &#x2013; I can't give it to you in U.S. dollar &#x2013; well, it would be the same, $11 billion bottom line, slightly down on what I think it was when we last said that. And essentially what's happened is there was very strong deposit growth up through Asia and Europe and Americas, as you will have seen in the numbers, and that was largely invested into liquid assets because within Australia we did so much in term funding and we're well ahead on our term funding program that the funds weren't required back into Australia. So the monies were kept in liquid assets, boosting our liquid assets offshore.</p>
          <p>In terms of the margin comparisons, remember that the other thing you've got to put in there as well is that Institutional carries a higher amount of capital. There's more earnings &#x2013; more risk based allocation of earnings to Institutional which pushes that the margin up. And then you've got also there's the corporate booking there as well as the true Institutional end, which pushes the margin up. APEA, well you've got such a mixture of credit cards, which really drags the average up because you have margins there which are very, very high single-digit, even occasionally might even get into double-digit, but certainly very, very high single-digit which pulls the margin up and write-down to low risk. So it's so much driven by that mix question that I was mentioning before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one thing, Brian. If you'd look at page 67 and 84, at a macro level you're probably absolutely right, but in our book, the risk levels relative to grades is actually higher quality in our APEA book relative to the total institutional book. And that's being quite clear we've stayed at the very top end of the market on our Institutional business both within the corporations and also within the financial institution space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Mike Wiblin from Macquarie. My question is just referring to page 120, where we've just got a view of the watch and control lists, you can see the watch list ticking up there. I suppose first question is, should we be concerned about that? And second is where are you seeing the sources of stress? And I guess just a general view on the outlook for the economy given we just had a jumbo size rate cut?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. In terms of the watch list, I mean as you'd expect, most of this is in the Commercial book. It's really skewed actually to the agri sector within that commercial book. And perhaps unsurprisingly in terms of where the economy is, if you think X resources sector, the economy is still struggling. And indeed the resources sector themselves are putting a lot of projects on hold which then flows through into the suppliers, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So it's perhaps not really surprising that there has been a little bit of pain in that &#x2013; in what I'd call the middle market.</p>
          <p>Having said that, in terms of actual losses, that hasn't come through because of course that sector is generally more highly secured than we'd see at the top end of town. But in terms of a 50-basis point cut in the RBA, well obviously that will help in terms of getting the economy moving along. But will it actually address the real issue of confidence. I think we need some real stability and consistency to actually create business confidence and I think that that's probably more an issue. But I might ask Nigel to just talk about the credit book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there is anything new in terms of the credit issues that the books facing. It's in the retail sector and manufacturing sector, those areas of &#x2013; those companies that have largely fixed price revenue, but are exposed to much higher costs. And some of those companies you're seeing exposed to higher cost because the cost structure is going through resource sector and contractors. So those areas aren't new, and neither is the risk that we're seeing in Queensland. So I don't think there is anything &#x2013; new issues we've seen in the last six months.</p>

          <p>Brett Le Mesurier, BBY. Couple of questions, first on that flow back of deposits to Australia, what are the accounts imply that they actually go to New Zealand. That's in the intersegment elimination, the bottom of the average balance sheet. And secondly, I wanted to understand how the change in average interest earning assets in APEA fitted in with your strategy. Because they're increased by $14 billion in a six month period, $4 billion of that was loan assets, $10 billion of that was investments in or deposits with the U.S. Fed and other government entities, which looks odd in the context that deposits increased by about $7 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, yes, you're right. One, congratulations, there's a lot of people who do that average balance sheet are very pleased that you raised a question on it. Two, the money which comes into Australia from Asia has been channeled into New Zealand, that is correct. It's been used fundamentally to finance the securitization &#x2013; not the securitization, the branch program I should really say. We have their assets securitized across in for New Zealand into the branch. And so that is why that shows up on the average balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In terms of the rest of the average balance sheet questions there, as we said before, there have been very strong growth in the deposits and they were funded, as you identified, into very high quality assets, liquid assets, central banks and so forth because the monies weren't required back into Australia. So with those additional funds which are available there, to give us some more flexibility.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Scott Manning from JPMorgan. Peter, you talked about a few mix factors that are going to offset each other for the margin going into the next half. I just wanted to say whether those margin comments included the mechanical rebasing of the margin outlook for the 50 basis point rate cuts, specifically the lower return on free funds and the deposit compression that will come through that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as I said in my comments when I was talking about the outlook on margin, there are lot of variables and, yes, the whole BBSW cash spread is a key one that's hard to forecast, exactly how that's going to play out, because it so depends on expectations. And you rightly identify the other one which isn't a big impact in the second half, it becomes more of an issue going forward, is the effect of the lower rate environment on earnings on capital and NBIs.</p>
          <p>I think lot of the commentary I have been reading about people focusing on the spread and not thinking about the NBI impact, there is not for the second half but it is a bigger issue for us all going into 2013. So we literally, as you can image, have been running scenarios and there's a whole range of scenarios depending on how exactly it plays out, what the reserve bank does, what the market anticipates, et cetera. So, yes, they had regard for that, but with a pretty wide distribution positively and negatively.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just a second question to follow on from that with the 50 basis points rate cut, I know it's the economists saying that a bit down in the world with 4% credit growth expected for both housing and business into next year, just your thoughts on whether you think that rate cut will see the system rates or credit growth go higher or whether you think it's just basically keeping people in the game for now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a bit of both. I think there's probably, it will certainly stimulate interest. But I think that the market already discounted probably $0.25 of that cut in. And I think that, yes, there will hopefully be some stimulation as a result, but is it going to dramatically change things? No, I don't think so.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's T.S. from Bell Potter. You referred to the pig in a python effect couple of years ago. And do you think this reflects the state of the economy right now &#x2013; the two speed economy where good things go in but nothing ever gets out? And how do you actually manage &#x2013; in terms of practical banking, how do you manage, I think, the side effects of this phenomenon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it is a multispeed economy, there is no doubt about that. And when you think about it, that's normal, it should be normal. We'd just got used to a situation pre-crisis where everything was firing on all cylinders, and that's actually not how a normal economy does operate. So I think that we do make to &#x2013; or we have to be a bit cleverer in really making sure that we can support the growth from businesses that are going to do well in this environment and of course there will be &#x2013; there will be many.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and banks included, banks have to adjust themselves to realize their potential in this sort of environment. So I think that this is not rocket science, there has to be a lot of common sense applied. But I'm still pretty positive about where the banking industry lies at the moment. I still think whilst it's coming through this turbulent time, there's nothing there that can't be managed.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions, if I could please. Firstly, the Australian business is looking a bit like the big ugly sister in the family portrait this half. Are you concerned with the operating trends of this business despite the across the board market share gains or should we also assume that the business has been hit with a liberal dose of corporate overheads and higher funding costs of recent? I do note a better net interest income performance for the Group center this half.</p>
          <p>And second question related to capital, your core equity Tier 1 is now 8.9% or I think 7.8% on a Basel III basis. Are you where you need to be yet or does your different strategy in Asia, so you're needing to build capital higher than peers and certainly higher from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the ugly sister, Phil  is actually &#x2013; he's &#x2013; I think he's well positioned to take advantage of some of the tasks that we have actually set ourselves, have been done this half. That will flow through, the benefits of that will flow through into the second half of next year. And also, the different pricing mechanism we've now introduced is going to be much easier, I think, to manage our margin more effectively, Craig. So, I think we've got the building blocks in place thereto actually bring that &#x2013; the performance back.</p>
          <p>In terms of the capital, I wish I knew. Every time we seem to get to the place that we want to be, our regulators say we require more capital. It is an issue for the industry, how much is enough. I mean  if you look at what we &#x2013; how much capital we are holding now compared to pre-crisis., we're actually holding double the amount of capital that we had in 2007 to support the same size business on a like-for-like basis. That has all been at the behest of regulators. And we continue to be told that we require more capital for this, more capital for that. So it is as difficult a situation we're in, and it is still not very clear. All I can tell you is that capital requests never seem to go down. It appears to be one way. But at some stage, this has to stop because it's going to have an effect on the underlying economy.</p>
          <p>You cannot keep going and just forever increasing capital requirements. So I think some of these regulators have no natural predators, that's the problem. And therefore, they are &#x2013; there hasn't been, I think, not all the dots have been joined. So now we are where we are, we're in a good position in terms of our competitors is all I could say.</p>

          <p>Thanks and good morning. Your domestic commercial lending book in light of recent comments actually grew by a fairly respectable 7% year-on-year.

          <p>We give you a breakdown on page 52 of the results announcement. So that 7% growth you see it's particularly coming out of business banking, is the main one with 9%, and 13% coming out of small business banking is us trying to reclaim some of the ground in those parts of the business. Tougher in regional and commercial, obviously, because that's an economically a tough environment that I think only had 4%, but still quite respectable. And then Esanda sitting at about 4% as well in its leasing business. So it's particularly us making more and more inroads into some of our traditional territory in the business banking and small business customers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'll just add that it's a very deliberate strategy to rebuild the ANZ presence in that small and medium-sized business markets. We think it's a very natural place, we think that medium-term profitability there is more secure than it is likely to be on the consumer side of the business. The brand works there, our capabilities in Institutional and in the Region play well, particularly for those businesses that are focused in on import or export and therefore our trade finance capability has got leverage as well and it supports the foreign exchange business. So we see taking what is a very strong market position that we've had in Institutional and then trying to recalibrate our commercial and middle markets positioning in line with that is a very natural thing for us to do, and it gives us a much better and more stable source of earnings within the overall Australian business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, gentlemen. Just to take Craig's point further on capital, how does operational risk sort of fit into the picture, because if I triangulate a couple of points you're clearly the most critical Australian bank CEO with respect to Basel III. CBA's new CEO suggested a key reason for not off-shoring is the elevated operational risk that you face in Asia. So therefore, could you sort of take us through a couple of points; one, what is the nature and extent of your offshore operations? Has APRA audited those functions? And if operational risk is elevated from off-shoring, what are the implications for capital and how do you trade off that cost versus capital equation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't think there is any difference in your operational risk profile. It doesn't matter where you actually put your operational centers. I would dispute the fact that there is any difference. In fact, what matters is how you run them. It is the efficiency and the talent that you have actually running them. And yes, APRA do inspect our operational hubs as a matter of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perhaps a tricky question, but given the renewed emphasis on cost management in the organization, will you have to give up the corporate jet?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now, just to add that the banking personnel in those offshore, they may be located offshore but they're ANZ personnel. So I think one of the points, if I recall it correctly, that Ian Narev was making was that quite often in off-shoring you're actually putting your operations outside of your company and that you lose some control over risk that way, whereas it's a different outcome for us.</p>

          <p>Plus it provides a geographic diversity as well. Rather than everything being in Melbourne or everything being in Sydney, it means we're spread across three additional locations with the backup that that provides.</p>

          <p>Thanks. And I think with that &#x2013; I know there is a couple of questions in Sydney, but we might follow those up after the presentation. We've been going for quite a while now. So with that, Mike, do you have any closing comments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes I will. I'll close just by thanking you for coming along today. As I said, I think this is a pretty strong result in what are fairly difficult operating environment. And I think again that this is another clear example where we can see that the benefits of our strategy are now beginning to come through in terms of real result.</p>
          <p>So with that, thank you for attending. Many thanks.</p>
