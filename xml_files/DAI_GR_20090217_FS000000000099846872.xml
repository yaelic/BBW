          <p>Good afternoon from Stuttgart. This is Dieter Buhl from Daimler Investor Relations. On behalf of Daimler, I would like to welcome you on both the telephone and the Internet to our full year results conference call. We are happy to have with us today the Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, Dr. Dieter Zetsche; the Head of Daimler Trucks, Andreas Renschler and the CFO, Bodo Uebber.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, Daimler's business performance in 2008 told two completely different stories. We had an extremely successful first half year followed by an abrupt downturn of markets in the second half. With this background, I begin by pointing out three basic facts. First Daimler is in a relatively strong position to face this crisis. During the first half of 2008, we proved how well we perform under normal conditions.</p>
          <p>Second, we have adapted to the extreme conditions that have prevailed since the end of the third quarter and our measures are proving to be effective. Third, both of those facts give us the opportunity to emerge strengthened from this exceptional situation and we will seize this opportunity.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to last year's figures beginning with the fourth quarter. Dramatic reverse in market conditions had a substantial impact on our Q4 earnings. Mercedes-Benz Cars posted a loss. Daimler Trucks earnings were reduced mainly by expenditures related to the repositioning of our Truck business in North America. Mercedes-Benz Vans remained at the previous year's good level while slightly increasing margin.</p>
          <p>Q4 earnings at Daimler Buses were somewhat below the fourth quarter of 2007, which had been exceptionally strong. At Daimler Financial Services, there was an increase in earnings compared with the previous year's fourth quarter which had been impacted by expenditures following our separation from Chrysler Financial Services.</p>
          <p>In addition to these developments in our divisions, the fourth quarter of 2008 was substantially burdened by charges of &#x20AC;2 billion connected with Chrysler. Excluding the impact from Chrysler and other special effects, fourth quarter EBIT amounted to &#x20AC;272 million profit.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a look at our results for the full year 2008 starting with cash flow. In 2007, our industrial business delivered a positive free cash flow of &#x20AC;7.6 billion compared with a negative &#x20AC;3.9 billion in 2008. The figure for 2007 included cash inflows of nearly &#x20AC;5 billion from the transfer of EADS shares and from the sale of real estate in Japan.</p>
          <p>In 2008, cash inflows from the sale of Potsdamer Platz in Berlin and the transfer of EADS shares partly offset the cash outflows for the acquisition of Tognum shares and the payment of the subordinate loan to Chrysler. The negative cash flow of &#x20AC;3.9 billion primarily resulted from an increase in working capital of &#x20AC;3.8 billion. This is largely due to the sharp drop in unit sales of Mercedes-Benz cars in the fourth quarter. Other factors include new vehicle launches and the build out of the new E-Class predecessor, disproportionately high payments to our suppliers at the end of the year, the temporary increase in investment expenditure associated with the launch of the new E-Class, investments in technologies for reducing CO2 emissions as well as our acquisition of strategic interest in the Russian truck manufacturer Kamaz.</p>
          <p>So what have we done in the second half of 2008 and since to strengthen our position in this more than turbulent market environment? First of all, we are preparing to cope with all contingencies and are therefore planning for several different scenarios. However, in each of these scenarios a key role is played by three levers. Consistent and aggressive crisis management, further sustainable efficiency improvements and future oriented long-term investments in new products, technologies and markets.</p>
          <p>One of the crucial levers for improving our cash flow is the reduction of our vehicle inventory. In December of 2008, we therefore began to adjust our production program. Since December we've been producing fewer vehicles than we sell. As a result, reduced our vehicle inventory by 40,000 units by the end of January compared to last year's peak figure. We plan to reduce our vehicle inventory to normal levels by this summer thus further reducing our working capital.</p>
          <p>We've also introduced a strict system of cash management. We've subjected all budgets to a rigid to review process. And we are also fundamentally reevaluating the necessity of all investment projects that are not directly related to vehicles, such as for example in the areas of IT and Real Estate. As a result, we are postponing all expenditures with no direct relevance to our competitiveness. Of course that includes our new office building Stuttgart-Untert&#xFC;rkheim.</p>
          <p>The shorter work times that have become necessary as part of our program adjustments are leading to savings in labor cost and other contributions improving our cash flow. At Mercedes-Benz Cars and in our Van business unit, we have introduced short-time work almost everywhere. Approximately 50,000 employees are affected in total.</p>
          <p>In addition, at our headquarters and in our divisions we will institute collective work breaks that are covered by vacation and flexi days. We've almost fully utilized the instrument of flexible work time accounts. These actions are being supplemented by a series of further measures including waiving salary increases for senior executives, reducing the number of temporary workers, suspending our employee shares program and strictly limiting participation in external training programs and the use of external consultants.</p>
          <p>Now, group-wide administrative functions we expect to be able to save about 23% this year compared to 2004 thanks to our new management model. That means that we fully achieved our goals connected with the new management model. The full effect of these measures will first be realized this year. In absolute numbers, we are counting more than &#x20AC;1 billion in annual savings.</p>
          <p>All in all, when we add our short-term crisis measures and our continuing efficiency enhancements, the anticipated overall savings in all of our divisions in 2009 over 2008 of several billion euros this year. With &#x20AC;8 billion, we have a good level of gross liquidity for our continuing operations. The unusually high liquidity at the end of 2007 was related to the sale of a majority interest in Chrysler. As a result of the decrease, we have achieved a level of liquidity appropriate to the Daimler group. The net liquidity of the industrial business decreased to &#x20AC;3.1 billion due partially to the cash flow development, but also to the share buyback.</p>
          <p>Various bond issues in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in January 2009 have shown that we have good access to the capital market although currently at higher refinancing cost. In 2009, we have bonds due for refinancing in an amount of &#x20AC;8 billion and similar amounts in 2010 and 2011.  This means that we require long term refinancing for approximately &#x20AC;2 billion in each of the coming quarters. We see no problem in placing this volume in the market. Our credit relations with our partner banks worldwide are stable. In addition, we augmented our non-utilized credit lines in the autumn of 2008.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we remain focused on key long term objectives, that's why we will not cut our investments in new products, green technologies or important growth markets. Our rule of thumb is that the best remedy in hard times is innovative automobiles and that's exactly what we've got. This year will be the year of the E-Class as a sedan, a Coupe and a station wagon. Customer response to date has been very positive. We've already received more than 35,000 orders for the sedan since the order book was opened in Western Europe on January 12. That order rate is even better than the already good rate we had for the new C-Class when it came to the market two years ago. The official E-Class market launch is scheduled for March.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter we will launch the new generation S-Class, which will be followed in third quarter by the new generation GL-Class. So, we continually update our extensive product range by introducing attractive new models through 2009. Our commercial vehicle business will focus among other things on the new Actros which will be available in all model variants in 2009. In general, clean and economical vehicles will play a key role in the market success of our product, That's why despite the economic crisis we'll remain firmly committed to our strategy for sustainable mobility. And we are making excellent progress, both with regard to the optimization of combustion engines and with hybridization as well as with full electric cars powered by petro-diesel fuel cells.</p>
          <p>We will make further advances in each of these areas throughout 2009 and beyond. And in giving you just some of the background let me first turn to the drive technology that will determine the most significant reduction of road traffic emissions in the short and medium term; the combustion engine. Our new four-cylinder diesel engine offers an excellent example of just how green and dynamic an innovative combustion engine can be these days. No other four-cylinder engine provides as much torque and at the same time it consumes only 5.3 liters of diesel per 100 kilometers in our new E-Class. That corresponds to only 139 grams of CO2 emissions per kilometer.</p>
          <p>2009 also marks the launch of Daimler's hybrid offensive in the passenger car segment which will kick off with the S 400 BlueHYBRID. This vehicle is not only the first German series-produced hybrid but also and more importantly, the first hybrid model worldwide that comes with innovative lithium-ion technology. We'll also produce a small volume of Mercedes-Benz B-Class models equipped with a fuel cell drive system this year.</p>
          <p>Towards the end of the year we launched a second generation electric smart within the framework of major pilot project. And next year, we'll start production of a limited series Mercedes model with a battery electric drive as well. The speed at which we can move ahead in the area of electric mobility heavily depends on available battery technology and lithium-ion batteries play a crucial role there. We have therefore, secured direct access to this important technology through our participation in li-Tec GmbH, a global leader in the production of lithium-ion cells.</p>
          <p>All of this costs money but is money well spent. In total, Daimler invests more than &#x20AC;10 billion in research and development in 2009 and 2010. Such investment is important, because it will ultimately determine which companies will emerge strongest from the crisis. Another area where we continue to move ahead is the expansion of our presence in the major growth markets of Russia, India and China. It's true, the emerging markets are also being impacted by the global economic crisis. However, our industry's long-term growth will be concentrated in these regions where the potential is still enormous.</p>
          <p>Now, with regard to the outlook for this year, we cannot give you any specific guidance at this time. Based on developments that we consider probable for today's perspective, global demand for cars in 2009 could decline by at least an additional 10% compared with 2008. At the same time, the market could bottom out in the second half of the year. However, in terms of our cost targets we also preparing for a worse development.</p>
          <p>The outlook for major commercial vehicle markets is not good. In total therefore Daimler is prepared for significantly lower business volumes in 2009. Unit sales will continue to fall and we also anticipate further substantial pressure on earnings both at group level and at the individual divisions. The first quarter, will be significantly negative.</p>
          <p>Due to the full availability of the new E-Class and the effect of our efficiency measures, we anticipate a gradual improvement as the year progresses. This is also based on the assumption that there will be some economic recovery in the second half of the year. We'll provide more precise statements on earnings later in the year when it becomes easier to predict where the world economy and the markets are headed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We will take the first question today from Jochen Gehrke at Deutsche Bank, Frankfurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I would ask two questions Dr. Zetsche, number one on working capital, could you maybe just give us a bit of a feeling how working capital should progress over the year 2009 now that you've moved to short work week? Should we see already an improvement in the first quarter and how long do you need to bring working capital back down to a normalized level? And secondly, on your cost reductions, I understand that in the press conference you mentioned several billion in cost targets for the current year. Could you just clarify at least in terms of buckets where you think those shall be coming from, should we anticipate a further restructuring measure in &#x2013; throughout the year 2009? And is this all incremental or do you count already announced cost savings such as the modular strategy, et cetera? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question, working capital, obviously the ultimate outcome is dependent on sales and production. I mean that is very basic and what we can plan for exactly is production. On our assumption for sales we assume that we will have significant progress in reducing the working capital in the first quarter. And that's &#x2013; and I'll make to the second statement a remark right afterwards and basically be done in Q2. Now the remark is that we plan to do a summer break in July, end of July, August. And if we would go with minimal inventory levels into this break, obviously we could not serve the market during and after this break anymore. Therefore, we have to prepare a little bit for this break and then right after be rather below than at our levels we are planning for.</p>
          <p>The cost cutting program, you know when we in the past have announced a specific program with numbers and categories and all of that we have very much committed to deliver exactly on those numbers. While we have a clear understanding about the scope we want to achieve, while we have already a high degree of definition how to accomplish this scope and while we're already in execution of course as we want to see the effect within 2009, we have not this precise level for the total program to be measured against and that's the reason why I have not been more specific in my statement I made before. But what this program means is that it's cost saving over the level and above the level of 2008, being effective in 2009, and of course we are using tools we have on hand like, for instance, the modular system but this will not provide for a significant improvement in 2009, specifically and especially the effect of the new E-Class with its cost structure is not counted as part of this program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, should be expect at a later stage like as you said initially with your guidance that we also get further clarity on where we stand in your cost positions and how much you think you can take out of the structure? Later in the year, I mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What would be interesting to you in this regard in the first place would be an amount of restructuring charge. At that point of time we do not have plans in this regard and therefore I think it's not necessary or it doesn't provide you with too much added value to go into too much detail with this program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from John Lawson, Citigroup, London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and good afternoon. First question, if I may, I think you said this morning, Dr. Zetsche that R&amp;D would remain quite close to the 10 billion cumulative over the next two years, which had been targeted a year ago. So, how much can you take out of the other element of spending, the PPE CapEx, which I believe was planned at around 4 billion per annum, just how much is it realistic for us to expect you to cut there? And second point, I just wanted to ask how big were the customer deposits at Mercedes-Benz Bank at the end of the year and how big is that relative to the asset base of that entity? I'm obviously wondering whether you've made any progress in regrouping the worldwide business into Mercedes-Benz Bank with a view to opting for government guarantees for your Financial Services refinancing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your questions. I don't think we have given you specific planning figures for 2009-2010 as far as R&amp;D or CapEx is concerned because we gave more rough combined numbers for the next three years or something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so in comparison to our original plan, we have reduced the R&amp;D total spending by some hundreds of millions, while protecting the contents to the maximum extent. We have, just to give you one idea for instance designed on the production side a scope of about 800 million reduction in CapEx for 2009 at that point of time. So that is the status of our efforts right there. This number was now specifically and exclusively for Mercedes Cars. So I don't give you the full scope but some idea in what steps we are moving forward. And with that, I would like to move onto both Bodo to give you more information about our Mercedes Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have in &#x2013; at the end of the year, we had 6 billion in terms of deposits in the Mercedes-Benz Bank and you know that we have increased our rates during the course of January and currently we are not finished with the order backlog. So to say, we are at 8 billion and our portfolio is roughly 16 billion. In this regard we plan also to present information. Of course the question is where do we use this kind of liquidity? You know that we are having Spain as a branch of the Mercedes-Benz Bank, so it means we have our Spanish portfolio within the bank and we plan to do so also, for example, for UK. So that means also we are optimizing our European portfolio there to use this kind of liquidity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At this stage, you've not applied for anything I guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Applied, so your second question, of course as we always said we are watching the situation there. As I said before we have right now enough liquidity in the Mercedes-Benz Bank. But if we do get to competitive disadvantages to our competitors, we will have the option to do so but that we will decide at a later stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is coming from Daniel Schwarz from Commerzbank, Frankfurt. Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, thank you. I have one question on cash flow. In the first quarter, you expect a negative income for the Group but with the planned reduction of working capital do you expect a positive free cash flow in the first half or in other words have you already been at the low point with regard to net liquidity? And the second question is regarding trucks, you significantly increased your market share in trucks in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, especially in Germany. Is that due to the rollout of the Actros and can we expect a similar development in other markets going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, regarding your first question we have addressed it also in the press conference. We'd like to stay with our guidance as we said, first quarter P&amp;L was our remarks negative &#x2013; substantial negative. And as we said we plan to &#x2013; what Dieter Zetsche said to reduce our working capital in the first two quarters with the statement Dieter made to the end of the second quarter where we have this downtime planned in July. So, then we will address in the first and the second quarter the cash for the working capital and more we don't want to say right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the slight increase we had in Germany in the fourth quarter was based on new Actros, we launched as the new truck of the year in 2008. And this was one of the impacts. The second was that we had a little bit challenge, if you remember in the first quarter with delivery, that was dragged through the year and that's the reason we ended up with a slightly higher market share.</p>
          <p>Depending on the other region you asked, if you can see there the same effect or the first effect will be not there any longer. We have no shortage with suppliers. We tried to stabilize and if there are possibilities to increase the market share. But we have a very good position market share around the world and we are in a very good position so it will be very tough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Aleksej Wunrau from BHF-Bank Frankfurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Aleksej Wunrau. Three questions if I may please. You've fully written down your receivables with Chrysler but you continue or you resume component deliveries to that company. So, I wonder whether we have to brace for some future one-offs in this regard? Secondly, the funding status of your pension plans &#x2013; well, reveals some gap. So, my question is whether they are going to be any annual contributions to that plan and if this is going to weigh down on cash flows? And thirdly on page 19 of your presentation Dr. Zetsche, you mentioned cost savings of this 1.2 billion from the new management program.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, next question is from Christian Breitsprecher from Oppenheim Research, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, it's Christian Breitsprecher from Oppenheim. I have two questions. One on your credit lines outstanding, could you tell us just the amount of unused credit lines that you still have? And secondly with regard to the whole state of your value chain, I mean is there any risk that you may have to take equity stakes in suppliers or that you will have to extend loans to suppliers because they just don't get any funding from banks? How stable is this situation, do you think that the worst is behind us or is Q1 or Q2 really the point in time where the whole value chain might get under such significant pressure, that you may have to use extraordinary measures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll start with your second question, and then Bodo will talk about the credit lines. Supply network, we have relatively good transparency today compared like two, three years ago, with early warning systems about the status quo of our suppliers. That's the good news. The bad news is that what we see is not very pleasant. And these are of course, individual cases which we deal with on an individual basis. Typically as in the industry because almost all of these suppliers deliver to all or most of the OEMs in Germany, and this is a kind of a routine where we venture together and decide in every specific case what to do, if to do something what to do. I don't foresee the situation where we would come up with equity, in any one of those cases. I don't exclude this possibility but I don't foresee it at this state.</p>
          <p>There are numbers of different ways to react between doing nothing to giving loans or talking about prices or whatever. It very much depends on what is the reason for the problem the supplier is in on the one hand and on the other hand how dependent we are on these specific deliveries.</p>
          <p>There &#x2013; we have seen definitely a significant increase in cases we have deal with. We have not seen major crashes to some extent because we have better preemptive actions and transparency to some extent but of course it can happen tomorrow morning. So, I definitely can't exclude that.  I don't think that we have seen the worst. The number of suppliers who are thinly stretched is still growing and is significant and that's an industry problem we have to deal with together as an industry. And hopefully as far as their problem is in terms if it is just the lack of financing for an otherwise stable and promising supplier we of course try to encourage the banks to play their role.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even in this regard we had three days ago a supplier where we could/couldn't convince the bank to step in. So, of course it's not excluded that we can convince with our treasury guys the banks to stay in this company. So, we do everything what we can, also of course to avoid that we have liquidity outflow all the time now.</p>
          <p>To your second question, the credit lines, we have two credit lines one is a $5 billion credit line which is committed and unused, until the end of 2011 and just last year we did a 3 billion credit line as a commercial paper back up and also for corporate purposes &#x20AC;3 billion, 364 days means October 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Horst Schneider, HSBC in D&#xFC;sseldorf. Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Horst Schneider here from HSBC. Quickly two questions, the first one is on your market guidance for global automobile demand. It strikes me that you guide only here for a decline of 10% in 2009 but when I listen to statements of your peers like for example Volkswagen which is guiding for demand decline of 20% even this year. I ask myself how conservative that guidance is or that market guidance is? So could you please breakup your market expectation by regions and in particular I would be interested in your expectations for the Western European and the North American markets and also I would be interested to know if you expect premium car demand to decline more than the global demand for automobiles in general? And then last question is on possible cooperation with BMW, I don't know if you have mentioned that already in your presentation, sorry therefore if I asked again but could you give any more details if and when you could announce more details on a possible cooperation with BMW? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As far as your first question is concerned, we kind of addressed our divisions if you want in split way. On the cost side we made much more conservative assumptions to &#x2013; conservative means more negative assumptions as far as the market development is concerned. And to the revenue sales side of the house, we said that we would expect the development in the range as you were mentioning as we said at least 10% minus, and in this regard we assume that the current status which is clearly further down will continue for at least the first half, that we will see some recovery in the second half. But once again we are prepared in our plan for a more negative development which basically then would not see any recovery in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give us...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>As Bodo said we're talking scenarios.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry, can you give a bit more detail what is your worst case assumption then you're planning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a split by market, what do you expect by region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can just give you an example for instance when you take North America, obviously we are having there a range of about 13 to 11 million between the scenarios I was just talking about.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, well, I'll leave it there. BMW, Daimler there are no news which would come from the participants in these discussions there are many so-called news from the media. The fact is that we informed quite some time ago that between the two companies we are evaluating potential opportunities of work together in some fields like we do in hybrids and still today we have nothing to inform about it but obviously the topic is so exciting that we see other sources to give information which are none.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Philippe Houchois from UBS London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions please, the first one is I'm looking at your operating leverage at Mercedes in the fourth quarter. It looks quite high. If I summed it right, you've lost about 1.8 billion of operating earnings on a 3 billion drop in revenue. That seems much worse than what we've seen elsewhere in the sector so far. Is there anything unusual and I know you don't supply your profit bridge but if you can provide some clarity on why we had such a drop?</p>
          <p>And the other question I have is more for Bodo. On the cash position that you report at the end of the year of 3.1 billion, how much of that cash is actually tied up in the Financial Services business? And that are you still in a position where you feel like this cash can be brought back to the industrial side and, i.e., refinanced in the markets or should we consider that cash is permanently gone to the Fin Co.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps what I could mention in regard to the fourth quarter and your question is that there is a significant amount coming from the difference of the E-Class in the fourth quarter 2007 versus the fourth quarter 2008, where obviously we are in the last phase of the run out with volume and margin very much depressed in a segment which is a key contributor to our overall profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we can't see how mix effects, yeah. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is certainly one important element. We have exchange rates there and we have &#x2013; which is well a significant chunk is exchange rate as well. We had some one-timers which are not reported, one-timers but non-recurring issues included. Overall our base levels like the productivity in our plants, like raw material developed pretty positive, so there were &#x2013; even raw material for the full year was 1.5% reduction in spite of significant raw material increases. But it's basically revenues and thereby as I said, a major impact from the E-Class and from exchange rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so there's no inter-group lending from parent to Fin Co.?</p>

          <p>The next question is from John Buckland. [MAN Securities]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. I assume that we haven't got any profit and loss or balance sheet numbers with these results, so I just wondered if you can give me two numbers if they are available. What is the inventory at the year-end? It was 17.3 billion at the end of September for the industrial business. And also what the trade payable number was at the end of December, it was 8.3 at the end of September, I wonder if those numbers are available?</p>
          <p>On the Truck business, I wonder if you could give us how the order intake has developed in January and in February. It's obviously very &#x2013; pretty awful in the fourth quarter. And given that you're restructuring the U.S. operations for a cyclical downturn and perhaps not the recovery you expect in North America, I just wonder whether you are thinking about doing a similar thing for the European Truck operation given the outlook for that market is equally dire? And just on the issues of cost cutting, restructuring. Under what circumstances will these temporary layoffs, will the short-time working have to become a more permanent feature and therefore, you will have to have restructuring and perhaps adjust your cost base on a more permanent base to lower volume, lower mix environment? I mean where are we? How close are we to that much tougher decision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While Bodo is looking for year-end inventories, Andreas can start to talk about Trucks in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a European question actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I got your question right, this was the question of the order intake in January and February. I think more or less they follow the line you saw in the fourth quarter of last year and that's over all the regions comparable. The second question if I got it right was market forecast for Europe for trucks. So it's tough to say, of course. And like Dieter said, Dieter Zetsche said, we're focusing on different scenarios. If you ask me I think a decrease of 30% is more than realistic in Europe. In United States it will be &#x2013; it looks like it's slightly above our &#x2013; there is also a decrease compared to 2008, a slight decrease in United States. The Japanese market, it looks like that it has reached the bottom line, the Japanese market. If you look to the rest of world that means Far East, also Middle East, there is also a decrease for sure. But again the best thing what we can do is focus on the different scenarios and find ways through, if production &#x2013; if all the/with other measurements we can take then &#x2013; that we still can fulfill our targets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are satisfied with the Truck answer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I was wondering whether if &#x2013; given that the European market peak to trough variation is likely to be similar to that of the U.S., and we could have an extended downturn given the level of order intake and you've restructured the U.S. operations. I mean are you not going to &#x2013; you're not needing to do the same for Europe? And also I wonder whether the same question applies to the Vans where you actually increased capacity recently, didn't you and yet we were facing a similar poor outlook for those products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look to Trucks Europe first, I think what we have done so far is through our programs tried to prepare ourselves to &#x2013; for this kind of situation. So in normal terms of a downturn we are prepared to come through a level of a 30% decrease in the market in our plans without further measures because we have worked with temporary, we have a very high degree in temporary workforce. They are gone by the end of the year and we have also worked with time accounts. So at the end of the year we have an average in our truck plants of positive time account of 250, 260 hours. So, first of all, we try to fix this with this counter measure. If there are more measures necessary we can go, for example, to the reduced working hours per week and such measures. Now, somehow like I said this is the situation in Europe and we will see how long this is going in the different scenarios. First of all, we have to use what we have prepared ourselves and the second thing is to then fill the measures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then of course on the Truck side, Europe different from the U.S. We do not have five, four or five smaller plants for consideration but we have basically one big plant, not counting the small one in Turkey and that's a very different production footprint between the two countries. The same more or less applies to plants as well. The plants, I mean are very concentrated production in one and half week shifts.  The plans we had for expansion we have stopped in time and not invested in this direction. So, that's not going to the wrong direction. And not talking about the Chinese production which would start middle of this year but that's obviously for this market which you can't access in a different way, but the plan for D&#xFC;sseldorf and Lukensfeld have been stopped. And you had the other question about the workforce. We have no plans of layoffs at that time and I do not want to speculate about potential activities in potential scenarios as far as this area is concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I had a lot of time to look up the numbers. Of course you'll find these numbers the 27th of February, when we disclose our annual report and 20-F and to all of course, and I would ask you all to look at these numbers. So the preliminary numbers right now for the inventories are 16.8 billion and for the trade payables are 6.5 billion. If you compare this to the third quarter, you see a big movement in the trade payables which we have also commented today in the press conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, Max Warburton with Sanford Bernstein. I've got some questions on mix but just wondering if I can come back to Philippe Houchois' question on the inter-company loan, a question for Mr. Uebber. Page 21 of your presentation has the components of the gross liquidity and the net liquidity. Could you just help us all understand what the positive number is in short-term financing liabilities in the industrial business? There is number of 6,057 which seems to be a positive liability, what is that if that's not a loan to the Financial Services company? That's the first question. And then can I come back on the mix questions, could we just get to the bottom of this liquidity question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, flipping through a whole of lot of pages but we got there. Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps you ask your second half of your question and we can start answering that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, okay, thank you. Yeah, I mean, Dr. Zetsche I really had a more strategic question for you just on mix and it's got three small parts. I mean, the first question is, are you seeing any positive signs on mix, just in terms of orders coming into Mercedes in the last month or so? I mean maybe there is no orders, but from what you're saying, when you said something about E-Class orders, is there any sign that moderating fuel prices is giving us a bit of a positive boost to engine mix within the model ranges? That's the first part.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I mean obviously thinking about the small car strategy, are you still determined to go ahead and build this second small car plant, I think in Hungary? There was some stuff in the local press there saying that you had broken ground and were going to start building a new A, B-Class plant. And then thirdly, just sort of strategically, I mean if &#x2013; I imagine the wise thing to do is wait a little while and see what mix looks like and try and figure how much is cyclical and temporary and how much might be more structural. But if the problem is structural, could you just give us your thoughts on how Mercedes repositions itself to be effectively more of a small car company? How does Mercedes start to get pricing and pricing power in small cars and what sort of things would you do differently to last time with smart and A-Class? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's an easy one. First of all, as far as mix is concerned and currently we have seen, as I mentioned before, to quite some extent driven by the life cycle of the E-Class significant over proportional decline in that segment. And as I mentioned this morning, we have seen in the first four weeks 35,000 orders coming from Europe for the new E-Class, which is a higher absolute number than in the same four weeks after start of sales for the C-Class two years ago in an very positive economic environment. So, I consider that pretty good news for the E-Class and for our mix altogether.</p>
          <p>We, when you for instance, look to the U.S. market you can see that the share between cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans beginning of 2007 was X and August 2008 the share of cars grew significantly on sacrificing the sale of &#x2013; the share of SUVs, pickups to some extent and minivans. When you go to December 2008 or January 2009, you will see that you have basically the exact same share of cars compared to beginning of 2007 and SUVs and minivans and pickups. So, there the change was almost entirely in correlation with gasoline prices and not with any other discussion. Of course, oil is very much down but mix is, as I just said, within the car segment there was a move towards more four cylinder engines and more smaller cars but the overall mix was the way I just said.</p>
          <p>Now, looking more forward, first of all, Hungary as you asked, as we have said before we plan on four different models in the segment of the A and B-Class compared to the two models we're having today. And we are very confident based on these very different models, which all we think are very appealing, we will have significant volume increases in that segment, which we cannot supply for out of the capacity of Rastatt. That was the reason for the new plant in Hungary and nothing has changed in this regard.</p>
          <p>Looking further forward, I do not have any indications that our typical clientele would prefer to drive in smaller cars, less safe, less comfortable cars than they do today. What they do either for their own sake or for the pressure of the neighbors want to see is lower CO2 emissions, less fuel consumption. And that's why we are working diligently towards reducing the CO2 level of our fleet not by selling smart instead of S-Classes but by reducing the respective CO2 emission levels significantly in all segments. And when you talk about an E-Class with 500 Newton-meters and 5.3 liters fuel consumption, I think you can see where we are going with pretty big steps.</p>
          <p>I don't see the need or any justification but I don't see either a way to turn Mercedes into a small car company. Once again in a strategic way selling smarts instead of S-Classes. We have with the smart certain &#x2013; certainly given the size of the vehicle and the segment pricing power. This is not an entry level vehicle pricing which we can charge with smart and even in the current situation we have very low discounts on smarts. They are, I would say lower than in any other of our segments. So, yes, we have some pricing power there but I don't think that I would see a viable business case for Mercedes to become a Peugeot or Fiat with a star of the hood as a company. And, but once again that's not that I am saying it because we don't know how to get there but because I see no reason to expect that customers would be reduced in numbers who want to have comfortable, safe, spacious vehicles with some status, which are very fuel-efficient.</p>

          <p>So, we &#x2013; the Group is longer funded in the debt market. That you can clearly see in the second column, where we have the long-term financing liabilities and that money, the 6 billion here, is short-term money we're giving to the Financial Services side. So, we are more conservatively funded, which means if you look also at the consolidated numbers, you see of course it's not anymore there because you're at industrial business and Financial Services. What means, at the end of day that the 3.1 billion is net liquidity industrial.</p>

          <p>Next question is from Thierry Huon from Exane, Paris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. This is Thierry Huon from Exane in Paris. I've got a question on the residual value because I heard this morning you said that you are seeing some improvement on that side when BMW said exactly the opposite last week, so I would like to have more details on that and if this improvement is also for the luxury segment? And I've got another question on the short-time scheme that you may implement going forward. Could you explain to us how it works and what is the compensation that Mercedes would have to pay to its workers if this scheme is implemented? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for your question first, residual values, to some extent &#x2013; first, to clarify. What I said doesn't mean that we would be by now at better residual value levels than we were in the fourth quarter 2008. We had within the fourth quarter a further decline and then a turned- turning point and an improvement in the last month which continues in the first month of this year. Secondly, to some extent we are talking about a Mercedes specific effect. For instance, in Germany, this is very much influenced by our young used cars, one-year-old, half-year-old, which is basically rental and employee car business in the first place.</p>
          <p>As we saw inventories building, we very much reduced supply in this regard. Plus a better used car market led to the fact that our inventory there came down sharply and prices recovered. That is not totally opposite to the industry trend right now, but we certainly have more momentum in this regard with Mercedes in Germany.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. we have two effects, which are in different directions. One effect is that we have a growing number of leased cars coming back as the industry does at this time, so this goes back three years, where these percentages were increasing. These cars are coming back. At the same time we have a growing percentage of the cars being sold through our retail network, which is the consequence of an initiative we took a year ago and which is very effective. And of course the big auctions are putting much more pressure on resale values than the retail used car business. So altogether in the U.S, we have seen the turning point as well, let's say, as well within the last two months and an increased activity on the used car side. So once again, if that's a trend I can't tell you, but I can say that the development in the last two months on that front was encouraging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And about the compensation for short-time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have regulations, which apply per state in Germany. They are different from state-to-state. And, for instance, in Baden-W&#xFC;rttemberg we have a very strange situation where the net income of the worker declines with the working hours declining and then when it goes towards zero the net income goes up to 100% again. So it is pretty strange this legislation, but that's what it is, very different from, for instance, Bremen where another major plant of ours, where we voluntarily added some to what we have legally to pay for short-term. Altogether I think it's fair to say that while we have reduced from 35 to 25 hours in our plants we have about which is what's 10 out of, that's about 30% something. We have, if you want residual cost of about five points &#x2013; yeah, five percentage points. So, it's a relatively good deal to avoid residual cost when you are taking your labor down. When you talk about a period up to 18 months it's the most cost effective way of adjusting production to lower sales volumes.</p>

          <p>We will take the next question from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley, London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Adam Jonas. Just a follow-up on the work structure in Germany, can you confirm that you have halted the early retirement program? I think, in all your plants but substantially in Germany as you're kind of shifting more towards short-time and can you say that this is going to be &#x2013; as long as you have the short-time at your disposal that your early retirement program will remain shut, not working?</p>
          <p>The next question is on the E-Class, you mentioned in this call and on the press call that you've been very pleased with the order intake, 35,000 orders, you mentioned it's higher than the C-Class which is &#x2013; typically sells more volume. I think you referred to it in Europe where the orders were very strong. Now, maybe I'm not the only one here that's scratching my head, thinking who's buying an E-Class in this environment, where are these orders coming from? Which countries are they coming in at a strong level or is this just early taxi fleets or some other technicality you'd like to let us be aware of?</p>
          <p>And then finally, on the dealers, you mentioned the distress on the supply side which I think we can all understand. But what about downstream at the dealer level, are you seeing dealers, any dealers going insolvent? And if so or if not yet, but if this were to happen, what happens to the receivables from the dealer? Do you write them off completely against EBITDA, can you just from an accounting perspective tell us how you treat that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first part, we have no ongoing early retirement program. We did a very, very small number of early retirements, but that's like a two digit number, around the end of last year, beginning of this year. This is a relatively or very costly way of reducing workforce, which at that point of time we don't think being prudent to be applied.</p>
          <p>E-Class, first of all, in general terms, my assessment is that reductions in volume car sales are at least to some and perhaps a higher degree related to a shortfall in purchasing power of the respective clients whereas reductions in premium car sales is to my understanding, primarily related to psychology when you just lost some of your assets at the stock market or you have difficult restructuring in the company you own or things like that, you're not necessarily in the mood to buy a new BMW, Mercedes, you name it.</p>
          <p>This for me is a reason why I think we have a chance for a faster recovery because obviously the mood can change faster than purchasing power. And secondly, we have a huge clientele of former E-Class owners or current E-Class owners. This is the classic Mercedes, the E-Class and many of these customers are certainly financially able to buy a new car and are curious about the successor and hear all these wonderful stories about very low fuel consumption, extremely high level of safety equipment and so on. And therefore, first of all, this is not any technicality or anything but it's just orders, admittedly a portion of it coming from dealers as well. So these are not all customer orders but it's a mix, just like it was with the C-Class at the same time. So, those numbers are totally comparable and the fact is just that this absolute number is higher for the same period of time than it was for with C-Class, which once again I think is a good indication.</p>
          <p>Dealers downstream distressed, we informed, for instance, last year that in Germany we did some general support program which was related to some different distribution of risks on residual values as well in the magnitude of I think 60 million or something in this range. And there are some &#x2013; have been some local programs of this kind in other markets as well, by far not to that magnitude. So we are of course looking at the profitability and capitalization of our dealer body in the respective markets. In some cases, we see the necessity of doing something in general terms or we see the necessity to do something on an individual basis or we don't see this necessity. So to some extent, this will lead to some restructuring as well, not necessarily there where we would like to see it. But we will not stop all of that from happening and we can't.</p>
          <p>Probably Bodo can give you better information about the fact that we are floor planning to a very high extent our dealers and therefore, we basically own the inventory and have less risk of receivables in this regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dieter was right. Thus to the extent the process we have implemented, the companies like on the supplier side, we have a weekly meeting between treasury, sales and Financial Services to exchange all the information, of course, we have from the dealer. And we do, let's say an assessment, what we do in a specific case and that we do sort of say for each and every country. And Dieter is right, from a risk point of view, of course, the stuff is floor planned, so it's asset-backed at the end of the day and normally our risk costs are from an average percentage of course lower than from a pure retail point of view.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, good afternoon. I have two questions. First of all, on the residual value risk, if I understand correctly what you said, should we assume that you rule out having to book further provisions for residual value risk, be it in the U.S. or in Europe? Second question on Chrysler, I was wondering what is today your assessment of the residual risk on Chrysler both in terms of liabilities and in terms of P&amp;L? Am I right in thinking that now that the &#x2013; your participation is worth zero that you won't have to book any further, equity losses in the coming quarters? And sorry, I have a final question on a clarification on the outlook. When you say that you will be losing money in Q1 at Group level, are you talking operating or net profit? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last one was related to EBIT. The first one, we cannot rule out. What we told you is that within the last two months we see a positive development and now we &#x2013; always when we talk about the future start to speculate is that a trend, is that a stabilization or will we see another turning point and things will deteriorate again? Which of course very much depends on the overall development of the economy and other indicators. So, we cannot rule out. We just can tell you that the information we got from the last two months was encouraging. That's all we can say at that point of time. And Bodo, you can talk about Chrysler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Georges you were right, so the book value is zero and the loans are written-off to zero, so you're right with this. The further risk we do have is all the pension guarantee we have in place. It's a $1 billion pension guarantee, which we have guaranteed to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation in the U.S. regarding to Chrysler. And I said also in the conference call that we have of course, some assets right now, which are on transfer to Chrysler. These are the wholesale companies which we have from Chrysler and this is the ongoing business we have with Chrysler. There's certainly, you cannot exclude a risk there, but of course I cannot calculate it there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just to make it very clear, in Q1, for instance, if Chrysler reports losses, will you have to book losses to the equity in your P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's no impact on the equity accounting because the book value is zero.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we don't have any impact anymore in the P&amp;L there from the equity accounting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

          <p>The next question we take from Ranjit Unnithan from J.P. Morgan, London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Ranjit Unnithan from J.P. Morgan. Question on the Financial Services, could you comment on the cost of risk? I know it increased, maybe if you could put some numbers around that, either as a percentage of your loan book or in terms of millions of euros that would be great? And if you could comment on the delinquency trend in your loan book through the Q4 quarter and compare it to Q3 that would also be helpful? And lastly, can you comment on the sustainability of your loan book? So right now it stood at 63 billion, you issued about 30 billion of new business retail loans in last year. How do you think about managing that in '09 given where the credit markets are? Does it &#x2013; it sort of kind of implies that penetration rates have to go up for your book? If you could comment on all those points, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So regarding your question of cost of risks, we had, at the year 2008 we had 73 basis points in terms of cost of risk, so 0.73% compared to 2007 of 0.43. Of course the 0.73 is more than the net credit losses we had in 2008. Delinquency trend, of course is going up, as we had also the repossessions going up more or less all over the world, but maybe also in the U.S. So the delinquency trends, of course are, let's say getting higher. That means also for the year 2009 we do expect higher cost of risk than in the year 2008 but I do think that it's common knowledge more or less for each and every &#x2013; for the, let's say, for the automotive industry I would say.</p>
          <p>From the portfolio point of view, I do expect the portfolio cost going down. As we see our sales going down, we try to keep our support means or penetration which we had to last year's on the level we had. In some markets maybe even we have to go into the market as we see some banks drawing back from this business, so we might support it even a bit more but it depends a little bit on the liquidity situation and balancing the business there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One follow-up, so based on what you see on delinquency rates, do you have an estimate for what cost of risk could end up at in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, as long as we do not get to &#x2013; let's say we have our &#x2013; we decided to stay with our EBIT guidance as we have said, so it will go up but we will show you each quarter where.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The final call of today we take from Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse, London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks a lot, it's Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Suisse, just a more strategic question to conclude this call. I mean don't we see a very drastically changing environment for the car industry? I mean, firstly, we're probably in the decade of a technology revolution for carmakers moving to the electrical drive train posing a huge change to how cars are being sold and about individual mobility overall? Secondly, on Financial Services, is probably a business unit which has been highly supported for the last 10, 15 years and companies might face higher cost of capital, limiting support and thus growth for the overall company from Financial Services?</p>
          <p>And then in the maturing world, demand is probably not coming back to where it was years ago and if so probably it will change significantly to smaller cars. So, if you look at your company on the longer horizon, I mean don't you need to find bigger answers than everything that we are currently discussing on this call? And then leading us to potential changes and you say you talked to BMW but I mean to us it sounds like you're sending over a couple of engineers, vice versa, and you're not hearing anything back. I mean doesn't management have to take a more active role in making this company more bulletproof for the future? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for that easy question to conclude. First of all, even though all car manufacturers are making a high percentage of their communication about alternative drive train electric vehicles, we will see a long time to come where the combustion engine is the drive train of the market. So, if we would see in 10 years 5% electric cars, this would be a very high share. So the core business continues to be around combustion engines, but of course even there as we have commented various times we have to make major investments to further significantly improve the technology, as we are doing. I was just mentioning the new diesel E-Class, for instance. And we have to prepare those alternative trends as well, which requires significant R&amp;D and CapEx efforts. That is an incremental burden, no doubt.</p>
          <p>As far as financing is concerned, I would assume that world altogether will see somewhat higher cost of capital, independent of the current record low Fed rates. But what's happening now can only be addressed long run with less leverage of equity and the bank debt on with higher cost of capital, which to my understanding means that altogether the world will see a lower level of growth than it had seen in the last 10 years. But that applies to every single industry you're talking about, including automotive. So either we go to a different planet or we accept that change of the environment, which applies to us as well, that is true.</p>
          <p>And we discussed that before. I don't have any indication from individual discussions, from statistics, from customer behavior that the basic interest for a safe, comfortable, spacious car as a percentage of total car sales has changed. We have seen an increase of this percentage over the last decade and in spite of the current situation which we discussed before, I don't see a long-term trend independent of total volumes. That the mix would go from &#x2013; to small cars from larger cars, especially with a clientele which has a better living standard.</p>
          <p>You are certainly right but that again applies to all industries that growth rates in trade markets will be limited in general terms and that it will take some time until we come back to the levels we had last year and the year before. Whereas, we all expect that probably at least some of the emerging markets, especially China, will come back to former growth rates or close faster than the trade markets will recover, at least that's my expectation.</p>
          <p>So, I confirm a part of what you are saying but not as specific for the car industry but for a change which happened to the world altogether and certainly we have to adjust our company, our business system to these changes in the environment and we are working on that. But I don't think that the answer is to, I'm repeating myself, sell small cars is better &#x2013; in spite of &#x2013; instead of large cars or to sell electric cars instead of combustion engine cars. But clearly, we have to look into our overall strategy and look for adjustments, not change of direction but adjustments given the changes in the environment.</p>

          <p>Yeah, and my question regarding South Germany was more, I mean doesn't Germany really need to join forces in premium car manufacturing in order to continue being the world leading premium car manufacturing ground?</p>

          <p>Well, I mean it's not what you're really asking , but first of all, I think that's not a German question but of the two companies but that's what you mean, of course. Secondly, I agree with you that that's not the question for any technicians or whoever traveling south or north and that's not the way it's dealt with but it's not the question of the media either. And therefore, whatever the time is, the two companies should give any kind of answer to this question, whatever it is, and this is then the base for further discussion, not the speculation, which is going on outside which I accept and understand, but it's not based on the actions that are taking place.</p>
