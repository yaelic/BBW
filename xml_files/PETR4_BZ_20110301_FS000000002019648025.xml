          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call to discuss fourth quarter and 2010 results. We have a simultaneous webcast on the Internet that could be accessed at the site www.petrobras.com.br/ri/english.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, I'd like to draw your attention to Slide 2. We may make forward-looking statements which are identified by use of the words "will," expect," and similar that are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Petrobras' management and on information currently available to the company.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me mention that this conference call will discuss Petrobras' results prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, and Brazilian legislation. At this moment, we are unable to discuss any issues related to U.S. GAAP results.</p>
          <p>The conference call will be conducted by our CFO, Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa. He will comment on the company's operating and financial highlights, and the main events during this quarter, and he will be available to answer any questions you may have.</p>
          <p>Almir, please begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss fourth quarter and full-year results.</p>
          <p>2010 was a year of milestones, as we execute our long-term business plan. We completed the largest capitalization ever by acquiring the rights to produce an additional 5 billion barrels of oil. We installed six new production systems, including the first pilot system in the Lula fields. In December, we set daily and monthly production records. And for the first time, annual and daily production in Brazil exceeded 2 million barrels per day. We are more than halfway through the complete modernization of our existing refining products and are now constructing two new refineries. We have all but completed our natural gas infrastructure, and we anchored the first floating production system in Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>Next, please. Each of our business segments contributed positively to our 2010 financial results. Results for the year were strongly blessed by the rising oil production and international oil prices, strong domestic demand, and the strengthening real, and stable product price in Brazil. The balance and integration between our upstream and downstream operations and our pricing policy that kept price stable in Brazil while it increased internationally resulted in upstream Brazilian operation meeting our end goals. Gas and Energy grew on the strength of increasing demand and infrastructure, while international operation benefited from a higher price environment.</p>
          <p>The Consumer Price Index in Brazil was 5.91% in 2010, causing an increase in costs throughout our operations. Volumes transported and sold grew by 11%, leading to higher <mark type="inaudible" /> costs even as their unit costs were stable. For the year, our annual operating income was up 4%, while our net income increased by 17%.</p>
          <p>Next. For 2010, oil and gas production was 2.004 million barrels per day, up 2% for the year. We had set a target of 2.1 million barrels of oil in Brazil per day but did not reach that target. The reasons for the shortfall were unplanned stoppage requests by the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency, ANP; the need to reduce production in Marlim Leste field to increase the pressure of reservoir; and delays in the start of production systems such as Guar&#xE1; and Tiro&#x2010;S&#xED;don. It is worth highlighting the growth in natural gas production of 5% in 2010. We expect to grow even more this year as we complete the important connections to our gas network in <mark type="inaudible" />  This will allow us to incorporate non-associated gas production from <mark type="inaudible" />, including gas from the Pre-salt. Our international production increased 2%, primarily from Nigeria. This year, Cascade and Chinook in the Gulf of Mexico will start up and contribute to results.</p>
          <p>Next. For 2011, we have set a target of 2.1 million barrels of oil per day in Brazil. We are confident that we can achieve this target based on December production of 2.1 million barrels per day. And assuming an average decline of 10%, we must replace 210,000 barrels per day of decline. As you can see from the slide, we expect to meet this target from a number of changes.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> in Campos Basin will contribute 120,000 barrels per day. We have <mark type="inaudible" /> P-57 installed last year, and the installation of P-56 in July next will add another 85,000 barrels per day. We have half of the Lula pilot and the Pre-salt production in the current stage are expected to contribute 60,000 barrels per day. The addition of these 265,000 barrels per day should compensate for the decline, as well as for having to stoppage and any other contingency that may occur.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />
          </p>
          <p>It is worth highlighting the discoveries we have been making in the Carbonate reservoir in the <mark type="inaudible" /> concession in the Campos Pre-salt. In the last two years, we have discovered our first <mark type="inaudible" /> 2 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the <mark type="inaudible" /> concession in the Campos Basin in Carbonate reservoir located above and below <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>We are beginning to tie back these reservoirs to existing production systems. The latest example is Tracaja, where we just announced <mark type="inaudible" /> in which one well is producing 23,000 barrels per day. In December we announced Carimbe, with initial capacity of 24,000 barrels per day. We have two additional wells planned for Carbonate in Barracuda and Marlim for later this year.</p>
          <p>Next, please. In the Pre-salts, we continue to progress, with results meeting or exceeding our expectations. In this slide, you can see the accomplishment of trends there. Some of our accomplishments include acquisition of the rights to produce an additional 5 billion barrels of oil in the Santos Pre-salt; the start-up of Lula pilots; the start-up of Guar&#xE1; extended well tests; and eight additional wells drilling.</p>
          <p>For 2011, we expect a number of key results: 12 rigs working the area by the end of the year; drilling of another 20 wells, double what we have drilled so far. <mark type="inaudible" /> will be completions. Two of the wells will be drilled in areas we acquired rights last year, producing 5 million barrels of oil. For production, we have the Lula pilot ramping up whilst two platform producing three extended well tests during the year.</p>
          <p>Next. Our production continues to be supported by the incorporation of proven reserves. This year we replaced 240% of our production, the 18th consecutive year we have replaced more than 100% of Brazilian production. On the SPE basis, we now have a reserve production life of 18 years. As you can, see our greatest success has been finding oil in deep and ultra-deep waters, including the Pre-salts. 2010 was the first year we began booking Santos Pre-salt reserves, which contributes 1.07 billion barrels to our proved reserves. Onshore and shallow water proved reserves have remained stable, even as their share declines. International reserves, particularly those in Latin America, have declined.</p>
          <p>To speak a little bit on rigs. During the last several years, the lack of drilling rigs has been the single greatest limitation to increase our production. We addressed this problem by incentivizing the construction of new rigs with long-term contracts signed in 2005 and 2008. Only now are these rigs arriving in Brazil.</p>
          <p>The slide shows the increase of the contracted fleet of drilling rigs. We have increased our fleet capable of drilling water deeper than 2,000 meters from three in 2007, when we discovered the Pre-salt, to 15 in 2010, with another 19 to be delivered through 2012. Solving our needs of this critical resource is an important milestone on our path to double carbon production by 2020.</p>
          <p>For our long-term needs, we are taking steps to develop a rig industry in Brazil. We have concluded the first phase of the structured award in construction of seven drilling rigs to Estaleiro Atl&#xE2;ntico Sul. The $662 million cost of each rig, when translated into equivalent days rate, is competitive with existing market rates. The financing of these rigs is already well under way, with commitment from third-party equity and debt sources. Petrobras intends to participate initially with 10% of the assets of the new company that is going to own these new rigs. Still to be concluded are the bid packets in which operators are bidding for long-term contract to be supplied by <mark type="inaudible" />. Discussions with potential operators are now ongoing.</p>
          <p>Next. We already have success with developing the capacity to build FPSOs in Brazil. Compared with literally no such capacity 10 years ago, Brazil now has a number of new shipyards and a supplier network that are internationally competitive and directly adjacent to our operations. The shipyards have the additional value to supporting our ongoing operations, particularly with respect to maintenance and optimized activities. Today we have seven units under construction in Brazil at five different shipyards. There are another 13 shipyards under construction in Brazil. In addition to the seven units under construction, we have begun construction of eight FPSOs for the Pre-salt.</p>
          <p>We continue to make gains in increasing the capacity of local suppliers to meet the demand of the Brazilian oil industry. Since 2003, local content has increased from 57% to 74% even as total investment spending has increased more than $20 billion.</p>
          <p>2010 was a breakout year for natural gas and power, as growing industrial and commercial demand combined with peak thermoelectrical generation. As you can see, overall demand for natural gas was up 38% while thermoelectric generation tripled. But averages do not tell the whole story, as power demand appeared mainly during the dry season from <mark type="inaudible" />. During that time, thermoelectric generation was as high as 6.5 gigawatts, with natural gas consumption reaching 86 million cubic meters per day. This clearly demonstrates that our gas and power infrastructure has now been built with the capacity and flexibility to respond to peak demand.</p>
          <p>By the first quarter of 2011, we will have essentially completed our gas infrastructure. The last remaining project will connect natural gas production from Mexilh&#xE3;o, Urugu&#xE1;, Tamba&#xFA;, and Lula pilots to our grid. When completed, we will be able to deliver another 17 million cubic meters of domestically produced natural gas to the market. In doing so we will substitute domestic gas for natural gas we currently import. <mark type="inaudible" />  vertically integrated business, with an average realization price to the distributor of nearly $7 per million Btu in 2010, natural gas will become a growing component of Petrobras' operating income.</p>
          <p>Next. During 2010, we saw tangible results from our investments in downstream. With the expansion of REPLAN, we will be able to increase throughput by 63,000 barrels per day. And increasing outputs of jet fuel. The REVAP coker modernization will substantially increase production of low-sulfur diesel and reduce our output of fuel oil. The REFAP acquisition will enable us to double our throughput of domestic oil at the refinery.</p>
          <p>During 2010, the percentage of domestic oil as throughput increased from 79 in 2009 to 82% in 2010. There's no major turnaround planned for 2011. Utilization rates and domestic throughput are expected to remain near these levels throughout the year, helping to reduce costs and expand margins.</p>
          <p>Turning to our financial results, we begin with volumes and price, which are the key determinants of our results. For the full year, Brent increased by $18 per barrel or 29% over 2009, while the value of our own crude increased by $20 per barrel, or 38% during the year. Due to our pricing policy of minimizing the volatility of international markets, the increase in international price was not fully reflected in domestic price. During 2010, the margin between U.S. and Brazilian price declined from average of $13.40 per barrel in 2009 to $4.50 per barrel in 2010, which had the effect of reducing refining margin but stabilizing our consolidated cash flow.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, our average realization price for product was relatively flat, which reduced the gap between Gulf Coast price and the Brazilian realization price. Oil price moved up faster at the end of the fourth quarter combined with our record production. However, this positive effect was absorbed by the revenue <mark type="inaudible" /> associated with our short-term adjustment oil products exports, and international sales. In December, Gulf Coast prices slightly exceeded the prices in Brazil, the first time since November 2008 that this has occurred. We continue to monitor price closely and remain committed to international price in the long term.</p>
          <p>Next. Accelerating Brazilian GDP growth is reflected in higher product sales. For the full year, product sales were up 11%, reflecting the exceptional growth of the Brazilian economy. Of note is growth of jet fuel, up 19% year-over-year, as growing income and the stronger real stimulated air travel. Gasoline consumption increased 17% year-over-year as growing income, combined with higher sugar price, increased ethanol price, reducing its competitiveness. Natural gas consumption grew by 33%, reflecting growing industrial demand, but more importantly a greater reliance on gas-fired thermoelectric power for Brazil power grid.</p>
          <p>From the third quarter to the fourth quarter, total product sales were up 1%, <mark type="inaudible" /> due to sales largely offsetting higher gasoline and jet fuel sales.</p>
          <p>Lifting costs. Expressed in reais, lifting costs before government take declined by 6% in the fourth quarter. Lifting costs in the third quarter had been affected by the charges related to the annual collective bargaining agreement, bonus, and non-programmed stoppages. For the full year, lifting costs in reais were up 2%, while the U.S. dollars increase was 14%. The increase in dollars for lifting cost is largely attributable to the value of the real, valuation of the real, which rose by 12%.</p>
          <p>For the year, total lifting costs were up 30% in U.S. dollars and 10% in reais, largely due to increased production tax related to the higher international reference price for oil. The growth in domestic consumption was met largely by imports of products. Over time, as production and refinery capacity in Brazil increases, we will be able to capture the margin that is being lost in imports.</p>
          <p>Turning to financial results, revenue for the full year of 2010 were higher largely because of growing sales volume in Brazil. Our pricing policy means that revenue did not keep pace with the higher costs associated with the import of oil and products, higher production tax due to the higher international reference price, and the net inflation. Cost of goods sold also increased due to growing <mark type="inaudible" />  particularly LNG to meet higher demand. Sales expense increased largely because of cost associated with higher volumes. Virtually all the increase related -which related to LNG regas terminal, <mark type="inaudible" />  and other logistics cost to meet growing domestic demand. The increase in general and administration costs of 8% is due to cost of inflation, which largely contributed to increasing personnel cost, which grew slightly above inflation rate. Our work force grew by 3% last year, very reasonable considering all we have accomplished.</p>
          <p>Next. Net financial results including tax and minority interests contributed to the 17% increase in the net income in 2010. There were several reasons for the increase. The real expansion of 25% versus the dollar in 2009, but only 4% in 2010. Since Petrobras has a net liability position dollar, the benefit was less than in 2009. Offsetting these benefits, Petrobras had a number of intercompany loans denominated in dollars in 2009. These were registered as U.S. dollar assets in Brazil. When the dollar weakens versus the real, our expense improves. Since then these loans were substantially reduced, thereby limiting the expense from the devaluation of the dollar.</p>
          <p>Higher balance of interest-bearing government securities added to income. The net effect of these movements caused an increase in the net financial results of R$2.4 billion <mark type="inaudible" /> since '09. Minority interest expense declined due to the reduction in income from a subsidiary with minority interest, primarily because of lower earnings from the net financial results in 2010.</p>
          <p>Comparing third quarter to fourth quarter, net revenues were down slightly due to flat prices and a 1% volume increase. Revenues would have been higher except for revenue from cargos of crudes and product export late in the quarter not yet recognized. The higher cost of goods sold was a result of high international price for imported oil and oil products and natural gas. Higher costs were partially offset by lower expenses, particularly those associated with the collective bargaining agreement. Inventory average benefited fourth quarter results by lowering cost of goods sold by R$543 million. <mark type="inaudible" /> at a lower cost. The lower revenue, combined with higher cost of goods sold, reduced gross income by 4% over the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Expense declined by 11%, largely as a result of a few extraordinary items, particularly those relating to the collective bargaining agreement, the termination of the Barracuda project finance and...</p>

          <p>My apologies, the presentation will be continuing momentarily. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Please proceed. Pardon the interruption, ladies and gentlemen. We are having technical difficulties. Please hold the line. Please go ahead. Sir, you are in the conference. You may please proceed.</p>
          <p>Pardon the interruption, ladies and gentlemen. We are having some technical difficulties. Please hold the line. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry for what has happened.</p>
          <p>But just concluding this slide on net income comparing fourth quarter to third quarter, we have our financial results table. Our income tax declined as a result of <mark type="inaudible" /> interest on <mark type="inaudible" /> and minority interest declined by R$531 million. The final result was an increase in net income from the prior quarter of 24%.</p>
          <p>Next, please. Turning to CapEx, capital spending totaled R$76 billion during 2010, an increase of 8% from the prior year. Capital expenditure by Brazilian exploration production increased by 5%, largely related to increased spending in the Pre-salt. Downstream spending grew by 70%, as an investment for upgrades, regulatory spending, and logistics is peaking while spending on the Abreu e Lima refinery ramps up.</p>
          <p>Gas and Energy spending declined as the gas infrastructure reached completion. Our International segment also was reduced, as capitalized spending remained focus on integrated operations in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Next. For 2011, our budget, as set forth in our annual business plan is R$93.7 billion. This amounts to 5.8% above what was approved last year. This budget is similar to the level of investment forecasted for 2011 in the 2010-2014 business plan, with a small increase to reflect initial exploration of the transfer of rights acreage. The allocation of investments for 2011 follows the pattern of 2010, with increased spending in Brazilian upstream and downstream, and continued reduction in gas and energy, with stable spending internationally. We are now planning to give a full update of our business plan for 2011-2015 in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Next. The capital raised in 2010 has given us a very comfortable position with respect to liquidity and leverage. We ended the year with net debt to net capital of 17% and net debt to EBITDA of 1 time. These are well below the limits we have established for the company. We ended the year with cash and equivalents including government securities, maturity above 90 days, of R$55 billion. Our bonds continue to be well received by the debt capital markets, where we issued $6 billion of 5-, 10-, and 30-years maturity in January. For the remainder of the year, we will have our international <mark type="inaudible" /> as well as <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>With that overview, we will now be happy to answer any questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. My question is on downstream. We still have very little profitability, visibility on your greenfield projects. And I understood from the Portuguese call that you were working with an assumption of a $7 per barrel margin in the future. However, I would like to see &#x2013; please break down for us how much of your &#x2013; let's say, how much is the CapEx for the Premium I, Premium II, or the Comperj refinery complexes in your budget? And more specifically, of the $38 billion in CapEx in refining of this year, how much it is for each of these greenfield projects? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to ask <mark type="inaudible" /> to help us on the answer. Please, <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Premium I and Premium II refineries, they have a design competition project undergoing. This design competition is a new approach that we are reviving. Our refinery &#x2013; how can I say &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> scheme and all the things you need <mark type="inaudible" /> better and more efficient refinery and lower costs. Since we don't have the results of these designing competition yet, we don't have the figures to give you about this <mark type="inaudible" />. We expect that within the next months we will have these results, these figures and then we have better conditions to answer your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I understand that you have zero of Premium I and Premium II CapEx in your $38 billion CapEx budget for 2011. Is that right? And Abreu e Lima, for instance, which is a refinery that is already half underway, how much of the $15 billion total budget is in the 2011 budget, then? I believe you probably have these numbers, right, because of the $38 billion was just this quarter. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. Just to follow up on the whole refining spending theme, as you're looking forward over the next couple of years, you obviously are going to be finishing a lot of the upgrading projects. You do have a lot of new spending coming in for the Premium refineries, but you're trying to reduce those costs somewhat. I'm just wondering, in terms of the weight of spending for refining and the total amount of spending, as we look out at 2011, '12 and '13, once we get beyond this period, is refining spending likely to decline fairly noticeably? I mean, how are you looking at the overall mix of spending as you move out over the next couple of years and beyond that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. <mark type="inaudible" />. Frank about the overall downstream <mark type="inaudible" /> forecast for the next few years. What we see is that the overall spending on modernization projects and the current assets we have are going to be reduced gradually from now until 2013-2014. So actually, if you consider, for example, the average spending in modernization &#x2013; what I mean, quality and conversion projects, if you take the average from 2010 to 2014 and compare it with the average spending after 2015 until 2020, you're going to see that this amount, the total amount, is going to be reduced by kind of 70%, 80%. So we're going to pretty much be done with the upgrading of our current refineries by 2013-2014, most of which are going to be ready.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, the new capacity we are adding now, mostly now due to the Northeastern refinery and the Comperj first module of refining capacity. You're going to spend more gradually until the startup by 2013. So what we see, there's going to be a shift from modernization spending to new capacity additions. But the answer is yes, the overall spending is going to be reduced, mostly due to the significant reduction we expect to have in spending in the current assets.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you very much. Actually, if I can just add one more question. I don't believe &#x2013; and maybe I've missed it someplace &#x2013; but the amount of the cargos that were not booked in the fourth quarter that look like they'll probably be in the first quarter, has that amount been released?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. <mark type="inaudible" /> about the 42,000 barrels per day <mark type="inaudible" />. The connection is bad. But yes, we felt that during the fourth quarter, the total export was about 140,000 barrels per day, so but only 100 was recorded. There is about 40,000, 42,000 barrels per day that was not recorded on that count. That is going to happen during the first quarter of this year. Exports.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Two questions. One, the dividend and the interest on capital for 2010 has gone to about 35%. I think historically you guys are roughly about in the 30%. Is that the new percentage guideline that we should use going forward? The second question is on the Cap &#x2013; yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Not exactly. What happened is that according to the law and the regulation in Brazil, the traditional shares, they have the right to receive at least 25% of the net income or 5% of the value of the financial share in the capital of the company. And in this year, in the case of 2010, 5% were greater than the 25%, so we had to pay the minimum 5% of the value of the shares as a dividend, and not to pay a different value to the voting shares, we made the same for all of them. In this way, we had to pay a dividend of 35%. But assume that this reason will not happen again. We shall go back to the 25%.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Cheng, you seem to be have been removed from the queue. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> In the meantime, our next question comes from Marcus Sequeira from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon, everyone. So just to follow up, I couldn't hear the amount of the shipments that were not booked in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And also to ask &#x2013; I'd like to ask that I believe this is a fairly common thing, right, to have shipments booked from one quarter to the other, but was this an unusual high amount in this quarter? Or how much you sold at the end of the third quarter and you booked in the beginning of fourth quarter. Just wanted to have an idea if really &#x2013; the shipments really have a meaningful impact.</p>
          <p>And the second, on the CapEx, could you give us a sense of the impact of just higher industry costs in your CapEx increase, or everything had already been contracted and, therefore, the higher industry cost had a limited impact in your CapEx for 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's have <mark type="inaudible" />  from the downstream to explain about the basic volume of exports that were not recorded. That means volume of exports in the fourth quarter that were not levered to the buyer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's talk about the numbers of shipments, the volume. Oil, 100,000 barrels per day and oil products 43,000 barrels per day. So we had, in terms of volume, 143,000 barrels per barrels per day. And talking about the levers, oil 90,000 barrels per day and oil products 11,000. So basically we have a difference of 42,000 barrels per day, and we are talking about the difference between shipments and the levers. That's good enough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcus, could you repeat the second question regarding CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, just a follow-up to the first, I believe that this is just a mismatch between selling and accounting probably happens in other quarters as well, probably is a common thing. I just wanted to know if in this quarter it was unusually high?</p>
          <p>And the second question was if the industry costs, inflation costs for the oil service industry, what was the impact of that in your CapEx for 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'm going to check the information regarding the inflation costs on the industry and what their impact on the 2011. I don't have it now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fine. Thank you. Then again on &#x2013; just replacing that question, on the <mark type="inaudible" /> the 5 billion barrels you talked about in the Portuguese call that your CapEx should be around, I think 500 million. Do you guys have an idea of &#x2013; I know we have a few <mark type="inaudible" /> this year. But do you guys have a plan of when you guys would like to prove commerciality of this field?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are working to do this as soon as possible. And as we said, we are going to drill two wells in the blocks that were assigned to produce the 5 billion barrels. We have to do a minimum exploratory work in each of these fields. And this includes drilling wells and running 3-D seismic <mark type="inaudible" /> larger potential productions we need to do an extended well test as well. So we have to complete the work for each area and at the end, we will declare each one as commercially viable, but we do not need to wait for the completion of all seven. As we finish the minimum work, we are going to declare as commercial, and we can enter &#x2013; establish the final price from entering the new stage of development.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions. One, Almir, in the CapEx, since I think in the oil industry most of the oil services contract are being denominated in U.S. dollars. In your case that when you sign a contract or that &#x2013; procure equipment, do you base on reais as the nominal price, or it is based on dollar? Or maybe give us a percentage. How much of your contracts or the service that you're procuring is based on U.S. dollars, so we know if the exchange rate change, how that impact on your CapEx? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And I may have missed it, but in your current budget of R$93.7 billion how much of that is related to additional spending associated with the new transfer rights, the 5 billion barrel operation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the transfer of rights in the R$93 billion. We are going to drill two wells. Hugo, are we doing any seismic...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. The total investment for 2011 in this transfer of rights will be close to R$900 million, which is more or less $500 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's less than a billion, so the bulk of the increase is actually not related to this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And how about the FX change and how that impact on your CapEx; how should we look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just returning to the previous question. We have the $224 billion for five years, and if you take the 2011 that is around $55 billion. And multiply it by five, it will give you a larger number. It means that we are planning not to do the same level of activity year after year. There are years that have a larger volume of spend in CapEx than others, and <mark type="inaudible" />  what I can tell you is to wait for the next five-year plan that will revisit all the years to come, and see how it's going to perform.</p>
          <p>Regarding the effect of inflation costs on our CapEx, we have in the upstream a larger portion of dollarized goods and services and material than in the downstream. The average of the company is about 50/50, and we take this into consideration whenever we do our calculations. With the mix together with the target and the five-year plan, we chart the exchange rate we are using. But the total in the company is about 50/50 &#x2013; and it's increasing the total of reais as greater local content is being developed in the country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Almir, can I read it correct &#x2013; read it the way, based on what you're saying, is that if we look at the original budget as R$88.5 billion, that is assuming the 2 reais for 1 U.S. dollar. So that gives you about $45 billion U.S. And you say half of your CapEx is dollar-based and half is reais-based, and if reais appreciate to about R$1.60, R$1.70 to a dollar from the R$2, so that half from reais term should be lower, probably, by say probably 15%. So that means that everything else equal, on reais term, your budget should be maybe more likely in the R$82 billion, R$83 billion, and now that you're in R$94 billion, so that is that you increased by 12%, 13% comparing to your annual plan. Is that interpretation correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I cannot tell you that it's wrong. Yes, if you take the 50% dollars and 50% reais, the currency exchange valuation is going to be offset &#x2013; one raise would offset the other. So the growth in real in the CapEx from R$89 billion to R$93 billion, this is the comparison you have to do; that is about 5%. You can say that this is real or equivalent to real, because of course the real has a larger value this year compared to each dollar. It depends on where you are taking the real currency. But turning back to your point yes, there is &#x2013; I mean, real, masks the volume of CapEx being projected for the 2011 than we did for 2010.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But do not compare that with the total we actually spent as CapEx, because we can reach at the end of the year with a smaller volume of CapEx as well. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

Then we took all the press releases, and we took data <mark type="inaudible" />. be in 2009 and 2010. But it is just a compilation of the information available in the website about these discoveries.

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to ask a quick question on refining. According to your press release, your refining costs went up 22%, discounting FX, for year over year, and you attribute that to high expenses in maintenance and personnel.

          <p>Yes. Just a second. Okay. Let's talk about the costs on the fourth quarter. Comparing to the third quarter, materials, we have 34% more than we had on the third quarter, basically because of chemical products. <mark type="inaudible" />. Personnel <mark type="inaudible" />  because third quarter we had some unusual effects. And probably we're going to keep on the same amount of money that we are in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Talking about maintenance, we had some maintenance, especially in two refineries REDUC and REPLAN and it's not going to be <mark type="inaudible" />. We're going to reduce that in the next quarter. And talking about turnaround, was much less than we had on the third quarter, 33% less than we had on the third quarter, because basically all the units were running. And the idea for the next year is that we're going to have a little less turnaround than we had in 2010. So we expect <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow up-on production. I don't know if Hugo is still around. When we look at the production target for 2011 of 2,100, Hugo, one of the main thrusts behind it will be the P-57. Can you tell me where production is and what level has it reached as of the end of January, for example, how much P-57 is producing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. P-57 is in the very beginning of the ramp up because it starts producing in December and there is a lot to come. But in the average in the whole year, at the end of the year we expect to have it pretty close to the limit of the platform, with a contribution that may be bigger than 65,000 barrels a day in the annual average. And I think it is important to remember that there is also the Tupi pilot coming, <mark type="inaudible" /> and other projects coming, and also P-56 at the end of the next year, some extended well tests &#x2013; there is a lot to come.</p>

          <p>Yeah. So the other question was in addition &#x2013; in your view, in order to reach your target, in addition to P-57, what would be the other two key platforms in order for you to be confident that you can reach that 2,100 target. What would be the other two key platforms, in your view, in addition to P-57?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a &#x2013; let me give you some &#x2013; there is something important to say. The pilot for Lula -Lula pilot is very important next year. And we are coming back with <mark type="inaudible" /> which is in <mark type="inaudible" />, a field below <mark type="inaudible" /> that is coming back, it was a field that was transitioned half off the potential last year in order to recover the pressure in the reservoir and to allow us to drill more wells. Now, this year we expect through <mark type="inaudible" /> us a contribution of close to 40,000 barrels a day. It's one of Albian Carbonates that we will be producing this year.</p>
          <p>Then with these two bids, some of the most important contributions for the next year, P-57 and the wells <mark type="inaudible" /> I think these are the main contributions for the next year. There is some others this year that we expect to grow fast and some <mark type="inaudible" /> that will come from Urugu&#xE1;-Tamba&#xFA; but mainly &#x2013; the main contributions are these ones.</p>

          <p>And P-56, right now you have it slated to begin in July, I believe, 2011. How is that date looking? Any chance for that to start beforehand, or any risk of delays? As we stand here today in February, how realistic is that start-up of P-56?</p>

          <p>The number of the main important problems that can occur in this kind of big systems is in the final commissioning process, where can test and find and discover some problems. Up to today, considering the construction and the wells and the equipment, everything is on schedule. But we are taking care to see at the end if everything will be okay to put this well &#x2013; this field on stream, okay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Barbassa, the last question for you related to CapEx. I know you can't talk about any quantitative points about the five-year CapEx that you'll announce later in the year, but qualitatively speaking, is it correct to say that in the past two or three years, you had important structural changes to your five-year CapEx such as the addition of Pre-salt, the introduction of these new refineries, which caused those big increases in CapEx to occur? But now looking out to the next five years, that we don't see any fundamentally major structural changes to the plan, and therefore although we could see an increase, maybe not to the same degree as we've seen in the past two or three years? Is that a fair or correct way to look at this trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think yes. But you may see we are expecting, natural, that the Pre-salt is going to grow more and more over time, contributing to more production as well. And so the areas will not have the same percentage of CapEx, that they are taking today or in the last years. But I believe that there is very important information here regarding the transfer of rights. According to DeGolyer and MacNaughton, as published in their report, who have put that together and not taking our numbers, but their numbers, all the 5 billion barrels of oil will be self-financed.</p>
          <p>What we are going to see this for the first platform to be installed. And then we can finance the second and so on. And this is going to be a very important contribution to the production of the company in the future. What it means we are going to grow production, no demanding of new capital. The additional cash flow generation from that same source is going to be self-sufficient. I believe this is the most important when you look forward concerning with the CapEx and the possibilities of the CapEx.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Emerson Leite from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Good afternoon, Barbassa and Hugo. I have two questions. First is associated with the whole Pre-salt development &#x2013; I would like to split it in two. In terms of drilling rigs, the winning bid for the first seven rigs on the 28 drilling rig package from Atl&#xE2;ntico Sul Shipyard was considered remarkably low by more established operators in this business. So my question is, are there any provisions in the contract for cost overruns in the construction of these rigs, meaning if the shipyard ends up building the rig at a much higher cost, who will bear that cost? It's going to be Petrobras or it's going to be the shipyards?</p>
          <p>And then associated with that question, I would like to know if you are already negotiating for the next package of seven rigs, or if you at some point will go to the open market to contract some of the remaining 21 rigs that have not been contracted yet? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Emerson, the seven rigs we just finished the bidding process. They are going to be owned by a company with private investors so they are going to be like any other rigs for E&amp;P from the markets. We are going to have 10% on the capital in new company to give comfort to the investors, but not to take and give overrun costs. So if there is &#x2013; there are some guarantee in place for performance that can cover delays on the delivery, not cost overrun.</p>
          <p>So if there is any cost overrun, the shipyard has to bear. And they are &#x2013; of course they are built, not the shipyard, but the company that is part of the shipyard, they are building drillships exactly like the design they are going to build in Korea right now. And they had the opportunity to get their engineers and their people trained to improve the cost on the construction. And more than that, they are not building one unit; they are going to build seven units. So they have time to interact and to improve their efficiency to reduce costs.  All were put together to be in a way that this is the cost to be paid by the owner of the rigs, and this is by the shipyard, so no possibility of cost overrun to be beared by the owner of the rigs.</p>
          <p>There is a second question &#x2013; ah! Regarding the remaining ones, we are still waiting for some operators of drillships that have proposed to us some leasing on rigs to be built in Brazil. They present us a higher cost, a higher price than we were expecting, so we are negotiating with them to see if we can reach to a price we are comfortable. Otherwise we'll assess the process of hiring or contracting new rigs to be built in Brazil. There is no &#x2013; so far nothing that points to have international-built rigs to supply our needs here. There's 21 remaining rigs needs to be built in Brazil.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Barbassa. Thank you. And a second question on the replica FPSOs to be built in the Rio Grande shipyard. What's the latest in terms of the bidding process for the topsides and the overall schedule of events? It seems that the process is a bit delayed, and I'd like to hear from you what's the status and if things are on track or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me have Hugo to help me on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Emerson. <mark type="inaudible" /> still requires some information regarding the <mark type="inaudible" />  and the results to see the size of these activities. Then if it's much more in <mark type="inaudible" /> and then we will be ready to move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Hugo. And maybe one final question. One thing that I've been watching closely is the level of depletion in the production of the Campos, or the central part of Campos Basin fields, and the data from ANP suggest that the depletion in the main fields is running at 15%. I always had in the back of my mind the number of 10%, which has been the guidance of Petrobras for a while. So I'd like to understand what's going on with those fields, if depletion is accelerating, if you are concerned with that. And how should we think of the current base of production? How much is depleting? In order to model the future production; I think that this is a very important point to be accurate in the estimate. So if you can give more clarity on what's going on there, would be helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is always a very important point for us in managing production and the decline rate, and the depletion is one of the most important indicators of the opportunities, the remaining opportunities, to improve recovery <mark type="inaudible" /> and to keep the production as flat as possible, optimizing the use of the existing infrastructure and production units. Then the behavior of these big giant fields, they do not behave as a linear decline, like a 10% or 8%. In general, in the very beginning of the production, they experience a higher decline. And as more mature or after a few years in a very low decline rate, which means that it tends to be much more hyperbolic than linear or even exponential.</p>
          <p>But in the case of these fields, there is always an opportunity to drill more wells and to keep exploring new opportunities close to the field in order to keep them producing as flat as possible, with the lowest decline rate as possible. That's what we are doing. With the combination of &#x2013; we call <mark type="inaudible" /> we call the exploration side of it also combined with in-field drilling and the management of water injection.</p>
          <p>This is number of factors to manage the depletion and the decline rate. In some fields, we can experience rates bigger than 10% in the beginning. I'm assuming that's what you could see in the data from ANP, but we are not concerned with this bigger number for these fields, because it's part of the management to manage. Sometimes we don't have spare capacity to reduce these decline rates, but sometimes it is because of the water production, then the liquids in the platform can be the same with some decline in oil and replace it by water. There we cannot do anything. And sometimes in the beginning we can face higher decline rates in some fields, which is in general compensated by low decline rates in other fields. That's why in the average we have the 9%, 10%, sometimes 8% decline rates as an average for the company. You get?</p>

          <p>With that I cannot help you. This is not on our <mark type="inaudible" /> and from the government. We are looking also to know when it's going to happen. There are some moves, but I cannot say more than is in the newspapers, really. Maybe in the second half they will do something but nothing different than what is already known in the market. We are waiting for the sign of the government.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
