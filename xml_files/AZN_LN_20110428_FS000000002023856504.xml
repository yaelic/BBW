        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you Jonathan and good afternoon, or good morning, to everyone. Aside from the one-off impacts from tax and patent settlements, the underlying business performance in the first quarter has turned out largely as we anticipated. We're driving growth from the brands where we retain exclusivity and from the emerging markets, so we are facing headwinds from the realities of increased generic competition and government interventions in pricing, both in the U.S. and in Europe.</p>
          <p>We're focused on productivity and efficiency, and at the same time we're making the necessary investments in support of new product launches, growth in emerging markets and, of course, in the pipeline. Our cash generation is strong, and we've significantly increased our cash return to shareholders in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On today's call, I'm going to cover four topics. And this quarter I think it will be clearer if we start with the P&amp;L, as there are number of items we need to address to make the performance bridge from a revenue decline to a core EPS increase. Then, I'll come back to the revenue commentary on a region and brand basis. I'll then make a brief comment on cash performance and shareholder distributions and then finally, I'll provide an update on our guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>So firstly, let me turn to the core profit and loss account. The press release does, of course, contain the statutory numbers and a detailed reconciliation to these core measures. When I refer to growth rates, they'll be on a constant currency basis. We achieved revenue in the first quarter of nearly $8.3 billion. That's a 4% decline in constant currency terms; a positive impact from currency movements resulted in actual revenue being 3% down.</p>
          <p>As I said in my opening remarks, revenue in the quarter was pretty much in line with what we'd expected. Generics provided a more than $550 million drag on revenue, around $400 million just from the U.S., and the balance being in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>The first-quarter revenue performance also reflects the impact from government price interventions. And this is only partially mitigated by continued good double-digit growth in emerging markets. I'll come back to revenue later in the call but let's just continue down the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>In contrast to the 4% decline in revenue, core gross margin was down just 1% in the quarter. Core gross margin included a $131 million benefit from the settlement of patent disputes between MedImmune and PDL BioPharma. We are to receive $92.5 million in payments from PDL in two installments, all of which have been recognized through cost of goods in the first quarter accounts.</p>
          <p>We also released a $38.5 million provision in respect to accrued royalties that where not paid to PDL for the period from December 2009 to the end of 2010. So, core gross margin in the quarter was 84% of sales, three percentage points higher than the first quarter of 2010, and just over half of this increase is due to the PDL settlement.</p>
          <p>You'll recall at the full-year results conference, I said that we expected core gross margin for the full year to be above our 80% planning assumption but probably below the 2010 level, which was 81.2% of sales. With the PDL benefit, we expect that core gross margin will now probably be broadly in line with 2010.</p>
          <p>Core SG&amp;A expenditures were up 1% in the quarter, and we continue to invest to grow our emerging markets business as well as invest behind the launches of new products, such as Brilique and ONGLYZA. Now, this was all largely funded by efficiencies achieved in our developed markets. The other new factor in SG&amp;A this year is the impact of U.S. Health Care Reform. Most of the effect is seen in the revenue line, but the excise fee that has been imposed on companies is taken through the SG&amp;A line. And for the first quarter that was around 2% of SG&amp;A expense, effectively responsible for the increase in SG&amp;A for the quarter.</p>
          <p>So, the 4% revenue decline becomes a 2% decline in core pre-R&amp;D operating profit and the uplift of core gross margin is partially offset by the slight increase in SG&amp;A expense and a reduction in core other income for the quarter. Core other income might not get to the $800 million that we guided to for the full year.</p>
          <p>Core pre-R&amp;D margin in the quarter was 57.3% of revenue. That's above the top of our 48% to 54% planning range. For the full year, core pre-R&amp;D margin should remain comfortably near the top of our planning range but probably below the 2010 level. Core R&amp;D investment in the quarter was $1.07 billion, that's a 7% increase. Now, you'll recall the spending on late-stage projects began to ramp up in the latter part of 2010, and that continues into 2011.</p>
          <p>There were also higher intangible asset impairments compared to the first quarter last year and that accounts for about 3 percentage points of the increase. So, this leads to a core operating profit of $3.7 billion in the quarter, 5% lower than last year.</p>
          <p>Net finance expense was just slightly lower than last year and a full-year net finance expense in the range of 2010's level still looks about right. Core earnings per share in the quarter were $2.23, compared with $2.03 last year. This is a $0.10 increase at constant currency, a portion of which is due to the benefit of lower number of shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases. But, the biggest driver is the movement in tax provisions.</p>
          <p>As we announced on the 28th of March this year, agreements were reached between the U.K. and the U.S. tax authorities regarding transfer pricing arrangements that cover a 13-year period from 2002 through to the end of 2014, as well as an agreement on a related valuation matter arising from the integration of our U.S. business units following the AstraZeneca merger in 1999.</p>
          <p>The cash impact from these settlements will result in AstraZeneca paying a net amount of $1.1 billion. The P&amp;L impact arises from the release of a portion of the provisions we've carried on the balance sheet for the outcome of these complex issues. In the first quarter, this resulted in a $540 million benefit, that's $0.39 per share on the tax line of the statutory P&amp;L. Now, this resulted in an effective tax rate for the quarter of 11.3% on a reported basis. If you exclude the $540 million, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 27.8% on a reported basis. The effective tax rate on a core basis is 12.3%, and this is higher than the reported tax rate because when we make the adjustments to report the operating profit, such as the restructuring costs and the MedImmune-related amortization costs, to reconcile to the core P&amp;L, well, we apply the 27.8% tax rate to these items to arrive at our earnings.</p>
          <p>And we'll take this same approach in reporting the tax rate for the remaining three quarters of the year. We expect the effective reported tax rate for the full year to be around 21%, whereas the core tax rate will probably be a touch higher. The first quarter 2010 also included a benefit related to adjustments to tax provisions, which amounted to $0.13 per share. So, net result is that the 5% decline in core operating profit becomes a 10% increase in core earnings per share.</p>
          <p>The core adjustments to earnings for restructuring costs and the amortization related to Merck and MedImmune are broadly comparable year-on-year, so the growth in reported earnings per share is also 10%, to $2.08. While I'm on restructuring, we charge $143 million in the quarter and the program is on track to costs and benefits as previously disclosed. Before I return to our revenue performance, a brief word on cash.</p>
          <p>Cash generated from operating activities was up 9% in the quarter to nearly $1.9 billion. As to cash distributions to shareholders, the $2.6 billion payment of the second interim dividend for 2010 combined with net share repurchases of $1.2 billion resulted in cash distributions to shareholders of more than $3.8 billion in the first quarter of 2011, that's a 57% increase over the first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to our first-quarter revenue performance. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:49) when I refer to growth rates, they will all be on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned at the outset, revenue in the quarter was down 4%. Revenue in the U.S. was down 11%, where we had to absorb more than $400 million in revenues lost to generic competition, that's chiefly from Arimidex, Toprol-XL and Merrem, as well as the pricing impact from U.S. Health Care Reform.</p>
          <p>Revenue in Western Europe was down 7%, largely due to generic competition from Nexium, Merrem, and one-month impact from the loss of exclusivity on Arimidex. In the rest of the portfolio in Western Europe, volume growth of 4% was more than offset by lower realized prices as a result of government interventions.</p>
          <p>Revenue in the established rest of the world was up 4%; good growth for Crestor fueled a 12% revenue increase in Canada. Revenue in Japan was down 1%, where volume growth was more than offset by lower realized prices following by the bi-annual price reductions in April of 2010.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets revenue increased by 13% with particularly strong performances in our oncology and respiratory products.</p>
          <p>Turning now to revenue at the brand level, I'll begin with Crestor. Worldwide sales of Crestor increased by 12%, to $1.5 billion. Across the world, Crestor is growing well ahead of the statin market growth rate.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., sales were up 17% to $682 million. Total prescriptions were up 9.3%, which is three times the market growth rate. Market share of total prescriptions was 12% in March, which is down 10 basis points since December. Market share for generics is up 1.2 percentage points. We typically do see an increase in the market share for generics in the first quarter as a result of the churn caused by the rollover to new plan year in the managed care segment. So, we will see is this moderates as we move into the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Crestor sales in the rest of the world were up 8%, to $796 million. Sales in Europe were up 6%. Market growth has slowed and we're also seeing the effect of price reductions. Crestor volume, though, grew by double digits. I already mentioned the strong performance in Canada. Sales in Japan, though, were down 3%. This is due to the phasing of shipments to our marketing partner. Underlying market share was up compared to last year. Sales in emerging markets were up 8%.</p>
          <p>Global Seroquel franchise sales were up 3%, to $1.35 billion, fueled by Seroquel XR, where sales were up 33% to $339 million. Seroquel XR sales are 18.9% of total franchise sales in the U.S. and account for 39% of sales in the rest of world. Symbicort sales were up 8% in the quarter, to $752 million. In the U.S., sales in the first quarter were up 14% to $197 million. Total prescriptions were also up 14%, compared with a 0.5% decline in the U.S. markets for fixed combination products. So, market share is up, reaching 20% of new prescriptions in March 2011.</p>
          <p>Market share of patients newly starting combination therapy is 25.2%. Sales in the rest of world for Symbicort were 5% ahead of last year, to $555 million. Sales in Western Europe were down 5%, largely on price reductions in Germany. Sales in established rest of world increased by 40% as a result of the continued strong performance in Japan since the launch in early 2010. Sales in emerging markets were up 26%.</p>
          <p>Alliance revenues for ONGLYZA were $35 million in the first quarter. KOMBIGLYZE XR, the first, indeed, the only, once-daily fixed-dose combination of a DPP-4 inhibitor, a metformin, was launched in the U.S. during the quarter and is off to a good start. ONGLYZA's share of new prescriptions for DDP-4 products in the U.S. was 11.8% in March and KOMBIGLYZE XR added a further 3.4% share, bringing the total franchise to over 15%. KOMBIGLYZE share of new DPP-4 starts is now 29%, with a third already coming from KOMBIGLYZE XR.</p>
          <p>It's still very early days in the rollout for BRILINTA/BRILIQUE. We recorded $1 million in revenue in the first quarter, largely on the initial launch sales in Germany. Reports from our German marketing company indicate that the product is being well received in the market, with formulary acceptances being achieved at a good pace. As we have said before, most of the launches that will occur in 2011 will be towards the second half as we work our way through the reimbursement process in many markets.</p>
          <p>Arimidex sales were down 55%, to $233 million in the quarter. The U.S. market is now largely generic, and Arimidex sales were just $19 million. Exclusivity expired in Western Europe in February and we're already seeing the impact, with sales down 33% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, NEXIUM. Sales were down 6% to $1.2 billion. Sales in the U.S. were down 8%. We're starting to feel the impact from generic competition in Western Europe, where sales were down 18% in the quarter. Sales in emerging markets, however, increased by 20%.</p>
          <p>Final point I'll cover before moving to Q&amp;A is our guidance update. The underlying performance in the business in the first quarter has evolved in line with our expectations. We're driving the performance of brands where we retain exclusivity; we're focusing on productivity and efficiency so that we can continue making the necessary investments to drive growth in emerging markets and to successfully launch the new products, while still navigating the impact of generic competition and government price interventions on our portfolio. So, revenue for the full year still looks to be flat to a low single-digit decline on a constant currency basis with the year-on-year comparisons becoming less demanding in the second half.</p>
          <p>We've made two changes in the guidance since the start of the year. We increased the core earnings per share target by $0.45 in conjunction with the announcement of the tax settlement at the end of March. And today, we've added a further $0.05 per share to the target to recognize the one-off benefit from the patent settlement with PDL.</p>
          <p>So, underlying business performance is in line with our expectations, with core earnings per share target raised on the back of the tax and patent settlement matters, resulting in a new full-year target for core EPS in the range of $6.95 to $7.25.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, our core EPS guidance is based on the average exchange rates that prevailed during January 2011 when the targets were communicated. The actual rates in the first quarter haven't given rise to any meaningful currency variance on core EPS versus our guidance basis.</p>
          <p>Going forward, this guidance takes no account of the likelihood that the average exchange rates for the remainder of the year may differ materially from the January average. And as usual, I'd point you to our currency sensitivity charts to help you flex your own estimates on the currency impact to sales and earnings.</p>
          <p>So, I'll wrap up my formal remarks here and turn the call back to the conference operator to begin the Q&amp;A session.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Thanks, two questions please. First question, on Vimovo. We've not seen much in the way of sales coming through yet for that. I know you cited some sampling and discounts, but when might we start to see true demand coming through for that drug?</p>
          <p>And then, on Crestor outside of the U.S., you've sort of given a bit of background, but is there real step down in growth across all the markets outside of the U.S.? For Europe specifically, can you talk about which markets you've seen generics? And then, any other reasons why we've seen that real step down in other markets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Gavin. Thanks very much for your two questions. On Vimovo, we launched the brand, obviously, the product in the U.S. and then some launches beyond the U.S. during the course of this year. We continue to see Vimovo as having a very important part to play in the market. And we expect to see the sales beginning to develop during the course of this year. And we'll be able to sort of report on that as we go through the course of the year. But you're right, at this stage, the sales are at a relatively low level. I don't think there's more comment I can give other than to say that we're on track with our plans for the brand.</p>
          <p>In terms of Crestor, the business in Crestor, we see continues to grow strongly. We're outstripping the statin market growth significantly in pretty much all markets for Crestor, typically to the range of about three to four to one. So, Crestor continues to grow strongly. In terms of the underlying shape of the market, we've seen overall statin growth remaining fairly much constant year-on-year. There have been one or two markets where growth has been down little bit in one or two markets where growth has been up. So, overall the statin market continues to show healthy growth and Crestor, as I said, comfortably outstripping that.</p>
          <p>When we look at specific performance of Crestor, there are a number of factors and I called out a few of those in my remarks and, indeed, we referenced a few of those also in the press release. But to recap on those, in the U.S., as I mentioned, we've seen, as we typically do in the first quarter, when we get a change in managed care plans, there tends to be jump up in generic growth in the first quarter and we saw that in the U.S. I called out, I think, 1.2 percentage points increase in generics. And therefore, we saw just a flattening in that quarter of the share for Crestor, and we'll have to see how that unfolds during the rest of this year. That was in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We also, I mentioned in my remarks in Japan, where we've seen very strong growth from Crestor and continued to show growth and the overall end demand continues to grow, but we did see some phasing of shipments to our marketing partners, Shionogi in Japan, which led to some reduction in sales of Crestor in Japan.</p>
          <p>And then if I turn back to the press release, we called out, there has been some generic entry for against Crestor in a few of our Eastern European markets, and that just reflects, and I should hasten to add, that's not premature loss of exclusivity, this is markets where essentially the protection was <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:05) exclusivity and that period has expired, so it's in a number of our Eastern European markets.</p>
          <p>And then in Western Europe, again, as we've called out in the release and in my remarks, good strong double-digit volume growth for Crestor. The brand continues to perform well, but we did see the impact of government price interventions pulling that double-digit volume growth back to single-digit growth in terms of revenue. So, Gavin, that just gives you some color to the Crestor performance, thanks for the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can I just a follow-up on briefly? On the European pricing pressures, is there something &#x2013; is there any reason to see that becoming less of a pressure as we go through the year or should be now look at this as the sort of growth rate going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not going to comment on the growth rate for a specific brand in a specific region. But perhaps, let me just remind you, recap on the guidance we have provided on the overall pricing pressure that we face. And I'll take you back, really, to January, and when we gave our full-year results, we gave some guidance on pricing &#x2013; government price interventions and actions during the course of 2011.</p>
          <p>We described, you may recall, Gavin, the U.S. impact of Health Care Reform being $700 million, a bit over $700 million, of which, between a quarter and a third was the excise fee which we record through our SG&amp;A line. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:50), I referenced that as being responsible for a 2% growth in SG&amp;A this quarter, so that gives you an ability to dimension the excise fee. The remainder of that $700 million for the full year is going to impact the revenue line. Obviously, it's phasing, it will depend a bit on the individual brands, but you can think of that as being reasonably well spread through the year.</p>
          <p>And then in Europe, we said that we did see historically low to mid-single digit price declines in Europe. It's a feature of our business over there in the many of the recent years. We also said that during the course of 2011, we expected that to be more at the mid-single digit level of price actions for 2011, given that we've seen volume increases of 4% in Europe, which I referenced in my remarks. You'll see that again, that sort of points to mid-single digit price declines in Europe. That's spread across a number of markets, many of the brands. And again, you can think of that as well-phased through the course of the year. So, hopefully, that gives you some color on the pricing pressures that we face.</p>

          <p>Okay. On your R&amp;D spend, even if I exclude the asset write-down, the spend level was fairly high year-on-year. And I'm just trying to understand what run rate we should be thinking about not only in 2011 and beyond? So just directionally, is your R&amp;D spending likely to be up, flat, or down over time? And also on R&amp;D, just in a broader sense, can you say whether your return on investment is currently greater than your capital of capital? And then, last question is on the tax settlements with the different tax authorities, why won't that have a favorable impact on the tax rate beyond 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks for the questions. Starting with R&amp;D, and I think you're asking for some indication of the P&amp;L expense for R&amp;D, sort of trend for this year and perhaps beyond. For this year, we've seen a 7% increase in the quarter, I mentioned that 3% came from an intangible asset impairment. The remainder was really a function, Tim, of a number of late-stage programs starting at the back end of this year &#x2013; last year and then beginning of this year, specifically, the fostamatinib, the TC-5214, the BRILINTA PEGASUS and then, in this quarter, the Nektar late-stage program. So, those are the main drivers of the increase.</p>
          <p>Those being offset, Tim, by the continued cost reductions coming through from our R&amp;D change program. If we look for the whole of this year, we'll &#x2013; we obviously expect to see those late-stage programs giving some modest uplift to the R&amp;D expense for the year, but I'm not going to make any comments about the absolute level, because it will, as you can see from this quarter, I'm not going to sort of predict it. Therefore, what quantum of any further intangible asset impairment we might have &#x2013; but, so, that's the sort of likely drivers of the R&amp;D spend for the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of looking beyond 2011, we actually look at our R&amp;D spend as an investment of cash. What goes through the P&amp;L versus what goes straight to the balance sheet depends upon the mix of &#x2013; in-licensing in a particular period. But, to give you a sense of &#x2013; to quantify that, as you know, in spite of our mid-term planning assumptions, we said that we expect to be reinvesting some 40% to 50% of our post-tax pre-R&amp;D cash flow and of that 40% to 50%, in 2010 actually the number was just under 40%, but 40% to 50% remains our view through the mid-term. And of that 40% to 50%, about $1 billion of that get put against the capital investment, the rest into R&amp;D whether in-house or cash in licensing, so that gives you some sense of the prospective level of investment.</p>
          <p>In terms of your question on return on investment, that question I welcome. This is a hugely important metric for us and we follow it closely. There are two ways of answering your question. Firstly, what has been the return on investment, on historic investment? And secondly, what do we expect the future return on investment to be? What will it take in order to deliver that prospective return? Dealing with the first of these, which is the historic return, we look at that in a number of ways, but essentially what we do is look at the historic investment. We recapitalize, we adjust it for the time value of money and then, we calculate a post-tax return on accumulative investments and I can now report that when we run that analysis, our return on R&amp;D investment is comfortably above our cost of capital.</p>
          <p>Although, Tim, you'll not be surprised to hear that in later years, it's trended down relative to the historic years as a function of two things. Firstly, the cost of &#x2013; well, clinical development requires more data, that's expensive, so the cost of R&amp;D rising. And secondly, the industry, and indeed, AstraZeneca's output has in recent years, as you know, been disappointing and it's driven a lot of the changes we're making.</p>
          <p>So, comfortably above our cost of capital, historically. And I think, what I've just said is very much true, not just for AstraZeneca but for the industry at large. Prospectively, again, we're investing 40% to 50% of our post-tax pre-R&amp;D cash flow in R&amp;D, because we believe it will drive value and a return for our shareholders. We believe it will generate a spread above and beyond our cost of capital.</p>
          <p>To do that, we need to sustain the sort of commercial value of medicines at their sort of historic sorts of levels. We believe that that's possible given the strong growth in emerging markets. Pre-R&amp;D margins are a critical measure, and take AstraZeneca as an example. Our pre-R&amp;D margins are now 10 percentage points higher this year than they were at the average of the last decade. That creates a very substantial amount of additional return and helps us to compensate for the increased cost on &#x2013; unit cost of R&amp;D. And obviously, we're also making substantial changes within R&amp;D to improve that unit cost efficiency. So, those are the levers we're pulling to ensure we sustain that return above our cost of capital going forward.</p>
          <p>So, a great question and thanks for that, Tim. And then, finally, on tax, the provision, the $0.45 uplift to guidance that we announced back in March had two components to it, Tim. The first was the provision release, which we dimensioned at sort of $0.39, and therefore, a little bit of additional benefit coming effectively from the settlement on this year's tax rate. We've also incorporated into that some changes in the, for example, the U.K. tax rate this year. It also had a modest impact on that.</p>
          <p>And therefore, we are guiding to an overall 21% for reported &#x2013; for reported tax rate this year. I'm not going to comment specifically on tax rate beyond, other than to restate what I said in January, which is we are seeing corporate tax rates around the world are trending downwards and particularly in a couple of key geographies for us, the U.K. and Sweden, where a lot of our intellectual property is. Our tax rate in both of those countries in is coming down. So, thanks for the questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Verdult of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Peter Verdult from Morgan Stanley. Some of my questions have already been answered. So, just three quick ones, Simon. Brilinta, in France, we're obviously aware of the Brilique situation with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:00) and how that's held up a lot of drugs. Just wanted to get an update as to where we are in terms of reimbursement timelines there. Jumping then, secondly, to China, any chance of getting an update on where we are on replacing your head of China? And any further comments as far as the press release regarding the DOJ investigation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, any more comment there, your understanding of what's going on?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, staying on the theme of R&amp;D, just as we &#x2013; big event coming up in July, there are scenario analyses to be done. I just want to get a sense of how much flexibility there is in the current R&amp;D budget in the event that Brilinta and DAPA don't go your way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Peter, thanks very much, indeed, for the questions. Starting with Brilinta, with Brilique, I think you're specifically asking about the situation in France, where just sort of to recap on the situation, the French Transparency Commission, which is the group that provides advice to, obviously, to the Minister of Health of France to assess reimbursement prices. The transparency commission met in, I think, back in January and asked for some additional clinical data from us.</p>
          <p>We're in the process of providing, developing &#x2013; aggregating that information, providing it to the TC. And we expect that we'll be resubmitting within the second quarter of 2011. I can't provide you with anything further on that at this point. The &#x2013; perhaps while we're on the subject of sort of Brilinta, move in to your question about the upcoming events in July where we indeed we have the PDUFA date for Brilinta and given the DAPA registration, we obviously expect that there could well be an advisory committee in around that sort of time.</p>
          <p>The outcome of those events, clearly, we do look at a whole variety of different scenarios. I think the progress or the outcome of specific late-state or registration decisions doesn't really have an impact on what we're doing in terms of progressing the overall R&amp;D portfolio. We look to invest in R&amp;D to drive a return. That's somewhat independent of what happens in a particular decision on a particular product. But, more generally, we are looking to bring more flexibility into our R&amp;D organization. We're looking to bring more flexibility in order to be able to ramp the costs up and down on in-house R&amp;D if we see good opportunities externally.</p>
          <p>We also think that increased cost flexibility provides an excellent discipline for the decision making. We don't need to invest because we've got the fixed costs down. So, flexibility in R&amp;D is a huge priority for us.</p>
          <p>Our current assumption on China, the &#x2013; I think you probably are referring to the disclosure on the final page, or penultimate page of our press release today. And that's where we do state that we have received inquiries from the DOJ and the SEC in connection with a range of investigations in the FCPA. We're obviously cooperating with all those inquiries and we're investigating inappropriate conduct in certain countries, including China. I can't, at this stage, give any more &#x2013; give you any more information on that.</p>
          <p>And then, I think your final question was the head of China and we obviously have &#x2013; our head of China has moved on, and as a consequence of having a strong commercial organization around the world, that happens from time to time. We have already replaced the head of China with one of our strongest commercial leaders, that's actually been in Japan and that transition has already taken place very smoothly. And we continue to drive our business in China successfully. So Peter, thanks very much indeed for the questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Scala of Cowen. Thank you. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. I have two questions, first on Brilinta, does the nature of the dialogue with the FDA to date leave you fully confident in an approval in July? So, that's the first question. And secondly, on Nexium, is it a near certainty that generics will launch in 2014 when considering the manufacturing capability of the generics and the volumes necessary? And how does your view impact the decision regarding the AGLP second option in 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, thanks very much for the questions. I mean, starting with Brilinta/Brilique, more generally obviously, we're in the relatively early stages of the launch and ramp-up for Brilinta/Brilique around the world. We do have approval in some 30 &#x2013; over 30 markets and filings in place in another 31, I think, to be launched in five markets. The most significant being Germany, I would say. I made some comments about the progress in Germany, I mean, we had got off to a good start. I know that we've got something like 44% trial rate amongst cardiologists in Germany. So, obviously, where we've got the brand out on the market, it's got very strong pickup from the specialists that we're targeting.</p>
          <p>Specifically, moving back to the U.S. PDUFA date coming up on July 20th, we responded very swiftly to the CRL, we provided the information that was requested. A series of discussions are ongoing. I'm not going to provide any further commentary on those, a follow-up perhaps is due. But, yes, we remain very confident in the roles of Brilinta as options for patients going forward. So, we look forward to the July 20th date.</p>
          <p>In terms of your question on Nexium, you're asking is it a certainty that we will have generic Nexium in the market in the U.S. in 2014. As you know, we entered into a settlement covering a variety of matters with Ranbaxy a couple of years ago. And as the first fighter, they have the option to come into the market in 2014 and our planning assumption is that indeed will happen. Whether and what sort of execution issues they may or may not have, that is very much a question for them and I'd direct you to them.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry and you did have a third question, Steve, I'm doing you right, I beg your pardon. In terms of the Merck, sort of the final step in the Merck exit, you're absolutely right, there is an option on us in 2012, again through to 2017. We will look at that in light of the prospective value we see on the remaining products within that, one of which &#x2013; one of the components being Nexium, but there are others, and we'll make that decision when the time comes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And we now have a question from the line of Brian Bourdot of Barclays Capital. Thank you. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you and good afternoon. Three questions, please. The first one on Brilique. Could you talk about how you price that drug in Germany and in the five markets that you've launched relative to branded Plavix and generic Plavix and whether you are pursuing a similar pricing ambition in the other markets? Second &#x2013; so that is the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on dapagliflozin. You alluded to a possible panel, I note that there is an endocrinology panel tentatively scheduled for the 19th of July. I'm just wondering if you've had any confirmation from FDA, whether they've asked you to appear at this stage. So, that's the second question.</p>
          <p>And the third question is relating to DAPA. You mentioned increased requirement for data sort of causing returns to research and development to trend down in recent years. I guess we've just seen a recent new imposition of additional data requirements I guess reducing profitability of Symbicort, but also it could reduce the potential profitability of respiratory products, including DAPA that you have in development currently, which you have. I was just wondering if you think that there will be any preapproval requirements for any of those sorts of medicines coming that could affect your decision to invest further in that program or whether it's too early to tell? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for your questions. Perhaps just dealing with them, not strictly in the order you asked them, just to knock off the easy ones first. DAPA, I can't confirm, specific &#x2013; my comment was most medicines now, the FDA is looking for an advisory committee we expect that on DAPA. We'll wait to hear precisely if that could happen and when.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Brian, and also <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:08), you normally see an announcement from the FDA directly, where really they tend to drive the scheduling of those meetings, they put a rough &#x2013; an agenda out and a roster for that. So, I would look for the FDA to lead on that. We don't have any comment beyond that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the LABA, I think the point I made was a general one which is we have seen, as you know, Brian, that the number of patients, the size, the scale of clinical trials has sort of trended upwards and that's been a pressure on R&amp;D cost. We feel very comfortable that we are taking all of the steps needed within R&amp;D to improve unit cost efficiencies to offset that. In other words, more data, but substantial lower cost per data, and that is a key driver of our confidence in sustaining returns above our cost of capital as we go forward, which was the comment I made in answer to Tim's question.</p>
          <p>So, we do see that, it's just a fact of business that we're in, one that we will mitigate through efficiency and efforts within R&amp;D. I'm not going to make any more specific comments about LABAs. Yes, there are some additional data requirements that there are in a number of other categories. We take that into account when we design clinical trials, when we make investment decisions and when we judge the outcome on LABA specifically. In terms of Brilinta/Brilique pricing, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:30) that is &#x2013; the whole PLATO program demonstrated Brilinta's efficacy relative to Plavix and that's clearly a key driver of our pricing decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Brian, if you wanted to take a look there, you can get the public domain prices, so if you judge it through the lens of those markets we've already launched in where've got a price established in the marketplace. Typically, if you look at some of that, Plavix maybe in the German market, a little over &#x20AC;2 a day, Effient would be sort of &#x20AC;2.20, and we're a little above that at just under &#x20AC;2.50 a day.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Operator, I think we probably have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>One more question, that's from Michael Leacock of RBS. Thank you. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two if I may. Firstly, on pricing, if I look at Thomson MarketScan, the price rises on Crestor and Seroquel were running at sort of 12% to 16% and Thomson MarketScan suggests that their data are from insurers who actually paid these prices rather than list price.</p>
          <p>If one were to apply those price rises to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:12) sales for Crestor and Seroquel that you had in the U.S. in 2010, that would broadly cover in its entirety the $700 million you suggest is the cost of the U.S. Health Care reform? Is that a fair statement and if not what's wrong with it? And secondly, just on Brilinta much more clearly, I think last <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:30) hinted at one publication, that your aspirin analysis will be published soon. It was in peer review I think about a month or two ago. Have you got any visibility on when that might be published and will you let us know as soon as it is? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I believe that there's likely to be a forthcoming publication with more detailed findings on the aspirin, Jonathan, do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, your question shows you're absolutely up-to-date, that's exactly where it is. As far as we know, the paper's been written, it's in peer review. And after that, your guess is as good as ours, how long that peer review and publication timeline will be. But, we certainly get a sense that it will be sooner rather than later, just can't give you a specific date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of, I think, your question on pricing. There were gross price increases so list price increases on a number of our medicines, including Crestor and Seroquel in the U.S. during the course of 2010. The net price that we receive is obviously a function of the formulary positioning and the rebates and discounts negotiated with a whole range of individual customers. We did sustain some net price increase on Crestor and on Seroquel during 2010 and into the first quarter of 2011. That has partially mitigated the wider U.S. Health Care reform impact, but by no means fully mitigated it, that remains a headwind &#x2013; a net headwind on the business. So, Michael, thanks for the question and my apologies, I'm afraid I have to move on, so, operator, we'll need to bring the call to a close.</p>
