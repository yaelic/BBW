        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning everyone here in London and good evening for those joining us from Australia, and a warm welcome to those participating via the webcast. With me here in London, we've got Tom Albanese, Chief Executive; and our CFO, Guy Elliott, is hosting our presentation from Sydney.</p>
          <p>Rio Tinto has produced another set of impressive results, reflecting favorable market conditions and strong demand for our products, in particular from Asia. Our operations have performed well in the face of unusually adverse weather conditions, and I must say that I continue to be impressed with the way that our people respond to challenges such as these, leading to excellent operating results at all of our managed operations.</p>
          <p>We are clearly in a major investment phase, which is continuing to gather pace, and over the past six months, we've added to our growth portfolio through the highly successful acquisition of Riversdale. But as I said in February, we believe that the creation of shareholder value over the long-term requires a balanced approach towards investing in high-quality growth and returning excess cash to shareholders. So far this year, we have completed $3 billion of the $5 billion buyback program that we announced in February, and today we've announced that we intent to maintain this buyback through the coming months. We have increased our buyback program by $2 billion to $7 billion, which we will complete by the end of the first quarter of 2012 subject of course, as always, to market conditions.</p>
          <p>The global economic environment clearly continues to be volatile. Policymakers are grappling with substantial economic imbalances in both developed and developing countries. That rebalancing process will take time, and change is unlikely to occur smoothly. However, in an uncertain and volatile environment, our strategy is clear and unchanged: to invest in assets of the highest quality, supported by a strong balance sheet. So, together with our fundamental belief in the long-term demand growth for our products, this gives us real confidence in the long-term future of our business.</p>
          <p>That's all from me, and I'm going to hand you over to Tom. Thanks, Tom.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jan and good morning to you; and for those of you in Australia, good evening. Before I turn to our first half results, I'd like to start, as always, with safety. Once again, we recorded improvement in our lost time injury frequency and all injury frequency rates during the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>However, this was overshadowed by four fatalities during the first half, mostly at construction projects. These were unacceptable, and we are taking action in all cases. At a time of rapid and substantial growth for our businesses, it is vital that we are able to grow our operations with everyone going home safely each and every day through their career. I will ensure that further improvements in safety performance are identified and implemented as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our first half results. In 2011, we achieved record earnings, record EBITDA, and record operating cash flow for the first half period. This was despite the exceptional adverse weather conditions that we experienced. We are recovering well through these, although there are still some residual effects at some of our operations, in particular in Queensland and the Northern Territory. We are making great progress in our industry-leading portfolio of growth leading projects and during the first half of the year, we increased the pace of spend at these projects to expand iron ore production from the Pilbara to 283 million tonnes per year by the end of 2013. We also announced the acceleration of our plans to expand this business further, to 333 million tonnes, and our target has actually been brought forward by six months, to the first half of 2015. This is in stark contrast to broader iron ore industry trends, which have seen many projects subject to significant delay.</p>
          <p>Just this Monday, we achieved a landmark when we completed the compulsory acquisition of the remaining Riversdale shares and we reached 100% ownership. Key Rio Tinto management have been appointed and already are on site in Mozambique. And right now, we're focused on the completion of the first phase of the Benga project, and we're evaluating the most effective and value-enhancing strategy to develop the entire resource acquired with Riversdale. We've increased our investment in Ivanhoe through the acquisition of shares and the exercise of our warrants, so we now own 46.5% of Ivanhoe and have nominated half the seats on the Board of Directors. We put in place a Rio Tinto team to manage the development of world-class Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold project and the development is well underway.</p>
          <p>In Guinea, we signed a settlement agreement with the government which allows us to take the world-class Simandou resource forward to first production by 2015. And as Jan mentioned, we are able to balance this investment in our industry-leading growth program with the return of excess capital to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Of course, one of the key drivers for our record earnings was the strong price environment in the first half. Demand from China continues to be strong; we saw a number of supply constraints across the industry. These included significant interruptions from adverse weather and labor unrest in some key producing regions. Looking ahead, consensus global growth estimates have moderated recently, but remain at around 3.5% this year. We do expect strong GDP growth in China, at about 9.5% in 2011, despite a year and a half of progressive credit tightening. Inflation does remain high, but it's likely to be close to its peak. In Japan, a key market for our products, the economy contracted in the first half. Analysts are predicting a modest recovery as industrial production and manufacturing rebound following the tsunami disaster in March. On the supply-side, the industry continues to struggle to bring on new production. Key input costs, including labor, capital equipment and consumables are rising, and tightening supply is affecting small producers in particular. These macro conditions suggest higher average prices for the remainder of this year and into 2012.</p>
          <p>However, there are two key macro risks to this outlook, the pace of credit tightening in developing countries and the risks of sovereign debt crises. The extraordinary scenes that we saw played out in Washington last week and over the weekend are symptomatic of the challenges faced by countries with significant debt. Eurozone problems have worsened considerably in recent months, and the potential remains for a debt crisis that could spread across the European continent.</p>
          <p>If anything, events in Washington, Greece, Italy and Spain over the last few weeks reinforce that we are in a volatile environment. Any of these risks can lead to a destabilization of the global economic activity, and therefore commodity markets. We are well-positioned to navigate volatile conditions with our high quality, low-cost operations and our strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to the product groups, starting with iron ore. We benefited from relatively stable prices through the first half, driven by robust demand from China, for this has more than offset the weak demand from Japan that we saw after the devastating tsunami. On the supply side, weaker than expected seaborne supply was the result of adverse weather in the Pilbara, lower than expected Brazilian exports, and Indian supply still constrained by export bans. As I've said, our Pilbara operations were affect &#x2013; heavily affected by the significant rains; we did suffer widespread flooding, a related train derailment, and loss of about nine shipping days. All in all, these events lead to a 5% decline in shipments during the first half compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>Production did recover strongly in the second quarter, and was in fact the second highest quarter on record. And this was a great result considering the adverse weather conditions. We successfully expanded our Pilbara capacity to 225 million tonnes per year on time and on budget, and we remain on track for global production of 240 million tonnes this year from our Australian and Canadian operations. Critical to the optimization of our supply chain and the maximization delivery of iron ore to the seaborne market is the flexibility and efficiency derived from our integrated systems.</p>
          <p>In May, the Federal Court ruled in favor that third parties were not permitted to run trains on our rail network. And while this case is not entirely closed, we welcome this endorsement and look forward to its eventual conclusion. On the technology front, we announced a doubling of our driverless truck fleet in the Pilbara, the first operational deployment of this technology in Australia &#x2013; or anywhere, on this scale. The trucks will be controlled from our industry-leading operations center in Perth, whose benefits are becoming increasingly evident.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our iron ore growth projects. Back in June, we took a group of you to our Pilbara operations to view first-hand the progress that's being made on the expansion of what I believe to be the premier iron ore business in the world. Our expansion to 283 million tonnes per year is progressing well and on schedule. We recently ordered the long lead time items required for the expansion to 333 million tonnes, enabling us to accelerate the time table by six months, to the first half of 2015.</p>
          <p>By doing so, we're able to keep all key contractors in place; they will simply move on from one expansion project to the next, creating greater efficiencies. We've also approved a further US$2 billion of expenditures as a result of the stronger forecast Australian dollar, and I do want to emphasize that our capital expenditure in Australian-controlled budgets remains on budget and on Australian dollar terms. Guy will cover this in more depth in a moment.</p>
          <p>Our Canadian expansions are also progressing to plan. At IOC, we expect annual capacity to be lifted by 4 million tonnes early next year to 22 million tonnes, and we have a clear pathway to 26 million tonnes with the potential to almost double this to 50 million tonnes.</p>
          <p>At Simandou, we signed a settlement agreement with the government of Guinea, paving the way for the first shipment of iron ore by mid-2015. We certainly have a number of important milestones still to achieve before we approve this major project, but this vital agreement gives us the certainty to invest and to move forward. Activities on the ground at Guinea continue to be ramped up; project spend is currently about $20 million per month and this will increase nearly fivefold over the coming months. The time table to first production is challenging and requiring intensive approach to project delivery. On ground rail and port surveys are now in progress and engineering is now underway. Tenders are being called for early infrastructure facilities, with construction on critical path items to commence in parallel with this.</p>
          <p>Moving on to aluminum, we benefited from tight physical markets and continued strength and demand in China, where newly installed capacity is taking time to ramp up. As a result, we did see prices rising 20% half-on-half. As foreshadowed in our February results, cost pressures are returning to the industry, including the effect of strong currencies and the higher cost of caustic, coke and pitch.</p>
          <p>In addition, we've had to contend with other external and abnormal factors, such as heavy rains in Australia, which impacted our alumina refineries in Queensland in particular. Hydrology conditions in the Saguenay did, though, return to normal in 2011, following the low snow and rain levels experienced in 2010. Operationally there have been some improvements, notably at the Gove alumina refinery, where output was stable and we set a new quarterly production record in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The expansion of the Yarwun alumina refinery remains on track. Bauxite processing will start in the first half of 2012, leading to the first alumina production in mid-2012. This expansion will move our average position further down the cost curve. However, like in iron ore, the U.S. dollar cost has impacted by the strengthening Australian dollar. Our transformation of the aluminum business continues, with plans firmly in place to achieve an EBITDA margin of 40% by 2014.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> The team (13:00) will provide further details on this initiative at our seminar in September, but just to summarize, the objective will be achieved through focusing on three key priorities: first, incremental EBITDA of $1 billion through cost and production efficiencies, optimization of product mix and capacity creep, second, step change improvement through capital investment in major projects, such as Yarwun 2 and the modernization of Kitimat and at AP60 and, of course, finally, disciplined portfolio management.</p>
          <p>Strategic reviews are underway for Lynemouth smelter and power plant in the UK and at European specialty alumina refineries. And more work is being undertaken across the Aluminum portfolio. At Kitimat, if the decision is made to invest in the full modernization project at the end of this year, we would expect to have this project completed by the end of 2014. And this is a key element to realizing our 40% margin objective.</p>
          <p>Moving into copper. Stronger prices continue for copper and all the byproducts, driven by a steady increase in demand coupled with a very small increase in world refined production. Market tightness has meant that any news of labor disputes or weather disruptions reverberate through the stock price. And of course, one example is the current strike at Escondida, which is now in its second week. At our 2010 Investor Seminar, we gave some guidance on our future copper production, and, as anticipated, we did see a dip in grades at the Kennecott Utah Copper, Escondida and Grasberg operations.</p>
          <p>These swings in grades reflect the normal cycles encountered in these types of copper deposits. We do expect a recovery in 2012 as grades pick up again. And as we move into 2013, we'll also see some new production coming in from the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine in Mongolia. In June of this year, we increased our ownership of Ivanhoe to 46.5%, following the exercise of our remaining warrants. And we have the right to increase our interests to 49% prior to the expiry of our standstill on the 18th of January 2012.</p>
          <p>During the first half of this year and following the agreement reached with Ivanhoe in December 2010, Rio Tinto put in place a management team to lead the development and operations at Oyu Tolgoi. I have been pleased with the progress on the ground, with construction nearly a third complete as of 30th of June 2011. While development continues to be on schedule, Oyu Tolgoi does require an agreed power solution to deliver first commercial production in 2013.</p>
          <p>Our other copper projects are making steady progress. At a recent Resolution project in Arizona, we recently approved just over $100 million to deepen shaft number 9 to full depth and for engineering commitments on two further shafts. Exploration of the resource continues, with encouraging drill results over the first half.</p>
          <p>At La Granja in Peru, we completed 50% of our 30 kilometer drilling program, with some promising high-grade intersections identified. And at Kennecott Utah Copper, we recently approved $238 million to fund the feasibility study and long lead time items for the extension of the Bingham Canyon Mine from 2020 to 2028. Approval has been given for pre-feasibility funding to evaluate the additional potential for a small underground mine near the Bingham Canyon, <mark type="ph" /> Colbinworth rid and Skarn. (16:28) This would operate in parallel with the open pit and could be operating in about five years' time.</p>
          <p>In Northparkes, we're evaluating a step change expansion which would increase production threefold. In addition, next year we will try our new tunneling technology at Northparkes, which has the potential to more than double the rate of conventional tunneling methods. Moving on to energy. Demand for both coking and thermo coal was healthy in the first half of 2011, with growth from China and India offsetting reduced consumption by Japan following the tsunami. Supply disruptions are playing their part in boosting prices, and our operations were no exception. Our four Queensland coal mines experienced major production challenges during the first quarter, leading to a declaration of force majeure at all sites. This has now been lifted and all operations are recovering well, although production rates have not yet reached their full capacity.</p>
          <p>At Hunter Valley, mines were impacted to a lesser extent, but were also affected by rains in June. Expansions are progressing, with additional port capacity now secured for the 8.5 million tonne per year Mount Pleasant thermal coal project. And we would expect this to come up for full board approval toward the end of this year, with first production in 2014.</p>
          <p>Energy projects have also been affected by the strength of the Australian dollar and other inflationary effects, Kestrel in particular. We have not yet approved any additional capital for Kestrel, but we are reviewing the budget and schedule at this underground expansion following the extensive flooding in the first quarter and currency movements.</p>
          <p>Turning to uranium, ERA experienced some of the worst weather conditions in living memory, causing it to shut down the processing plant from January to June. We intend to raise support of ERA's strategy and plans as outlined by ERA today, including ERA's strategic water management initiatives. We understand that ERA has engaged a financial advisor, and is well developed to developing a long-term funding plan. Subject to the usual internal approvals, Rio Tinto's committed to playing its role as part of that funding.</p>
          <p>An important highlight of this half was the transformation of our Energy group's growth portfolio through the acquisition of Riversdale, giving us access to a number of Tier one coking coal projects in Mozambique. On Monday, we completed the compulsory acquisition process and now own 100% of Riversdale. This was an uncontested bid where there were two existing strategic shareholders, and many observers doubted our ability to reach full ownership. This was a major achievement by the Rio team.</p>
          <p>Eric Finlayson, who took over from me as Global Head of Exploration, has been appointed managing director of Riversdale and is now based in Mozambique. He is well-placed to bring his expertise in resource optimization development to our newly acquired coking coal resources, assuring that they deliver value to shareholders for years to come. Eric and his team are reviewing the engineering and strategic planning options for this world-class asset. Their near-term focus is to get the first phase of Benga project up and running.</p>
          <p>And at this stage, we'd expect first production at the end of the year, ramping up to full production for the phase one of 1.6 million tonnes of coke per year &#x2013; coking coal &#x2013; and 800,000 tonnes per year of thermal coal by the end of 2012. There are some further exciting growth options underway, including further expansion of Benga and the development of a substantial Zambezi Resource from the Tete East project, both of these 100% owned by Rio Tinto.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a look at our Diamonds and Minerals product groups. Demand for borates and titanium dioxide feedstocks continued to strengthen in line with improving global economic conditions. Market conditions for rough diamonds strengthened during first half of 2011, as demand from India and China continued to grow, with a moderate recovery from the U.S. TiO2 prices have been receiving a lot of focus this year. For the time being, our exposure to spot prices will be relatively limited. As our multi-year contracts mature over the next few years, they'll be replaced by contracts with alternate pricing mechanisms which will provide increased exposure to the current market pricing. At Argyle, production was impacted by significant rainfall that occurred in March and April, which restricted access to the ore body due to flooding. Access has now been restored and the underground development project is progressing.</p>
          <p>Production will be affected by lower grades until the underground mine is fully operational in 2013. And, like our other Australian projects, U.S. dollar equipment costs will be impacted by currency movements. At QMM in Madagascar, production is up by over a third compared to the first half of 2010, due to the successful dry mining operations and full capacity is expected to be reached over the next two to three years. We continue to evaluate further growth options across our Diamonds and Minerals portfolio and, just this week, we finally completed the divestment of our Talc operations.</p>
          <p>So now with that, over to Guy in Sydney.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom. Hello, everybody. Now, let's take a look at how our record first half underlying earnings were achieved. It will come as no surprise that the primary driver has been price, increasing earnings by $5 billion. We provided a breakdown of the price variance by commodity at the back of your handouts, in which you'll see that by far the largest benefit came from the strong iron ore markets we continue to experience.</p>
          <p>Higher copper and aluminum prices were also significant, increasing earnings by approximately $600 million apiece. These strong prices were partially offset by the impact of currency movements, notably the stronger Australian dollar. These collectively reduced our underlying earnings by $810 million compared with the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Lower sales volumes reduced earnings by $444 million, following the extraordinary weather disruptions in the first half. Iron ore operations were disrupted by several cyclones, widespread flooding and a subsequent train derailment. Despite these challenges, we completed the expansion of our Pilbara system to a capacity of 225 million tonnes per year, and are looking forward to a strong second half.</p>
          <p>Sale volumes were also affected by expected lower copper and gold grades at Kennecott Utah Copper, Escondida and Grasberg. We'll experience lower grades for the rest of this year before seeing an improvement in the second half of 2012. Higher cash costs reduced earnings by $1.2 billion, which I'll return to in a moment. The effect of exploration and evaluation costs reflects a greater level of investment in the business, and that's what I consider to be a good cost. And so our underlying earnings were $7.8 billion. All things being considered, this was a good result in a challenging operating environment.</p>
          <p>However, we did see some pressures on our operating costs, which I'd like to explain more thoroughly. As I just mentioned, cash costs reduced underlying earnings by $1.2 billion in the first half. This increase was significantly influenced by uncontrollable factors in the first half of 2011, including adverse weather and lower grades, higher input prices for raw materials, and general inflation.</p>
          <p>Bad weather in the first half, particularly at our Australian operations, impacted earnings by $245 million. This was a consequence of higher unit operating costs from lower volumes and remediation costs to return operations to normal operating levels. As Tom previously highlighted, our operations have largely recovered from these severe weather conditions.</p>
          <p>Markets for key raw materials to the mining and minerals industry have continued to tighten, as output and investment has increased across the industry. Raw material prices have continued their upward trend. Some products with structural supply side constraints, such as caustic, coke, pitch and explosives, have continued to experience high prices during the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Tightening raw materials prices, increased labor costs, localized inflation in mining hot spots and commodity price-related expenditure, including an increase in royalty rates; all these decreased earnings by $384 million. Then, there were unit cost increases associated with non-weather related production declines, most notably from previously foreshadowed lower grades in the Copper group. These decreased earnings by a further $67 million.</p>
          <p>The next variance of $350 million to earnings reflects our investment in our growth projects to begin the transition from the status of Under Construction to that of Operating Business. This involves putting teams and systems in place prior to project completion, ensuring the most efficient ramp-up of production. We've also incurred costs associated with the transition to new mining operations for the first time in 2011, particularly in our Pilbara operations.</p>
          <p>We expect to see continued growth in real mining wages over the medium-term, as many countries face an under-supply of skilled mining labor. Availability of appropriately skilled engineers, project managers and contractors is going to be critical to achieving short-term production forecasts.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we should expect to see continued inflation in production costs and in input prices, in particular labor cost in locations such as Australia and Canada, and certain critical raw materials. Our leadership in operational excellence helps us to identify further opportunities through a focus on cost management and productivity gains, to ensure that our cost base continues to be well-controlled. Of course, our strong earnings led to strong cash flows, demonstrating the exceptional cash-generating capabilities of our Tier one assets.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations, including dividends received from equity accounted units, increased by 31% to $12.9 billion in the first half of 2011. We invested $5.1 billion in capital expenditure; momentum is returning, and this rate of spend is increasing into the second half of 2011 and beyond, as I'll explain in a minute.</p>
          <p>Our successful acquisition of Riversdale was completed earlier this week, although the majority of the cash costs occurred in the first half. We invested a further $1.3 billion to increase our ownership of Ivanhoe to 46.5%, and we participated in its rights issue to support the development of Oyu Tolgoi. These investments reflect successful value-accretive acquisitions in world-class assets.</p>
          <p>We continue to balance investing in the business with returning capital to shareholders. During the first half of 2011, we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through the final dividend payment and the share buyback program. Overall, after taking into account interest, tax and various other cash flows, we increased net debt by $4.5 billion, leaving us at $8.6 billion at the 30 of June. We've also continued to optimize our payment profile by issuing $2 billion of bonds in the first half with maturities of 5, 10 and 30 years, at attractive coupons.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains in great shape. Our strong cash generation and balance sheet will allow us to fund our substantial pipeline of high-quality growth projects. Capital expenditure is ramping up, with $5.1 billion invested in the first half, including the payment made by Simfer to the government of Guinea.</p>
          <p>Our major projects are making great progress against their key milestones. Yarwun 2 remains on schedule for first alumina production by mid-2012. In the Pilbara, head count related to construction projects has rapidly increased, from about 1,000 at the beginning of the year to 2,500 at the end of June. This will continue to increase throughout the second half of the year, doubling to 5000 by year-end. At Oyu Tolgoi, the project is over 30% complete, and more than 50% of the phase one commitments have been made. This will drive increasing investment through the second half.</p>
          <p>At the end of June, we already had $6 billion of capital expenditure commitments scheduled for payment during the second half. We expect to continue ramping up our rate of spend on our portfolio of high-quality organic growth projects through the second half of 2011 and into 2012.</p>
          <p>Capital projects are not immune to changes in currencies, particularly those located in Australia. We've seen a significant strengthening of the Australian dollar in recent months. As a result, we've announced an increase in capital expenditures in U.S dollar terms. A step change in market expectations for the Australian dollar has had the effect of increasing U.S dollar equivalent capital expenditure by approximately $2 billion at our approved projects in the Pilbara.</p>
          <p>This is a multi-year investment program, and projects are subjected to changes in economic conditions. As an example, when the Yarwun 2 was approved in 2007, the Australian to U.S dollar exchange rate was about $0.85. It decreased to a low of about $0.61 in January 2009 during the global financial crisis, and then it peaked at over $1.10 a few days ago.</p>
          <p>In order to provide additional insight into the impact that currencies can have on our capital projects, I've provided these two examples of our larger projects, the Pilbara infrastructure expansion to 283 million tonnes and the Yarwun 2 expansion. The actual Australian to U.S. dollar exchange rate, on average, tracked closely to our estimates through the middle of 2010. Since then, as you're all well aware, the exchange rate has risen sharply. As these projects are highly leveraged to the Australian dollar, currency movements have impacted project costs in U.S. dollar terms. Business units manage capital expenditures in local currencies. But let me reassure you that our projects remain on budget in those terms, with no significant changes in scope.</p>
          <p>Stronger exchange rates are just one of the challenges facing the mining industry today. Lead times for most major pieces of equipment are extending, and some are approaching timelines last seen in 2008. With greater lead times, we also expect short-term cost escalation for major pieces of equipment.</p>
          <p>The increase in lead times is adding to the overall challenges the industry is facing to bring on new supply, although our key projects are tracking to their original plan timelines. Rio Tinto is favorably positioned in this environment, with our global procurement strategies, including long-term relationships with key suppliers and early commitments on critical equipment. This approach secures our placement in our supplier's production plans.</p>
          <p>Taking haul trucks as an example, the normal lead time is about one year. However, lead times have been extended by about nine months due to current demand levels. Through early engagement, we've secured our position within haul truck manufacturers' production plans to deliver our required &#x2013; truck requirements for major projects, including Pilbara 333 project. While the availability of equipment is creating some headwinds, the industry supply response is also challenged by resource nationalism, and for some smaller players, also by the availability of financing.</p>
          <p>Wherever we operate, sustainable development underpins our approach to developing and operating our businesses. The mining and natural resources sector occupies an increasingly strategic and exposed position in the thinking of host governments. While these factors can lead to tensions, with effective management and proactive leadership, we can develop this into a competitive advantage. In volatile markets, some companies may find it difficult to finance projects. Considering the strength of our balance sheet, this environment may present opportunities for us to gain access to new resources.</p>
          <p>Turning to our priorities for the use of our cash flows, as we've outlined many times, our first priority is to increase shareholder value by focusing on high-quality growth. Value is the key. During the first half of 2011, we delivered on this priority, with more than $10 billion of high-quality investments. This included both organic capital expenditure and acquisitions. We have many attractive organic opportunities to grow, and as I've described, our rate of CapEx spend is rising. We will retain a prudent balance sheet that will allow us to continue to invest as appropriate through the cycle in our first class growth projects and in other opportunities that may arise. In April 2011, Standard &amp; Poor's raised our credit rating to single A minus. We've now regained single A status from all major international credit agencies, achieving a key corporate target.</p>
          <p>The third pillar of our financial strategy is capital management. I'm committed to ensuring that the capital structure of Rio Tinto is efficient and well-balanced within the parameters of a single A credit rating and a progressive dividend policy. In February, we announced a $5 billion buyback to be completed by the end of 2012. As a result of the business' strong cash generation, we've already completed $3 billion of this program. Today we announced that we would increase the program by $2 billion, which would maintain our current pace of buyback. We expect to complete the program by the end of the first quarter of 2012, subject to market conditions.</p>
          <p>This reflects a balance between our priority to invest in high-quality value accretive growth, while considering the economic volatility of the markets that we operate within. Finally, an important priority for us remains the dividend. As foreshadowed six months ago, we have declared an interim dividend equal to one half of the previous year's full-year dividend. This leads to a payment of US$0.54 per share, a 20% increase on last year's interim dividend. Given the long-term nature of our business, it makes sense to revisit the dividend on an annual basis. Of course, we are aware of the importance of income to some shareholders and intend to closely review the level of the dividend in February next year.</p>
          <p>Now back to you, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Guy. Turning to the long-term outlook, we continue to hold the view that the longer term drivers of industrialization and urbanization, driven by increasing prosperity in developing countries, remains intact.</p>
          <p>This is well-demonstrated by the fact that China's Central and Western provinces continue to experience far lower GDP per capita and metals intensity rates than their Eastern neighbors. I was recently in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, and witnessed the growth of the Western cities for myself. The activity in the ground and the development plans demonstrate quite clearly the intent of the inner regions to grow rapidly. As urbanization rates rise, we're also seeing increasingly metals-intensive construction in China, as buildings become higher and regulations for construction more stringent.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the short-term uncertainty and volatility in the markets, we continue to expect that, over the next 15 to 20 years, consumption trends will lead to a doubling in demand for iron ore, for copper, for aluminum and certainly for other commodities. On the supply side, volatility of the capital markets could reduce availability of finance for some projects. New ore bodies are harder to find, are getting deeper and are more technically challenged. Many are located in higher risk regions and often subject to longer stakeholder engagement processes.</p>
          <p>This is just one reason why the group's strategic commitment to sustainable development is a crucial factor maintaining and extending our ability to do business. The combination of strong demand growth and industry supply challenges gives us confidence that real long-term prices and margins for almost all the minerals and metals will continue at elevated levels, albeit, of course, with heightened price volatility.</p>
          <p>We're growing into this strong environment of rising demand for our products through our strategic allocation of capital to our high-quality growth programs. We currently have $26 billion worth of major capital projects underway. Many of these projects have been approved recently and are still in the process of ramping up expenditure. We have spent $5 billion of capital in the first half, and as Guy said, we already have committed to spend a further $6 billion during the second half of this year. As you can see from the detail before you, this investment is focused on large, long-life, cost-competitive projects across a wide range of products. This is right in line with our strategy of focusing on the development of Tier one ore bodies. And I look forward to reporting on further milestones as these projects progress through to completion.</p>
          <p>Looking further ahead, we have a world-class portfolio of high-quality tier one projects in advanced study. We have tens of billions of dollars of this type, including the underground development at Oyu Tolgoi, the world's best undeveloped greenfield copper deposit, and the largest high-grade undeveloped iron ore deposit at Simandou. These projects have not yet been approved for full development, but most are expected to come before the board over the next 12 months. Each of these projects is a natural fit with our strategy, and they are truly tier one assets.</p>
          <p>And further, we've an active program of projects at an earlier stage of evaluation in each of our product groups. These projects may be longer-term, but they are all exceptionally high-quality tier one assets themselves. And this will allow Rio Tinto to continue to grow through the decades ahead. I think over the course of the year, we've been providing more information on the progress that we're making with each of these world-class assets over the investment seminars that we have two scheduled in the second half.</p>
          <p>The quality of our growth program is underpinned by our strategic focus and leadership in two vital areas, exploration and step-change innovative technologies. Rio Tinto has a record of success in exploration, literally spanning many decades. Our in-house exploration teams have discovered many of the tier one assets in operation today, including our Pilbara iron ore business, Weipa, Diavik and QMM in Madagascar, to name just a few.</p>
          <p>Our leading organization of exploration professionals have also added significant value to the outstanding growth profile we have, either through the initial discovery of tier one ore bodies, the evaluation of other people's discoveries to optimize the resource and development plan, or by applying their expertise to turn minor deposits into tier one resources.</p>
          <p>Our strategic production planning process allows us to evaluate literally thousands of alternative mine planning scenarios in order to optimize our growth plans. And this skill is vital in a business where large sums of capital must be invested upfront, and early design decisions can influence value creation, literally over a number of decades.</p>
          <p>When I became Chief Executive in 2007, <mark type="ph" /> I and we (42:48) took the strategic decision to target investment in innovative step-change technologies. We've focused our attention on a small number of areas where we believed we could generate significant value and differentiate ourselves from the rest of the industry; this decision is now delivering. We see real benefits from our operations center in Perth, from where we control the whole of the Pilbara supply chain, including 14 mines, 1400 kilometers of rail, and 3 separate port terminals. We're also moving forward with advanced underground mine development technologies and intend to prototype some of these at Northparkes in 2012.</p>
          <p>These step-change technologies, along with others, have the potential to deliver significant value over the coming years. And I believe our approach will allow us to gain access to the best ore bodies in the world, either though discovery or value optimization. And we believe this will provide us with competitive advantage over the years and decades to come.</p>
          <p>So to conclude, the first half of 2011 has been another exceptional period for Rio Tinto. We delivered record first-half earnings, EBITDA and operating cash flows. In the near-term, we expect demand for our products to remain strong within a volatile macroeconomic environment. At the same time, the strength of the Australian and Canadian currencies and rising raw material costs will continue to put pressure on the industry. We will not be complacent; really sure that our costs remain well-controlled. Looking over the longer-term, our growth continues to gather momentum. We've accelerated iron ore expansion in the Pilbara, which I believe is the highest-value, lowest-risk iron ore project in the industry.</p>
          <p>Our spend is gathering pace, and we've secured future growth options at Oyu Tolgoi, Simandou and Riversdale. In just six months, we've invested over $10 billion in high-quality projects, either through organic investment or M&amp;A. At the same time, we're able to balance our investment programs with the return of excess capital to our shareholders through our enhanced share buyback program. Six months ago, I told you Rio Tinto was entering 2011 in a position of strength. Our range of organic growth options is larger than ever. Our business is generating record cash flows. And our people are continuing to deliver industry-leading operational performance and project delivery. In challenging market conditions, those companies with the best assets, the best people and the best operational capability, will be the most successful.</p>
          <p>Our long-established strategy of focusing on long-life, cost-competitive, expandable assets, together with our expertise in sustainable development, expiration, and technology and innovation, will allow us to enhance shareholder value over the longer-term.</p>
          <p>So we'll now be happy to take your questions, starting here with the audience in London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think, just for the total audience, I'll start with the questions in London, then I'll move over to Sydney, and then I'll move over to the phone. And Guy, you'll of course moderate the questions when we move over to Sydney. So first we'll start here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, Tom. Rob Clifford, Deutsche Bank. Just two questions on CapEx. Firstly, just a bit concerned about the rate. Last year, you fell short of the CapEx target and said it would carry into this year. In the first half, you spent $5.1 billion, but $700 million of that goes to the Guinea government and not into the ground, so it's more like sort of $4.4 billion. So you look a long way short of the $13 billion that had been discussed previously. And on top of that, the Australian dollar, obviously, is inflating part of that $4.4 billion, so what &#x2013; how do we get confidence that you can actually ramp up to the rate that you've just been talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, thank you for that. I will just maybe make a few comments, then Guy, if you can say a little more detail. We've had a long history of project development and what we all recognize, I know you know, you've been following this quite closely, there's a normal S curve in project development where, in the early month and sometimes it takes even longer than the early months, you're really doing the surveys, you're doing the pre-commitments, you're doing the work that needs to be done before you actually have large construction activities on the ground. For example, Pilbara expansion continues to remain on track; I was there about a month ago, they're putting in pilings for the various activities. While that's generating a burn rate of cash being spent, it's certainly a lot less than you'll seen in the coming months because, again, as you put foundations in, as you put pilings in, then after that, you begin to put on the true fabrication and the true, more expensive burn rates.</p>
          <p>So I look at the $5.1 billion, and then I look at the fact that we've got commitments of at least $6 billion in the second half. I'm comfortable that we are going to be spending in excess of $11 billion, certainly the math will show that in the second half &#x2013; and probably closer to $12 billion. Now our previous numbers would have been $13 billion &#x2013; are our projects, the key projects on track, yes. Oyu Tolgoi on track, Pilbara on track, Yarwun 3 on track. Am I asking people to spend money just for the sake of me being a target? No. Again, we want to be prudent with all of the monies that we spend and we will be properly reflective of the fact that you don't really want to change the pace of what should be a normal construction spend S curve. So, I don't know, Guy, if there's anything else you can add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that you, by implication, raise the question of currency, understandably. The amount of higher capital that was expended because of the currencies in the first half was about $280 million. So, it is true that the run rate, obviously, is lower than what we expect for the year. But I do think that if you look at the <mark type="ph" /> demanning (48:38) and the other commitments that we've got, it's very, very clear that we're going to see a much escalated level of capital expenditure in the second half.</p>
          <p>I think that the exact timing of payments in the period November through February, I don't know what that will be. But the important thing is that we do not foresee delays in our main projects, the ones that we've mainly been describing today. So, I think that we're pretty confident of the numbers that we've given out, actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, just one more point on sustaining capital, because a large portion of our total capital budget will be sustaining capital. During the financial crisis, we, like everyone else, cut way back on this sustaining capital. We focused on those things needed to protect the safety of the facilities and our employees, of course, but we actually held back quite a bit of activity. And I think, as we ramp projects back, I think on reflection, we probably have some element of wishlist of projects that are on each plant-by-plant sustaining capital that actually may take longer to get done than would have been scheduled for this year. That's not affecting the growth rates, of course, and of course we will continue to do the work required to protect the integrity, but in terms of just the ability of plants to do that work in that given time, I suspect that'll be part of the reason why we will come in less than that $13 billion we would have said earlier this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a second question, I guess following on from Guy's point about currency. Rio Tinto used to hedge currency so that when the board committed to a U.S dollar number they could be more confident of getting the original returns rather than, as we're seeing now, reduced returns. Why did Rio move away from that, and would you look at reinstating that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to let Guy answer, but I just make one comment about history because, I think in the past actually, our actual practices, in some cases we hedged the currency on capital projects, in some cases we didn't. And generally the bias would be in those cases where we had a, say, a third party involved with the project that wouldn't necessarily have been as capable of weathering the financial issues.</p>
          <p>We've always borne in mind, whether it's operating costs or capital costs, that once you begin hedging the currency, you actually begin to break that natural hedge, and so we were mindful of that, as we look at hedging on a going-forward basis. But, Guy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, the history is actually that we very rarely have hedged the capital projects. Now, there was an important exception, which was in 2003-4, when we did the first stage of the Pilbara expansion. We did hedge that project, the capital element of it. We took that decision because we thought it was an easy decision.</p>
          <p>The Aussie dollar at that time was in the range $0.50 to $0.55. It's a bit easier to take a decision when the Aussie dollar is at that level. It's much more difficult when it's approaching parity. And so, we have not hedged these matters and, as you can see, that's gone slightly against us in these two projects that we've discussed today. But, I think that the world knows that we're not very big hedgers and that's the policy that we follow. Getting it right is very difficult.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. Tom, just to push on -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your last question, just leave other questions for --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just from a natural hedge; how do you get a natural hedge when you're not earning from your commodities while you're constructing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we've generally seen over the past few years is sort of a higher elevated view of long-term commodity trends. And so, I think that, to some extent, Australian currency, as a commodity currency, would be reflecting that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tom. Two questions. Firstly on aluminum, it seems like you're mapping out a bit of a plan there to meet your target of 40%. But it seems like the two big drivers to that are going to be divestments, if I'm sort of hearing you correctly, and also capital costs. Just in terms of divestments, is now everything open? I mean, you've had a number of under-performing assets in the portfolio, like Gove. So, you're throwing everything open now and reviewing that?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just on capital spend, the current value of the aluminum business is $40 billion, you're spending another $4 billion over the next few years. I'm just wondering, are you very confident about the return on invested capital that you're actually going to achieve out of that? Margin's one thing, return on capital is the next thing.</p>
          <p>And just the second question, just following on from Rob's question. There's a very interesting chart that Guy put up in terms of just your planned exchange rates and how you revised that up. But if I'm reading that correctly, you are still looking for the Aussie dollar to fall in 2013 to $0.90 and then 2014 to $0.85. So, if the Aussie does stay here, we would see a large increase in terms of your capital spending in U.S. dollars. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Guy, I'll ask that you talk about the portfolio work we're doing with the Rio Tinto Alcan. I'll tackle the capital project of the Rio Tinto Alcan. I'll only say a few words about the planned exchange rate, but Guy can be quite precise and specific on that. So on the portfolio, I think we're looking at all aspects of it but, Guy, if you want to say something in more detail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, we said in February and we've said again today that we're looking at our portfolio, and we're particularly looking at the aluminum portfolio, because, as you say, it's one of the drivers that will take us to this 40% margin target. But it's not only the aluminum business that we're looking at. Tom's mentioned a couple of sites where we're carrying out a strategic review in Britain and in France, mainly in France.</p>
          <p>But we are giving consideration to whether there are other assets in the Rio Tinto Alcan portfolio that maybe would be better off in somebody else's hands. We've taken no decision along those lines. And I would say that also, we regularly review the whole portfolio to say, is this asset really a tier one asset? And if it doesn't have a pathway to attaining that status, well then, we begin to wonder whether we should take another look at its future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If I look at the key capital projects which will make a difference in terms of EBITDA margins for Rio Tinto Alcan, I really want to focus on three. The first would be &#x2013; actually, I should say four. The first is completing the Yarwun 2 project. I think that has been an attractive project. We kept it going through the worst of the financial crisis because we recognized the forward the importance of adding that alumina into the market and I'm very happy we keep it running through the financial crisis, because, again, having it ready to go into 2012 and moving into a net long position on alumina, I think, will be quite important.</p>
          <p>In Canada, we have some of the most competitive power positions in the world in the aluminium sector. But they're also matched with some of the oldest plants in the world. Kitimat, Arvida are very, very old facilities. They date back to the 40s and the 50s and, frankly, you're never going to get the efficiencies and effectiveness out of a facility with that technology, with that level of productivity and that age. And I think under virtually any economic assumption for aluminum or currency or anything else, those make quite a bit of sense on a going-forward basis.</p>
          <p>And then, finally, I'd say that any opportunity that we can find to expand the bauxite production, so as we look at Weipa and we look at moving south of the Embley, this will be a very important project in terms of delivering, again, even more bauxite, which seems to be increasingly of value from a global prospective. So, again, what we're looking at for a 40% EBITDA margin in terms of the capital projects would be those projects that have been well-flagged, well accepted, very attractive. And we're certainly not looking at rolling a series of sort of Greenfield projects in to make that, we are looking at those projects that you are very, very clearly aware of, and we've had quite explicit and detailed discussions in the past.</p>
          <p>I guess, just one comment on the planned exchange rate, then Guy will go into it. And that is that, I think that, to some extent, the markets and their forward view of what exchange rates will be in 2014 are probably making some assumptions of reversions of commodity price which are probably matched with reversions in currencies. And again, that would be, I think, reflective of that natural hedge. So, if a currency stays high in those periods of time, means that probably the commodities are probably also quite strong in that period of time, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. But, Guy, anything more detailed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's the important point that Tom's just made. And it goes back to Rob's question about the natural hedge. The natural hedge is not a perfect thing, there's lags in it, the degree of movement of currencies is not necessarily the same, in the opposite direction as the move in metal prices. But there definitely is some relationship. We have, unusually, given out today a projection of the Aussie-dollar rate. We might easily revise it as we get closer to the years concerned.</p>
          <p>I don't know, that will be informed by whatever the current state of the markets are. But as Tom said, if we do revise it, it may very well be that that revision takes place because we've reached a different view of the price that we're likely to attain for the metal concerned. So, to the extent that we're paying a higher capital cost for the Pilbara expansion than the price that we had originally anticipated when we committed to it. We also could say, I think, that we are expecting to receive higher iron ore prices than we expected at the time we took that decision and the same will be true of Alumina. So, in this case, we can say that there is a relationship.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Pass it on if you can. Thank you. One more question here and then, Guy, I'll turn it over to you in Sydney.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom. It's Jason Fairclough, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I guess, just a question about sort of medium-term capital allocation and deployment. This year, it's looking more likely that you're going to go and expand into three new geographies, three new mineral basins with Simandou, with Riversdale and with Oyu Tolgoi. And I'm just wondering, given the embarrassment of riches that you have in terms of cash flow, what is the capacity of each of these new districts to soak up capital? I mean, should we be thinking $10 billion to $20 billion apiece, or should we be thinking $30 billion to $50 billion for each of these districts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that I'd like to just say that, these are three, I think, emerging global districts. And emerging global districts, you don't try to develop out over a few years, actually it's going to probably take &#x2013; you got to get the first infrastructure out, and there's a lot of fixed costs associated with that first round of infrastructure. But, what I would hope to see is something where we move along at what would be a logical pace of development, get early production in quite quickly and then we provide that next generation of engineers with the tools, the infrastructure, the capabilities, the systems, but most importantly, the resources, so they can look at optimizing.</p>
          <p>And I think that very much plays into our long-term strategy of having access to that resource and having access to mineralization and having access to mineral domains that have yet to be fully considered, and then progressively put in capital as the markets are there, as the technology is there and the capabilities are there to bring it forward. So, if I look at capital allocation over the next few years, I've got to say first and foremost the number one priority would be to expand the Pilbara the 283, the 333. It is, as I said, it's the lowest risk, it is the most enabled in terms of having the key parts of it, which is the port, the rail, it's all there, it's in place, it's even well-flagged. That makes the most sense to put the highest priority into that.</p>
          <p>I think getting first production going out of Oyu Tolgoi and, again, that's going on, as we said, on schedule. It is very important for the government of Mongolia and the economy of Mongolia to get that going. There certainly, it's going to be important to get underground at Oyu Tolgoi ultimately to access higher grades. And then the exact mining method, the exact pace of that, I think, will be driven by the opportunities that present themselves. But, again, we're going to be driven by getting first production out of the open pit as quickly as we can on this schedule and then properly pace the underground.</p>
          <p>I think it's going to be about, again, I'd like to get production sooner rather than later, but recognize that the big ticket capital for the infrastructure, the rail, the port, it's most important that that's done properly. The sites are picked properly, the engineering is done properly and we don't try to get into too much of a rush to do something too quickly. Now, we have other options on the inner base to get early production quicker, and certainly that's been an active part of the consideration. But again, given the prospectivity, given the providence, a huge piece of <mark type="ph" /> Karrige os type (62:12) material, undeveloped, will be tremendously valuable in the future world iron ore and steel market.</p>
          <p>And again, it's going to be about what I see it progressively develop but rapidly bring some production in there, get that infrastructure going as soon as we can but with the right infrastructure decision, the right siting decisions, the right placement of things like ore loading or unloading, make sure of the soil configuration. The boring stuff the engineers do has to be done right and properly and we have to build those teams on the ground in advance of that.</p>
          <p>And Mozambique, it's in the Moatize basin, I know I started personally getting my eye on it back in about 2001. I think it is going to be something that will be a key part of the future seaborne coking coal market. Initial infrastructure is going to be restricted to sort of modernization of what's on the ground today, getting the existing rail configured, the existing port configured and then looking for progressive expansions of Benga after that first production. And then, again, as I said with Simandou, for Zambeze in particular, making sure that we get the long-term infrastructure solution properly engineered, properly optimized and properly sited and constructed because again, that's something that will be benefiting Rio Tinto for literally decades to come.</p>
          <p>So again, number one priority Pilbara, we have other basins, but again, we get first production in on a fairly rapid basis but then we've got take the right decisions on a progressive basis. I think, in terms of the overall capital allocation, that's the appropriate thing do given our longer-term outlook. We're going to go now over, Guy, to you in Sydney, and then I'll do the phones and then back to the room here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Guy. Tom, just a couple of quick items. <mark type="ph" /> Glen Lockheart (64:11) UBS. Firstly, just, if you can cut that pie chart a different way, the cost one, if you can just cut it quickly into what's recurring and what's non-recurring, if you could do that. I don't know if you've done that? And then just on Mozambique, I know you sort of talked a lot about it, but I was just wondering if you could comment on your thoughts in terms of the Zambeze project, in terms of partnering and potential size? Given you've already talked about first production, you must have an idea for size, just wondering what you're thinking in terms of that as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Glen. I think and, Guy, help me if you want to add anything to the pie chart, this is your pie chart. But what I would say is that, that there is one chunk which is related to one-off and production issues, and I think those better be one-off, so I'd put that in that category. And weather, we always know the first half is a challenging environment anyway, particularly in Northern Australia, this was an exceptional period of weather-related impacts and I hope to say that that's a one-off.</p>
          <p>If I look at the segment, which is a very interesting one about site readiness, one thing that we have learned and we've spent quite of time on is if we focus with the growth projects on just the capital owner teams and just the construction and then we plan for just-in-time readiness for having the people ready to go and hire a General Manager right at the time when it's ready to go, we end up with a longer commissioning period, a longer ramp-up period.</p>
          <p>And given the state of the markets, we're consciously saying make sure we have these mines ready to go, we have the teams, particularly in this tight market, we have the teams, the capabilities, the systems, ready to go for 283 million tonnes then 333 million, not on a just-in-time basis but in advance of that, so that we can fully take advantage of that infrastructure when it's ready to go and ramp up the capital as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>Now, one could say, well doesn't that sound like part of the project and shouldn't that be capitalized? We run, I think, a conservative balance sheet and we do take the appropriate thing. It's very difficult to distinguish that type of work from the normal type of hiring you would be doing at the operation. So, I think it's appropriate for that to go to the P&amp;L, but we have been trying to isolate that from the P&amp;L. But I would expect that that will be something that you will see as we go through the ramp-up stage, particularly in the Pilbara.</p>
          <p>And then I think in terms of the one that is probably the most challenging is the sort of the ongoing input pressures. I think again, to some extent, these are driven by the markets so as the market rise, they will rise. But I'm more concerned about, say, labor increases, increases in rates of royalty, in new types of tax imposts that could get themselves baked in and sort of they'll there in good times and bad. And all I would say and certainly from our organizational perspective what we are focusing is the fact that we can't just accept them as they go because we will then run the risk of a burdened cost structure in a different type of market circumstance.</p>
          <p>So, we've got to focus on operational improvements, we've got to focus on innovation and most importantly, we've got to focus on individual productivity. So a very, very important point, particularly from the Australian perspective is as we see sort of stepped-up pressures on IR, in industrial relations, if our highest-paid market is the Australians, we pay more on average to Australian wages than any other country in the world, it's got to be matched with higher productivity. So, higher wages, higher benefits, have got to be matched side by side with higher productivity or ultimately, over time, those markets get themselves uncompetitive and priced out of the position. I don't know, Guy, if there's anything more you want say on that particular chart?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mozambique. I think right now the emphasis is, let's get the first production out of Benga as soon as it's reasonably practical, let's look at the options for expanding that as soon as reasonably practical, and we're right in the midst of strategic production planning on Zambeze. Again, we are now at a point where we're outside that bidders period, but I don't want to preempt what the engineering is currently going in the ground.</p>
          <p>As I've said, it is a tremendous resource, we've got to look at the right infrastructure solution. I suspect that infrastructure solution will have a component of public-private partnership, again, that seems to be something that's supported by the Mozambique government, so they'll be engaged with other stakeholders as we come to that final infrastructure solution. But, again, the resource is there and the resource is worth the effort to take time and get it going while we focus initially on the ramp-up of Benga.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, you had a question? Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Paul Young from Deutsche bank. Two questions, first one is on your transformation of the aluminum division, I'll ask it in a different way. Your EBITDA margin for the first half was around 20% and it was flat year-on-year. You have stated you want to increase EBITDA by doing <mark type="ph" /> goals (69:25) I presume that's on a half basis, so that would take EBITDA margin to 30%, so how do we get it to 40%? Or should I say, what component is expanding your better quality assets, and what percentage is actually higher prices?</p>
          <p>Second question I have is actually on sovereign risk and your acquisition strategy, and you touch on resource nationalization, but look at what's happened over the last year with having to make that $700 million payment to the Guinean government, for what should be a &#x2013; I guess you could term a fiscal stability payment. And then there's now &#x2013; also a discussion now that the government of Mozambique potentially taking part ownership in resources in Mozambique. So how does this change your one year acquisition strategy towards Africa? Or has it simply, I guess two, lifted the required hurdle rate on these projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Paul, first of all, on aluminum transformation. I feel that actually, the efforts on aluminum transformation, the key capital projects which I've already referred to with <mark type="ph" /> heath (70:34) and the work on terms of really focusing the portfolio on the highest quality piece of the assets are not quite equal, but they're all materially important to that 40%. And I want to also say that, a year ago, I actually put that 40% out there on an aspirational basis for the team but also externally and now, over the past 12 months, I've been very encouraged by the fact that the team has, under <mark type="ph" /> Jaseef's (71:00) leadership, has not only focused on recognizing its aspirational, but it's got to be something that they build into their planning and also their base case performance expectation.</p>
          <p>So again, what we're doing is, those things which are prudent and those things that are in &#x2013; what I would call a long-term pricing environment to make that happen. Over the past 12 months, I think we've seen industry cost pressures bring the long end of the curve up to a higher level, so while we've enjoyed the higher LME price, we haven't seen the full benefit of LME price flowing through margins, because some of those industry cost pressures, particularly coke, pitch and caustic, were those that traveled through the entire cost curve. And I think as we look forward, we're just going to &#x2013; I would expect to see that there'll be components of the industry cost curve, particularly around energy, which will disproportionally effect some other parts of it. But again, we're not looking at what I would call anything that's out of the range of what I'd say is the longer-term LME price environment for aluminum, but all three of these have to hit to get to that 40% EBITDA target.</p>
          <p>In terms of sovereign risk, I don't think there is a single country in the world where we're not dealing with sovereign risk in one way or another. And I think that we are seeing an environment where governments have an increasing range of fiscal challenges, debt challenges, budget-balancing challenges, populist challenges. At the same time, our industry and our sector is doing quite well, and I think we have to be realistic about that. But we also have to recognize and we have to educate everyone that, part of the benefits of the resource sector would be the fact that, as we make long-term investments, we can be job creation engines for years and years to come. And that we're more likely to make those investments in fiscal and political regimes that are stable for those types of long-term capital infusions.</p>
          <p>And so that's, again, a key part of why we feel it's very important to do everything we do on a transparent basis, what you got to do is subscribe to EITI. We subscribe to open, transparent taxes. We've actually been the first of the big mining companies to publish our taxes on a country-by-country basis and, again, educate and inform everyone about the benefits of stable &#x2013; the best fiscal regimes relating to stable investment regimes, leading to more spending. Certainly, as we look on a country-by-country basis, we are very realistic about what the regimes look like and what types of investments we make as a consequence of that. Certainly, we have a very good relationship with governments of Mongolia, of Guinea and Mozambique. We work quite constructively in all cases, as we do with every other government around the world. But I'd say that resource nationalism is probably, from a strategic standpoint, one of the largest sector challenges we face at the moment, and probably for the next few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I could add that, while it is true that we face sovereign risk in all countries, the great, great majority of our assets actually sit in OECD countries, point number one. And that will remain the case for many, many years. The second point, in answer to your question about discount rates, is of course we require a higher return from riskier-looking environments. But we need to be thoughtful about how we might mitigate those risks and the time at which assets are most at risk. So we're thinking a lot about that and, in particular, thinking about how to mitigate risk.</p>
          <p>So should we go to the next question, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Tom, Guy. Lee Bowers from Macquarie. I had a couple of questions. The first one just relates to the progress of your labor procurement efforts up in the Pilbara. It's &#x2013; I noticed in the presentation you've highlighted that you're looking for the site count to basically double into the second half. Things are on time and on budget right now, but clearly the critical part will only start to emerge when we really start to scale up, which is the point you've made. So just wondering if you can provide a bit more color on those efforts? And the second one relates to capital management and I guess the broader view of it. I'm wondering what sort of signals we need to take out of the last few buyback announcements, in the sense that the first one was structured over, basically till the end of 2012, when you've bought back at more than twice the rate to the current point. And then this one basically takes us, on the road specified, just pass the next financial result.</p>
          <p>I guess it's just interesting from the perspective of, you noted in the presentation the fact that you've invested $10 billion over the first half. I guess I see it a bit differently; in my mind you've invested more like $12.3 billion when I include the stock that you've bought back, certainly on the basis of what we value it at, and I think what most people in this room and in the room in London value it at as well. So perhaps just a bit more insight into the thinking there would be appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, do you want me to try and handle the second question, if you'd like to handle the first? Would that make sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. We &#x2013; it is certainly a challenge to fill all the skilled positions, all of the operating positions, all the construction positions in the Pilbara at the moment. And actually, given that a number of the flagged projects in West Australia haven't actually been fully kicked off, in some cases they're still in pre-approval stage &#x2013; not just in mining, but also in terms of some of the offshore gas projects. I suspect that the labor environment will even get tighter in 2012 and 2013, so we do recognize that an early moving &#x2013; early mover will get the advantage in terms of bringing those skills in, bringing the people in.</p>
          <p>I visit sites on a regular basis, and you can't help but notice that construction camps, that fly-in fly-out camps, that the town sites, are all in much better shape than they were in the past. We've got to not only compete in terms of the wages and benefits, but also in terms of the quality of the accommodations, the quality of the food, the living experience we can give for people that are actually working in those areas. We have to do &#x2013; we have to put a lot more effort into &#x2013; and some of this gets built into our cost structure, the cost of hiring and make sure we recruit the right people. To some extent, the decision we made to accelerate the 333 million was to essentially match construction contracts together, so rather than get in the situation where we were de-manning construction in camps in 2013 and then waiting six months to nine months and then re-manning them 2014, we recognized providing stability of a construction camp actually provides us with a better position in that overall environment.</p>
          <p>I can't say it's easy, but with the team in Perth, the team in the Pilbara, they are an exceptional team. And I have confidence that Sam and that team will be able to do what's required to ensure that we have the people in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the capital management signals that you asked about, I guess we do see it slightly differently from you. In that we wouldn't say that we've invested $12.3 billion in quite the same sense that you imply. What we are saying is that there's a balance, and the balance needs to be struck between, as a first priority, we think it's our job to invest in high-quality mining and metals opportunities, whether they be organic or M&amp;A. When we have exhausted those opportunities then, within the constraints, as I said, of the dividend and the single A target, then we need to return cash to shareholders by whatever the most efficient means may be. And that's what we've done, and we did it more quickly than we originally said. In other words, we have bought back $3 billion at a pace that might &#x2013; compared to our original announcement &#x2013; have taken longer. We've done that because the surplus cash was greater than we anticipated at the moment that we made the announcement. Now we've chosen to maintain something like the same run rate, and if we were to do that, it would be completed at approximately the end of March. Now this is all subject to market conditions. We do see it slightly differently from pure investment in the Pilbara. It is a different proposition, we believe, but we do think it's an appropriate balance and it is &#x2013; that's what we've struck in selecting this time period and this amount of money.</p>

          <p>Yes. Just a question in regards to the Queensland call; you said your operation's not quite back to full production yet. When do you sort of expect the &#x2013; those operations to be back at full production, sort of in the second half of the year?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clarke, I think, again &#x2013; I think there's going to be a progressive return over the course of second half and, in some cases, we have areas where there would still -would be water in the pits, where they would be exposed coal ready to go. In other cases, we had a situation where we had to defer stripping during some of the wet weather, and we have got to get caught up on those stripping before we get into those new coal areas. So, I would say it's a progressive ramp up over the second half. Next question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. My question's on the dividend policy; you mentioned that would reviewed significantly next year. I was wondering if yield comes into that equation and whether the progressive nature might be looked at in favor for something at a sustainable higher level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The words that I used were very carefully chosen, and the answer is, we will look at the dividend in February. And I'm not making any commitments about it at all. We look, of course, at yield, but you have to realize that's a function of the share price, which &#x2013; we don't know what that will be when we come to February. But probably the most important question that we consider when we set the dividend is, considering that it is a progressive policy, that the level of the dividend, if there is to be an increase, has got to be &#x2013; to be able to withstand any shock in the future. We wish to be completely dependable in future where the payment of that dividend is concerned.</p>
          <p>So we don't &#x2013; we need to look beyond today's very strong conditions and what I think will probably be strong conditions also in February, and say to ourselves, well what are the most difficult conditions that we can imagine, and then set the dividend according to that. And so, I think that this is a very strong business, we've got very low cost assets, very large assets that generate cash even in the worst possible condition. So we can certainly afford to have this progressive dividend policy. But it's those considerations that go through our minds as we set the dividend. And so I don't think we're going to look at the notion of the progressive dividend and adopt some completely new type of dividend approach. We have said for years that this is the intent of our dividend policy, and we most recently committed to it, for example, in the rights issue that we had. So at the moment, there is no intent to look, completely root and branch, at a different form of dividend policy.</p>

          <p>Good evening, good morning. Just back on aluminum, the total asset value of the business, $40 billion, out of the total Rio asset value of $73 billion, so a little bit below the trends particularly on that last chunk of your asset base. If I move to your 40% EBITDA margin target and let's say you're doing that in this period already and annualize that, as a rough estimate, translates through to that at 12% EBITDA to asset return. So is that enough, the 40% target? Could it mean that you actually have to look at further write-downs or impairments in that asset value of your aluminum business because that 12% powers against some of your other businesses, particularly iron ore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it is difficult to compare it to iron ore right now, I do understand that. We have given an EBITDA target in margin terms; we haven't given a return target, and I haven't checked your calculation, but it may very well be in that sort of order that you've come up with. I can assure you that we look at all assets every year where there's been a triggering event, to determine whether they're being carried at the correct value and if they're not, we take an impairment or reverse an earlier impairment.</p>
          <p>In the case of assets which have a lot of goodwill, which is the case with Rio Tinto Alcan, we look at that annually in all cases; so we'll do that this year, as we have done in all previous years. But of course, taking a hit, if that's what we chose to do, to the book value of Rio Tinto Alcan, would make no difference at all to the EBITDA, which is basically a cash measure. And it's that margin that we're trying to increase by the various methods that Tom outlined in detail. And I think that's the most important thing; we've got to focus on getting the performance of the business back up through operational improvement, through investment, and through divestment. And that's what we're focused on doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I might just say that we set that 40% target on the basis it that, over long periods of time, we've noticed that product groups have to be generating, on average, a 40% EBITDA margin in order to competitively attract capital compared to other opportunities. If you look at this period, I think we're roughly a 45% EBITDA margin, and that's been certainly benefiting from iron ore, which is probably plus 70%, but I think both the aluminum and the energy groups are the 20%s. So, again, what we see over time is, is there is a cyclical nature, different businesses &#x2013; over long periods of time, different businesses are doing better than others, and &#x2013; not necessarily the same one every single decade. So that drove the 40% target, but as Guy said, that was predominantly to generate cash returns.</p>
          <p>I think we have just a few more minutes, but I'd like to maybe something in the audience here in London, please. Right here. Okay.</p>

          <p>Tom, hi. Andrew Keen from HSBC. Two questions. One on acquisitions; you previously used some very carefully chosen words to say that you would look at things in the low single digit billions, you just spent $4 billion, which I guess is close to the limit of that definition. I wasn't sure whether you were saying per deal or in total, but can you give us some idea of your appetite for adding more growth options from where you are at the moment, given the fact that you're now at $11 billion to $13 billion in CapEx? And just secondly, a very specific question because you spoke about sustaining CapEx and the way that that's moved. Can you give us an idea of what a proper, normalized, sustaining CapEx is for this business?</p>

          <p>Okay. I'll make the comment on acquisitions, and then Guy, if you want to supplement that on acquisitions, but maybe if you can give us something on sustaining capital. And I will just &#x2013; I will supplement that. First of all on acquisitions, what we had said over the past year or so was, small to intermediate size, and I think that Riversdale was frankly fit for purpose. It was a good opportunity, it represents what we see as a first tier asset. There are not that many out there. As I look around at the, sort of the suite of investment opportunities and things that are being considered, most of them are assets that have been around for the past 10 or 20 years. They're sort of on the third stage of being shopped, in some particular cases. While there may be some opportunities, wouldn't necessarily meet that same successful screen as Riversdale would have.</p>
          <p>So, first and foremost, I have to say, what do we have in-house? And if I look at our in-house assets, I say we have the best, as far as I'm concerned, the best in-development copper project underway at Oyu Tolgoi. We have some of the best now coking coal projects underway in Mozambique. We have an incredible suite of iron ore opportunities, of course lead by the Pilbara, but also talked about IOC and the North Shore of Canada, and also in Guinea. These are very, very strong options within the company, and I'd actually want to focus on those strong opportunities, as &#x2013; they are things we know, and we know what we can do to bring value. We &#x2013; of course, we keep our eyes on the spectrum out there, but it's not that there's a rich spectrum of opportunities outside. Guy?</p>

          <p>Well on M&amp;A, I think the key point to make, which you've kind of made already is, we're entirely focused on value and focused on quality. In addition to which, we're very focused on execution, and quite a lot of desirable assets are difficult to get out of the hands in which they sit. It is very difficult to execute those transactions, as we can see from our own efforts and from the efforts of others. Doesn't mean we're not going to try.</p>
          <p>On the question of sustaining capital, we've slightly changed our definition of this in recent times. And the reason we've done that is the Pilbara machine is essentially causing us to open and close mines at a very great rate in the coming years. And so we're re-classifying the opening and closing of mines as sustaining capital. Which means that our sustaining capital is at a level of approximately $4 billion, plus or minus, in coming years. And so what we'll do in the seminars that we'll be holding later this year is to give a bit more detail about that. But I think you'd have to understand that many people would regard, as opening a mine, as normal organic capital. But because of the nature of the infrastructure being so important in the Pilbara, we tend to regard it as sustaining. But $4 billion would be the sort of level that you should think about.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, a specific example of that would be West Turner Syncline, which was a new line that we put in place last year. And that was designed to basically ramp up as Tom Price naturally began to ramp down. So good example, specific example, of that type of capital.</p>
          <p>Oh yeah, sorry, here we are. Yes. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Sorry. <mark type="ph" /> Terry Austin from Terry Austin Associates (91:14) Some of the updates that you've given on the Oyu Tolgoi, for instance, is the production schedules. There are some milestones, though, not only for the start-up, also ramp-up in the future, given the site of the project. What's the timing of these key milestones of the power, transportation, smelter contracts; they're all spelled out for the matter, but you did talk about? And also the project financing, which has not been completed yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think again, many of those questions, also regarding finance, are probably best directed to Ivanhoe, not to us. But let me just talk about from the project-specific basis. The first priority is to develop the open pit and the surface infrastructure for that open pit; that's the mill and the various surface facilities. And that is, again, as I've said, nearly a third of the way there, and it continues to run on schedule. We will, over this period of time, need to have a electricity solution for the &#x2013; particularly for the mill, which is &#x2013; mills are normally very heavy power consumers. And there, I think there'll be &#x2013; ultimately there'll be a combination of probably Mongolian power production driven off of Mongolian coal. By the interim, I think it's going to be requiring Chinese power that's being exported into Mongolia. The power line is being built on the Mongolia side of it; it has not yet been done on the Chinese side of it.</p>
          <p>So those will be things that will need to be solved, and the teams are working very hard on those particular areas in this period of time. I think, in terms of the pace of underground is continuing to develop as we would expect, and again, we're going to be motivated to bring underground production in, but properly, because that's where the highest grades are going to be coming into the production picture. Additional facilities, smelting on site, etcetera, I would not see those as critical path milestones, and there may never actually be a need for a smelter on site.</p>
          <p>It may be part of the project, it may be something that's separate from the project, these will be the types of options that we'll be able to consider in the future. So within first stage, the key milestones would be the open pit, the surface facilities, getting the power for those surface facilities; and then, once that's up and running, which is what we've said, 2013 commercial production, then being ready for the next phase, which is going to be oriented around getting the underground, the higher grades from the underground, into that mill complex. Back here?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Tom. Nick Hatch at RBS. Returning to the shareholder returns theme, there were two mechanisms you've used in the past, namely the off-market buyback in Australia and special dividends. Can you outline your current philosophy on those?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Guy, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Nick, you're right to say we've used both of them. In relation to the off-market buyback, that worked at the time we did it, because the delta between the limited and the Plc share prices was such that it made good financial sense for an Australian investor to do the buyback. It would, at the present delta between the two prices, probably not make sense for such an Australian shareholder to buy back the shares, just because that gap has widened so much.</p>
          <p>We do keep a very close eye on that, because it certainly is an option, and we recognize that there would be those who would want to do it if the circumstances were right. The idea of a special dividend is occasionally discussed. To date, we've felt that the buyback of Plc shares is the most efficient means of returning cash to shareholders, but you can be sure that we do keep these other ideas in mind, and from time to time look at them again, but the important thing is that we're returning capital to shareholders on a pretty major scale.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Tim Gerrard from Investec. Just a quick question on the TiO2 feedstock business, can you give us a little bit of an idea on how quickly you might be able to grow that, or put it as a priority? And I noticed you talked about Madagascar being up 30% on last year's, can you just say &#x2013; tell us what that actually means in terms of tonnes? And, within two or three years' time ,Madagascar will be at full capacity; can you again just remind us that &#x2013; what is full capacity for Madagascar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, I'll talk about the broader growth objectives for TiO2, maybe if you could then be ready to talk about more specific numbers that Tim's asked? I'd say, on TiO2, we have a very strong market position, but also I'd say technology position, resource position, so I would see ourselves leveraging those technology capabilities and the resource opportunities.</p>
          <p>We are in discussions with the government of Quebec, where of course our Sorel assets are located, and they're going to be an important part of the Quebec industrial economy. I think there are going to be opportunities to look for, working with the government of Quebec on their Plan Nord or Plan North, and leveraging some of their government objectives with our business objectives. So I think that there are going to be opportunities to expand both feedstock and smelting capacity up in Quebec.</p>
          <p>I think we'll also have large resource positions in Mozambique that we'll be able to bring in and consider opportunities for &#x2013; in addition to those in Madagascar. I think, with respect to South Africa, we've got to look at the overall power position and the availability of power, because again, the smelting of TiO2 or TiO2 slag is a very power-intensive activity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On Madagascar, Tim, I'm afraid I haven't got all the data at my fingertips here, but I believe we were about 10% below target, in terms of our production in the year-to-date. The programs to improve the mining at QMM are well underway, and I understand that we're looking at different mining methods, including dry mining, which is currently going on there. And we should be able to look at the development of the phase two at some point following 2015.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, I'm just going off memory, but I think our &#x2013; what we say the rated capacity for QMM we'd like to get to is 750,000 tonnes per year of TiO2 concentrate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Again, I appreciate all your questions and your interest. A very strong set of numbers, it was a challenging weather environment, the operations in the organization pulled through quite nicely. I'm very excited about the state of our current businesses, the long-term position of our markets, and certainly I think we have some premier growth opportunities to leverage up in the coming years, and not only the coming years, but also the coming decades. And certainly we are continuing to ramp up our capital spending accordingly, but also mindful of the balance that we've talked about; we've accelerated and increased the size of our capital buyback program.</p>
