          <p>Okay music down.  Good morning everybody and thanks for joining us at the ANZ 2010 Interim Results.  We have people here with us obviously in Sydney and we have people joining us on the phone and on the web.  Presentation format today will be pretty familiar to you.  So, Mike and Peter are going to talk for about 35 minutes, then we'll go to Q&amp;A and I'll comeback and talk about the housekeeping for that at that time.</p>
          <p>With that I'll hand over to Mike Smith.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, many thanks, Jill. And good morning to everybody joining us here in Sydney and on the web and over the phone.  As well as Peter, I've got most of the management board either here in Sydney or on the phone to help answer any questions you may have later.</p>
          <p>Let me start off by saying that today's result demonstrates that we are delivering on our promises and what's encouraging is that we're beginning to see the benefits of the difficult decisions that we've taken over the past two and half year to establish a much stronger foundation for the business and to create new momentum in the underlying performance.  On top of that, we're seeing the more positive trends in provisions and the credit story driven by the economic recovery and how these trends are playing out in our unique geographic footprint.  We've been following the strategic roadmap that we set out for you in December 2007, which was of course before the global financial crisis really took significant hold.  As a result we are the only bank in this market with a clearly articulated strategy to take advantage of Australia's geographic business and cultural linkages with the fastest growing region in the world, but what our super regional strategy gives ANZ is the strength and stability that comes from a balanced geographic portfolio.</p>
          <p>Asia not only gives our shareholders an unique exposure to Asia's growth, but to Asia's significant savings and you'll hear from Peter later that the bottom line for us here is that growth in our deposit base in Asia has reduced our funding gap by $7 billion this year.  And we're the only bank among our domestic peers with the management expertise and depth in the region to be able to deliver on this.  This has not only allowed us to weather the financial crisis and keep delivering, but importantly to come out of it in a better shape and as a stronger bank than we went into it.</p>
          <p>Let me now talk briefly about the results.  Across the Group revenue and profit increased.  Underlying profit was $2.3 billion, up 23% on the proceeding half and 20% higher than the first half of 2009.  The reason I'm emphasizing the underlying number is that I think it helps us look past some of the accounting noise and establish how the core business is performing, because its here that we have to create value.</p>
          <p>In terms of statutory profit that was just under $2 billion, which was 26% up on the proceeding half and 36% higher than the proceeding prior period.  Importantly for shareholders, this is also flowing through &#x2013; through a dividend of $0.52, which is $0.06 per share or 13% higher than the first half of last year.</p>
          <p>Now, historically we have paid out a ratio of 45% interim dividend and 55% final dividend.  I'm not sure if this was factored into some of the analyst expectations.</p>
          <p>Turning to our key geographies.  Australia performed well and we have established much greater clarity and discipline around performance and around growth.  Customer proposition I think is resonating with improved satisfaction, trial intention and account opening within the retail bank.</p>
          <p>Profit was up 12%, excluding acquisitions with positive contributions from institutional from commercial and from wealth and cost growth was 1%.  Retail was slightly down and was impacted by two things one the intense deposit pricing competition and also the lower fees that were introduced late last year, which customers are now benefiting from to the tune of about $3 million a week.</p>
          <p>I said last year that I am bullish on Australia and we are continuing to invest in our business here.  We're on track with the integration of ING Australia and with Landmark, which is strengthening our position in two key areas, wealth and agribusiness.</p>
          <p>New Zealand's performance has improved significantly although I have to say of a low base, as the economy is showing signs of recovery.  The profit outcome was largely driven by 45% reduction in the provision charge, but costs were also down 5% excluding acquisitions.  In Asia-Pacific, we've been growing at the same time as completing the pretty complex integration of the RBS businesses.  This acquisition will provide an important boost in subsequent years particularly for our retail and our wealth businesses.</p>
          <p>However what is pleasing to see is that we've recorded double-digit profit growth with a 19% increase in U.S. dollar profit on the proceeding half based on strong contributions particularly from the partnerships and from institutional.  It's a clear signal that Asia's economic growth and the experienced management team we put in place is allowing us to pursue both strategic and organic growth and to deliver really good performance.</p>
          <p>Finally, our global institutional business, one of the other positive features of this result is that it shows that we are now making genuine progress in turning around the business, which has been based on a clear strategy aligned to our super regional objective.  Institutional profit after-tax grew 22% with a 38% lower provision charge.</p>
          <p>Total income remained steady.  However, if you were to exclude the global markets income which had an unusually strong 2009 if you remember.  Revenues grew 10% on the back of good deposit growth, particularly in Asia.  There was a strong performance in trade.  And we're seeing the benefits of a change in the composition of the balance sheet with the run-off of low margin assets and repricing new assets at more realistic and more sustainable levels.</p>
          <p>Of course the backdrop of our improving business performance is a much better outlook for provisions, which reflects the strength of the economic recovery, particularly in Asia and in Australia, but also as I said the early signs in the green shoots that are now emerging from New Zealand.  At our interim results last year, I talked about the work we were doing to prepare the business for the global recession and the weakening credit environment that would come with it.  What we've seen playing at during the past year is an increasing &#x2013; increasingly multi speed reaction around the world.  Today we are expecting global economic growth to be about 3.5% in 2010.  However, in most of the advanced economies it's expected to be under 2%.  In contrast emerging &#x2013; the major emerging market countries are growing strongly again.  This includes most of Asia, which is now the World's best performing region with growth of almost 8% projected excluding Japan, which is more than twice the global average.</p>
          <p>Linked to this group are other economies such as Australia that have very strong trade links with China and other countries in Asia and are directly benefiting from that growth.  But I do want to emphasize that the Asia story is not just about China.  Over time the emerging nations of Vietnam and Indonesia are also going to play a very important role in the region's economic growth.  And at the same time, Australia's linkage with its major trading partners in the region are deepening particularly Korea, Japan and India.</p>
          <p>For us our super regional strategy positions us perfectly to take advantage of the growth across Asia and the flow on effects that you will see in the Australian and New Zealand economies.  We're also seeing the benefits in these results of the difficult decisions that we've taken to improve the foundation of our business.  And this has involved driving our strategy down to every level of the business and strengthening disciplines around investing in growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>We are distinguishing ourselves through the approach we've had to managing our balance sheet throughout the crisis and through the economic downturn ensuring that we've been strongly capitalized, ensuring that we have been very actively managing liquidity and that we are well provisioned.  And we continue to build experience and capability amongst our employees by investing in training and development and hiring experienced bankers.</p>
          <p>We now have almost 42,000 full-time staff, who're doing a great job all around the region.  This is almost 5,000 more than a year ago.  And as of 31st of March we were still finalizing the RBS integration in Taiwan and in Indonesia and Singapore.</p>
          <p>We've taken up the drains in identifying the issues within the various businesses and I had to say we've had our fair share of issues.  But we've used this as a catalyst to introduce stronger procedures, stronger governance and stronger controls.  We've recognized ourselves around our three key geographies and most importantly around our customers.  This has allowed us to be closer to them during the difficult times and also to see opportunities of how things have begun to improve.  However, I'm not inclined to gild the lily and as a traditional banker, I am naturally cautious and there are three issues I think represent that caution.</p>
          <p>First, the scale of the global financial crisis and the depth of the economic downturn in the U.S. and Europe, means we have to be realistic about the outlook.  Recovery of events of this sort of magnitude just do not happen smoothly.  Second, while there will be further regulation in response to the crisis and I think we have to be realistic about that.  I am concerned that there is a possibility that we're going to end up with an overreaction driven by populism in the U.S. and Europe.  And while the financial crisis was clearly &#x2013; has a "Made in America" or "Made in the USA" stamp on it,  here in Australia and in Asia banks put in a strong performance which was due to good strategy, good regulation and I think most importantly due to good supervision.  Unless we get regulatory reform right, there is a risk that the types of proposals that we now see emanate from the U.S. will restrict the flow of credit.  It will put up barriers to future economic growth and it will result in higher cost to consumers.  And I think we need to be very clear here. Banks, customers and everybody in the wider economy can't afford the cost of unnecessary or bad regulation.</p>
          <p>The federal treasurer's perspective on the G20 &#x2013; in particular his comments on the one-size-fits-all approach, I think represents a very welcome note of balance in the debate around the world.  My final note of caution is that ANZ is halfway through our five-year plan to create a super regional bank, and there is still a lot to do to create the type of organization that we promised, one with regional focus and one with global quality.</p>
          <p>In this environment there will be unexpected bumps along the way, but I believe that ANZ is now incredibly well positioned and there's the opportunity for us to aim much higher over the next two or three years.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to hand over to Peter, who'll take you through the rest of the results in more detail.  Many thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you Mike, and good morning to everyone.  What I would like to start with is to take you through some of the adjustments to the statutory profit derived at the underlying profit.  As Mike said at the outset, most of our focus in our analysis is on the underlying profits.  I think it's important to understand where those adjustments are, which should take out a lot of the accounting noise.  The key thing to point here is that there is no change here.  These are all adjustments which have been flagged.  The methodology of which we're using is consistent.  I think these are all things which you'd familiar with.  Clearly the largest adjustment is first of all backing out the account &#x2013; acquisition costs and valuation adjustments to do with various acquisitions, particularly from ING as the $322 million, which the main component of that is a $181 million related to the revaluation on acquisition of our existing 49% interest in ING and that was again was flagged at the time of the acquisition.  It also includes around $95 million in integration costs, $70 million of which were related to RBS.  And we have the &#x2013; the intangible asset amortization in there and also an adjustment in relation to some of the AFS reserves.  So, again all things which aren't part of the core business.</p>
          <p>Economic hedging, this is the adjustment we always make to back out the effective mark-to-market on our structural funding swaps.  This is just purely a timing difference, but recognizing that, particularly in the last few weeks in fact spreads have come in.  So, the gains on our own name or there's been &#x2013; sorry, the gains on our name have contracted and there have been losses on the basis of that we've had as part of our funding and that's this $138 million mark-to-market adjustment there, which we will reverse over time.</p>
          <p>Credit intermediation trades, we flagged I think at the time of the trading update.  In particular we've used the opportunity during this half to unwind some of those transactions, so our notional is now been reduced by 21% and notably that's involved unwinding transactions that no longer had purchase protection where the approaches protection counterparty had defaulted, that coupled with narrowing of the spreads across the half has meant that there was a small mark-to-market gain intermediation trades.  I think the rest of those adjustment there are things which will be familiar to you and don't require any future discussion.</p>
          <p>As we see overall, the statutory profit growth half-on-half and the underlying profit growth is very similar, so the net effect of these adjustments was relatively modest.  I think Mike made a key point before around the dividend.  The dividend is up 13% on the pcp and you see underlying profit in fact it's only up 2% pcp, but the statutory earnings &#x2013; statutory earning per share would be up 16%.  I stress the point also that Mike made about how we have traditionally phased the interim to be about 45% and the final about 55%.  And so, I think those of you who looked through the document would have seen the first half dividend payout ratio on underlying profit was about 58%, so think what that means in terms of adjusting for that 45-55 that means about 64%.  So, I think it puts that payout in a broader context.</p>
          <p>So, let's have a look at what driven that 23% growth in the underlying profit and clearly the principal driver here has been that 32% reduction in provisions.  With individual provisions down around 17 and the collective provision being a relatively modest charge, which we'll talk about on a subsequent slide.</p>
          <p>Now the profit before provisions &#x2013; growth is only 3%, but you've got to stand back and remember that there is an interrelationship here between the trend and profit before provisions and the trend in the provisions, because the profit before provisions now was being pulled down by the exceptional markets result.  The same factors that caused an exceptionally high level of credit provisions last year and all the global uncertainty of economic conditions also meant exceptional conditions for markets.  So, there is a relationship really between the lower provision charge and then the same time lower opportunities are making gains within the markets business.  As we'll see subsequently in these slides the markets business nonetheless had another exceptional half and considerable momentum, but obviously not the same opportunities as existed last year.</p>
          <p>Looking now on the right hand side of the chart net interest income, a key thing there to note is that the volumes are of course being relatively flat and that growth has come from 15 basis points half-on-half improvement in margins excluding markets in that.  So, that's been a quite significant contributor.  The non-interest income line of course has had to absorb by what has been $70 million half-on-half impact for the various adjustments to exception and other fees that are being implemented here within Australia and also in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>So, let's just look at that 3% profit before provisions growth and as we show on the next chart global markets has had a massive impact on this.  The loss of markets business has been growing strongly relative to 2008, it's nonetheless down relative to 2009.  Income is down around 17% hence profits before provisions are down around 22%.  So, the effect that that's had on the group is in fact to pull profit before provisions growth from 2.8 &#x2013; sorry down from what would have been 8.5% down to 2.8% so you can see it's had a very significant impact on the overall trends.  It's also had a big impact on things like jaws.  I mean you can see the combination of adjusting for markets and adjusting for acquisitions turns what appears to be a small negative jaws through into in fact, quite a healthy positive jaws.  I would caution that the half-on-half movement in expenses is slightly distorted by there were couple of one-off items in the second half of last year that you might recall, but nonetheless the jaws would remain positive.</p>
          <p>Mike went through in some detail talking about the geographic results so let's just quickly have a look at what happened from a divisional business line point of view.  And I think the key observation here is really on both pre-provision and on PAT. All the businesses with one qualifier had positive growth for the half.  The one qualifier of course is the institutional division, but once again in profit before provisions terms if you backed out the markets income as profit before provisions would in fact be up by 12%.  So, positive results across each of the businesses.</p>
          <p>From a PAT point of view, all the businesses had reductions in provisions and they varied between 14% and 38% and that's what then pushed up to those very strong half-on-half PAT numbers.</p>
          <p>So, let's have a look now at some of the income expense and provision drivers to get a better understanding of that.  From the overall income point of view, you will see as in the pack, we've gone out of our way to make adjustments for foreign exchange rate effects and adjustments for the acquisitions so you can see what happened with the core business and notably from an income point of view there was rather an additional $205 million from acquisitions, as I mentioned earlier was around $70 million coming out from fees.  And clearly, the stronger Australian dollar relative to last year's had an impact as well. And all that detail is set out for you within the results announcement.</p>
          <p>The other key variable that appears on 14 is obviously the markets business.  So, let's have a look at what happened there.  As I think we said at the time of the trading update.  You really have to take a longer term view on the markets business and see what's been happening.  And against the backdrop of 2009 being clearly exceptional, if you go back to, use 2007, 2008 as a base line, the business is nonetheless growing at a 32% CAGR.  So, it's a significant momentum within this business.</p>
          <p>I think the key observation as well is the chart in the bottom right hand corner, which shows that because we are so active in multiple geographies and being able to leverage particularly off the Asian sector of our business it becomes part of a diversified portfolio of businesses within markets.  And for example in the first-half of '09 Asia-Pacific and Europe and Americas were extremely strong as was New Zealand.  Australia was a little softer, but then that's turned around in the last 2 halves and that diversification has helped to maintain that continuing growth and momentum.</p>
          <p>From the top charts, you see the split between trading and sales for the first-half of 2010 is 51% that comes from sales.  Longer term aspiration and the things that the business is working towards is to build a business where two-thirds of the income coming out of the markets business will be from customer flow, which is not to underemphasize trading, but to see the growth coming particularly out of that customer flows of the business.</p>
          <p>Margins, I think the chart on the left hand side is similar pattern to the one we've been seeing for the last couple of halves with the effects of some funding and mix changes, notably that 8.3 there includes 3.2 basis points from higher capital.   But then the very negative impacts coming through from funding costs, from the effect of deposit competition, but the other thing offset for the repricing for risk and recover some of the funding costs coming through in the assets side.</p>
          <p>What I think is though powerful is the note that of that 14 basis points there on asset repricing, 6 basis points in fact comes out of institutional and that's why we've shown the chart on the bottom right hand corner, which shows that there has been quite a significant transformation in the margin and structure of the institutional business, where we've gone from where institutional business had a substantially below average margin to now where it's back to higher than the margin for the group.  There has been some run-off of assets in the process of doing that, but that's really meant running-off a lot of very low margin business, where the margin didn't justify the risks and to now create a far more sustainable mix.</p>
          <p>When you make that adjustment, you see in fact that the margin we should note the grey line, excluding institutional has been relatively stable.  The big transformational changes have been coming out of the institutional business.  I said earlier, that we had relatively little growth in average interest earning assets and so it's worthwhile just having to walk around the balance sheet for a minute and see what drivers have been affecting that.  And here you can see a continuation of the theme on the last chart, where the institutional lending book has contracted by 4% this half and the growth that has been occurring has been within the Australian division, with some momentum in fact picking-up in Q2 of a 5% growth there and up through Asia with 6% growth in U.S. dollar terms.</p>
          <p>Very little in the way of growth coming out of New Zealand on the lending side recognizing the economic conditions there.  But what I think then is interesting though is look how it flows through on risk weighted assets.  Our credit weighted assets have actually contracted by 4% in the half and when you look through the drivers of that you can see that risk could actually have been smaller than the positive impact seeing some reduction in higher risk accounts flowing through into that effect.  From a growth point of view, it's really a mix story, because the higher risk weighted asset &#x2013; institutional assets have been contracting and growth has been in Australian mortgages and some lower risk lending in Asia, you'll see that &#x2013; that growth in mix is in fact a net reduction of our risk weighted assets.  Some of you might have immediately been drawn to that rather low risk weighted asset increase in &#x2013; from mortgages and that's a mix effect that there has been growth in Australia and run down in some of the higher risk mortgages in New Zealand, so the effect had been a relatively small net change in risk weighted assets.</p>
          <p>But then the clear stand out, I think that is &#x2013; as I've on the left hand side again, when you look at what's happened from deposits point of view.  And you can see the success of the Asian strategy coming through here and the record growth we've had in customer deposits and this then leads into the comment that Mike made at the outset around how we've been able to reduce our funding gap, which is the gap between our assets and our customer deposits, there has a $7 billion benefit coming out of Asia-Pacific.  And so and again that has always been part of the strategy.</p>
          <p>Looking at expenses, I'm sure a few would have observed that our reported revenue and expense relationship was in fact negative jaws, which is also important to understand what caused that and its being caused by two factors, one, the markets income coming down and then two, the effect of acquisitions.  Now the latter recognizes that all the acquisitions we've made are very high cost-to-income ratio businesses relative to the rest of the Group.  So, mathematically it results in your expenses going up faster than your revenue does.</p>
          <p>And then the markets effect obviously has been to pull down the rate of growth income as we'd flagged.  So, if you look at the pcp, you'll get 1% positive jaws, if you excluded markets and if you look at the half-on-half, you'll get 1% positive jaws again if you exclude acquisitions.  So, we're continuing to run that neutral to positive jaws, but acquisitions and the markets exceptional results last year, which led to us having 5% positive jaws for the last year have meant that the reported numbers looks slightly awry to that.</p>
          <p>Looking at the chart on the right side on the individual businesses, it's not surprising to see the cost &#x2013; the fastest growth in costs continues to be the Asian business.  Their income a little softer, because of the effect of markets having a particular impact on their business.  And very little in the way of &#x2013; in fact costs down within New Zealand and half-on-half institutional had a very little in the way of growth in costs as well.  Partly timing associated with remuneration adjustments in the second half of last year.</p>
          <p>Australia division, you might be a little bit surprised by that four and five.  Remembering of course that the four includes absorbing $70 million of, sorry, sorry, for Australia it has been $55 million of fee reductions and the 5% reflects some pickup in FTEs to handle high volumes of -that have been incoming through.  It also includes some key projects that business has been doing and because the Australian business is the principle occupier of our new building at 833 Collins Street, it of course has the issue of going from fully depreciated premises to brand new premises and some additional costs coming through for that.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the impaired asset numbers and I think we stressed at the time of the trading update that Q1 had very little in the way of growth of impaired assets, but we said that since Q1 we've been seeing some further impaired assets coming through, classically towards the middle market area and they had though low loss given default, because they're well secured and that's what this chart points out.  There is a small reduction in the rate of emergence of new impaired assets in March '10.  But the key thing I think is what you see from the chart on the right hand side that the mix is changing very significantly.  It's the period previously where it tended to be more at the very top end of town financial institution related and big components from property has now gone to more of the traditional middle market type areas, where you're picking up far more from manufacturing wholesale and agri becoming another factor, that's playing through.  Now the key difference is of course that sort of lending tends to have more security, and that's why the rate of reduction in individual provision is greater than the rate of reduction in the level of new impaired assets that are coming through, reflecting these assets have higher levels of security.</p>
          <p>Looking at the chart in the middle, it's also interesting to note, inconsistent with what we said we expected to happen that the new impaired assets are dominated by medium and smaller credits.  For example, assets between 10 and 100 million represents 63% of that of the growth in our level of gross impaired assets and over $100 million is only 17%.  So, it's skewed now towards that middle and smaller credits, again inline with the trend that we expected to see.</p>
          <p>So, what has happened in with the individual provision and total provision charge?  As you saw before, total provision is down by 32%.  Now the individual provision is only part of the contributor, that's been a big contribution coming out of the collective provision.  So, the individual provision is down 17%, but importantly virtually every business has had a reduction in individual provisions.  There have been a couple of exceptions, but &#x2013; really it's been across the board that the individual provisions charge has been down and which has been pleasing to see.</p>
          <p>Now from a collective provision point of view.  Again not surprisingly given there's been relatively modest balance sheet change, you were seeing on the risk weighted asset side that there was in fact a small benefit from credit portfolio migration.  That we've seen stabilization in the credit portfolio which meant that there is relatively little in the way of risk adjustment and relatively little volume adjustment.  So, hence a modest collective provision charge, notably though and one exception to that story is within the New Zealand business.  So, that's $36 million there includes around $60 million of economic cycle and concentration top ups recognizing some of the continuing stress within the commercial and rural books within New Zealand and that's been the principle driver behind why our overlay for the cycle and for concentration.  I mean showing on the chart on the top right hand corner is increased by $31 million in the half and now stands at $555 million.  So, a collective provision showing that trend towards some more stabilization.</p>
          <p>So, the obvious question that comes out of that is so what does that mean in terms of the outlook from here.  So, a few observations using the same structure that we used at the last half look for some of these key drivers.  Obviously, our earnings have been benefited by improvements in the margin and stayed inside of the outlook and the opportunity for further improvement in that margin is much less than it has been.  We're substantially through the repricing, whilst there is still some opportunity for repricing.  There is also signs of credit margins in the institutional and corporate type lending coming in a little bit.</p>
          <p>Still further repricing that comes through within New Zealand as that mortgage book progressively reprices the future mortgage book, but then against the backdrop of very strong growth in competition in deposits meaning that that outlook of further margin improvement is much more subdued.  From a balance sheet point of view some early signs of a little bit more momentum since some of our outlook for lending within the institutional sector is more positive than it was has been, perhaps I'd say a turnaround in that.  So, less margin improvement but we're expecting some more growth coming through on the balance sheet side.</p>
          <p>The markets business as we said earlier this has clearly a very strong momentum in the underlying business here.  But nonetheless when around half of your earnings is coming from trading, there is some volatility there as to what opportunities emerged.  So, whilst, we're expecting underlying trend in the markets business continued to be upwards, you've got to recognize that you can have half-on-half volatility in that.</p>
          <p>From the credit provision charge on the top right hand corner, I would caution against the assumption that there is a trend downwards in the second-half.  Second-half typically is seasonally higher in parts of the business that's retail, parts of the business and small business.  There is still some stress set in the New Zealand and portfolios around commercial and corporate.  So, once the outlook is probably better on the institutional side, we would think the second-half around these levels maybe slightly higher and maybe slightly lower.  But certainly I wouldn't be expecting a significant change from these sorts of levels.  It's still &#x2013; there is still a lot to play through even though the general environment is much better.</p>
          <p>From an investment point of view, we will continue to have relatively higher rates of growth recognizing the strategies we have within the Asia-Pacific and institutional businesses in particular, but really across the Group.  So, you would expect excluding acquisitions, us to continuing to target neutral to mildly positive jaws and the variable in there will obviously be what happens when the market business side is unexpectedly weak.  Markets income in one minute can be slightly negative, but philosophy continues to be to target and neutral to positive jaws.  So, we can maximize the growth and build the franchise.  But on the right corner around the effect of the Australian dollar obviously it's had a drag on the first-half of around 3% and that detail is set out for you within the pack.  And if there was to be a continuation of exchange rates around the current level and that translates into PAT impact for the full year of around five.  So, you can see that it is something which we'll be driving into the results as well.</p>
          <p>So, since I think we had a strong PAT growth when you're looking behind the profit before provisions growth you see in fact is also strong, once should adjust for the exceptional results in markets last year and so it's been an overall solid business performance.  So thank you, I'll hand back to Jill.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Thanks Jill.  John Mott from UBS. Actually I'm going start with a question for Peter on something he just talked about a minute ago.  But I just wanted to get a bit more detail on it.  And it's the burden there for debts and the outlook over not just the next half but over of the next year or so.  If you look at slide 21, one of the factors that you can see there is in that say pay charge the risk profile is now negative for the first time in some &#x2013; some years.  And you also have a cycle and concentration coming down materially.  So, unless you see a big re-acceleration in credit growth I would have thought it would be pretty fair to assume that we see pay charge if anything would start to unwind and go negative for some time unless you see very good acceleration in credit.  And secondly if you go back one page to page 20 with the IPs again if we do see the economy continue to recover we should in theory see that continue to go back down towards where it was previously to the financial crisis.  So, if you add those two together, is it fair to assume that at some stage over next couple of years we should see very low charges below the expected loss that the you highlighted I think about 31, 32 basis points and what would we actually need to see before we get to those levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good &#x2013; good set of questions in there.  I think what you'll see on page 28 we said that what is the current expected loss for this portfolio and it's running around about 1.6, 1.7 billion on the current profile.  So, we're still running at above average credit losses, but obviously at some point we're going to have below average because typically you spend more time below average than you do above in the credit cycle.  Going for your questions individually, first of all from the collective provision and point of view I think we said before that we wouldn't envisage any substantial unwind of those overlays in the current year.  You'd really want to see a more sustained period of reduction in individual provisions.  Some of those overlays are earmarked against some specific risks.  And so if there will be some developments from those you may have some release of that &#x2013; but as the general principle we'd like to see some more sustained period of lower levels of IPs. Recognizing the comments that Mike was making at the outset, it's still, it's a multi-speed economy out there.  There are still pockets of stress.  The worst things are certainly improving and therefore we've gone away from needing to top-up these provisions.  We are not yet calling the position where we say we're going to start unwinding them although that would definitely come.  I don't know, Mike, do you want add any further comments there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure I mean the two comments I'd add to that is that you're not going to see a return to a pre-crisis credit cost levels for some time.  That's &#x2013; that was if you think at the very end of the cycle.  So, we'll have to run through that.  So, in the medium-term you're going to see, it won't be as significant as it is now, but it's going to still be a higher credit costs than we were used to in pre-crisis.  The other thing is that there will be growth in the balance sheet.  We're beginning to see a pickup in demand from the top end of town from institutional businesses a lot in the pipeline, but it just hasn't yet come to fruition, the people are still waiting.  So, there is a lot of potential stuff just waiting for that confidence to fully recover.  So, I do think we will actually see an increase in lending in the institutional book.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse.  A question for you Mike, in you Asian strategy I think you've articulated there is a number of phases associated with it, with the first phase predominantly looking filling out the strategic hubs and then phase two to actually go into different geographies within the region.  So, two questions around that, does the RBS asset acquisition fulfill filling out the strategic hubs?  And then secondly with phase two and without specifically mentioning Korea Exchange Bank to what extent does an opportunity within Korea represent something that you'd look at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I think RBS has obviously given us a leg up in terms of building a core competence in a number of those hubs.  We still have to do more.  We still have to build that out and that may &#x2013; that will be a mix of organic or indeed opportunistic acquisition as and when it comes.  Countries like Japan, Korea, India are also going to be incredibly important and China obviously because they are major trading partners of Australia.  And therefore it figures that there is going to be customer flow.  And in fact if we take Korea, I mean Korea's results were &#x2013; last year was 70% up on history.  We are building up our business there.  But those areas are quite difficult in terms of opportunity. They're a little bit more &#x2013; they're not emerging markets. They are much more mature markets and opportunity for assets rarely comes up.  So, you just have to be opportunistic.  And again I would go back to our acquisition strategy, which is very, very clear. It has to be within our strategic our overall strategic template.  It has to represent good value in terms of what we could do organically.  And three, we have to be able to execute. I have the resources and people to execute.  And if we cannot tick off those three boxes, we won't do it and I think we've proved that on a couple of occasions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>James Freeman from Deutsche Bank.  Just want to actually ask a question around the deposits, your customer deposit growth has actually been negative in Australia, Australian region and also New Zealand region.  Just a bit of an explanation as to why, and that's on page 44 of the results pack.  And secondly, Mike you just mentioned there's a pick up in the top end of town or expecting a pick up in the top end of town, I just wanted to confirm whether the margins on that new business are expected to be similar to those that you've shown on slide 16, which shows institutional margins up around 3%, will that be where your new business is being priced at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and that's where the new business is coming in at the moment.  And there has been a repricing of global credit.  So, that would be the case.  How long that lasts of course is another issue, but in terms of the overall customer deposit numbers that is very skewed to the loss of institutional deposits which is all part of the deleveraging effect that has happened over the last year as debt has been replaced or been repaid basically from cashed up companies or indeed from new equity risings.  In terms of retail and small business deposits that has actually increased.</p>

          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley.  Just a question relating to the Asia-Pacific, Europe and America region, on page 52 you've got the U.S. dollar amounts.  Asia profit went from 143 million to 145 million half-on-half so it's pretty flat, I'm just wondering if we can get an explanation as to what drove the flat profit outcome in the Asian region and some expectation for whether you can reinvigorate profit growth in the next half and how much the RBS business might actually add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the Asian profit result, it really gets back to what's happened within the markets earnings.  There was also within Asia a slight increase in provisions half-on-half.  So, I think we've been saying within the Asian business that they had exceptional growth last year and so it's a little hard to get the same rates of growth this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, is the second half issue was it <mark type="inaudible" /> because in the first half of last year, the profit was actually lower than it is now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was &#x2013; remember the first half is extremely strong market earnings and it came down into the second half and then and so basically continued.  So, if you look on page 53, you'll see that the Asia PAT growth there is 1% and credit has been up by 9% and there were a couple of accounts that required some additional provisions and on the income growth, which had been running at very strong double digit, came back to 12% particularly from rundown in the income on the market side and then continued to invest 20%, sorry 20% per half on the spending side, because even though that the volatility in markets has happened we have not held back on the investment and so we ended up with only 2% pcp growth.  It's fair to say as well here that Alex here manages this as a total portfolio of businesses.  And so he'll try to fund some of his investment in Asia from other parts of the Pacific or from Europe and Americas and so you see Europe, Americas was stronger.  It was up 17% so you use some of that to fund what was happening in Asia.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's &#x2013; that's we will see some of the &#x2013; in terms of the market income, I think we'll see some of that volatility returning, particularly coming out of some of the sovereign issues that we're seeing in Europe.  I think credits markets will become a bit more volatile, which should provide an opportunity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jill.  Mike, can you talk broadly about your appetite for credit risk. If I can make a couple of small observations to lay into that question or follow-up on it, in institutional obviously margins going up, which would seem to imply you're taking more risk and pricing for it, but you're taking more risk, your thoughts on the Australian housing market and especially in light of your view last year around first time buyers.  And then I guess finally if we look at credit card volumes, very strong in Australia, very strong in Asia, probably two of the strongest growing segments in the book, just your overall appetite for credit risk at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of institutional risk, I wouldn't say we're going up the risk curve, in fact I'd say quite the opposite, we're actually going down it.  I think what we are doing is actually pricing for risk correctly, which I don't think we had been doing, I don't think the market had been doing.  I wouldn't single ANZ out.  The issue is how long will that cycle last.  Bankers have short memories, as we all know.  I think in terms of the housing market, I reckon our portfolio is pretty good.  It's pretty robust, but there has been an increase in default rates in the mortgage book, and that has predominantly been in the parts of the portfolio which related to low doc and high LVRs, which we actually turned off in 2008.  So, that's &#x2013; part of that portfolio is running through and we're beginning to get problems there, but frankly I think we recognized it in time and you're quite right, I think the first home buyer market may come under a bit of stress as rates go up.  But again, I think we kept our credit policy pretty sound there with lower LVRs.</p>
          <p>I think it is absolutely critical that we maintain a responsible lending policy and I feel that we have that right now, but I would share the concern in terms of affordability of housing that the RBA has annunciated.  I think it is an issue and we do have to be aware of it.  In terms of cards, the advantage I think we have in cards is that we have a very mature portfolio in most of our businesses.  And as a result we seem to have a lower default rate than the market and you'd expect that with a more mature portfolio.  And actually we're seeing default rates there actually come-off, which is sort of counterintuitive, but that's what's happening.  I think maybe we're improving our collections, but I think it's probably quite a good quality portfolio.</p>

          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA.  Congratulations on a great result, Mike.  Mike, a question for you and then one very quick one for Peter, if you look at the Bell Resources case, which goes back 20 years ago, this is concept of perfection of security where the banks give a little bit more credit, let it live for another 6 months and then push it into receivership.  And all of sudden you've gone from being unsecured to secured. Without putting specific names on that, if you look at things like ABC Learning, Timbercorp, Great Southern.  Every one of them seems to have exactly the same characteristics, when you talk about that some of the economic overlay is against specific risks.  Is that the risk we're talking about?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I mean I'd &#x2013; let's be quite frank.  We've got a few heavy names in there &#x2013; heavy in terms of the losses, not heavy in terms of the capability of the company, but I think that we have got some way to run through this.  These restructures take a long time and gradually you can work them through, but I think we have to be realistic that they can go pear shape at any time and you need to have sufficient coverage to deal with that so.</p>

          <p>Brett Le Mesurier from Axiome Equities.  So, question for you Peter, you showed that the new impaired assets on slide 19 peaked in the September half '09 within your review in the 4D you show that they bottomed in the second half '09.  There is about $600 million difference.  So, can you just tell us what you've done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is two different numbers you're looking at. The chart is looking at impaired assets and I think the other numbers you're looking at the 4D are impaired loans.  So, if you've had something which has gone for an unproductive facility into a loan, that doesn't change your impaired assets, it's just migrated from a facility to actually have been drawn down and likewise we had around $200 million account that was restructured last half and now became an impaired loan.  So, it's just moved from impaired category to another.  So, for these loans, the numbers we had on the slide is the total loans plus unproductive facilities and plus the restructured items, which is the better measure to look at it, because it's looking at all of your accounts that have defaulted.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  It's a bit like Brian's nerdy spreadsheet question to some extent, but I'm just trying to reconcile and further to James's earlier question about deposit growth rates.  On slide 17, the Australian division shows 2% customer deposit growth half-on-half.  Page 47 of the result deck shows the Australian division with a 1% contraction in deposits.  So, is the difference there institutional customers that sit within the Australian business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm afraid this is &#x2013; welcome to our &#x2013; our internal nightmare.  This is the difference between the geographic view and the divisional view.  That &#x2013; the business had growth, but the institutional was down by 5%.  So, if you see on page 47, retail and commercial and wealth comprise the Australian division, which is Phil's principal responsibility and when you add-on institutional to get the whole geography you go from what was positive growth in deposits to minus one.  And that was the deleveraging effect that Mike was referring to before affecting the institutional deposits.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And withstanding the Ensanda run-off in deposits that's occurring, there seems to be a bit of different dynamic in your commercial book between your loan growth and your deposit growth.  Can you pass some comment there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, right. Yeah, sure.  Well, I mean there is obviously a lot of detail underneath that, but the commercial dynamic is that we've had quite good growth in small business.  But the further up the spectrum you go into the commercial accounts, the more they look like the corporates that have been deleveraging.  So, we've had quite a mixed outcome.  I think we've had about roughly 10 to 12% growth from lending to small business, but the overall outcome was pretty flat on asset growth for commercial, generally.  The deposit story is really dominated by the Ensanda run-off of the debenture books.  So that does in a sense undersell what has been quite strong growth in the bank's share of household deposits.  So, I think that Peter's answer about the geographic issues is the correct one, which is, if you look it at macro level, it looks like it's falling. If you start breaking it down, the institutional categories fell the Ensanda piece was in run-off from last year and we've had reasonably strong growth and higher than system growth in the household deposit categories.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Scott Manning from JPMorgan.  Just a question on the domestic mortgage market, we've seen a very strong growth in wholesale funding requirements from CBA and Westpac.  They've kind of indicated that they probably had enough and they are looking to slide down the growth rates in those portfolios.  Just wanted to see what you are doing on your risk metrics and your level of appetite in those markets to see whether you might push towards above system growth as they might look to slowdown?</p>

          <p>We're actually already experiencing above system growth in our mortgage &#x2013; in the mortgage portfolio.  But as I said earlier, if we are maintaining our credit quality and the credit policy of slightly lower LVR than perhaps some of our competitors.  So, we continue to do that.</p>

          <p>Good day to everyone. Mike, you referred to having a fresh share of issues from the integration of RBS, do you want to elaborate on that a bit please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the first share of issues was all the other legacy stuff that we had in &#x2013; within the businesses which we are working through.  I think in terms of RBS what I said there was that was a very complex transaction and the reason it was a complex transaction is that it was only in three countries.  We actually transfer the whole of the RBS business to us. In the other three countries it's meant transferring part of the business, the retail and wealth and commercial business actually it's the funding which is great.  But it means that you have to split the branch business and that is never an easy thing to do.  So, of course the systems issues, the customer agreement, the regulatory issues were all quite complex, but I'd think we've made incredibly good progress on that and things are tracking exactly on plan.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning.  My question was on the markets business and I guess capital allocation going forward, just looking at the half &#x2013; the assets in the markets business were up about $9 billion, the margins were down.  The first part of my question was just whether that increase was a one-off or we should expect to see that sort of balance sheet growth going forward.  And with the margins whether that just relates to credit spreads tightening in.  And then I guess as a broader question for Mike just on capital allocation, you're sitting on a 10.7% Tier-1 just interested in sort of the priorities ex-acquisitions for that capital with regard to growing the markets both growing offshore lending, domestic lending or potentially returning any to shareholders post the regulatory environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well if I answer the second question first.  Whilst I acknowledged that we are at the high end of the Tier-1 capital band, I still feel that we are in an environment which is uncertain and in terms of the regulatory environment, it's still very unclear as to what will happen.  And I feel that we do have to be genuinely careful with what we utilize our capital for.  It does give us as you say some potential to grow the business both organically or by acquisition.  And in terms of the mix organically, I would like to see that fairly evenly spread it in due course, I'd like to see the business split at least between institutional and commercial and wealth and retail as being more or less the same.  But in the nearer term that is probably going to be hard to achieve, particularly as we build up the Asia-Pacific business which will be predominantly get sort of the skewed to the institutional side.  So, everybody can bid for the balance sheet in terms of our businesses and I think we have to look where the opportunity is the best?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matthew in terms of your question on institutional growth in assets within markets where you particularly you're looking at the average assets and that was the strategy which are being used during the half and all those have been in effect now run-off.  So, that's been less in terms of the averages that affected the balance, it was sovereign securities or purchases part of the business.  I'll remind you that the comments I made earlier the strategy for this business is to increasing make money from sales not from trading off from balance sheet and to extent that any usage of balance sheet would be relatively short-term not.  As was the strategy that caused the average interest earning assets to grow during this half.  We'll be looking to make money from customer flow and not from churning &#x2013; not from using the balance sheet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>James Freeman from Deutsche Bank.  Just actually Mike I want to follow-up on that question on capital.  I mean you're generating 40 basis points a half at the moment of organic capital, which I mean if we keep going at this rate and one would argue over the next couple of years that should continue to accelerate as the bad debt is also reduced.  I mean you're going to end up with a very big capital position as we wait for regulatory change to actually come and get some certainty around that issue.  I mean at what point do you turn around, sit there, and say, ok I'm a little too high now and I can start to reduce even though wanting to keep the surplus above where some of the peers might see it.  I mean what point do we get to that and just the other one for Peter -</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hoping for a little more detail than that.  Peter just also your sticky funding ratio I notice that it has been absent from this presentation.  Is there any change in that or if I just missed it in the 200 pages of data we've got to get through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To answer your question.  I mean obviously I don't want to hold onto more capital than I need in the longer term, but I do think there is sufficient uncertainty out there that we're relatively comfortable.  And as I say there is quite a lot in the pipeline right now in terms of loan demand and it just hasn't actually been executed yet, people are still waiting.  We have got quite significant approvals just waiting to go within the pipe.  And it's just that confidence has not yet come back completely into the market and I think when it does there may be quite a big growth.  So, I'm comfortable where we sit, but I take your point I mean and I'm not going be sitting on excess capital for too long.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that pipeline big enough to offset the organic generation at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I suspect it will be because we will actually have quite a large adjustment.  If you think about how our risk weighted assets have come right off in the last 2 years.  I expect that they will increase quite substantially before they even out into a more sustainable growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another little variable that sits in there that's sort of subtle is the average term of your lending portfolio because your risk weighted assets are a function of the probability of default, the loss given default and the remaining term.  And a lot of customers are shortening up and not refinancing in the current environment.  So, the average term keeps on shortening and risk weighted assets go down.  Now there is not a lot, I think it was $1.8 billion for this half.  We've had that trend for a while and once people start to refinance, they're going to refinance out 5 years and so not only you're going to have balance sheet growth, but you're going to have the term extending out.  So, hence yes, you could say risk weighted assets growing again.  The trouble in this whole space is there is so many variables at the moment.  How you manage them and have defaults it's better to be higher than lower.  So, to maximize your ability to manage the variables which are sitting out there.</p>
          <p>In terms of your question around the sticky funding ratio, our internal what we call our core funding ratio.  I would actually publish the ratio but you can get the directions of it from page 39 because it's a combination of how much is in customer deposits plus how much is in term funding and you find that both of those numbers have improved in the half.  Our customer deposits have gone from 55% to 56, and term funding has gone from 15% to 17%.  So, as our internal core funding ratio has improved by about 2% across the half and interesting enough our internal core funding ratio is remarkably similar to the outcome of the &#x2013; NSFR similar because we adjust the customer deposits for how volatile they are and saying they're getting similar numbers. So the portfolio from a liquidity point of view has improved across the half.</p>

          <p>Just a question on some of these tax changes currently being talked about and there's been a few credible leaks as we go into weekend, I just wanted to get your view was there anything that sort of come out that you see as an opportunity or potential threat and in particular one of the ones that I saw which was kind of interesting was just the talk about deposits and some favorable tax treatment on that.

          <p>Mike, if you look around the world, Asian banks and you seem to be very focused on telling us that you're an Asian bank, run a lot bigger T1 ratios than banks in Europe and North America.  Now on one hand 10.7% sounds really big, but if you have a look at KB Bank, for example which we don't want to talk about, it's over 11.  Who's right? And that's all core by the way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely. I think that's an important distinction and I think Asian banks have generally been much more conservative in terms of their capital management and indeed of their liquidity management and I think we can all take lessons from that, but we have to be competitive.  We have to be realistic.  I would expect as we build up our emerging market businesses not saying that Korea is an emerging market here, but certainly our emerging market businesses that you would maintain a higher capital ratio against those businesses than you would say in a market like Australia.</p>
