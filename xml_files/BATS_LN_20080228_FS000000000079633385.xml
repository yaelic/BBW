        <plist>
          <p>All right. Good morning everyone. I am Jan du Plessis, Chairman of British American Tobacco. And with me this morning I have Paul Adams, Chief Executive, and Paul Rayner, our Finance Director. And thank you all for coming. A warm welcome also to those of you listening in on the conference call or following this on our website, bat.com. Also I should just extend a special welcome to the number of visitors from Russia this morning, a number of journalists we've got with us. Thank you for joining us and I hope you'll find it interesting.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to say we have lots of goods thing to talk about. I thought I might just start with one bit of bad news. I am sure you will have seen from our announcement earlier this morning that Paul Rayner has decided to return to Australia for family reasons. And according he has asked to stand down as a Finance Director at AGM in April. With great sadness, we have obviously agreed to his request. And we can only wish Paul and his family, well at this difficult time. We're not only losing a brilliant Finance Director, but I am sure you all agree that we are losing somebody who has widely respected, both inside and outside the company, and who is much liked by his colleagues world-wide.</p>
          <p>Paul will be succeeded by Ben Stevens, currently Regional Director, Europe. I think a number of you might have meeting him from time to time. Paul is a tremendously experienced executive, since joining &#x2013; I mean, Ben I am now talking about. Ben joined our Group in 1990. Ben has held a number of financial and general management roles in different parts of the world and I have no doubt that under Ben our Group's finances will be in good hands.</p>
          <p>Having said that, in the meantime the summer is going on, I must warn you all that Mr. Rayner is charged up as always and is ready to do battle with you all in the traditional sparring session, which is otherwise likely known as the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>So, back to business. As you all have seen from our announcement, we have a lot of ground to cover this morning. In addition to discussing our 2007 results, we will take you through today's announcement on the acquisition of Skandinavisk Tobacco [Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni]. Paul Rayner will also be looking forward to the next five years productivity program. And of course, at the end of our presentation there will be time for your questions.</p>
          <p>When you look at the headline numbers, it is obvious that 2007 was another good year. Although, overall volumes were down slightly, global drive brand showed strong growth up 10%. The adverse impact of the exchange, meant that revenue rose 3% and profit from operations 7%, which clearly marks the underlying strength of the business. At comparable rates of exchange, revenue rose by 5% and profits from operations, excluding exceptionals was up 11%. Notwithstanding the adverse currency impact, adjusted earnings per share rose 11%, slightly ahead of our expectation of delivering high single-figure earnings growth over the medium to long term.</p>
          <p>In fact, as you can see from this chart, over the last five years we have delivered at the very top end of that guidance, with adjusted earnings per share growing by 10% on compound basis. This clearly demonstrates that we have reason to be confident in our ability to meet our often stated earnings goal over the medium to long-term.</p>
          <p>We announced with some pride this morning that after the first five years of our productivity program, we have generated annual cost savings in excess of &#xA3;1 billion. Paul Rayner will cover these savings with you later and will also talk about the next five year target to achieve further annual savings of around &#xA3;800 million.</p>
          <p>M&amp;A activity is an important part of our growth strategy, although I have often said that patience is a hugely important component of any successful acquisition strategy. So, although we have been relatively quite in recent years I suppose it's a bit like the proverbial London bus; after a long wait, two arrive at the same time. Both transactions announced in recent days give us scale in some key strategic markets, were done at sensible prices and will, I believe, yield attractive financial returns. Paul will tell you more about the Tekel and Skandinavisk Tobacco deals later.</p>
          <p>In line with the Board's plan to raise the dividend payout ratio to 65% by 2008, the proposed payout ratio in respect of 2007 has been raised to 61%. This translates into an 18% increase in the dividend per share to 66.2 pence. Looking back over the past five years, the proposed dividend for 2007 means that dividends have grown at a compound rate of 13%. As the payout ratio will rise 4 percentage points to 65% in a year's time, there should be a further significant increase in dividends per share during 2008.</p>
          <p>In addition we have during the year, invested &#xA3;750 million in the share buyback program by buying some 45 million shares at an average price of &#xA3;16.57 per share. This program will restart again shortly, although we have decided to scale back the program in recognition of the financing requirements arising from the ST and Tekel acquisitions.</p>
          <p>We continue to be committed to returning cash to our shareholders. As this slide shows, over the last five years, we've paid out about &#xA3;7.7 billion, 4.7 billion of which was in the form of dividends, was almost &#xA3;3 billion being returned in the form of buybacks.</p>
          <p>However, we are sensitive to the needs of our bondholders and about our credit ratings and accordingly decided that in particularly given conditions providing in the credit markets, it is prudent to scale back the level of the buyback for the time being. We will keep this under review and would expect to return to the &#xA3;750 million level in due course.</p>
          <p>You'll recall that last year we sought a take-up upon our waiver, supported by, consented by independent shareholders at the AGM to allow our now, shareholding to rise above 30% as a consequence of our buyback program. Shareholding currently stands at 29.5%. We will again be seeking a renewal of the waiver and the shareholder support at the AGM in April.</p>
          <p>You will also recall that last November Richemont and Remgro announced that they will be reviewing the R&amp;R structure. This review is underway and as you know we have agreed to seek a listing for British American Tobacco on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, if requested by R&amp;R to do so. You will appreciate that this is a R&amp;R restructuring and there is no more that we can say on that matter today. We expect further announcements will come from Remgro and Richemont in due course.</p>
          <p>And finally, before I hand over to Paul, I would like end my remark with this chart, which shows our returns over the last five years against the FTSE 100. For those of you who cannot see the legend, BAT is the blue line showing that &#xA3;100 invested in BAT would have yielded a total shareholder return of &#xA3;394, compared to a return of &#xA3;189 invested in the FTSE 100 index.</p>
          <p>So, I will now hand over to Paul Adams, who will review with you last year's performance in more detail and also comment further on the two recently announced acquisitions. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning everyone and thank you Jan. As Jan said, it is been another very good year, on almost all of the key measures, the Group has performed well. Volume was 1% lower, due mainly to some of the trade buying in certain markets at the end of the 2006, in anticipation of excise movements. In addition, we had some supply chain disruptions in the Middle East and the loss of StiX in Germany. Improved pricing has also had some effect on volume but this has helped net revenue, which was up at 3% current rates and 5% at comparable rates.</p>
          <p>Improved mix has also been a driver of revenue growth and the 10% growth in global drive Brands is a reliable indicator of improving mix. In fact, our premium volume has grown 3% despite the 1% decline in Group volume. Higher revenue in cost savings are drivers behind operating growth, up 7% and our operating margin at 30% has risen from 24% in 2004.</p>
          <p>So when we talk of another good year, we are talking about consistent good performance coming from the strategies we have been following for the last five years. There is consistency in the application of the strategies across the regions. As this slide shows, each region delivered good revenue growth at comparable rates of exchange.</p>
          <p>Volume was 1% lower in Europe, due mainly to the trade distortions in Russia at the end of the 2006 and the loss of StiX in Germany. Asia-Pacific achieved volume growth as a result of strong growth in Pakistan, South Korea and Vietnam. The 1% decline in Latin America followed strong pricing with revenue up almost 13% at comparable rates. AME had good revenue growth, up 4%. The volume was down as a result of the supply chain disruptions in the Middle East. Even America-Pacific, with lower industry volumes in Japan and Canada, had revenue growth before the impact of adverse exchange.</p>
          <p>Looking at profit on the same basis, the 11% rise in profit at constant rates on lower volume of 1%, reflects the very good performance of our global drive brands in many markets, together with improved pricing and cost savings. At current rates, the exchange rate was &#xA3;106 million. And I'm delighted to report that all regions reported strong profit growth at constant rates of exchange, including America-Pacific.</p>
          <p>2007 saw two significant milestones, both Kent and Pall Mall passed the 50 billion sticks volume mark for the first time. The combined volume of the global drive brands was 161 billion, double the volume back in 1999. The global drive brands now account for 23.5% of Group volume and the international brands, which rose 6% to 303 billion, now account for 44% of Group volume. And not only did Kent break through the 50 billion level, with growth of 19% during 2007, it is now the biggest brand in the Group and a premium brand of that. Kent has been launched in a number of markets in Western Europe including the Nordic countries using the Barkley Kent migration as a platform. Kent Nanotek has been an outstanding launch in Russia and other Eastern European markets. But the success of Kent is not confined to Europe, Benson &amp; Hedges' migration is underway in South Africa and Kent continues to grow in Chile.</p>
          <p>Innovation has been a driver behind Dunhill's 6% growth with the success of the resalable pack in the Gulf States, and the launch of super premium offers, such as Fine Cut, Top Leaf and the tribute packs. Lucky Strike has had two years of growth, despite the industry decline in its key markets Germany and Japan. Again, innovations have given Lucky Strike momentum in Spain, France, Italy and Indonesia.</p>
          <p>The rollout of the Pall Mall across the regions has enabled the brand to deliver solid growth of 10% despite the loss of StiX volume in Germany. It is easy to overlook the fact, that Pall Mall is the number two global brand in roll-your-own, a segment in which the brand enjoyed good growth in 2007. Taking RYO and cigarettes together, Pall Mall's growth would have been 14% last year.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the regions. Europe had another strong year with global drive brand growth of 15%. These brands, plus Vogue and Viceroy are now 47% of regional volume. Profits grew strongly up 8% to &#xA3;846 million, of both current and comparable rates of exchange, driven by productivity savings and an improved mix, assisted by a better pricing environment.</p>
          <p>In Italy, volume and share were lower, although Lucky Strike, Dunhill and Pall Mall grew share. Profit was lower due to reduced volumes, higher marketing expenses and the disposable of the Toscano cigar business in 2006. Despite a slightly improved market share in Germany, volumes declined, as industry sales were affected by the growth of the illicit trade, end of the stiX, changes in vending regulations and consumer down trading, leading to lower profit. In Russia, profit grew significantly, benefiting from higher margins, improved product mix and productivity savings.</p>
          <p>Asia Pacific volumes were 2.4% higher with a strong 12% growth in global drive brands. Profit rose &#xA3;56 million to &#xA3;672 million. In Australia, profit grew with improved margins from product cost reductions and price increases. Market share also grew, driven by Winfield and Dunhill. Although, overall share was down in Malaysia, our share of the premium and value-for-money segments grew. Higher pricing and the improved product mix was more than offset by lower volumes and increased marketing expenditure. Volume, share and profit in local currency rose in South Korea, with Dunhill continuing to grow strongly.</p>
          <p>Latin America delivered 11% profit growth at current rates of exchange, despite weaker currencies. Volume was 1% lower due to excise increases and higher pricing. The 35% growth in global drive brands, was off a low base and was led by Central American and Caribbean markets, Chile and Peru. In Brazil, profit grew strongly, benefiting from higher volumes, price increases in anticipation of the excise increase in July and some improvement in the product mix. The excise increase in January 2007 had an impact on industry volume in Mexico, which together with lower market share and a weaker currency resulted in lower profit.</p>
          <p>Adverse exchange rates and supply chain disruptions in the Middle East held back the Africa and Middle East results. Profit at current rates was just &#xA3;2 million ahead at &#xA3;470 million and volume was 4% lower. At comparable rates of exchange, profit would have been 11% ahead. In South Africa, good profit growth was achieved in local currency, as a result of reductions in illicit trade and improved product mix and higher margins from pricing and productivity improvements. Margins improved in Nigeria as a result of productivity initiatives and product mix leading to higher profit.</p>
          <p>Profit from the America Pacific region increased by &#xA3;22 million to &#xA3;446 million, as a result of higher profit in local currency in Japan and Canada, partly offset by the impact of weaker exchange rates. Volumes were lower mainly as a result of the decline in industry volumes in Canada. Higher margins and lower production costs enable Canada to grow profit by &#xA3;4 million at comparable rates of exchange. The growth of illicit product and loss of market share from 53.8% to 52.6% resulted in a 10% reduction in volume. In Japan, where there was a significant decline in industry volumes, the growth of market share, profit and volumes continued, driven by the strong performances of Kent and Kool. Profit grew through higher volumes, increased margins, improved product mix and effective cost management, partly offset by the impact of unfavorable exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Now this morning we announced a deal to buy 100% of the cigarette and smokeless snus businesses of our associate Skandinavisk Tobacco. We will exchange our existing 32% stake, as an agreed valuation of &#xA3;904 million and pay &#xA3;1.151 billion in cash to settle the transaction. The overall price is equivalent to &#xA3;2.055 billion.</p>
          <p>On completion, the combined business will account for more than 60% of cigarettes sales in Scandinavia with the Skandinavisk business giving us annual sales of approximately 30 billion cigarettes principally through market leadership in Denmark and Norway and approximately one-third of the Swedish market. The number two position in Poland and around one-third of sales and sales in more than 30 other markets. The deal will also give us an excellent premium brand, Prince, with annual volumes of around 7 billion cigarettes in 25 markets. Roll-your-own sales, excluding Denmark, equivalent to around 2 billion cigarettes a year across Europe and the acquisition of Swedish snus manufacturer Fiedler &amp; Lundgren, which sold almost 16 million tins of snus in 2007.  We estimate the businesses to be acquire, generated EBITDA of &#xA3;183 million in 2007 and the price represents a multiple of 11.2 times. A net turnover of &#xA3;467 million, the margin is 40%. We believe this is an excellent deal to British American Tobacco.</p>
          <p>By turning our minority stake in a diversified business into full control of very profitable cigarette businesses, we will significantly strengthen our business in Scandinavia and unlock significant cost synergies of approximately &#xA3;60 million per year by 2011. We anticipate one-off cash cost of around &#xA3;115 million.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Turkey. Last Friday, British American Tobacco won the auction for the cigarette assets of Tekel with a bid of $1.72 billion. We had a telephone conference following the announcement and most of the details are known to you. The deal will take our market share in Turkey to around 36% from just over 7%. But more importantly it will transform our position in the world's eight largest cigarette market and give us important scale to improve the efficiencies and profitability of both businesses. The Tekel brands combined with our existing brands will provide a stronger platform for the growth of international brands including Kent, Pall Mall and Vogue. On an estimated EBITDA of $151 million in 2007, this represents a multiple of 11.4 times. We believe that once the business is integrated into British American Tobacco and the synergies are realized, it will prove to be a very good investment for shareholders.</p>
          <p>We will take your questions on both these transactions after Paul Rayner has taken you through the remainder of the presentation. Paul?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul, and good morning everyone. Since we announced the productivity programs in early 2003, we've provided an annual progress report with the preliminary results. Two years ago, we announced a revised target of &#xA3;400 million for the five year overheads and indirects project, which we completed at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>The cumulative annualized savings from overheads and indirects reached &#xA3;455 million. We also made very good progress on our supply chain, with annualized savings of &#xA3;177 million coming through in 2007, and that makes cumulative annual savings of &#xA3;551 million. Total annualized savings for 2007 were &#xA3;277 million, bringing the total for the five-year program to an excess of &#xA3;1 billion, a remarkable achievement that demonstrates how the Group has driven the productivity element of our strategy.</p>
          <p>During 2007, further five cigarette factories were closed and several others are pending, including Zevenaar in Holland and the Power factory in South Africa. The numbers on this chart relate to cigarette manufacturing plants. In addition, there are other tobacco products factories and leaf processing facilities that have also been scaled down. But it's the cigarette factories that people tend to focus on.</p>
          <p>Back in 2003, we added a further seven factories as a result of acquisitions that year in Italy and Peru. From the chart you can see that significant progress has been made since we announced the productivity programs in early 2003. With the closure since that time of 30 factories and we moved or removed over 400 billion sticks of capacity, more than half our annual production volume. But we don't intend to stop there.</p>
          <p>As promised a year ago, we're announcing today a new five-year cost savings target. There is no doubt that productivity savings are a significant driver of our profit growth. And while some drop through to the bottom line, the balance are reinvested in the business to fund our growth strategy. Which as you can see from the performance of our global drive brands is really working. We look at our costs relative to those of our competitors and also other FMCG companies, and it's clear that there is still scope for greater efficiencies.</p>
          <p>The next five-year target of &#xA3;800 million will come from both the supply chain and overheads and indirects. We believe that it's a demanding but an achievable goal, and it builds on the momentum of the last five years. But we've already laid the foundations for the next five years. Above market processes are being put in place and that's evidenced by the significant reorganizations that are underway in the regions. And these reorganizations will lead to more efficient management structures aided by investment in IT, which generally makes the organization more effective and efficient and also gives us greater use of purchasing power.</p>
          <p>We also seek opportunities to improve working capital, and a good example of that is the global leaf pulling organization, which started trading very recently. We continue to focus on product complexity reduction, eliminating, streamlining and optimizing various specifications and practices we have in the business. And we will continue to report on our progress at this time each year.</p>
          <p>If we return to the results, profit from operations before exceptional items for the first time exceeds &#xA3;3 billion after unallocated costs at &#xA3;107 million were broadly in line with the previous year. During the year, there were some restructuring charges taken, principally in respect of the productivity programs. And the total charge for these restructurings was &#xA3;173 million, which includes the restructurings in Italy and the restructuring of the business across the Europe and Africa and Middle East regions, as well as further costs relating to restructurings in prior years.</p>
          <p>The &#xA3;75 million gain on disposals arose from the sale of pipe tobacco trademarks, which was &#xA3;11 million, and the sale of the Belgian cigar factory and associated brands to Skandinavisk Tobacco, which was around again 45 million. And incidentally we've not bought that business back; it was excluded from the Skandinavisk deal. Finally, there was a gain of &#xA3;19 million arising from the termination of the license agreement that we had with Philip Morris, relating to the Chesterfield trademark in a number of countries in Southern Africa.</p>
          <p>Net finance costs at &#xA3;269 million, a lower then the previous year by &#xA3;20 million and we will cover the details on the next slide. The 11 million increase in associates is after accounting for an exceptional brand impairment charge, taken by Reynolds American of which our share was &#xA3;7 million net of tax. In addition, 2006 included a benefit from the favorable resolution of tax matters and our share of that was &#xA3;17 million.</p>
          <p>At constant rates of exchange excluding exceptionals, associates were up 9% with Reynolds up 7%, ITC up 18% and Skandinavisk Tobacco up 4%. At current rates of exchange, the contribution from Reynolds American was &#xA3;281 million, from ITC was &#xA3;108 million and Skandinavisk was &#xA3;48 million.</p>
          <p>Net finance costs excluding the fair value and exchange differences that are driven by IAS39 and 21, where &#xA3;269 million, which is broadly in line with the guidance given you of &#xA3;17 million per quarter. But it is &#xA3;20 million lower than last year and that reflects in the main lower average net debt in the year, as well as some one-off items.</p>
          <p>The tax charge for group subsidiaries rose from 716 million to &#xA3;791 million. But that gave an underlying tax rate of 29.6% which is in fact exactly the same as last year. We expect the 2008 rate to be between 30 and 31%. Although there remain various unresolved tax issues in a number of markets, which could move this guidance either way. This forecast is slightly higher than last year as 2007 included tax credits to resolve some prior year tax orders.</p>
          <p>Profit for the year rose 12% to &#xA3;2,287 million and the minorities charge rose slightly to &#xA3;157 million mainly reflecting higher profits in Brazil. The adjusted earnings per share calculation is based on adjusted profit figure of &#xA3;2,213 million divided by the fully diluted shares number of &#xA3;2,039 million to give 108.5 pence per share and that is up 11%. The strong profit performance at constant rates of exchange, in adjusted earnings per share. Minorities had a minimal affect and the share buyback program, which bought back 45 million shares at an average price of &#xA3;16.57 benefited earnings by 1%. The share buyback program will resume shortly at the lower level of &#xA3;400 million following the two transactions that we've announced in the last week. At constant rates adjusted earnings per share would have been up around 15%, but adverse exchange rate at 4% impact bringing the adjusted earning per share down to 108.5p, which was rise of 11%.</p>
          <p>And finally, if we look at cash flow . Overall there was a &#xA3;150 million increase in tax outflows. Net cash flow from operating activities before restructuring cost, rose &#xA3;208 million to &#xA3;2,790 million. And this reflected higher profitability, the timing of working capital movements and higher dividends from associates. After lower restructuring cost the group's net cash flow was &#xA3;238 million higher at &#xA3;2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Higher net interest flows, net capital expenditure and dividends and minority interest resulted in free cash flow being &#xA3;170 million higher at &#xA3;1,711 million. Free cash flow per share increased 13% and the ratio of free cash flow per share to adjusted earnings per share rose slightly to 77%. But we do expect this ratio to improve in the future year. Gross borrowings rose from 6.6 to &#xA3;6.9 billion and net debt rose &#xA3;585 million to &#xA3;5.58 billion.</p>
          <p>That's the end of a very long presentation, and I'll now hand over to Jan for the question and answer session.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Paul. Before we start the Q&amp;A session, I think we should give opportunity to our Russian visitors to leave. Is that correct? <mark type="inaudible" /> Are the visitors are going to be leaving now or?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, so moving onto the Q&amp;A session. Can I just ask again, of course, as is accustom that for the purposes of the webcast in the conference call, I'd appreciate if you could just confirm the name and the name of the firm that you represent. And I will as I've done on previous occasions, very briefly summarize the question for the purposes of the webcast. So, who wants to go first? I saw a hand right at the back.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon Leinster, UBS. Just some questions on the cost savings. First of all, you put the target of 800 million and you said that was the benchmark against peers, where would you put yourself against the peer group currently? And where would the target of 800 million puts you within the peer group? Secondly, again on cost savings, doesn't include the 30 million from Tekel and 60 from STK? And lastly, as to run a very remarked that this cost savings program seemed to indicate a greater impact on cash flow, could you therefore give some indications of what you think is ongoing for the cash restructuring -- CapEx indeed mentioned working capital or what sort of level of working capital inflows want to be achieved in product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Question in three parts. The first question relates to the new target of saving &#xA3;800 million over next five years and that Paul Rayner is asked to compare where that could leave us in five years time relative to our peer group. Secondly question is about these &#xA3;800 million target includes savings that we hope to achieve from the Tekel and ST acquisitions. And thirdly Paul is invited to explain in more detail relationship between the productivity savings and cash flow and the various cash flow improvements that he alluded to in his presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks John. Its will get us somewhat closer, but if you look to that cost per thousand compared to say PMI, we're still significantly higher. And this will get us closer and they continue to reduce costs themselves. There will always be some reasons why our costs are somewhat higher than some of that peer groups, because may want to invest in areas that they do not want to invest in. But it gets a significantly closer, but I think it gives us the confidence that we can achieve the 800 million in savings, even though I think it's going to be stronger stretch in the first five year program. They don't include the synergy savings from the two acquisitions from the Tekel and Scandinavisk acquisitions. So those synergy savings will be on top.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash flow. Yes, I did indicate in my announcement there that yes, we are going to be targeting free cash flow per share versus earnings per share. Free cash flow per share is being significantly below earnings per share because of high restructuring cost over the last few years associated with the productivity program and also acquired high levels of working capital as we've had high level of buffer stocks as we move a lot of production around. We would anticipate that we'll able to have low levels of restructuring cost going forward. There will be some restructuring cost associated with the productivity program, but not some of the very higher levels we had associated with some of the large factory closures where we did have some significant, both planned write-offs and redundancy cost. So we expect restructuring cost would come down somewhat, certainly in terms of cash flow.</p>
          <p>And in terms of working capital, we are doing a number of things to try and improve our working capital over the next five years. We are starting to manage our supply chains on an above market basis. And with the benefit of new systems which still have to basically be put in place and be working properly and with the benefit of things such as running our leaf on a global basis which I just announced, we should be able to get reduced levels of stocks because we are starting to run things on a more efficient basis and we'll have integrated sales and operational planning processes, both for the regional level and eventually at a global level. And you compare that to the last five years we have had buffer stocks, we should be able to get working capital levels down. So the combination of improved working capital levels and lower restructuring cost, should enable free cash flow to improve and that is a ratio of earnings per share to improve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. David Hayes from Lehman's. Two questions, just on the STK acquisition, can you give us an idea about what you think about in terms of revenue synergies and should we expect snus to go into your strong distribution in Russia and that's an opportunities that kind of what you are thinking about developing that business? And my second question in terms of the results today, organically it looks like you reinvest or you spend back about &#xA3;200 million in the year, is that a number that you are comfortable with and can you give us a feel for where that sit? Is that kind of your IT that you mentioned Paul, is the innovation, is the AMP spend, is it distribution and can you give you kind of a feel for that might split out? Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two questions just from webcast. First question goes to the Skandinavisk acquisition, have asked to comment on the scope for revenues synergies, any particular ours plan for the snus business. And secondly, David Hayes is asking us to comment on the level of spend back to the last year, you've estimated that to be of the order of about &#xA3;200 million, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we don't normally factor in revenue synergies into our acquisition plans. Tend to look upon those as bonuses if they happen rather than part of the key financials. I think there are some opportunities. You are right, because of the presence that Skandinavisk has in the number of the Scandinavian markets, they have very strong market shares, we do think there will be opportunity to strengthen our sales of international brands in those markets. In terms of snus, it really comes back to the snus business. Yes, with F&amp;L, I think they have 6% of the Swedish market and 4% of the Norwegian market. So yes, it's a creditable size business for snus and having said that I wouldn't get too excited about opportunities for rolling snus at around the world, as we know that a long whole and we still very much in test markets in South Africa and Canada and in Sweden itself.</p>

          <p>On the stand back question David, yes, the leaf stand back was high, you are quite right. I had a figure slightly less than 200, but it was very high. The main area was in marketing, which you would have thought with the rollouts of some global drive brand in the number of markets and going direct distribution number of markets. But on top of that there was some significant increase cost in R&amp;D, there were some significant increase costs in IT which you have eluded too, and we had some significant cost as well involve in setting up some of these new -- the setup cost and some of these new above market structures we are putting in place. We've got a large amount of resources involve in putting together central supply chain organization and there was a lot of money spend on that during the year.</p>

          <p>This is Adam Spielman [Citigroup]. Just really quick following-up on the tax, question on the spend back. As we look forward, given the target of &#xA3;800 million, I mean as far as I am drilling out what sort of spent back do you expect on that 800 and how much probably drop in 2009, because presumably you can't go on ramping up your marketing spectrum. I mean in each year your marketing is getting higher and higher, and that must come a point where you don't need to increases any more, and equally presuming you are not going to be setting up above market structures that we have. So that is one follow up question. And then if I can ask a separate couple of questions. In Canada, in the past you have said that by 2008 you would hope the profit declines would stop and indeed if I calculate correctly you have pretty profit increases in the second half 2007. So I'm just thinking about the outlook in that market. And then finally, and obviously your market shares going up and down in some markets, but persistently, we've seen decline in Italy and Mexico. Can we expect that to continue? Is there anything you can do to stop this market share [inaudible]</p>

          <p>Three short questions from Adam Spielman. The first is back on the &#xA3;800 million target of savings for next five years, asking the Executives to comment on what proportion that will go be and swing back into the markets. Do you see that it comes level at which time we can't spend anymore money in marketing. Second question, relates to Canada, and asking as to comment on the level of profitability in Canada last year and the outlook for 2008, based on previous comments as we expect the bottom of the cycle in profitability terms to be reached in 2008. And thirdly, asking comment on the continuing declining in market share in both Italy and Mexico.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me handle the marketing spend. I'm afraid the marketing spend does continue to increase Adam, as long as you expect global drive brands to keep on increasing year-after-year, anyone ask us when are you going to stop growing global drive brands, as long as you expect global drive brands keep increasing year-after-year, as longer as you expect our premium volume to growth year-after-year, you have to increase the money to be spent in order to achieve that growth...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Roughly speaking, you spent an incremental &#xA3;120 million on marketing, and I think it is huge as 200 times to 60%, that's a huge amount of money to increase your budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you will find that our global drive brands are increasing their profitability after spending that money each year. And therefore it's very worth well investment. But basically, you just can't expect to grow premium brands without spending year-after-year, without spending incremental marketing. And it's the good investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But presumably incremental investment will get -- it doesn't maybe 120 extra each year, I would guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends on what we're trying to do and what kind of pay back we get from which markets when we launch it. We don't just increase the budget and then say how can we spent it. Right? We actually look at what it is that we're trying to achieve, what kind of returns we get and therefore invest the money at that. It's a marketing trend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Canada profitability. Yes, profitability in Canada stabilized last year. And we would see continued stabilization in 2008. Which is not a guarantee that the profits won't go down, but I don't think they will go down anything like they have been over the last few years. It might even be stable. But I am not underestimating the challenges in Canada with the growth of illicit trade, the continued down trading and reduction in the markets size. Those are very strong head wins in which to grow profits. But I think what we do have in Canada, we now got the DST to where we wanted to be both in terms of its effectiveness and in terms of its cost. We got our cost set at Mexico down to where we want them, so two very good programs. Peter Jackson, which is all value for money brand is going very well in Canada, where we are rolling out of test market John Player Standard which we think has good legs. We've launched Viceroy, low price brand into Ontario. So I think our portfolio is stronger than it has been for four or five years now. So I think we are putting some strong tools against the Canadian situation, but I think we've got a strong head win.</p>

          <p>Well, I think you are still on, markets share declines in Italy and Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean, you're right. I mean, we can't grow market share everywhere in the world, much as we try. And Italy and Mexico are two problems spots for us and you are quite right. The problem that we have in Italy and Mexico is basically on the local brands. Our international brands or global drive brands are doing well there in growing share. It's the heritage brands if you like, that we got issues with. They have been in long term decline for many years and we have done a lot of activity to try and slow and stop that decline. I think it would be foolish to say that we'll stop it but you can rest assure we are focused on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe I can just add an offset thought to that, because we've looked at it quite recently, is that just to be clear off course from a financial perspective the return on investment and EPS has been excellent. So we are disappointed as likely to market share development, but never to the cash and financial terms.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you want to use that mentally, I guess mentally that might be okay, Adam. I mean it really depends on the opportunities that are there and the need to get an acceptable number on the bottom line. So you cannot predict the number. I mean if you look at the level of spend back overall the first five years of the program, it would have been probably slightly less than 50%. But skewed towards the back end it was higher, because there are more opportunities as we've had the role of the global drive brands and did a lot more in terms of direct distribution. So if you want to use that as a guide going forward the next five years, that's fine. But I can't tell you what it's going to be, because it will depend on the opportunities. And as we've always said, the cost side is just to give us the confidence that we can deliver our high single-digit earnings growth, and if we need them for that we will use them for that. So it really depends on any one year, but as a guide I think that's fine if you want to do that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Chris Davidson from Midland Securities. Two questions, with respect to the buyback and the limitation side to keep your credit rating. If I look to interest coverage, it's a very generous amount at the moment and one wonders what the criteria are that limit your ability to make such a long-term demand buyback. And second question, a great part of your success has been driven of premiumization global drive brands, international brands, something over a decade ago this all seems to in cigarette market, was in value for money and everyday low pricing. And I wonder whether you have perceived any kind of strength or limit to your present emphasis on international and global drive brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right if you take the first question as you say that -- first question relates to buybacks, and wanting some more information as our full prices in determining the appropriate level of buyback given the levels of interest cover and our ratings generally. And the second question will relate to the question of premiumization and the question is is there a limit to our ability to continue to grow the premium sector at the expense of value of sales over the next five to ten years. You want to take the ratings firs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. You're right, our interest cover is above the sort of limit we've set ourselves, the range we've set ourselves of five to nine; it was 9.4 for the year. But the two transactions that we've announced we'll bring it down towards the middle of the range. But that's not the thing that the credit rating agencies look at so much these days. I mean we've always said publicly we want to stay in that range of five to nine and we kicked off the share buyback program five years ago, when it sort of got above nine. But the credit rating agencies tend to these days look very much at cash flow as a percentage of net debt. And Moody&#xB4;s specifically look at cash flow after dividends as a percentage of net debt, and as you all know we've been increasing our dividend payout ratio. So the balance sheet from their point of view is not a strong as you might think it is when you look at the interest cover, which is very high.</p>
          <p>And we have decided that we want to target credit rating of BBB+ or BAA1, which is where we are today, that is our long-term target. We think it's prudent to stay that credit rating in today's market; we do need to go into the markets and refinance the acquisition debt over the next sort of 12 to 18 months. I see no problem at all in doing that, but we would like to maintain the strong credit rating that we've got. In order to do that, we think it's necessary to scale back the share buyback program from 750 to &#xA3;400 million. And we've always said in the past that if we did any major acquisitions, we reserve the right to defer a scale back to the share buyback programs. So what we've done is entirely consistent with what we've said, and we've just spent &#xA3;2 billion in one hit on two deals. And from the shareholder perspective, I point out to you that the returns we're going to get on those deals will be far better than returns you would have got on the share buyback. So you'll be way ahead. So you shouldn't worry about it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just say that whoever it was saying it several years ago that total round value for money wasn't us, we've never believed that, and we've always believed in the value of having a balanced portfolio, and we believe that there's more money in driving your share premium globally. The premium segment globally continues to increase and we want an increasing share of an increasing segment, which happens to have high margins. So that's another reason why we spend money at it. So to answer your question, do we see any constraint? Sure, when you're going into a reduced increase in the economic situation globally, that must sort of slightly slow your ability to grow. Having said that, with over 70% of our volume in emerging markets we're still seeing GDB growth in emerging markets, okay, it may come down a point or two but you're still seeing 3, 4, 5% growth in emerging markets. And with that kind of growth, that kind of increase in disposal incomes, people will trade up. So do I see any see constraint? No.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris Wickham from Main First. Just two quickies really. I think at the outset of your chairmanship you said that you could maintain a high single-digit rate of EPS growth organically in the first five years of your model and thereafter you would have in order to maintain that to shift more emphasis on M&amp;A or really on A. Now clearly you've done 12% and that's all been pretty much organic. Are we now looking towards the stage where we should now be seeing that this first couple of deals is part of a significantly greater emphasis on acquisition as we go into the back five? If that is the case, I was wondering perhaps if you could particularize really the contributions to your EPS growth that you're getting from sales or you're going to get from cost savings or you're going to get for M&amp;A. Clearly cost savings <mark type="inaudible" /> we could roughly do that ourselves. And I was wondering if perhaps there is a sort of BAT model that we can look as we get into the next half of these ten years, during the first ten years of your tenure. I don't know. The second one. You look very healthy. And I was wondering also, just on the grounds that you are separating, the revenue synergies as a bonus rather than key financials, should we be expecting a lot of bonus now from Poland?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll just quickly summarize the question and then I guess I should respond to the question. The claim has been made that five years ago or four years ago, when I assumed the chairmanship I suggested that during our first five years we would be able to achieve the high single-digit earnings per share target based essentially on organic growth, but thereafter we would have to rely more on acquisitions; that is the suggestion. I'll comment about it in a second. And the second question relates to revenue synergies.</p>
          <p>And just to pick up the question Chris, listening firstly, I don't actually recall making that statement. I think that we've always said seriously, we've always said that our strategy is clear. We will continue to focus on achieving good quality organic growth in the way that you well understand by focusing on the creation of premium brands, better margins. We've for sometime said we can do that by focusing on productivity and leasing money to reinvest in our brands, you know the model. And I don't think that is going to change. If you look at what we've done over the last four or five years, yes, you are right to point out that that really hasn't relied in any way on mergers and acquisitions. But I've got no reason to suspect that that'll change in the next five years and the fact is that two buses arrived this morning, two London buses arrived this morning at the same time is a sheer coincidence that doesn't in any way suggest a change in thinking.</p>
          <p>I want to emphasis though that we continue to be prepared to buy things if they come around. There is no doubt that Gallaher has being picked by JTI, and Altria have being picked up by Imperial of course. So the big consolidation game is over. But we are still very interested in buying the right businesses if they come along at the right price. But I was very serious when I said earlier I think that there are few things that scare me when from time to time we read in newspapers some chief executive of A or AFD announcing that they've got a bag of money to spend and they are quote, unquote on the acquisition trail. It scares the hell out of me. I mean that is just so dangerous. I think successful acquisition strategy almost your single most important key is to be patient, buy the right thing at the right time. We were lucky to get two good deals in the space of just a few days. Now, we will continue to be patient and if the right things come along at the right price and it makes strategic sense we'll buy; if they don't we won't. But I am quite clear that this business today has got good quality momentum and can generate over the next five years further high single-digit earnings per share growth and we do not need for that to rely on the M&amp;A; I'm quite clear about that.</p>
          <p>Now the second question is I guess all goes to all of you gentlemen, is simply the reference to revenue synergies. Yes, we would never make allowance for the opportunity to obtain revenue synergies when we buy businesses and I guess we'd invite you to comment on what it might mean for us specifically in Poland.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Erik Bloomquist from JPMorgan. Three questions. Firstly on the 2008 outlook, since we've got arguably volumes probably up 1% next year, I'd be curious to your sense on that. Given that we've got quite good organic momentum and with FX being positive next year's spot rates, why should we believe that EPS can grow at low double digits in 2008? Second question is around the cost savings program. I was wondering if the timing of that will be similar to what we saw on the previous program, so back end weighted? Also wondered if you could give us a rough split between overheads and indirects in supply chain. And the third question is related to the South African secondary. Is it fair to assume that if that were done, if would be done in such a way that those shares will be considered local South African shares?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions. The first question relates to the 2008 outlook and suggests that if we would achieve a 1% volume growth and if we would make allowance for a more benign FX environment does it suggest we can do better than say higher single-digits in the current year. Second question relates to cost savings, and Paul is invited to comment on the timing of cost savings whether they would be back ended as indeed was the case in the first five-year program. And thirdly, I will comment briefly on the potential secondary listing of our shares in Johannesburg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, volumes. Let me just talk about volumes for a minute. To answer your question succinctly, I think, we will see volume growth overall this year probably around 0.5%, so not 1 to 1.5%, and we see volume growth slowing. The number of reasons for that, some are just the regulatory pressures, but frankly, it's much more to do with our end strategies. Last year we declined by 1% in overall volume, but we increased premium by 3%. We increased value for money by 3% and we lost low price volume; low price volume declined by 7%. Now there are trade-offs between volume and taking price increases and putting your resources behind premium. And whilst we never like losing volume if there is a better trade-off to go for price increases and focus behind premium, we'll take it. The key focus for us is net revenue growth. And we've got good net revenue growth in 2007 despite an overall decline in volume. So I'm not that bothered about what our volume growth is. I am very bothered about revenue growth. And I think we have the flexibility particularly by focusing on premium and to some extent value for money in achieving it. I think that answers your question and explains the sort of volume growth equation. I understand your assumptions, and our earnings guidance is medium to long term on average, so what may happen in anyone particular year, I'll let you guess that.</p>

          <p>Paul, do you want to comment on cost savings and timing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think you should assume it's fairly evenly split. I mean the various components of the cost savings program will be sort of more front-ended. Some of the reorganizational savings should come through in the early years. But some of the back office, IT, shared services savings, I would think will be more towards the later years. And supply chain type savings should be fairly evenly split but, that's a very rough guide and we don't intend to split it into overheads and indirects. And supply chain, like we've done, is just one productivity program. We don't have the same sort of sensitivity about announcing the supply chain target as we did at the beginning of the five-year program. That's why you've just got one big overall target today. I think, perhaps, there'll probably be more savings in the supply chain areas than the overheads and indirects, if you want to rough guide but that's pretty, pretty rough.</p>

          <p>Third, Erik asked to comment on a potential secondary listing of British American Tobacco shares in Johannesburg. And the question was whether for South African exchange control purposes it might be consolidated to be quote local shares because it has an impact on who may or may not be allowed to hold them. Almost as a bit of an aside, let me tell you that I believe that in last week's South African budget, the Finance Minister announced proposed changes on the foreign exchange regulations which as I understand it,  were very largely due away with the current distinctions on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange between foreign shares and local shares. But that's a little bit of an aside and don't quote me and please do you own research, if you don't mind me saying so, because it's actually just something I picked up on the newswires.</p>
          <p>My real answer to your question is this: The potential of restructuring, really is their restructuring is not our restructuring. They'll talk about this in more detail if and when they're ready to do so. And I think we should respect that. All that I would say to you is understand why people from time to time are somewhat concerned about what RNI may or may not do. I don't know what they may or may not do. But they are big shareholders; they own 30% of our company. They've been big shareholders for a long time and I'm <mark type="inaudible" /> trust that they're not about to go and do something which hurts our share, which hurts the value of their investment in this company. So that may not be a very satisfactory answer to people who are wondering exactly what are these that they may end up doing and when they are may not doing it. But we are quite relaxed about that. We think that it's not logical for us to fear that they may do anything which is not in the interest of this company long-term so I'll leave it on that basis.</p>

          <p>Julian Hardwick with ABN AMRO. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about the cost environment <mark type="inaudible" /> and particularly in relation to <mark type="inaudible" /> perceived generally and how that flows through to leaf; are you seeing any signs that the farmers are actually returning to <mark type="inaudible" /> other things other than tobacco leaf and what's the upward pressure, is that <mark type="inaudible" /> could you just talk a little bit general regards cost inflation for the Group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the question for the webcast, about cost inflation and particularly the question relates to the current inflation in agricultural products more generally and whether we believe that may or may not impact on the cost of leaf going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are right. I mean leaf costs are picking up a little bit and &#x2013; they will come through in terms of higher inflation in 2008. It's probably the main commodity that is affecting us right now, in term of cost increases. I guess our level inflation overall for the group for the year was probably 3, 3.5% for 2007. I think because of the leaf cost increases that could go up to 4% or more for 2008 and could even be higher for 2009. Because usually get a deferment, I mean higher leaf cost issue usually comes from the P&amp;L the next year. And we are seeing at the beginning of the season quite higher leaf cost that should come through next year. So that's the main thing that's affecting us in terms of commodity cost increases. The other things all seem quite fine. And of course, we would intend to recover those cost increases in terms of price, because we're the price leader in about 50 markets around the world. But it is giving us some pressure. That's right.</p>

          <p>It's Nick Almaris from Merrill Lynch. Just want to get back to your comment of reinvesting some of the cost savings. Could I assume that the -- what are the projects you referred to in this reinvestment with all the projects that would make business center and give you payback of standalone? And if you didn't have the cost savings, you could have gone ahead with the increase marketing spend or efficiency improvements in the back office. As Jan said earlier, it scares him when someone's sitting with a pot of money and he wants to make acquisitions. Could I assume that the increased cost savings is not the reason for those investments?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>You mean, because we have got the money, we will spend it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We don't do that. Surprisingly enough. We actually like to see if we can get value from the amount of money that we spend. And that is carefully controlled, particularly around marketing. We have a number of systems in place where we are able to predict the kind of returns that we will get from incremental marketing expenditure and once we spent the money we go back and review whether it achieved, what we thought it will achieve. Now, I have to tell you this is marketing right, not everyone is a winner, but most of them are. But there are other things that we spent money on. We are frankly -- shareholders have to decide whether you fill that that is a value to the company. If we spent money in shaping the regulatory environment going forward, there isn't a payback on that that you could put on a spreadsheet. Is that how shareholders think we should be spending our money. If we are spending money on R&amp;D trying to develop reduced harm products. I can't guarantee you there is a payback on that. But I would strongly recommend that that's something we should be doing. We are doing test markets on snus around the world to see whether we can grow snus. And when we do the test markets, we learn and then we fix and then we learn again and we fix it again, and we try and create consumer demand among smokers for those products. I can't guarantee you a payback on that. But I think it's something that we should be doing and may present value for the shareholders in the long-term. But then everything that we do, we believe there is value to the company and value to shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does it make sense, when we modeled your company to link these spending I refer to then to the cost savings at all on those decisions made independently from whatever cost of savings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know the modeling we work to. I mean, that everybody want, thinks that, we've run this business on a spreadsheet and it is all done by ratios and as per we organized we did, but there is no phrase, if you want to make God laugh tell him your plans. And I mean, we have -- as you remember, we have the bad stuff, we have the stuff that we want to invest in and we have the cost savings and anyone here we're trying to balance the stuff that's coming out is and the stuff we want to invest in because we think it will return value, in anyone year we're managing that. And if we get less bad stuff, we don't see the opportunity to spend, it drops through the bottom line. We get more bad stuff or there some really big opportunities, the less we'll drop to the bottom line. So I understand, when you say, we want to know where these cost savings going to fall year-by-year and if you had your way, you want to know it by quarter and how much is going to be spend back year-by-year by quarter preferably, and how much is supply chain and how much is going to be overheads. It doesn't work that way.</p>

          <p>And not so much a question. My apologies for the webcast <mark type="inaudible" />. And obviously Paul Rayner this is your last results meeting, about which we're all very sad, and on that obviously can't, we back to when you're actually pointed back in when the announcement came out in June 2001. And I remember when bringing Ralph is was without doubt the from of all information and knowledge on BAT past and present and sometimes future every good launch, and ask him to what's its played like to which the answer was, I've never had been. Now we all like to go into the next that was a bit scary for a while. Unfortunately by the some you are right not only was the share price up 10%, we found out little bit, little about you. Obviously we got many things to thank you for. First when you were on obviously the architect, the buyback program by crafting that clever net interest cover ratio, which you just happened to exceed straight away, so that was good. And you increased disclosures, we could find out exactly how much that <mark type="inaudible" /> to British American racing is to cost.</p>
          <p>We negotiated Reynolds American and of course you got involved in the cost cutting program where I understand revealing the name of <mark type="inaudible" />. For the purpose of the webcast I won't say what you want to add it on the front of that and particularly anticipate in kind of way. We've got much to thank you for. We will miss you much and we wish you the very best for the future.</p>
