          <p>Welcome to Enel Interim Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Now let me hand over to the CFO, Luigi Ferraris for the presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our presentation on the first half 2008 results. On the -- numbers that I'll comment today, you will see a robust growth in the domestic and international activities, together with significant level of debt reduction. Then our CEO, Fulvio Conti will make some closing remarks. Q&amp;A session will follow.</p>
          <p>As for the agenda, first, I will take you through our overall financial results. Then you will have some specific details on each of our division. The annexes will provide you with additional relevant details.</p>
          <p>First, some financial highlights on chart number two. Group EBITDA increases by 66%, driven by the consolidation of Endesa, the solid performance of the domestic operation and the increasing contribution of other international activities, mainly Slovenske Elektrarne. Without the contribution of Endesa, EBITDA grows by 15%.</p>
          <p>Group net income, grows by about 44% to almost &#x20AC;2.8 billion also due to tax rate decrease, which I will comment in the next chart.</p>
          <p>Group net debt reduction reflects the completion of the -- E.ON. Later on, I will give also better details about this.</p>
          <p>Now on chart number two, our set of numbers starting from EBIT down to net income. First, let me tell you that the circled numbers did not take into account the impact of the Endesa as you see <mark type="inaudible" /> purchase price allocation, which will be affected by year end. Nevertheless, the asset disposals to E.ON reduced Endesa's goodwill by almost &#x20AC;4.2 billion.</p>
          <p>EBIT increases by 69% thanks to EBITDA improvement, which has been partially offset by the effects of a lower fair value of Viesgo. Without the contribution of Endesa, EBIT grows by 11.3%.</p>
          <p>Our net financial charges amount to &#x20AC;1,446 million. This is the net effect of the following. First, higher interest charges for &#x20AC;1,543 million, this is mainly due to the resulting net debt position following the acquisition of Endesa, OGK-5 and Muntenia. Our cost of debt is equal to an average of 5.2%. For a better understanding, let me just remind you that the 35 basis points valuation of interest rates will imply the &#x20AC;60 million valuation of our interest charge.</p>
          <p>Second, higher interest resulting from the fair value valuation over CRF reduction.</p>
          <p>Group's tax rates has gone down from 36.4% to 21.2%, as the net results of the following: higher taxes from carrying the interest income of &#x20AC;96 million for domestic generation sales facilities as a consequence of the new fiscal law, higher net reserve taxes of &#x20AC;150 million, the gain from the domestic generation of sales activities as a consequence of the new fiscal law.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we have decided to take advantage of 2008 financial law which provides by paying a special tax so called in cost of substitute event, a specific option in order to eliminate temporary difference between the accounting and the fiscal carry amount of assets,that starts differentiating for extra accounting purposes.</p>
          <p>The difference between the deferred taxes reduced in the past and released to the profit and loss, and the above mentioned special tax is equal to &#x20AC;800 million. The compound effect of this is a reduction of income taxes for amounts of almost &#x20AC;555 million. The normalized tax rate for the other year stand in the region of 34, 35%.</p>
          <p>Now on chart number four, our EBITDA evolution. As you can see this chart shows an increase in EBITDA in all of our divisions. But before moving to a specific division, let me keep your attention to EBITDA growth on chart number five.</p>
          <p>Generation and sales activities increased from 58% to 59% of total Group EBITDA. With this respect, our strategy of selling forward is becoming more and more crucial to secure margins. As for network division, current result confirm the robust capability of generating stable cash flow through efficiency product.</p>
          <p>In the following chart let me be more specific on our hedging strategy in particular our forward electricity sales. As far as Italy is concerned, our 2008 domestic production is already 100% hedged while we are already over 80% hedged for 2009 and 40% on 2010. Latest sale campaign has been at &#x20AC;160 per megawatt hour of baseload price.</p>
          <p>As far as Enel is concerned, 2008 domestic production is already 70% hedged, while we are already 35% hedged for 2009. In Slovakia, 2008 domestic production is already 90% hedged while we are already 40% hedged for 2009 and 10% on 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the domestic generation and energy market division on chart number seven. The increase in the generation margins equals to &#x20AC;165 million, thanks to the following. &#x20AC;149 million due to the contribution of higher unit margin driven by the positive effects of price and generation mix, &#x20AC;16 million due to higher margin in the ancillary service market despite the decrease in the relative revenues of &#x20AC;120 million. This is due to effect of utilization of our plant portfolio.</p>
          <p>Additional items are minus &#x20AC;46 million of gas trading activities due to lower volumes coupled with lower prices and plus &#x20AC;37 million of the fair value of bilateral contract with a single buyer and commodities.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a quick look at the fuel cost evolution on chart number eight. Net of ancillary service, the unit margin in the domestic thermal generation market is increasing from &#x20AC;36.6 per megawatt hour to 38.5. In particular our coal and shipping strategy is a significant source of strengths for the group and our current procurement portfolio assumptions secured the major growth of our mid-term sourcing requirement.</p>
          <p>For 2008, we have already secured 100% of our coal products and 90% of our shipment requirements. For 2009, we have already secured 80% of our core -- and 60% of our shipping requirement. On an average total discounts versus spot market of $60 per ton.</p>
          <p>Moving on to chart number nine on domestic market division. EBITDA totals &#x20AC;291 million versus &#x20AC;100 million for the first half 2007. This is the cumulative effects of the following. First an increase of &#x20AC;80 million in the electricity regulated markets due to tariff revision. Second, the increase of &#x20AC;96 million in the contribution of the free market, mainly thanks to the following, higher electricity margin for &#x20AC;117 million basically due to higher volumes sold and the positive contribution of the forward selling strategy, higher gas volumes for &#x20AC;3 million, and other for minus &#x20AC;24 million.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 10 or domestic infrastructure and network division. EBITDA totals &#x20AC;2008 million, representing an increase of &#x20AC;236 million versus 2007. This is the net effect of the following. First, the improvement of &#x20AC;215 million in the electricity business, mainly thanks to higher energy margin <mark type="inaudible" /> non-recurring items of &#x20AC;114 million. Cost saving for &#x20AC;62 million. Second, the decrease of &#x20AC;17 million in the gas business, despite the increase in volumes, more than offset by the non-recurring items posted in the first half 2007.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 11, on international operation. EBITDA totals &#x20AC;580 million, representing an increase of &#x20AC;136 million versus 2007. This is the cumulative effect of the following. The strong contribution of the rest of Centrel for &#x20AC;81 million. In particular first half 2008 EBITDA of this company equal to &#x20AC;432 million was posted by higher domestic energy margins and higher volumes sold. This positive results will continue all throughout 2008 since 90% of the rest of Centrel output has been already sold forward.</p>
          <p>The positive impact of &#x20AC;41 million due to higher price and higher volumes in Russia, a positive income of &#x20AC;3 million also reached seven for the positive contribution of OGK-5 consolidation.</p>
          <p>Before moving on to following division, a quick look on the Russian activities on chart number. 10 -- 12. First, let me remind you that EBITDA has seen improving results just for single month. In the first half 2008, OGK-5 reported an EBITDA of &#x20AC;72 million that represents a 20% increase from the like-for-like basis versus last year.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the chart, electricity price net of capacity payment is up by more than 18% versus last year. This confirms that the revaluation process of the Russian markets and the alignment of these prices to the European average level is stable according to government agenda.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 13 on Iberia &amp; Latam division. EBITDA totals &#x20AC;2,436 million representing an increase of &#x20AC;2,251 million mainly thanks to the consolidation of Endesa for &#x20AC;2,366 million.</p>
          <p>Let's just talk on Endesa results on chart number 14. EBITDA was over &#x20AC;3,487 million representing an increase of &#x20AC;262 million versus the first half of 2007. This growth has been posted by a wireless contribution of Iberia and Latin America.</p>
          <p>In particular, in Iberia, growth has seen an increase as higher fuel price and average note sectors versus the rest of the market and a more efficient commodity cost base.</p>
          <p>For the whole, the numbers reported and we recorded taking into account conservative approach for 2007 COD will be equal to &#x20AC;230 million. In Latin America, higher power prices and improved distribution margin posted in Endesa EBITDA by a 10%, versus first half 2007. With regards to synergy profit, the company has already reached 75% of the target for 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving on to chart number 15. Take a look at EBITDA of the service and all bigger area which stand at &#x20AC;64 million, this means &#x20AC;37 million half versus the first half 2007 this is basically due to the following, first, higher margin on imports for &#x20AC;31 million and other minor items for &#x20AC;6 million.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt evolution is concerned on chart number 15, you'll see that the overall net debt spend of &#x20AC;51.5 billion including the net debt relating to Endesa Europa business. The evolution of the debt level is mainly due to the impact of extraordinary activities and in particular the sale of the Endesa Europe and Viesgo, E.ON which counts for &#x20AC;8.4 billion, and the acquisition of 22.6% of OGK-5 and Muntenia which counts for &#x20AC;1.2 million. Moreover, we can rely on debt maturity profile, which gives us a clear financial stability until 2012. During a year, we expect to bring our consolidated net debt below &#x20AC;50 billion.</p>
          <p>And now on chart number 17, let me focus your attention on renewables. Installed capacity, as of June the 30 2008, is 3269 megawatts versus 2825 the last year, which means an increase of 15.7%. In the production it's equal to almost 7 gigawatt-hours versus 6.1. EBITDA totals &#x20AC;441 million versus 436. And first half 2008 domestic EBITDA includes some negative non-recurring items for the total amount of &#x20AC;49 million related to 2007 regulatory adjustment. Net of these items first half 2008 EBITDA stands at &#x20AC;474 million Euro growth of 13% on a like-for-like basis.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and now I'd hand over to Fulvio Conti for some closing remarks.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to you all. I hope that you have listened to what Luigi has been telling you, because I have a terrible connection on my side. So I really hope that you can hear us loud and clear.</p>
          <p>I want to just to summarize what Luigi was saying with few words about our future outlook. You see that we have delivered a very strong set in first half results for the Group, which has come above expectations at least above market expectations, not mine expectations.</p>
          <p>And on the back of this I anticipated that consolidated EBITDA for 2008 will be well above your current market consensus, which is today 13.3 billion. But, not only this. I do expect that for 2009, we'll be well above the target stated in London up 13.8 billion, natural -- not strategic natural disposals.</p>
          <p>We now see our outlook of future much better than March and we will be in a position to come out this -- the inception of the new plant.</p>
          <p>Now we are ready take on questions. Please, make your voice heard to us.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first participant speaking is Mr. Alberto Gonzalez from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Good morning. It's Alberto Gonzalez UBS. The line isn't great so indeed. I have three questions on my side, please. The first question relates to slide seven, you are showing your forward sell. Could you please elaborate on the top line for moment? Can you elaborate on the spark and dark spreads you expect for 2009 and 10 in comparison to 2008? And could you talk about same thing referring to Spain not just to the Italian market?</p>
          <p>So could you compare this on both sides? Second question is about disposals, could you please elaborate on where we stand on networks and renewable? And can you also talk about parameter, why don't you try to implement an early breakup of the Endesa with Axion it seems to be mutually convenient to the two shareholders.</p>
          <p>You would have full control over Endesa and anyway the market already discounted for the size of the cash put option, so where do we stand on this? And lastly you have commented on the EBITDA target which you gave in London but you also gave an EPS target. Can you -- could you elaborate on that please as well. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me start with the disposal and I'll ask Luigi to answer your first question. On disposal, we are obviously working with Endesa to increase the level of pricing expectation that we can get out of high voltage network. And to that effect we think we  head out a favorable interpretation of the associated relative tariffs available to the high grid voltage network to support our case for more price in our negotiation with them. I feel &#x2013; I still feel very confident about it.</p>
          <p>The timing it's in our hand because if we create no agreement on our special price we have open an option and there are already enough of interested parties willing to jump on that valuable assets. So, I do see that coming anyhow in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the group, of gas distribution, we can wait for the new regulatory regime, where it's under evaluation by the regulator. And I am confident over that available, the value won't be enhanced and we will be reassessed the business case for gas development. So, I'm feeling comfortable on this situation waiting for the supports of new regulation.</p>
          <p>What is important though, what Luigi has mentioned to you that we have managed our cash flow and working capital reduction that we are going to apply irrespective whether we got ourselves the overall <mark type="inaudible" /> which we will be. We are going to get below the 50 billion  mark by year-end as promised and guaranteed. So I still feel very comfortable on my leverage. I hate to speak about something that is now happening like your questions on the Spanish market.</p>
          <p>And I am happy with the situation that we see today. We see the company Endesa performing very well irrespective of all of the daggerings of different opinions especially at the board level and the management of the company continues to be very focused. I'm very pleased with what working any scheme. The results are speaking for themselves. I think this will be something that I can keep one in for -- and if there will be opportunities in the future, we will examine in due course and in a friendly basis. For the time being we're happy with the way we are working on that. Well, Luigi on the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, when it comes to the spark spread and dark spread in Italy. Today for the 2008, we foresee the spark spreads in the region of &#x20AC;25.3 per megawatt hour, I'm referring to the market of course and 37.1 in terms of dark spreads. When in it comes to euro this year of course these spark spreads will be better, we are talking about value higher than &#x20AC;35 per megawatt hour and they are in the region 41, when it comes to the dark.</p>
          <p>If you want our objection for 2009, 2010, of course, it will depend on the commodity price evolution, but as I said during my presentation, since most of the concept that we already secured on the coal side, we believe to maintain this competitive advantage for the upcoming year as well. When it comes to Spain situation is a little bit for the system the spark spread is in the region of 22 to &#x20AC;24 per megawatt hour, while the coal is lower than in Italy is in the region of &#x20AC;31 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>Now, of course, if we look at this, when it comes to Endesa, we have to take into account the extremely competitive source that Endesa has and therefore the spark spread especially for Endesa in this year will be higher than 25, &#x20AC;26 per megawatt hour and we expect to confirm that those in the coming years. But the spark is a little bit different, the coal system, the coal power plant system in Spain is most efficient generally speaking than the one we're building here in Italy. Therefore the dark spread is lower than in Italy. But of course, since we are planning Endesa to increase our combined cycle capacity, we think we are in a good shape to maintain and improve our profitability.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, in EPS ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>The next question is from <mark type="inaudible" /> with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry Matthias, but before your answer -- before you -- so your question referring to EPS. And for Alberto, Alberto, EBITDA is going to grow as it's going to be growing and I guarantee that to you, EPS will grow accordingly. I mean, if the tax rate you've heard is around 34% and therefore you can easily calculate it. As soon as you will know what EBITDA level will be and it will be quite above the level of -- a much. Even in the same speed and direction. Matthias?.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. Well, congratulations on the results. I have two questions on the numbers. Now, one is on hydro, you stated you had a better hydro in the second quarter compared to last year. But I remember for the last couple of years Enel has had pretty poor hydro.</p>
          <p>I wanted to know whether the hydro levels that we had in the first half according to you is in line with the historical average, above, below the last 10-year, 30-year average, have they made any consideration. Second question on the purchase price allocation for Muntenia and Endesa. So you don't have yet any purchase price allocation on your addition depreciation spend for Endesa. How much could the yearly impact be, once you allocate additional depreciation for these three acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matthias on the first question, even though my wife keeps telling me that is really too much. We already have 92% over 30-year historical average. One is good and we have more snowfalls, which by now are being used in the reservoirs, the basins. And therefore it is leading us for the potential uplift during summer time. So overall it's been kind of average over the last 30 years, even though they are slightly on the lower side. But definitely much better than the last couple of years. Luigi would you take the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the purchase price allocation, as I said during presentation a year ago that we would finalize the purchase price allocation of Endesa by year-end. You know that we basically have a 12 months' time to summarize this process. Therefore the numbers you see detailed over year do not includes the impact of these additional depreciation. Now, clearly, we are not yet finalized this process, but we do not expect to have additional depreciation higher than 300, 400 million Euro in total, once we are going to finalize the purchase price allocation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from <mark type="inaudible" /> from ABN AMRO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi yes good morning everybody. I have three questions please, on the EBITDA guidance you talked in London at 13.8 and I think on the first quarter numbers you also gave a generation EBITDA target ex the fair value adjustments to 3.4. Could you just tell us where you are now in terms of guidance both of the Group and for generation for 2008 in view of those comments? And second question given the tax break in the first half and those higher EBITDA figures, whether or not you think that you might be in a position to pay more the net rigid $0.49 dividend.</p>
          <p>Whether you have flexibility to do that or whether that 49 is an absolute number come what may. And my third question is about nuclear, I think Italian government has said that they are not prepared to give public finance for a nuclear build in Italy. Could you just say at this point what your latest thoughts are on how realistic a nuclear build is in Italy and how Enel will do in this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, nuclear, let me start with reverse order. We -- and are definitely optimistic about -- optimistic about the government report. Nuclear should be back into Italy. I am optimistic to say that -- I see the government willing to issue pretty soon legislation to play with that kind of reconciliation with new technology. I could say that Enel's ready because as you know we have been since two years working back into the nuclear activities and could probably in France where the agreement will be in the building in some EPR plants, obviously we also have the privilege of looking into the Spanish nuclear American Westinghouse Technology.</p>
          <p>So, we have quite long list of young and old engineer mix, we need engineer with the nuclear back -- probably elated to jump on board in Italy. If we can get the proper legislation I am still confident on the timeframe, we can take advantage of some of the potential sites available to build that into nuclear activities in Italy in the next few years. My recollection is that these trend can be done with any major significant financial distress, can be financed, the evidence of nuclear being more convenient than gas when it comes to overall cost. It's supporting any potential financing of those trends.</p>
          <p>And as you know Italy is already in nuclear activity, that we do import about 15 to 20% of electricity out of France, Switzerland, Slovenia which are nuclear based. But in spite of that I cannot be more precise about timing, venues and sites so understand I need to know exactly what kind of legislation the government will be issuing in near future. The only thing that I know they are adamant on the point and I am very pleased with that.</p>
          <p>Therefore our results are going to be significantly higher than the one we were commented to you in the recent past. We see few 100 millions of incremental EBITDA accounting during the year and carrying through the 2009 results. So the implication of that we are going to have higher net income at the end. So, if your question is that, could we pay more dividends, no doubt we could.</p>
          <p>Do we need to do it. I committed to $0.49 minimum and I am sticking to that point at the moment. And as you know in my press released I'm saying that I am going to ask for authority to the board, next board on the 11th of September to start confirming advance payment of 10%. Today, today $0.49 is the exceptional 8% yield. I think this is more than enough to justify that $0.49 of the base. Future will tell whether we need to increase, but I don't think we need to. We are now in need of showing capital gains as opposed to just increases. They do not give revenue in the place assets or am I missing something..</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Yes, as I recall at the end of March, we -- I said that we were expecting for the full year for generation of the margin, the management &#x20AC;2.4 billion of EBITDA, of course this is confirmed. In that we should expect a fair improvements in the region of couple hundred million Euro by year-end. And then we have a chance to the group EBITDA expected results; I can only basically confirm what others have said a few minutes ago.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. Just a few detail, can you specify this forward -- the price we are getting on your forward sales in Italy on average in '09 and '10. And basically if you can give a little bit of detail in the chart you had assumption and commodity on -- embedded in your guidance for 2009. The other question is on Uni&#xF3;n Fenosa Renovables -- after the accrual of Uni&#xF3;n Fenosa, you tend to be interested in buying the 50% of Uni&#xF3;n Fenosa?</p>
          <p>The other point is that -- if you elaborate ITR, if you can just update on the timing. And finally, if you can repeat your point of discussion on Acciona -- with Acciona, which will be your best case scenario for the good solution of the situation? And which is your take on the potential tender offer for minority of Endesa. Thank you. Sorry, last question, CapEx, can you just update on the CapEx level, you expect on 2008 and 2009? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Many different questions Antonella. Good morning. On the Acciona, I'm not going to repeat what I just said. And I confirm to you we'll continue to give project review as the development planning Endesa, the way it is. And we will discuss any different posture if needed and that's sort of trending we're happy with the way. When it comes to Fenosa, we are busily addressing the movement, to address natural way towards Fenosa and there opens the opportunity. We are very happy with the Uni&#xF3;n Fenosa Renovables.</p>
          <p>And Uni&#xF3;n Fenosa Renovables is doing very well. And if there is an opportunity to -- in conjunction with the changes in the control of company we may consider taking on the entire state of that company. No doubt, leaves us an opportunity for us. And for the time being, we are just watching what is going on out there. When it comes to two different questions, I will ask Luigi to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, we were to the first question, obviously the price to work on average in that in the sense that we already advanced further. So, let me say this Antonella, of course, as you know our policy is frankly coming from services on the rolling basis. Therefore, we build our backlog on the day-by-day. As of today our average backlog price for 2009-2010 in the division of the &#x20AC;85 per megawatt hour just on average. The last sales campaign that we have done is higher than 105, it's basically equal to &#x20AC;106 per megawatt hour as I said during the presentation.</p>
          <p>Of course, the commodity scenario behind describes -- if the commodity scenario at the moment we are basically served. And we said that it seems 85% of the price are fixed as I said in the presentation, most of the sourcing particularly on cost side in Italy secured because of all the long term cost, but again, I take also that our expected European margin is going to increase in the coming years. And therefore, we are building a backlog with the higher profitability.</p>
          <p>Your second question is much longer -- we also referred to the -- was the expected CapEx in 2008, 09 and 10. Now when it comes to 2008, we expect to have, let say, lower profits in the region of the almost &#x20AC;1 billion versus the &#x20AC;8 expected according to London presentation. With regards to 2009 and 2010, we confirm what we said in London, which is &#x20AC;8 billion basically on average per annum -- for 2009 and 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonella, I missed your answer about your <mark type="inaudible" /> but on the CapEx before I move into that, let me tell you she should have seen some really important step forward and our strengthening in the Italian market with the indication of Civitavecchia coal plant. And opens up the route developed for the Coca-Cola plants and then opens up to Ministry of Environmental Affairs regards.</p>
          <p>So things are finally moving in that direction -- we are pleased to report that to you. And when it comes to the renewables we are not resting on summer. We continue to bundle up all the renewables and <mark type="inaudible" />. This would be achieved with and the inception through contribution into our company that we might be calling Enel Green Power, but the related things would be for December 1, up and running on its entire portfolio of assets and that would mean that we might be having by the year-end full year of results available within the group on that company that can be a few effectively taken as a base for prospectus and information, or around potentially during summer time next year. That's what we are working on at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes. Good morning. First of all, a follow-up on Antonella's question, if you can just clarify the change in the your CapEx guidance for 2008, and to walk that a little further, then also you mentioned that Porto Tolle, I was wondering if are you still 100% convinced that you would like to ahead to go ahead with Porto Tolle maybe also in the context of the news on nuclear in Italy?</p>
          <p>Then different question, maybe an update on your best maturity for Sira and is facility maturing in the next 12 months. And the lastly, your view on the timing and size of synergies associated within Endesa, any change compared with the guidance that you gave us at the end of last year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no major changes on the Endesa guidance, company again continues to develop which, which is very healthy and on time and I see no changes. When it comes to CapEx of Porto Tolle I've seen no different posture on CapEx I mean we are ending all the quarters that we are looking and  coal is still very, very attractive to us with the announcement in EN and the reason why these are attractive is embedded with the numbers that we just been meant to hear about dark spreading even including what we are working for the future development and top and taxation registration and they will be good for our CO2 allocation, so also part of our strategy for coal.</p>
          <p>If you -- think about replacing coal with nuclear I would say that there is no replacement, I mean there is need for all technologies and that's why we got the best strategy which is paying off for all of us. That's the reason why I'm switching directly or getting to work and I will redouble the effort to get a quick as providing of the permission in the Porto Tolle  case. What am I missing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yes -- that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yeah no major changes, in terms of maturity profile we confirm what we said in -- the next  due date will be 2010. And we are confident to respect through the disposal program that we have in place until they are creating stronger falls which is by the way giving us -- we believe more than 1 billion this year additional available for sure, for sure. So I think we are in good shape there. When it comes to CapExs, I obviously said we confirm our investment plan in the course in this year in particular we are going to there probably unless CapEx, which are not compromising the growth in the expected EBITDA, it will be the result of some minor delays and mainly also the efficiency recovery in the natural business we of course we are fine tuning our, our CapEx plan according to the new regulation.</p>
          <p>So I won't see any major changes there, and with this respect I see only optimization.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question is on the ratings, you have a negative outlook for Moody's and S&amp;P. So, are you comfortable with a low A rating, and what are you going to do to maintain that rating, because are you going to reduce CapEx or stop dividends or what is the discussion going on with the agencies?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on asset disposal I already commented that we continue to negotiate on the basis of figures which is available on the disclosure on the -- my expectations of that would be &#x20AC;1.5 billion and that would be more than enough to bring us down below the level of 50 billion in and even including for something -- on the management of the working capital. Therefore we are delivering the expected reduction on the, under that, and that we have guaranteed during the March presentation.</p>
          <p>There will be no real funding needs, although we are not going to be in a market unless there, there are opportunities to refinance subject in advance of the maturities which will be in 2010, 2012, but for the time being we are really proud that no significant plan for need of refinancing.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the rating agency we have recently confirmed our single A ratings and we'll continue to monitor our ratios sticking with them in advance of any potential movement that we don't see and therefore I am feeling very comfortable with that we will be maintaining the single A rating for the next foreseeable future. Next question please.</p>

          <p>The next question is <mark type="inaudible" /> Javier from JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Its <mark type="inaudible" /> Javier from JP Morgan. Most of my questions have already been addressed but probably the -- and the last remaining two questions would be firstly, which is your deal on a special dividend to be paid by Endesa, do you think that it makes more sense for Endesa to keep the cash from the disposal of assets to E.ON in the balance sheet until the situation with Acciona is clear in the next few months, or do you still believe that Endesa should be paying a special dividend on these -- on the capital gains of the disposal? And the second question is regarding your strategy, your marketing strategy in Italy.</p>
          <p>As you have said that the forward prices have strengthen significantly and you said that the last round of sales were made at &#x20AC;106 per megawatt. Would you contemplate considering that you are also significantly hedging in fuel cost, would you contemplate selling at discount to wholesale prices also in order to minimize the political risk of another Robin Hood tax or another one of decision by the Italian government? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are not running the company on hedging on risk on a government. We're running the company on the -- on a assumption that we have to extract most valuable pricing in the market that we can. We'll continue to deliver what we can to maximize our profits overall and the supply. We can demonstrate that we are able to deliver on that basis.</p>
          <p>When it comes to your first question on cash dividend, I'm neutral. I'm truly consolidating my 67%, so 67% of our money and where it stays in Endesa in my cash flow -- cash is staying here, is still mine, so I don't really have any worry or concern about it. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. <mark type="inaudible" /> from Cazenove.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen, I have a couple questions. One is related to the CO2 emission if you can give us the cost in the first half? And if you can give us the further if you use from CRs and if you're planning to use some in the second half since you have a big availability on that. And the second question is Luigi, if you can comment on the decision by the authority to exclude some power plants in Sicily and Sardinia from the ancillary service market. What kind of the impact do you expect from that? And if you can give us a flavor on your expectation on this market, if it change compared to what you were expecting some months ago? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I missed the second question, but let me answer some of the others. I'll ask Luigi to address the CO2 emission and cost. Sicily it's a very, it's a very funny place. The decision that the authorities were always taking was indicating to take,  has not been taken as a risk, it is based on a fundamental mistake, fundamental mistake, that all power plants in Sicily are the same, which is not a case.</p>
          <p>There are only couple of places where you can see the plant being depending, important for the maintenance of the grid transmission system. One is the plant of company Torrevaldaliga and other -- <mark type="inaudible" />, the rest of the plants are obviously selling into, they have their markets.</p>
          <p>So we will be contrasting this because it is a false technical assumption that has been taken by the regulator maybe incorrect information received from Terna. But everything is more of a principle than of substance. I do want to have respect on the principle, so I will fight against their decision anyhow. Again, second question including cash -- on CO2, please Luigi?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah sure. In the first half 2008 we basically were in a bad luck position. We have just little surplus. Therefore, we had no charge. Our location are being to cover our emission. And we expect to be in the same position for the full year. Of course as you know we have a huge backlog of certificates, which allow us to have an average cost lower than ten Euro for example. Therefore, we think that there are no major issues on this side and we think we are in a good shape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the last question was about the <mark type="inaudible" /> difficult market. You explained that your margins went up despite the decrease in the revenues. So if you can elaborate a bit on this perspective on this market compared with what you had in the past month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As I said if I compare with the net revenues of this year versus last year, we had a decrease in terms of total revenues of &#x20AC;120 million, whilst we had the same profitability or even higher as I said during the presentation. Now we have been able to reach this result because we have reduced our production cost.</p>
          <p>So we have used or managed the portfolio of assets serving this market, let's say the more efficient way than last year and therefore we've balanced the prices with the cost reduction. And I think that this trend will continue in the second half of the year as well</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>The last question is from Suarez Javier from Dresdner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Sorry for being the very last question on 1st of August. A couple of questions, if I may, the first one is on an update on the guidance regarding your debt by the year-end. I think that the CFO has said that the level of debt should be below 15 -- &#x20AC;50 billion. I was wondering if you could be more specific on debt target and give us an update on the level of debt with which you feel comfortable with in the next few years.</p>
          <p>And the second question regarding the debt structure too. We have seen that the average cost of debt is 5.3%. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the number for the cost of debt that you have on your budget for the year 2008 and 2009? And finally, the debt structure sources have 50-50% structure, which is fixed and variable borrowing. Can you give us an update on which is going to be evolution of this percentage going forward? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when it comes to debt by year-end, I keep repeating what I just said. The number would be below 50 billion irrespective of our potential disposal of asset that we have -- that we are working on. Obviously, it could be also selling assets and it would be regular assets should be -- the level of debt that we expect is the level that we have committed to the community in March, and my view will always be in the region of Single A, A plus, A minus, the maximum volatility that I can support, and accept.</p>
          <p>Therefore, I see really this not be an overall issue. The currency view 5.3% is the average. It's a 1,000 average valued goods we sold, let me say, borrowing in the Latin  America and then we are <mark type="inaudible" /> some financial expense is even earlier.  So, it's not indication on the overall cost.

          <p>I hope this answers to all of you, your basis points, if there will be any further query, obviously, Luca Torchia and Luigi and myself will be available with all the other colleagues and I'd like to see you on the road pretty soon, keep supporting us. Thank you so much and have a good summer vacation for those of you who are going to be vacationing. Thanks a lot.</p>
