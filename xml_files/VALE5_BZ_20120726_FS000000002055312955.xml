      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, good afternoon. The second quarter of this year was marked by challenges posed by the lower price environment for all of our products and operational issues in the base metals and coal business.</p>
          <p>Our iron ore production recovered, and recovered very well, increasing 15% against the first quarter. And pellet output reached the all-time high at 14.3 million tons. At the end of the first half of the year, our iron production reached 150 million tons, which is in line with our target for 310 million tons this year. As you'll note, we improved substantially the volume of our production in the second quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>Operating revenues, operating income and margin, as well the cash flow improved in relation to the first quarter of this year, despite of the negative contribution of prices, which produced a negative impact of $630 million on EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Our net earning suffered a large non-cash balance sheet impact arising from devaluation of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. On the other hand, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against our basket currency like 15% Canadian dollar and others, produced a positive impact of more than $330 million.</p>
          <p>But, we needed to call your attention for some important milestone, like the granting of the environment permit to S11D, which is an important step and we are looking forward to getting the final environment permit this year.</p>
          <p>You know that this is a very important milestone for us in terms to contribute to improve the average quality of our iron ore output, to lower our operating cost and to create a new platform for low CapEx brownfield projects. I think that this is a milestone, it's one of the most important milestones in our history.</p>
          <p>We had already signed an agreement with the government of Mozambique for the construction of the greenfield railway and the maritime terminal of Nacala. I think that with this logistics system, Moatize will provide us the scale, cost structure and quality to transform the coal business an important source of shareholder value-creation in the future.</p>
          <p>Last week, we signed a Memorandum of Intention with the government of Argentina, which is a positive step towards the agreement that will provide a road map to facilitate the execution of Rio Colorado. And this is a key element in our structure in the future of the fertilizer business.</p>
          <p>Asset management is an important tool for our shareholder value creation. And we are looking to improve this management, and I think that for some assets, we believe that we are not the best one for them. On the other hand, we bought an additional stake in MBR, a core asset. As part of our discipline in capital location, this is very important for us. The investment is under continuous review, given the larger volume of resource involved, the execution of S11D will imply a review of priorities for our project portfolio. And as a manager, we believe that it's very important to establish priorities. And we needed to provide some review in some of them.</p>
          <p>What we must give emphasis is that our intention is to finalize mainly 2012, 2013, a lot of projects like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (08:20) Concei&#xE7;&#xE3;o Itabiritos, Serra Leste, <mark type="ph" /> Plus 40 (08:26), the logistics system for 150, the Malaysia project, Konkola in Zambia, and Salobo, our copper project. We are completely focused to go and to end this projects. On the other side, we needed to focus mainly in our project, the iron ore project in the north of Brazil. We needed to give effort in Moatize. We needed to see the project the Rio Colorado project as a key element for us.</p>
          <p>We know that we have several challenges today and in the next &#x2013; but we are very confident that in the next 20 years, you'll see a lot of people, millions of people moving to the middle class requiring housing infrastructure, consuming proteins. And we needed to provide a lot of fertilizer and raw materials to them. And Vale is investing and we are investing in good projects, big and good projects. And we are very focused to bring return to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>As I said in my first discussion with you in May 2011, it's our focus to bring return to you. And, we believe that in this regard, we needed to have a focus &#x2013; very focused and disciplined in capital allocation, to be very concerned about the leverage of the company and to provide dividend in accordance with our cash flow.</p>
          <p>In the end, I'd like to say our gratitude to our friend for his professional devotion to Vale, dear Tito. Thank you very much, in my name, the name of the Executive Board, the name of our friends at Vale, I'd like to express again our gratitude. And to say very welcome Luciano Siani as the new CFO.</p>
          <p>And now, we are completely open for new questions. And I call my friends at the Executive Board in order to help us with the answers. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Felipe Hirai with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning and good afternoon, every one. So, my first question is related to any potential changes that you could do to your CapEx. So when do you think that you could give us some more specific details on how you're going to do that? So we should be just expect to see that on a quarterly basis, whenever you report your earnings? Or are you planning to make any kind of announcement of the updated CapEx budget sometime towards the end or in the beginning of the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And my second question is related to the recent news on the dispute on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:17), so just if you could give us an update on how is the current situation, and what do you think of this R$4 billion to R$4.5 billion value that was expected to be paid to the government? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good question, Felipe. I think that there is a big misunderstanding regarding the discussion and our negotiation on the certain liability with DNPM [Departamento Nacional de Produ&#xE7;&#xE3;o Mineral]. The working group composed by representatives of Vale and DNPM completely &#x2013; they announced, are documentation related to the base of calculation of the assessment that question of the payment of mining royalties. And what I can tell you that at this point of time, we have already complete and we got a very important reduction regarding this now &#x2013; is to what &#x2013; very important to say that we are not talking about the agreement with them because the first step is to provide a complete assessment of the documentation regarding this royalties.</p>
          <p>We did the analysis since 1991, up to now. And in this regard, what I have to tell you, that we have completed the assessment and the number that we got it's very important. But now, we have the second step. The second step is to have a discussion with our board, to discuss with the board members about all the <mark type="ph" /> tethers (14:08) that we have with us, and then to go to DNPM and to address all the points with them.</p>
          <p>Then, we have two elements, the first one, it was the assessment to the numbers. And the second is, we will beat the discussion with the DNPM. And about the CapEx, I think that we must provide a review based in the cash flow. I think that it's very important to say that we intended to finalize all the projects. We don't want to review the capital, the number that you are investing in all of these projects, but we must be ready to review in sustaining <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:01). I think that it is very important to provide this review.</p>
          <p>We don't want to go to the market and to provide some announcement, because as you know with this volatility that we're facing, can be very premature to take a decision for the remaining of the year, but we'll be following very closely in a weekly basis, what happened with our investment mainly is sustained. Thank you very much, Felipe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Ivano Westin with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, everyone and thank you very much for the call and for the question. My first question refers to depletion. The Board of Directors approved the Itabiritos Cau&#xEA; project, which based on a CapEx of $1.5 million and 24 million tons of iron ore capacity. However, this volume will be used to replace depletion volumes resulting in no additional volume to the market. And I believe it is the same case of Caraj&#xE1;s north 40 million tons capacity. So, my first question refers to your depletion, I'll appreciate if you could comment on the depletion ratios of all your mines as an overview. And the second question refers to your average iron ore price, which reached $103 a ton this quarter, which represent a discount to support price. So, I wonder whether Vale has the intention to revisit the overall pricing strategy and starting getting into iron ore derivatives as an alternative to hedge your price. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Martins, please go head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking first on market depletion, in the Southern System, we have a situation where many mines are entering ending of their life. But at any time we are developing new operations based on concentration. So the Cau&#xEA; project, together with Concei&#xE7;&#xE3;o and also <mark type="audio gap" /> (17:21-18:02)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Please continue to hold. We are reconnecting to the main speaker line now. Please continue to hold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, coming back to the issues, so we have the many projects in Southern Systems, mainly devoted to improve quality and give a continuity to the volumes, extending life of mine. So, we have four projects underway today, one is Concei&#xE7;&#xE3;o Itabiritos that we will start operating in 2013. We have a further exploration of this Concei&#xE7;&#xE3;o Itabiritos adaptation 2014, also Cau&#xEA; and Vargem Grande. So those projects could be entering operation between 2013 and 2014 are mainly &#x2013; the main objective is to increase mine life and also improving quality by concentration.</p>
          <p>So, only to give you an idea, those &#x2013; the quality will improve for something around 65% today to 68% today. And also silica will be reduced sharply from the level of 4% to 5% today to the level of 2%. So, all those projects in the Southern System are based on the extending mining life and improving quality in the Southern System.</p>
          <p>As far as Caraj&#xE1;s, all the projects that we have in Caraj&#xE1;s now is for increasing capacity and also improving quality because we have been developing new ore bodies. So, we have in Caraj&#xE1;s there today the <mark type="ph" /> Plus 40 (20:00) project. We have also Serra Leste project, besides S11D. So, all of those projects will be aiming to increase the volumes and also improve the quality.</p>
          <p>We also have to open new mines in existing brownfields based on new areas that can be developed in the North System. So in these cases, as we are working to get the approval and the license to also open these new bodies in the existing mining area. Those bodies will bring more volumes and also more quality. So, hopefully speaking, the projects in the Southern System are mainly designed to improve quality and extending mining life. And the projects in the North System are mainly to improve the volumes and also improving quality by opening new mines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to complete your question, we think that we don't have enough liquidity in the market in order to go ahead with a <mark type="ph" /> sincere mining (21:22) program, but I'd like to hear Martins much more about this issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's better for Tito to explain because it is really a financial issue. Commercially speaking, we are not very much interested in doing it, in going forward for this kind of financialization of the iron ore price. We believe that we are the lowest cost producers, even with this level of profitably in the iron ore is very good. So, we don't see any reasons to develop this kind of operation. We believe that would be more useful for customers that want to protect their margins, so that's our position so far. But I also would like to hear Tito's opinion about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I think what happened was not just a matter of liquidity. In order to build up liquidity, we're probably going to have to <mark type="audio gap" /> (22:30) for the future markets. And given the variety of ore available in the world today, I think it's going to be very complicated to do that. And when you compare with the big markets, for example we have some standardization on the products that are used. And also the storage capacity, which is a big issue as well. The tonnage is up, iron ore, we are talking about it, the volumes are much higher than the ones we see in other minerals &#x2013; in other commodities and other minerals. So, I think it's going to be very difficult to see actually a huge or significant market, future market for the iron ore. That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another point is about the price, this quarter our average price was around $103 and last quarter, it was around $109. If you look the year back, it went down around $2.50, and also the 1% iron ore content value went down also $0.50 per each 1%. So, only the IODEX and also the 1% content can explain $4 of the decrease. The remaining $2 are spread in a lot of different items, but I would like, as I did in the previous conference <mark type="ph" /> before I give (24:13), I would like to address the issue with little bit more detail.</p>
          <p>So, the transparent price the market can see is IODEX average, which was $141 in the third quarter of this year. This price is dry and CNF China. So, to bring it to FOBs conditions and also wet basis, our average price is on a wet basis, so you have to reduce the long-term freight that we use in our negotiations with our customers, which is $25 per ton. Also, you have to reduce the average moisture that you have in our ore, so this will bring down another $12.</p>
          <p>So, the FOB price wet basis is $104. On top of this, we needed to add the quality differential that we deserve because our ore has 2% or 3% content, in relation to the IODEX. So this is adding today $7, additionally to our price. So, we come back to FOB wet basis, 64.5% around $111. From this, we needed to deduct all the different sales that we have. For instance, when you sell domestically in Brazil, we deduct all the logistics involved, not only port but also railways.</p>
          <p>We have a special contract with our subsidiary Samarco, we sell them 10 million tons per year of run of mine, which is not ore, it's not processed ore, and also has no logistics involved. It's door-to-door operation, our mine is just around, just nearby Samarco concentration plant. So we deliver this ore to them, and this ore, is based on a long-term contract and has a lower price because it's not iron ore 68%, 67%. So, this ore implies a reduction in our average price of $3.5, only this is this aspect.</p>
          <p>We also have some carryover that we have a different price system in our portfolio. The average price we see is the quarter price we are looking for, the quarter price we are presenting, but in the second quarter price. But we have a different system, part of it are based on former quarter average, part of it is based on the real, actual quarter price and part of it is based on monthly average price. On top of it, we have some sales on a spot basis which is not based on IODEX, but it's based on what we get in the market. If you put all of these points that I raised here to you, we have a $8 deduction from the $111. And then we reach $103. So this is roughly the explanation, why our price went down $6 and how it comes from the $141 to $103.</p>
          <p>I hope that explanation was useful for you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question Mr. Westin. Our next question comes from Carlos De Alba.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. My first question is regarding to the coal and the big metal operations. The performance of these businesses have been far from stellar. So I would like to understand, if there are any action plans that the management team has, talking about to address what is going on in these two businesses, segments? And when can we expect to see some results of these actions, if any? And my second question has to do with, what are the plans in terms of the financing of the CapEx and dividends for this year, given the fact that the cash from operations based on where has been reported so far and based on consensus expectations, doesn't seem to be enough, I mean the free cash flow is not enough to pay the dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos, thank you very much for your question. Regarding the base metals, we have already started our discussion about the strategic plan. And we intended to finalize in November in order to present to our shareholders in the New York Day, in the London Day, as well. We believe that, for sure, the performance it's below our forecast. We needed to address carefully everything, the assets that we have in copper and nickel, and with the results that we can see today. For sure, we have some influence of the &#x2013; regarding the price of nickel and copper, but the main problems that we have, it was regarding also Puma and New Caledonia project. We hope to provide a deep analysis, but before of this, I think that I would like to hear from Peter, what happened with our projects in New Caledonia and also Puma in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Murilo and thank you, Carlos, for your question. There is no doubt that base metals is having a challenging moment in the short term. Although in the long term we have a good strategic plan, but this is not only because of the low liquid prices today. But as we just talked about, the main reasons are the two ramp up operations in On&#xE7;a Puma and VMC, New Caledonia.</p>
          <p>If we go to VNC, New Caledonia, there was this incident in the acid plant. It was &#x2013; diluted acid leaked in the heat exchange. The water mixed with the acid and corroded some part of the equipment. Now, very important to state that this has nothing to do with high technology HPAL and SX column issues. So, this is a completely different issue and the HPAL and SX technology was proven in the beginning of the year, when we produced an integrated run of over 1,000 tons of nickel final product. And the acid plant only supplies the input to those downstream assets. So, we're going to repair the acid plant and we're going to restart operations in New Caledonia at the end of Q3, and start to produce nickel in Q4.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Puma, we had to stop the furnaces also in May and &#x2013; two furnaces due to furnace run-offs. For safety reasons we stopped them. And we are still assessing the extent of the repairs and the period of time required to perform them, but we think they will be out for some months in operations. So that's the situation about two ramp ups which are very challenging. And I would be happy to take further questions, if necessary. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos, just to say that we had problems in some operations not just in the base metals, but in the coal business, as well. I would like you to hear from Roger Downey, regarding the coal business as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to everyone. We've had a very good performance of the Moatize mine, the ramp up is progressing very smoothly and very strong. However, of course, in Mozambique we have been slightly hindered by the performance of the railway down to Beira, so much so that we have had to slow down operation a bit in order not to accumulate stock, because some of our coal, do have a short shelf life before it oxidizes.</p>
          <p>So, I think in terms of production we're okay. We need to focus, and we are working on initiatives to increase output from Beira. We have today significant initiatives and investments in order to speed that up, but as, I think, Murilo has mentioned, a very significant outcome of our negotiations with the government of Mozambique to explore the Nacala corridor will be a significant triumph in terms of bringing Moatize up and beyond its current ramp up.</p>
          <p>In terms of Australia, we've had several different issues with the operations there. And Carlos, yes, far from stellar there, but at Carborough Downs, we had a problem with oxidation on the underground mine there. We've had to stop that and it's been stopped since the end of May, basically. We have &#x2013; the good news is that we have not lost the equipment. That it was oxidation, we basically had to flood the mine with ash and <mark type="ph" /> fluxol (34:45) and that basically dampened &#x2013; and it kind of gets the equipment wet. So we lost a little bit of the electronic part of the equipment, but the equipment is, in general, in a good state. We should resume operations shortly, we have been cleared with the local authorities in terms of reentering the mine. And we're now working on getting that started.</p>
          <p>The rest of Australia I think, well, we have been &#x2013; there are issues here and there, but very small impact on the Isaac Plains and Integra operations. So we are operating there quite smoothly and in general, we are expecting a recovery in terms of the Australian operations at the end of the year</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Clearly, what we were forecasting for price for 2012, we are not seeing that happening. And we will have some benefits from the exchange rate mostly in Brazil. I mean, the devaluation of the real against the U.S. dollar in some ways will help us up with some reduction in the investments, in sustaining in the capital growth. And so expecting to benefit from this reduction, and increasing a little in our leverage, we will actually match the needed cash flow for the whole year. We are not expecting to see our balance sheet ratio changing dramatically. The long-term on EBTIDA has been below one time, and as we have promised since last year, we're expecting to have this numbers around one time, no more than that.</p>
          <p>I feel that we are confident that even with this drop in prices, we may actually finance the full cash flow and keep the investments at the level they are today. And paying the minimum dividend that was announced at the beginning of the year. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions, I guess, probably for Roger. The first one is Moatize, at current coal prices and using the current logistical set-up, do you believe that that project is going to be EBITDA positive or do we need the new logistics and higher coal prices to generate positive EBITDA there?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, Rio Colorado, I noticed there was no increase in the CapEx budget. It's a little bit surprising, given the inflation that we're seeing Barrick announcing a big increase at Pascua-Lama today in Argentina. Is the financial review of that project complete or should we &#x2013; or are you still working on a budget there? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Yeah, Alex. Murilo, do you want to make any comments before me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, just to give some notes regarding the last weeks &#x2013; two weeks ago, Vale signed with the government of Argentina, a Memorandum of Understanding which is a positive and key step towards the agreement that will provide the roadmap and the full assessment of the logistics. But please, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Alex, starting with Moatize, well, Moatize is a world-class mine. We've got large resource &#x2013; vast resources of low-cost open-cut coal mining there. Most of it is 70% hard coking coal, so I think even with prices we're seeing today, we're seeing a positive contribution from Moatize. I have no fear that this will become a very high return projects, obviously, we're suffering the pains of growth. That's applicable to every single project around the world, I think, and we're no exception.</p>
          <p>We are building a world-class operation, our challenges today have more to do with rail, of course, and like I mentioned earlier on, we've just made a very important development, a very important milestone in the development of this project which is the signing of the agreement to develop the Nacala corridor. That would be a world-class railway operated by Vale and I think, once we're there, we can certainly start looking at Moatize too with much brighter eyes.</p>
          <p>In terms of the PRC as Murilo just mentioned also, we made a very significant move in Argentina, the signing of the Acta Acuerdo which basically establishes the footprint for us to develop the infrastructure that we need to go ahead with that project. That project, your questions were more related to scenarios, I think, and right now as we're maintaining our CapEx for that project, we are looking at all the different scenarios. One of the scenarios that I think you must look at as well is a scenario where we could see some favorable exchange rate fluctuations, favoring the dollar in relation to the peso, which would actually have a very positive effect on CapEx, bringing our CapEx below our target. So far, we've got about around 35% of execution up at the mine. We're on track there. So I think it's &#x2013; any CapEx update at this stage would be a bit premature.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And about the risk of the project, what we have to tell you that we are analyzing many alternatives. One of the alternatives could be to have a partner in the project, but it's just one alternative, we have many alternatives that must be analyzed carefully to be presented to &#x2013; in our strategic plan to the Board. Thank you very much, Alex.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Two questions, the first on the unit costs, we noticed that the unit iron ore costs fell 5% to 6% in the second quarter. My understanding is that when the real depreciates, it typically takes a few quarters to see the full benefit of that. What should we expect in the third quarter, should we expect an even bigger fall in unit costs? And then secondly, just on iron ore, what are your expectations? We're right above what we saw the lows of last year, what are your expectations for the rest of the year and have you given any thought to production cuts to help support the price or is this more of a seasonal issue at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tito, please go ahead about the costs, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Usually, we don't give any guidance on unit costs. What I can tell you, some of the effects of the exchange rate were already accrued during this last quarter and we should expect some additional effects along the rest of the year for sure, but I can't tell you more than that. Second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martins, about the price and the scenario that we are doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we believe that we are reaching the bottom of the market as far as price is concerned. If our assumptions are correct and the price is reaching a point where many players will be put out of the market. And then, we believe that there will be some stabilization or even a rebound of the price. We do not see a strong recovery, but we see some stabilization and even a slight recovery in the next weeks.</p>
          <p>We're going to see it very soon because we believe this price was reached more in the second quarter of 2010, and also ended in the four quarter of 2011 and didn't stay in this level for long &#x2013; recovered in this level for long &#x2013; it recovered very fast. So, I think we're going to see in the next two weeks the behavior of the market.</p>
          <p>My view is that the iron ore price range will range between $120 and maybe $180 in long-term. We consider this too, as the range because $118, many steelmakers cannot compete, so the demand will decrease. And also $120, many miners will not be able to compete in the market, mainly local miners in China. So, we see this range as where the iron ore price will stay in the next two or three years, but what could change it is a lot of supply from outside that could change the economics of the pricing system, because today the economics of the price is supported by local miners in China. As local miners in China is displaced by foreign more competitive players, this economics will change, but you'll not be in the short trends. It will take a long time for us to see the point where the economics of price in iron ore will based on pure seaborne players. I think the local players and the most &#x2013; the less competitive players continues to play a big role on the price as far as the floor price is concerned.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, gentlemen and thanks for taking my questions. I guess, what sort of just touching on a couple of things, one in terms of the internal review of the Simandou project, if you could give us an update on when we can expect or when you expect to complete that internally, is that also tied into <mark type="ph" /> Vale (46:59)? And then a couple of things on Salobo, which is in comparing Sossego with Salobo. Sossego obviously not delivering the results that you had hoped for, if you could just provide some clarification in terms of why the outlook on Salobo is significantly better.</p>
          <p>And then, if I may, just opening up the potential for you to talk a little bit about the blue sky in terms of further expansion in the Northern System, that Martins was suggesting, presumably that takes place around Serra Sul, and are we back to sort of low capital intensity projects, because the infrastructure build out has taken place. I know that's beyond the current planning, but if we're looking on a 5, 10-year view, what does that longer-term CapEx profile look like? Thank you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Please, Peter, could you spend some few words about Salobo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks for the question, Rene. So Salobo is in the beginning of the start-up, we are now since June ramping up with two lines. And we have so far produced some, some small tonnage of concentrates. This is not unusual, this is just the transition now from the commissioning and the ramp up. Both projects Sossego and Salobo are very similar in terms of concept, in terms of flotation stages and in terms of &#x2013; based on small difference in terms of mineralogy, but comparing &#x2013; almost Salobo is a copy-paste of Sossego. So what we have is that there is &#x2013; rather was a CapEx adjustment in &#x2013; Salobo I was adjusted to $2.5 billion and Salobo II, which is &#x2013; it's also 100,000 tons concentrate capacity, was adjusted to $1.4 billion, but in the next months we will see a robust ramp up from these operations, because there's really no &#x2013; there is a very similar situation like we had in Sossego. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But for sure, Rene, the new project in the north of Brazil, will contribute to improve the average of our quality in iron ore output. I think that we reduced the operational cost and then mainly, mainly to create a new platform for low CapEx in our future brownfield. I think that it's very important for us, this project in this regard. It's can be &#x2013; the milestone regarding the logistic system as well. Tito, any further comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the first question was about Simandou, you want to make any comment about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Simandou, I think that we didn't receive any new message from the government of Guinea, regarding the new legislation, the new mining code. We believe that we needed to reserve the &#x2013; everything regarding the shareholders is clean, the royalty, the logistics, the ownership of the logistics, before going to the board of Vale, and we see some sign regarding the future of the project. Unfortunately, we stay as it was in the end of the first quarter of the year. We know that it's a very important issue in the political contest there, a matter to be addressed carefully by the government, but in the end, we don't have any answer in this regard. Thank you very much, Rene.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. First question is to Murilo regarding CapEx inflation risk for new projects. We're starting to see some lower pressure on equipment and material prices, as some projects are actually being canceled or even postponed. So do you see &#x2013; do you already see this happening for Vale as well, some reduction on CapEx risk? And if this could reduce the risk of revising CapEx upwards for our new projects like Serra Sul?</p>
          <p>And the second question is for Martins, if you could comment a little bit about the iron ore market in Brazil in the domestic market, if you believe that there could be a small catch up in terms of prices in the domestic market for the coming years, mainly 2013 and probably 2014, when there could be a little bit of excess capacity in terms of port with the start-up of new competitors. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcos. In fact, right after some years, seeing CapEx inflation and depreciation of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollars. I think now because of the weakness of the market that you are seeing, for sure we have &#x2013; our feeling that you'll see some benefit in terms of the CapEx. But, we needed to see in the next coming months, if this feeling is right or wrong. Well, I believe that it can be good news in terms of the implementation of the S11D, but we need to wait a little bit in order to give you some level of certainty in this regard. And then, Martins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as Brazilian domestic market for iron ore is concerned, our view is this market has become not an iron ore market anymore, but a steel market. So, if you want to sell iron ore in domestic market, you have to produce steel, because all the steelmakers in Brazil are vertically integrating their operations. And what we sell in domestic market today, if you look carefully is indirect exports. So the 10 million tons we sell to Samarco is totally exported. The iron ore we sell to CFA and also to CFE, a big part of it is exported also. So Brazilian market for iron ore is practically disappearing and becoming a steel market. So we do not see any changes on it and that's the reason we are supporting some ventures to produce steel in Brazil because that way we think that we can keep some market share in this market.</p>
          <p>I think Brazil has a lot of iron ore &#x2013; availability of iron ore is big, although, not high quality anymore in some areas, but for vertically-integrated companies, it's rather good. So, I think the challenge to compete in the steel market for local steelmakers will drive more and more to vertical integration. I think that is my view about it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much for taking my questions. My first question is regarding the strategy to acquire EBM, which own 61% of the Southern System and the leasing of Hispanobr&#xE1;s. If you can comment a little bit on the strategy, and if there would be any interest in acquiring more participation in iron ore assets. And my second question is regarding the Caraj&#xE1;s Serra Sul project? One question that some clients asks us, is whether the existence of caves could increase costs or pose any sorts of implementation challenge to the project. So, if you can comment a little bit on how the caves impact, let's say the Caraj&#xE1;s Serra Sul project, or if it doesn't impact at all that will be great. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Martins, MBR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the acquisition of small share of MBR and also the legal mechanism for Hispanobr&#xE1;s, it's part of our long-term strategy of consolidating our assets in iron ore. We have this is small participation from Japanese players and former MBR. And every plan that we have opportunities to buy back, we are buying the share. So, this is not a big &#x2013; it's not a big problem for us to keep this participation, but we believe long-term it makes sense for us to do it.</p>
          <p>And as far as the Hispanobr&#xE1;s, it's better to operate under this system, because it gives us much more flexibility to use different plants to reduce operational costs. So, until recently, all these joint ventures were independent companies. And each one had his own story, his own management, his own infrastructure. Now, under this system, we have a much more flexibility to operate in the pellet plants to shut them down or to keep it working full capacity. I think that in the past, it was difficult to reach. We always have to negotiate with the partners these issues. So, I think those movements are in a way to consolidate our assets in iron ore. And also improve the operation, reduce costs and make it more flexible. As far as the Caraj&#xE1;s caves, Vania will explain a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning. The existing legislation allow us to compensate the cave. So it's easier &#x2013; I cannot say it is easy, but for the maximum relevance cave we cannot compensate, but there are just a few. For the higher and medium relevance caves, we cannot compensate. So, all of this is under negotiations, just to negotiate with all the environmental organizations, how we can compensate this, that is just a matter of how, because the legislation already allows us to the compensation. So it's not a big issue, we can overcome it for sure.</p>

The most important to leave a message that we continue completely focused and the disciplined in the capital location, looking to increase the volume, to be more efficient use of our reserves and knowing very well that it's an important new platform for the low CapEx cost that what we are building today. We are building in S11D, in Moatize and in Rio Colorado.</p>
          <p>I think that it's very important to see these three projects as a new platform for low cost and in the future for excellent brownfield projects. Thank you very much, and again to express our gratitude to Tito, and welcome to Luciano Siani. Thank you.</p>
