          <p>Welcome to Cisco Systems First Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco Systems, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I'd like to introduce Ms. Blair Christie, Senior Vice President of Global Corporate Communications for Cisco Systems. Ma'am, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, Kim. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 83rd quarterly conference call. I'm Blair Christie; and I'm joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and CEO; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, Executive Vice President of Worldwide Operations; Ned Hooper, Chief Strategy Officer and Senior Vice President, Consumer Business; and Padmasree Warrior, Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of our Enterprise business.</p>
          <p>The Q1 fiscal year 2011 press release is on U.S. High Tech Marketwire and on Cisco's website at http//newsroom.cisco.com. I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides. In those slides you will find financial information that we cover during this conference call as well as additional financial metrics and analysis that you might find helpful. Additionally, downloadable Q1 financial statements will be available following the call including revenue by geographic segment as well as product category. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets and cash flow statements can be found on our website in the Investor Relations section. Just click on the financial reporting section of the website to access the slides and those documents.</p>
          <p>A replay of this call will be available via telephone from November 10th through November 17th at 866-357-4205 or 203-369-0122 for international callers. A webcast replay is available from November 10 through January 21 on Cisco's Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The financial results in the press release are unaudited. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.</p>
          <p>As we typically do when we begin a fiscal year, we have made certain reporting changes and enhancements that are reflected in the financial results we will be discussing today. First, in Q1 we consolidated our Asia Pacific and Japan operations in order to achieve operational efficiencies in our business. As a result of this operational change, we now have the following four geographic segments: United States and Canada, European markets, emerging markets, and Asia Pacific markets. Asia Pacific markets now includes the prior Asia Pacific and Japan segments. As a reminder, the geographies are the primary way we manage our operations.</p>
          <p>Second, we have also changed the way we report revenue by product categories. Given the ongoing evolution of our business, we are grouping our newer technologies into a category called New Products. This new category better aligns to our strategic growth priorities and allows investors further understanding of our progress in the new markets we are entering. Our New Products category will replace Advanced Technologies and include some products that had been in our Other category. The New Products segment contains five subcategories: Data Center, Collaboration, Security, Wireless, and Video Connected Homes. Our core Routing, Switching, and Services categories remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>In terms of components of these subcategories, Data Center includes Application Networking Services, Storage, and Unified Computing Systems. Collaboration includes Unified Communications, TelePresence and TANDBERG. Security and Wireless remain unchanged, and Video Connected Home includes Networked Home, Pure Digital, Video Systems and Cable.</p>
          <p>In the slides that accompany this call, you will find we have provided further details on these changes including a mapping of products into the subcategories as well as a reclassification of fiscal year 2010 quarterly revenue based on the revised product categories.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we have made formatting and other improvements to the slides in order to better communicate key data points that we will consistently provide to our investors in each quarter.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to John for his commentary on the quarter. John?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Blair, thank you very much. Based in part on the feedback from a number of you, we are continuing to evolve the format of our quarter's conference call; the objective being to share more information in a tighter format while leaving more time for Q&amp;A at the end of the call. Please do not hesitate to give us feedback in terms of the effectiveness of this new format.</p>
          <p>We will break the call into three sections. In the first section, I will provide a general overview of the quarter, focusing on key financials, geographies, customer segments, and products followed by a discussion of key accomplishments in the quarter and what we would like to do better and ending with general comments on business momentum exiting the quarter as well as our guidance for Q2 FY '11 with all the appropriate caveats. In the second section, Frank will provide additional details about Q1 FY '11 as well as expand on our Q2 FY '11 guidance, investments, opportunities, and challenges. In the third section of the call, I will provide some brief closing comments and then we will wrap up with Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Now beginning with the opening section, I will cover five key areas in the following discussion. First, from the financial perspective, Q1 FY '11 evolved pretty much as we expected and in line with our guidance provided last quarter. And in this first section, we will provide a high level financial review of the quarter primarily in terms of revenue and other financial information. Second, this will be followed by a discussion on momentum in the geographies, products, and customer segments. Third, I will then focus on what's working from our strategy and architectural approach and briefly discuss three areas where we are seeing the most new revenue opportunities for the next year: those being collaboration; second, video; and third, the combination of data center virtualization and cloud.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we will then cover several areas that we are watching that experienced some interesting challenges in the quarter. Two of them are areas that we have limited ability to control or influence and one is in an area that I expect us to improve over time. Finally, the last section will be a summary of what you can expect from Cisco over the next several quarters closing with how we feel about the business going forward.</p>
          <p>Now beginning with the opening section, from a high level perspective there are a number of key take-aways from the results in Q1 FY '11 and our momentum going into Q2 FY '11. First Q1 was a solid quarter from a Cisco, from a financial, product, customer, and geographic perspective. We continue to execute well with a compelling financial position, expanding innovation engine and execute in both our core markets and market adjacencies. However, what I am most pleased about is how our business architecture and technology architecture is gaining customer acceptance.</p>
          <p>We were pleased with the financial results achieved during the quarter. Revenue of 10.75 billion, a 19% year-over-year increase, was right in the middle of our guidance provided last quarter of 18 to 20%. Non-GAAP operating income of 3.0 billion was a year-over-year increase of 14%. Non-GAAP net income was 2.4 billion, a 14% year-over-year increase; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42, which was a year-over-year increase of 17%. GAAP earnings per share of $0.34 was an increase of 13% year-over-year. Operating expenses were 36.3% of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 16.8% year-over-year versus 19% increase in revenues. Non-GAAP gross margins were 64.3% and non-GAAP product gross margins were 64%.</p>
          <p>Cash generated from operations was a solid $1.7 billion, bringing our total cash including investments to 38.9 billion. We also delivered on our hiring projections with a net increase of approximately 1,900 additions to the Cisco team in Q1 FY '11. This includes approximately 150 people from acquisitions. As an additional point of interest, we added over the last two quarters 600 incremental sales reps, a 15% increase to the total sales rep population in our global operation. Q1 additions followed on last quarter's new hires of approximately 2,000 additions. It is our intent to continue to hire in proportion to our global business assuming support from government decisions on private job creation in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Q1 had a number of other very positive accomplishments and several challenges. As I mentioned earlier, the most important accomplishment to me was the rapidly expanding acceptance of our technology architecture, the unique way we combine products, customer segments, market adjacencies, security, mobility, video, etcetera, appears to be clearly understood by our leading edge customers, and how the pieces come together from a technology architecture perspective and the advantages that this approach has in enabling customers' business goals.</p>
          <p>Our customers also understand our ability to accelerate this innovation machine in a way that protects their investment in Cisco's products. In short, any device to any information, across any combination of networks, in any format with video playing an increasing role, from the home to the cloud is playing out as we expected in our strategy.</p>
          <p>We had several other significant accomplishments this quarter. First, from a product innovation and market share perspective, it was a very solid quarter. From a revenue perspective routing was up 13% year-over-year, with high-end routing, which includes the acquisition of Starent, up 16% year-over-year, and mid and low-range routing up 7 and 8% from a revenue perspective year-over-year. Switching was very solid with a 25% year-over-year revenue growth with both modular and fixed switching showing equal growth.</p>
          <p>Second, our key new products are filling in our architectural approach and are evolving very much in line with our strategy. The proof point being that our New Product category, as Blair outlined in her introduction, grew 22% year-over-year from a revenue perspective in Q1. Data center led the way with a very strong 59% year-over-year growth followed by collaboration with growth of 45% year-over-year. We will provide more details on these two major growth opportunity areas in a moment. Video Connected Home grew 11% year-over-year followed by Wireless at 9% and Security was down slightly at minus 2% revenue growth year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Third, our new next generation products continue very solid customer acceptance. The following will be discussed in terms of revenue year-over-year. The ASR edge routers grew approximately 200% year-over-year; with a current annualized run rate of approximately 1.4 billion. The ASR 9000 was especially strong with over 700% growth year-over-year with an annualized run rate of 280 million. These ASR products continue to lead the market at the edge of the network and are very well positioned for future growth.</p>
          <p>Our Nexus product family also continued to be very strong with year-over-year growth in excess of 120% and an annualized run rate of approximately 1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Our UCS server product family had another extremely strong quarter with growth year-over-year of 550% to an annualized run rate of almost 500 million. The number of UCS customers has grown steadily over the last three quarters from 900 three quarters ago in Q3 of FY '10 to a total of 1,700 in Q4 of FY '10 and approximately 2,800 in the current Q1 of FY '11. We now have over 40 customers who have ordered over 1 million of UCS systems from the time of initial product introductions. We are also starting to see many of these systems now going into production rather than initial pilot systems. Over the next several quarters, we hope to start seeing our first large orders for major data center implementations. Cisco, for example, has over 2,500 UCS systems in production, and so far they have been rock solid.</p>
          <p>The new ISR G2 product family had growth of approximately 125% year over year and a current run rate of approximately 1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Our MDS 9000 continued to see solid growth, with year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 24% and an annualized run rate approaching 500 million.</p>
          <p>Fourth, from a country perspective, balance was relatively good, with 13 of our 15 countries growing orders year over year in the mid-teens or better. Our strategy of focusing the entire company on five leading emerging countries is evolving in line with our expectations, and all five had especially strong growth from an orders perspective. Russia led the way, with order growth over 100% year over year, followed by India and Brazil with growth above 60% year over year, Mexico with 40% growth year over year, China with 30%.</p>
          <p>However, the U.S. had product order growth of only 6% year over year, with U.S. service providers which traditionally accounts for a third of our U.S. product business experiencing very mixed growth rates, with our traditional service providers growing orders in the 20% plus range, while our cable operator orders decreased over 35% year over year. We will cover this area in more detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>In terms of product orders, we saw 10% year-over-year growth for our global operations. For our geographic segments, U.S. and Canada was up 7%, European markets were up 2%, emerging markets up 32%, and Asia Pacific markets were up 18% on a year-on-year basis.</p>
          <p>Fifth, from an industry perspective, our enterprise and commercial customer segments continued to have good balance from a global perspective in each of the major theaters, with order growth of 16% year over year for enterprise which excludes public sector, and 13% for commercial. Service provider order growth was mixed depending on product area with an 8% year-over-year order growth. Public sector was also mixed, with a 6% year-over-year order growth. Consumer was flat year over year. I will cover the service provider and public sector in more detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>There are three areas that I would like to expand on further from a positive perspective at this time. These areas will in my opinion offer tremendous growth opportunities over the next several years and also play very tightly with our technology and business architecture strategies in our service provider and enterprise accounts. These areas are collaboration, video and, third, data center virtualization cloud. These are relatively new growth areas within Cisco and the industry. We will focus the following discussion in terms of order growth rates year over year.</p>
          <p>From a collaboration perspective, which includes the impact of TANDBERG, we saw very solid order growth globally, over 60% year over year. Balance was good for TelePresence, traditional TANDBERG, phones, call manager, and tying them all together as an architectural play is rapidly gaining traction. Video brings collaboration to life from an innovation and a business process change perspective. Over the last six months, we believe a tipping point has occurred in global CIOs' minds in terms of their rapidly increasing focus on video. At first they were following their CEO interests in terms of TelePresence. And the CEOs grasped how this could change business models probably before the CIOs did, and the CIOs were also focused on travel savings. But now they're beginning to see the early adopters think out of box on video, enabling collaboration for major productivity gains and major process change.</p>
          <p>At our yearly CIO conference, which occurred about a month ago, almost half of the CIOs said the area that had changed the most for them was how quickly they are focusing on video and how far Cisco has come in enabling their business goals by utilization of video.</p>
          <p>From a data center, virtualization and cloud perspective, momentum is extremely strong. We are making great progress on being the first new large architectural player in the data center in almost two decades. In the service provider environment, the emphasis is on virtualization and cloud for new revenue streams and expanding the way we deliver services to their customers, whether they are consumer, commercial, or enterprise business is gaining traction in almost every major service provider around the world. The same is true in many of these accounts for our VCE Alliance products, along with our partners VMware and EMC, with 62 enterprise and service provider accounts beginning Vblock implementations or have Vblocks actually in production.</p>
          <p>From an enterprise and commercial perspective, our new data center products are also gaining architectural commitments with order growth year over year in our data center category of approximately 56%. And even with this very strong growth rate, the numbers are still relatively modest compared to the opportunities that are existing in our opinion one to two years out.</p>
          <p>However, we did see several challenges in the quarter, as you would expect given some of the numbers we just discussed. These areas include certain categories of our public sector segment, certain products in our service provider segment, and to a limited extent, Europe in terms of business momentum.</p>
          <p>First, we did see mixed results on a global basis from our public sector business. We had solid orders growth in the mid-teens or better in the U.S. federal public sector, and also the emerging markets public sector. However, we did see challenges, for example, in the U.S. state government business, down in Q1 approximately 25% year over year from an orders perspective. And to give you an idea of how rapid a change this was, the state government business was down 48% from Q4 to Q1 from an orders perspective.</p>
          <p>We saw similar challenges in our Japanese government business, as well as orders from certain central governments in Europe. We believe the public sector business will continue to be challenging for at least several quarters. The public sector represents about 22% of our total product orders in Q1. The global public sector grew only 60% from an order perspective in Q1.</p>
          <p>Second, the service provider business on a global basis had a number of strong positives from a product perspective, but also a couple of challenges. On the very positive side, our relationship with our service providers as both a customer and a partner continued to grow even stronger from a technology architecture and business architecture perspective. This is true and expanding in the vast majority of major service providers in the world. These large service providers would include leaders such as British Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, Verizon, AT&amp;T, NTT, Telstra, et cetera.</p>
          <p>From an IP NGN architecture perspective, growth was very solid from an orders perspective, growing at 14% year over year. We discussed the strength of the ASR family at high-end routers earlier, and just as an update, the customer acceptance from the pilot perspective on the CRS-3 is off to a great start. In Q1 we shipped our first CRS-3 system. We received 51 million in orders from 30 customers. However, we expect it will probably be several more quarters before we see rapid increase in these accounts from our new high-end routers as they test out all the new systems of this magnitude before they begin volume commitments.</p>
          <p>A year ago, our exposure to competitors and the service provider would have been in the area of edge routing and mobility. Today, this is the strength especially in video. While the recent success in these product areas has been very good and accelerating rapidly, it would not surprise me to see even faster growth in Q2. The ASR 5000 accounted for approximately 88 million in revenue and a 30% year-over-year growth in Q1 comparing back to its days at Starent. If I were to anticipate Q2 video mobility momentum especially for the ASR 5000, it is very possible, with all the appropriate caveats, to see a doubling of product orders in this area from Q1 to Q2.</p>
          <p>While there are many positive accomplishments with our service provider customers and service provider partners, there are also some challenges. Our global service provider order growth rate was 8% year-over-year while the U.S. was down 2%. However, the results varied dramatically by service provider and even type of service provider in terms of growth rates.</p>
          <p>For example, in the U.S., our orders grew in the 20% or better range in our large service providers such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, and regional service providers did equally as well. Our challenge was in our MSO cable operators area where we saw a year-over-year decrease in the mid-thirties. To put this into perspective, the cable operators have traditionally accounted for approximately 35% of our North American service provider business. Just as a reminder, our total U.S. service provider business had order growth rates in the last three quarters of fiscal year 2010 in excess of 20% in each of the three quarters.</p>
          <p>So we see two primary challenges at this point in time in the service provider business. First, similar to a number of our peers, we are also seeing some challenging trends in terms of CapEx expenditure in some of our global service providers. Second, in one specific service provider customer group, we are also experiencing some unique challenges. That is our cable segment specifically the traditional set top business portion tied to consumer spending. As a reminder, the set top business has an annualized run rate of approximately $2 billion and our IPTV and international set top business remains strong. However, our traditional North American cable business which accounts for the majority of our current set top business is under pressure as new housing and consumer spending slows, as lower cost competitors begin to enter the market.</p>
          <p>As a result, we are seeing year-over-year declines in orders, and we expect to see continued pressure, specifically in our traditional North American cable business. From an orders perspective, our traditional North American cable set top business was down over 40% year-over-year in Q1. Traditional North American cable set tops were approximately 50% of our total set-top box orders in Q1. With that said, we are seeing strength in both our international cable set top business and our IPTV set top business. We are comfortable with the business momentum of cable set tops outside North America and we are pleased to see the continued growing footprint of the IP set-top boxes.</p>
          <p>Third, Europe, as we are all aware, central government budgets in many of the countries in Europe are being reduced dramatically. Our European public sector business was down in mid-single digits in Q1 from a year-over-year perspective. On the positive side, we did see solid order growth from countries including all the industries of France, Germany, Netherlands and the Nordic countries. But we also started seeing some initial pressure on certain other customer segments by country, although it is way too early to call this a trend.</p>
          <p>From a book-to-bill perspective, while product revenues were very good at 21% year-over-year growth, total product order growth was only approximately 10% year-over-year. Therefore, book-to-bill was below one. As you all are aware, we have a very strong sales organization and a track record of being very accurate and at times even conservative on the quarter orderly quarter forecasts.</p>
          <p>Traditionally in Q1 our book-to-bill is normally slightly below one off of a strong Q4. However, this quarter was different. To put this into perspective, the challenges that we experienced in Q1 resulted in orders being below our initial Q1 sales order forecasts by over 500 million.</p>
          <p>In summary, we continued to gain market share in many of our product areas in the third calendar quarter of this year. In terms of our new intermediate two to three year big opportunities, we are well positioned and getting good results in video, collaboration, data center virtualization, cloud, our emerging countries, smart connected communities, as well as our new innovative products. In terms of our new longer term market adjacencies, such as smart grid, sports and entertainment, virtual health care and virtual education, we believe they will become significant, with the appropriate caveats, three to five years from now. And we are off again to an excellent start.</p>
          <p>On the areas we control or influence from an innovation point of view or an operational execution point of view, we feel we are very well positioned. Almost all of our product families are in the early stages of their lifecycle and gaining solid momentum as we discussed earlier. Balance across geographies and customer segments remains reasonably good. So as many of you would expect, we are going to focus on what we can control and influence as we have done in each of the periods of uncertainty. And as we're going to be aggressively in terms of investing resources in the new market adjacencies where we are also gaining good momentum from both an innovation thought leadership perspective as well as a business perspective.</p>
          <p>This is where the strength of our financial model and ability to generate cash and profits comes into play. In answering some of your questions about how we feel about the business in general, we believe that our vision of how the industry is going to evolve and our strategy to uniquely lead this industry is gaining more momentum and customer acceptance than many would have thought just one year ago. Our ability to enter new markets from the data center to the cloud to UCS to collaboration to video mobility to the home is gaining speed, scale, flexibility and is becoming replicable as we had hoped, as well as tying together from an architectural perspective.</p>
          <p>We do think some of the challenges in public sector spending will be with us for a couple of quarters and subject to the appropriate caveats, the most likely scenario for service provider spending is to pick up over the next year given both the loads on networks and resulting from the extensive uptake of collaboration and video in the networks combined with new service provider market opportunities such as managed services and cloud delivery. We are obviously not projecting growth as fast as we would like over the next several quarters and reflects, in our opinion, the reality of public sector spending, some challenges in parts of our service provider market and one or two areas we should improve our execution.</p>
          <p>However, barring a surprise, which is always possible and again with the appropriate caveats, we believe it is realistic to hope for a return to 12 to 17% growth goals in the not-too-distant future, assuming a return to a good economic growth in many of our countries worldwide. As you would expect, we will focus very carefully on expense management; however, we also believe that the intermediate and long-term growth opportunities far outweigh the short-term challenges. And with that in mind, we plan to continue to invest in new markets and technology architecture plays. We will also reallocate expenses based on business momentum and opportunities. However, our view is that we are going to power through in what we believe to be some short-term challenges in the next several quarters with all the appropriate caveats we talked about before.</p>
          <p>As we've said in conference calls over many years, Cisco will always be affected by major economic changes, capital spending patterns, new and existing competitors, potential issues affecting our suppliers and our ability to execute or not on our strategy and other factors as discussed in our SEC filings. For purposes of our long-range goals as well as our quarterly guidance, we are also assuming that our vision of how the industry and the market will evolve will be accurate and we will effectively execute on that vision. We are very confident on our strategy. We will now be providing both Q2 fiscal year '11 revenue guidance and our best estimates of revenue growth for the entire fiscal year.</p>
          <p>This guidance is based on a conservative view of our normal seasonality trends, current pipeline and how we believe the market will play out based on the information we have today over the next several quarters. Given the uncertainties in the market, we could be above or below our guidance for the year and by definition are subject to all the appropriate caveats we discussed in our conference calls and our SEC filings.</p>
          <p>With this discussion in mind, our revenue guidance for Q2 FY '11 including our usual caveats as discussed earlier in our SEC filings, is for revenue growth to increase 3% to 5% year-over-year. Our estimate for fiscal year 2011 is for the yearly revenue growth to be in the 9 to 12% range. Frank will continue with a detailed guidance in the next section.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to Frank for the second section of the call. Frank, to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John.</p>
          <p>We had solid results for Q1 fiscal year '11 which continues to demonstrate the robustness of our portfolio and our entry into several new markets. Total revenue for the first quarter was $10.75 billion, an increase of approximately 19% year-over-year, within our guidance of 18 to 20%.</p>
          <p>Total service revenue was $2 billion, up approximately 13% year-over-year, and total product revenue was $8.7 billion, up approximately 21% year-over-year. Switching revenue was 3.6 billion, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Modular switching revenue was up 25%, and fixed switching revenue increased 24% year-over-year. Routing revenue was 1.8 billion, up 13% year-over-year, representing an increase of 16%, 7% and 8% year-over-year in high end, mid-range and low end respectively.</p>
          <p>New products revenue totaled $3.1 billion, representing an increase of 22% year-over-year. We saw strong year-over-year growth in data center of approximately 59% and collaboration of approximately 45%. Security was down 2% year-over-year while Wireless was up approximately 9% and Video Connected Home was up approximately 11%. Other product revenue totaled $231 million, up approximately 13% year-over-year. This category is primarily comprised of our Optical business and Emerging Technologies.</p>
          <p>We experienced an increase in total revenue across all geographic segments on a year-over-year basis. Year-over-year revenue ranged from an increase of approximately 41% in emerging markets to growth of approximately 11% for the European markets with revenue in the U.S. and Canada theater up approximately 18% and Asia-Pacific markets up approximately 22%.</p>
          <p>Q1 FY '11 total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.3%, up 0.2 of a percentage point quarter-over-quarter and down 2 percentage points year-over-year. For product only, non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 64%, up 0.4 of a percentage point quarter-over-quarter. For the quarter-over-quarter comparison, higher cost savings were partially offset by discounts.</p>
          <p>On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP product gross margin was down 2.3 percentage points. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by pricing and discounts, along with higher manufacturing related costs associated with the carryover effect of our FY '10 supply chain constraints and unfavorable mix, partly offset by cost savings and higher volume. Constraints in our supply chain have improved, and our customer lead times are at normal levels on almost all products.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP service margin for the first quarter was 65.7%, down from 65.9% last quarter and down from 66.3% in Q1 FY '10. Total gross margin by theater ranged from approximately 65.2% for European markets to approximately 62.3% in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating expense was approximately 3.9 billion in Q1 FY '11. Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 36.3% in the quarter versus 35.4% in Q4 FY '10. Interest and other income was $74 million for Q1, reflecting realized gains on investments. Our Q1 FY '11 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 22%. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $2.4 billion, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 22.4%. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter were $0.42 per share versus $0.36 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, a 17% increase year-over-year.</p>
          <p>GAAP net income for the first quarter was $1.9 billion, as compared to $1.8 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter was $0.34 per share versus $0.30 in the same quarter of fiscal year 2010.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the balance sheet, the total of cash, cash equivalents, and investments at quarter end was $38.9 billion, down 936 million from last quarter. Of this total balance, $3.8 billion was held within the U.S. at the end of Q1. Our cash flow from operations was approximately $1.7 billion. Cash flow from operations is typically lower during the first quarter due to seasonally disbursements such as our annual variable compensation payment to employees and some timing of tax payments.</p>
          <p>Moving on to accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance was approximately $4.5 billion at the end of Q1. Also at the end of Q1, days sales outstanding or DSO was 38 days. This compares to 41 days at the end of Q4 FY '10 and 32 days at the end of Q1 FY '10.</p>
          <p>Total inventory at the end of Q1 was $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP inventory turns were 10.8 this quarter, down 1.3 compared to last quarter and down 0.5 from Q1 of last year. Inventory purchase commitments at the end of Q1 were $4 billion, down 6% or approximately $270 million quarter-over-quarter driven by continuing improvement in our component supply chain.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, we repurchased $2.5 billion of common stock under the stock repurchase program or 113 million shares at an average price of $22.14 per share. The remaining approved amount for the stock repurchase under this program was approximately 4.5 billion as of quarter end.</p>
          <p>Deferred revenue was 10.7 billion at the end of Q1, an increase of approximately 16% compared with Q1 FY '10. Deferred product revenue was $3.6 billion and deferred service revenue was approximately $7.2 billion, each increased approximately 16% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>At the end of Q1, our head count totaled approximately 72,600, an increase of approximately 1,900 from last quarter. And now for further details on our guidance.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>We believe it is helpful to provide a reflection of where we are headed for the rest of the fiscal year and help set your expectations by providing target revenue range for the full fiscal year. This guidance is based on our normal seasonality, current pipeline and our view of the business trends based upon the information that we have available today.</p>
          <p>For fiscal year '11, we anticipate total annual revenue will grow in the range of 9 to 12% on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, our comparison for Q3 FY '11 will have one less week than Q3 FY '10. For Q2 FY '11, we expect revenue to be in the range of 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>Going forward, as we have provided previously, we will continue to provide financial guidance for the next fiscal quarter on our earnings conference call. The financial guidance going forward will provide revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the next quarter with reconciliation to GAAP in order to provide perspective to investors regarding our anticipated quarterly performance.</p>
          <p>For Q2 FY '11, we expect operating margins to be in the range of 23 to 25%. Q2 FY '11 earnings per share is expected to range from $0.32 to $0.35 per share. For our Q2 FY '11 GAAP earnings, we anticipate that GAAP EPS will be $0.08 to $0.10 per share lower than the non-GAAP EPS. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more details.</p>
          <p>Other than those items noted above, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional provisions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.</p>
          <p>Our balanced financial results in Q1 demonstrate our ability to execute across many areas within the company. We believe we have competitive advantage that provides us with a platform on which to base profitable growth. We are moving the business forward to deliver results for our customers, our shareholders, and also our employees.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call back over to John.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, thank you very much. I would like to now make some closing comments before turning it back over to Blair for Q&amp;A. We make all of our decisions not on the next quarter or next year but where we want to be three to five years from now. This is where we start all our internal discussions, and this is how we would summarize today's call.</p>
          <p>In terms of the big picture and how the industry will evolve over the next several years, the market transitions are playing out pretty much as we expected in how we position Cisco to lead as the network becomes a platform for next generation technology architectures and new dynamic business organizations. In many of our large enterprise and service provider customer opinions, they view us as not only being a safe and secure during periods of rapid change, but also a very innovative technology and business partner that can help them achieve their goals. And in increasing numbers, they recognize the value of our ability not just to move into new market adjacencies with the networking &#x2013; with the network driving innovation and with our dynamic network organization structures, but also architecturally combine these adjacencies in a way that we believe will be the future for the entire industry.</p>
          <p>We obviously have a large head start on many of our peers, and we fully intend to apply additional resources to expand this lead. The big plays in our traditional markets are going well for Cisco with proof points in recent market share gains in the third calendar quarter of this year as cited by industry analysts in routing, switching, enterprise voice, wireless, and storage area networking, just to name a few.</p>
          <p>The next group of market adjacencies that have large potential in the short term such as collaboration, business video, and data center virtualization all saw strong growth in Q1 in excess of 30%. The market adjacencies that we have that have an intermediate large potential such as cloud computing, Smart Plus connected communities and VCE Vblock implementations are going very well. And a third wave of potentially long-term big opportunities for Cisco in the smart grid, sports and entertainment, virtual healthcare, virtual education and dozens of others are off to a good start.</p>
          <p>Our Enterprise and Commercial businesses are continuing strong, consistent growth and as such are probably the best gauge of economic trends. We did see some challenges in part of our public sector, service provider, and European business. And while the economic environment is not growing as fast as we would all like, we believe these challenges will likely be short term in duration, and that is why we made an exception to our guidance and provided the full fiscal year guidance with all the appropriate caveats and to share our expectations with you for the remainder of fiscal year 2011.</p>
          <p>We feel very good about our ability to rapidly move into these markets and lead in many of them. Will we make some mistakes along the way? Of course we will. Otherwise we are not taking enough good business risk. In simple terms, we believe that this is the opportunity of a lifetime for us, and we are going to go for it. When we get surprised, we will pause, analyze the situation, and adjust appropriately.</p>
          <p>In our view, most of the challenges we experienced in public sector, service provider, and Europe capital spending were outside our ability to control or influence, and therefore will not result in major strategic changes. We will always approach these periodical challenges with a healthy paranoia on what we should do better. But the key take-away from Q1 remains that our vision of the industry's evolution and our strategic differentiation is playing out pretty much as we had desired, and Cisco is strongly positioned to win in these traditional markets and new market adjacencies.</p>
          <p>We will always try to be conservative and transparent in what we are seeing in the market. Our strategy to take advantage of all market transitions balanced with a conservative philosophy in terms of business models and financials combined with a healthy paranoia about what could go wrong.</p>
          <p>In summary, in terms of what we can control or influence, we continue to be feel very confident. At this point in time, I would like to thank our entire Cisco family for their dedication, loyalty, and sacrifices as we navigate these times. I could not be more excited about how we are positioned for the future. As always, I want to thank our shareholders, customers, employees and partners for their support and continued confidence in our ability to execute during rapid industry consolidation, market transitions and challenging economic times.</p>
          <p>Blair, I now turn it over to you for the question and answer session.</p>

          <p>Great, thank you, John. We will now open the call for questions and we do request that sell-side analysts please ask only one question. Before we go to the first question, I would like to reconfirm and clarify a comment we made earlier. Global public sector orders grew only 6% annually, not 60%. So with that, operator, let's open the floor for the first question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Looking at your guidance last quarter, you thought you were going to reduce share count by about 40 million shares. You bought about 110 million back this quarter. Wondering, given the relatively big gap between the growth rates you've been putting up and what you just guided to, it wasn't too hard to predict the stock price is going to go down. Why accelerate the share purchases this quarter? And does that indicate anything about when you came to the conclusion that things were going to be weaker than you maybe thought three months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at what we do, we always purchase the stock during periods when we see it sliding a little bit. But, no, the quarter was shaping up very much as we anticipated for the vast majority of the quarter, and we hit our expectations financially and earnings per share wise. So, no, that had zero to do with purchasing in the marketplace. We intended to be aggressive in the marketplace.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>And, Jeff, we have been doing these share repurchase as you know on an ongoing basis, and we do this over a longer period of time. So we don't make any decisions specifically on the quarter. We make decisions over longer period of time.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John. By most accounts, the economic environment is improving or at least stable, yet the sequential guidance is down 4% to 6%. If anything it seems to be more Cisco related as most companies are beating and raising their outlook. Just trying to see if &#x2013; what the root cause of these polar dynamics, and if it's about catch market transition, how did Cisco miss the cable MSO transition where they are losing video subs and the public sector situation, which has become more seasonal? And then lastly, Frank, I don't think you mentioned the gross margin guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So a couple questions. First is I think everyone on this call understands what's going on in public sector. So I'd be very surprised if that does not have an effect on companies who do business in public sector on a global basis. For us it is 22% of our business, and as a reminder, our enterprise is 23% of our business. Public sector is 22% of our business. The commercial is about 20% of our business, and service provider is about 33% of our business.</p>
          <p>So within our service provider segment, it is growing very well for us in our traditional routing, switching, next generation networks. We're up over 14%, as an example, and we're doing great in terms of the partnerships, the data center implementation, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Now, we're going to be, Mark, in probably 40 different product categories and areas, and in a given quarter, you basically are not going to have them all hitting at the same time. And you're going to have a couple of challenges. During normal quarters, you usually have growth in one area that balances a lack of growth in others. This quarter because of our missing our sales forecast, and we almost never miss, we've got a world-class sales team, and we normally &#x2013; what we say we're going to get in terms of orders, we usually get or exceed within orders.</p>
          <p>In terms of the MSOs, part of that also, as you know, is about how fast they are building out new houses, new operations, and the MSOs are in a transition from a traditional set-top box capability to IP set-top boxes where we're doing very well within that. So we saw the transition coming. We've positioned ourselves for the long run pretty well. We made a couple changes in our Scientific Atlanta group in terms of management, but Mark, it's just one of multiple areas.</p>
          <p>And in terms of Europe, I think what we outlined in Europe again in terms of momentum, most people see Europe like we do. Hitting some challenges, a couple of challenges along the way, especially in the government spending side of the house. Too early to call it a trend, but they are experiencing some drops.</p>
          <p>So I would say, Mark, I thought your challenge in your question was really to help in many ways staying where we are. I think the only one that I would draw attention to is our cable business, and that's because it's very unique to Cisco in terms of the market going on there. But if you look at the total cable transition, new competitors, a lot of new players, that is a market in transition, and I would say where we are two to three years from now will say how well we caught that transition or not, not what we did in a given quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, as far as the guidance, as we have been talking about for some time, our focus is really on top line and profitability. That's how we manage the business, looking at the growth rates from revenue and also looking at our operating margins. It's also how we have been guiding you and others to focus on operating margin, so we think that's important over a longer period of time, which is why I gave guidance on operating margin.</p>
          <p>As far as the gross margin is concerned, we have in the near term probably two factors that would affect gross margins. First, as you would expect with the guidance that we gave on revenue, volume. So as volume comes down that has a negative impact on margins. And then as the other thing that relates to Q2, which I think is important, is the seasonality of some of our businesses like consumer. Consumer tends to have a very high participation based on the holidays in the second quarter. And as you know, the margin for consumer is lower. So the mix does have a negative impact.</p>
          <p>So those are two factors to take into consideration for Q2 from a gross margin perspective. But bearing this, from a longer-term perspective, let's say for the rest of the year, we see margins in that 64% range similar to what I had provided last quarter.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have a question on your full-year guidance. If I assume next quarter is going to be normal seasonality of 6% up, then the &#x2013; sorry, the quarter after, then 4Q you need to get 10% to hit your annual guidance. So that means you're assuming very strong growth for 3Q and 4Q regardless of the distribution between the two quarters. And the question is, what kind of visibility you have or what's the basis for this strong guidance? And second, where do you think you're going to have the strength? What kind of areas or what kind of regions? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Tal. First of all, our view on this guidance is we're disappointed. This is something that if we were to look back just a quarter ago, we expected it to be in the mid-teens or higher, and that's what I think our growth rates should be. If you look, we've got a couple air pockets that we hit. You adjust to those air pockets as you go through in terms of the direction. And if you look at the strengths for the third and fourth quarter of the year, with the third quarter &#x2013; and remember, we've got one extra week that we don't get this year in terms of comparison.</p>
          <p>Rob and I, as you would expect, have gone through in painstaking detail over the last couple weeks, Rob, looking very carefully about where we are in terms of the pipeline, and we see good balance literally in all the segments. Service provider, you will have problems next quarter in terms of the cable business, but I would anticipate it coming back up into positive growth in North America, and I think we're well positioned for that. I think we're very well positioned longer-term service provider, and out of the traditional service provider players in North America, around the world, our position is the strongest it has been.</p>
          <p>Enterprise and commercial is actually very solid off of very tough comparisons to a year ago, and so when you think of bookings a year ago, remember our order lead times at that time were very stretched out. So people were ordering in Q1 not just what they needed in the next normal period but ordering beyond that, and so we have tough comps in terms of the direction.</p>
          <p>In terms of emerging markets, Edzard has nailed it in Asia Pacific and handled the challenges in Japan remarkably well. And the investments in the five top emerging-market countries, not as a sales machine, but as a true trusted government partner, investment in business development, engineering, et cetera, is paying the dividends, where the slowest growing of those was China with 30% growth, India and Brazil at 60, and Russia at over 100. That is extremely, extremely solid.</p>
          <p>So if you look at our business across the board, it has not changed dramatically. Collaboration is on fire. The data center we're taking share and moving rapidly on. Our core product areas we gained share in the last quarter, and there will be quarters up and quarters down, but if you watch us over time, it's very rare we lose share in our key markets. We usually continue to gain even when we have very, very high percentage gains.</p>
          <p>So, Tal, I'm disappointed in that fourth quarter just being at the higher end as you said of a given number. And I think if you get normal economies and you watch us making the decisions as we said in my statements, not on the short-term immediate, but where we want to be one, two, and three years out, I'm very comfortable with our long-term growth aspirations in the 12% to 17%. I do think we've got a couple pockets here we have to fly through that surprised us, quite candidly.</p>
          <p>And to answer the question that was asked earlier, we bought stock because we thought it was a good price in terms of momentum for where it would be not just a quarter out but one year and two years and three years out in terms of direction, Tal.</p>
          <p>So that &#x2013; I tried to answer about four questions combined with making it sound like one, Blair. You can give me an evaluation on it later.</p>

          <p>John, you said that the quarter unfolded as you expected. And then at the end of your talk, you said that orders missed, if I got it right, your internal projections by about $500 million. So at what point did the orders start falling behind your target rate? Was that before or after September Analysts Day? Just trying to gauge did they right from the get go start falling a little bit behind and ended up at 500 million behind, or was that something that sort of happened very recently?</p>
          <p>And then on the inventory side, for Frank, with customer lead times back to normal, I would expect the inventory levels to start coming back down again. Wondering why the inventory is high, and I assume at this price point where the stock is trading right now, you'll be buying back a lot of stock because you bought it at 22 and the stock is back down there, so your thoughts on that?</p>

          <p>Okay. So in terms of the sequence on the quarter, the quarter was within our normal seasonality in terms of mix for each of the three months, the first month being a little bit light and the last month being a little bit stronger, but the middle month being right in the middle. So it was pretty much normal, Rob, would you say?</p>
          <p>In terms of the momentum, we are a world-class sales organization, and when we make forecasts, we stick by them, and candidly, our ability to close on them is very, very good. So we felt very comfortable with the quarter and direction, and the quarter was not a concern in terms of making our commitments that we made from a revenue perspective or earnings-per-share perspective.</p>
          <p>The real key is understanding what's happening in public sector, and that really is slowly becoming obvious to us in terms of certain segments of it and with the cable group where our service provider team felt pretty good about their forecast going into the quarter and the growth here in the U.S. and just reminding everyone, that group had experienced growth three quarters in a row of 20% plus.</p>
          <p>For the second part of the questions, Frank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So from an inventory standpoint, we went from 1.3 billion at the end of Q4 to 1.5 billion, so about a $200 million increase. The reason for that, there are two things from a business perspective. One has to do, as I mentioned before, on the margin side, the seasonality of our consumer business. As you would expect, we have anticipated a significant number of shipments to our channel partners in this month, actually, in November, so we usually build that inventory toward the end of Q1. So that's one of the drivers there.</p>
          <p>The second driver is we also have a planned shutdown with one of our manufacturing facilities during the holidays as it relates to our cable business, and so we do build ahead some of that inventory which we have done in the October month in anticipation of that. So that's factored in.</p>
          <p>And then the third piece, which is probably the smallest of that, is just the anticipation of shipping more in the quarter and then having a little bit more in inventory as we move into November. But it's primarily the first two that are driving that delta, the seasonality for consumer, as well as the need for our set-top box business.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, what's going on? So, Frank, going back on that inventory question, the raw material inventory increased 53% quarter on quarter and 98% year on year looking at our numbers. Was that driven by &#x2013; were there component shortages you were trying to deal with that you may have overshot on? Would we expect to see some type of correction in that in the following quarter?</p>
          <p>And then, John, in terms of the &#x2013; with the stock coming down here a bit, can you talk a little bit about your strategy in terms of looking at acquisitions and any change to that? Anything you think in particular that looks, given the changes that you're seeing in the networks, that looks particularly interesting to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Frank, you go first. I'll get the second piece.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just make it a general statement about the supply before I go into the specific question. Now, I know over the last several quarters we've been talking about some of the supply challenges that we've had and most in the industry have experienced. And I did mention as part of the call that in Q1, we did increase or actually get to our lead time objective across most of our products. So we have seen a substantial improvement in our supply in meeting the customer requirements, which we have been working on now for a couple of quarters. That's some of the good news.</p>
          <p>Now, as far as specifically going forward and looking at the inventory and the raw material question, that was about up a hundred quarter-on-quarter. And the other was finished goods; that was up about a hundred quarter-on-quarter. That's the 200 that was I was talking about before, so the explanation for that on the raw materials as well as on the finished goods was related to consumer products as well as for the set-top box based on the seasonality and then also the shutdown that we have. Nothing abnormal from the standpoint of buying ahead parts, as I said, things for us are coming a little bit more in balance on that.</p>
          <p>Now, the overall supply chain I think in general from a component standpoint is still tight, so we'll have to continue to work on that the next couple quarters. But from an inventory management standpoint, we're getting much better aligned this quarter versus where we were a couple quarters ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of what looks interesting in the opportunity, majority of our cash, as all of you are aware, is overseas. I'm still optimistic that I think our country should recognize the leverage that 1.2 trillion represents that will be invested outside the U.S. if we don't create a favorable environment to bring it back.</p>
          <p>And I don't mean to imply that the whole group would come back, but Cisco would bring back almost all of our overseas which is well in excess of 30 billion. And I think the odds are reasonably good, well better than 50/50, that our government will come to the same conclusion on that, and it's one of the few levers that they can really hit that doesn't cost the taxpayer anything. In fact, the taxpayer makes money on it. That could create not just jobs but investments in assets here, investments in manufacturing capability, investments in, candidly, doing acquisitions or paying dividends. So it's something that I would hope that we will do.</p>
          <p>In terms of would this change our acquisition strategy, the answer is absolutely no. We're making decisions for the long run. We hit a couple of air pockets here, that's what they are. And you all have watched us hit these air pockets over the years. We wish we were smart enough to see them coming. We were not this time, and by the way we're normally not.</p>
          <p>If you were to ask me what concerns me most about everything we covered today, it's that we missed our sales forecast. We don't do that very often. If we were to see that occur a second quarter, that would really concern us in terms of is something going on in the industry at a very large scale? So we're not perfect. We don't get it right. Our track record has been very good.</p>
          <p>We clearly missed this one in terms of the order rates that occurred, but again when you have lead times very low, you don't &#x2013; customers don't have to order very far out. So you can basically wait and wait and wait until you want to order as opposed to when lead times are long, you have to order at the beginning of the quarter, the middle of the quarter, so that's why you really don't know where your quarter is going to end up until you are literally closing the quarter in the last couple of weeks in terms of how much pressure there is going to be or not within the areas. And to answer the question indirectly, we came down even at that time by a fair amount on it.</p>
          <p>Having said all of the above, you walk through with our sales team. The big picture hasn't changed. The major transitions that are going on, we're in great shape for. We're taking market share in most of the areas we're moving into. There may be a quarter or two where we're not. But as a whole, we're really world class in this. And what we miss this quarter is usually when we have one area trip, we have another area or two that is very strong to pick it up.</p>
          <p>This time we had 22% of our business begin to trip at a much faster pace than anybody would have anticipated and it wasn't all but it was a fair amount of the public sector. And we had one segment of service provider trip at a time that normally we might have picked it up in another segment of the service provider. We just didn't do it at this time. So if you look at the big picture, it has not changed very much. And to answer the question back, the quarter in terms of the big picture, I mean, the big plays that we're making on new markets, the big plays we're making in emerging countries, the plays we're making on collaboration and the data center, those did not change. We had a couple challenges, and we'll manage through those. But I think we'll look back and say they were just air pockets and good bumps, but we'll go right through them.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Nikos Theodosopoulos with UBS. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I'm trying to think of how to ask this question. So I guess, John, the question is, in covering Cisco for many years, when there's been a fairly significant reset in expectations, from my recollection it's typically been during big macro changes: the tech bubble and then maybe in the 2008, 2009 recession, so this one here is a bit surprising. And I understand the way you explained it with public sector and cable. You know, and there was actually a question last conference call specific to public sector, and management said we actually reviewed that this morning prior to the call, and we don't think there will be an issue.</p>
          <p>So my question is, given the breadth of what the company is doing and the many different businesses it is now than it used to be, do you think that you need to change your process in trying to figure out what the bookings and revenue targets would be? Because this is a pretty significant reset when the rest of the company &#x2013; the rest of the industry isn't seeing this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm not going to comment what the rest of the industry is seeing or not. We're one month behind some of our peers in the industry and direction, but I think the challenge is fair. And if you were to look in terms of across our product lines, most of our product lines and areas, Nikos, are in very good shape.</p>
          <p>The second &#x2013; and so if you look at the total picture and you take our top 20 product category groups, we went through them I think pretty slowly in terms of what our growth is, and I could walk through those again, whether it's high end routing, whether it's access routing, whether it's the edge routing, the modular switching, the fixed switching, the data center, the collaboration, the video capability, and progress on UCS and others. So our balance is good there.</p>
          <p>Second, you're right, that when there have been major industry issues, as you see occurred in our Q3, and those issues we said were long-term in terms of implication. What we have here is a public sector area that I think I would be surprised if anybody on the call thinks the public sector spending over the next year is going to be dramatically strong on a global basis for those developed countries, and each of you have to form your own opinion on that. What surprised us is it happened quicker than we thought, and you're absolutely right. Rob and I looked at that last time, and the forecast stayed well. That's why I raised the area as we don't miss the forecast very often. Sometimes that can be an elbow.</p>
          <p>We think this is not an elbow toward a down trend. We think this is a bump in two to three areas of our business, and we think the majority of our core business, Nikos, is in very good shape. That's why we gave the yearly guidance that I know you're nudging me towards. That's why we took a step out and even with these uncertainties, gave guidance that I think one of your colleagues was very correct in assuming what it would probably be with all the appropriate caveats by Q4 which is just two quarters out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. John, I think everyone understands your comments on gaining share in all of these new data center collaboration and markets. I think where we have some concerns is around the fact that it seems like you're losing a lot of share in your core legacy markets. And when we look at security, you're down 2%. Every other security vendor is up 10, 15. In Wireless, you're up 9, but everyone else, 10, 15. I'm not going to talk about application networking. We all know what the situation is there. And based on your guidance going into next quarter, I would assume your switching revenue is going to be down a good 10, 15% sequentially, which again would raise the questions of where Juniper and HP are taking business away, even the routing business for you, while doing well this quarter, up 13% year-over-year for your biggest competitor across the street. It's up more than 20.</p>
          <p>So I guess the question is, when you look at our core markets, I mean, do you feel you &#x2013; you're not losing sight on your core markets? Do you feel that all this investment and focus on the new areas you can still execute on that without dropping the ball and losing focus on what you do best historically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you always want to look as we said before when you get surprised and we did get surprised in the quarter, you basically pause, you analyze what you think went well, what you need to improve on, and then you have the courage to go right back aggressively. We've been doing these together for what, 15 years now. And that's what we're doing here. This is minor bumps in terms of the direction on where we're going to head as a company.</p>
          <p>I'm going to constructively challenge you, Ittai, in terms of your market share gains. Access routing is an example. The data just came out that we gained a point on that again year-over-year and we're up to 87% market share according to the industry analyst and gained quarter-to-quarter as well. This is what occurred the third calendar quarter. In terms of switching, we again gained 2 points year-over-year according to analysts with a market share of 70% plus. In terms of Wireless LAN, that was an area that we had lost share over a couple quarters, and if you watch what Brett and the team has done on the Wireless LAN, it was up 3 points quarter-over-quarter this last quarter in terms of direction.</p>
          <p>Security is an area that we want to improve on. I'm very comfortable with what Padma and Brett are doing in the security architecture. We spent a lot of time over the last couple of quarters in terms of this direction. And security is set up for an architectural play. It has to tie to routing and switching, the data center, and the server type capability. And enterprise voice I think we gained four points on that over the last year, had a very solid quarter-to-quarter gain on that.</p>
          <p>In terms of UCS, you can do the market share numbers as quickly as I can, a play that most people didn't anticipate us being in, we gained probably in excess of 5 points year-over-year and a couple points this last quarter. Even areas like SAN, we gained according to this industry analyst that I have in front of me 6% year-over-year and a couple points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>To the two areas ANS and WAAS that you said here are some areas that we have good competitors like F5 and some of the others in, we did lose market shares in those two categories. By the way, out of the markets that I've just run through, the nine or ten that I mentioned &#x2013; let me see: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine that I mentioned, those are the two smallest. They're very meaningful in a billion dollar plus market opportunities for someone, but if you look at the sequence I just went down through in terms of the largest market size, we're doing very well in the top seven of the nine and the two that we're losing share in, and I don't want to lose share anywhere, are ones that are, while still very material, smaller.</p>
          <p>So I want you to continue to challenge us, Ittai, but respectfully, I think actually our execution here is pretty good. And I wouldn't lead &#x2013; when you bump &#x2013; when you hit a bump or an air pocket, that doesn't mean what you're doing strategy-wise hasn't been right all the way along, and we've been executing very well, and I'm very comfortable with where we need to go. However, I realize part of what you do as the leader, it's when you hit that air pocket, you are good at challenges, that's your job, and I welcome the challenges.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry about that. John, I wanted to follow up with you on your orders coming in about 500 million below your forecast. Is that entirely explained by the 3 items you mentioned, the U.S. cable segment, public sector, and Europe? Or were there other smaller factors as well? And if you can rank order those three, that would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And then just again comparing your outlook to some of the larger competitors in your space that have reported, I look at Juniper. Their product backlog was up 25% sequentially. I look at Motorola which also has a significant set-top box presence and also significant public safety business that sells to state and local governments, and in both of those cases, their Q4 outlook was actually for sequential growth. And so just wanted to see if you can clarify a little bit further if this is a macro issue or a Cisco specific issue or if there is some rotation in priority maybe that is affecting you guys disproportionately?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would break it into the answer would be a C that you didn't give. In terms of let's say in terms of maybe it's our product areas, we're doing pretty well in most all of them. We have an area in the cable space that I think is due to a combination of factors. I think we discussed that one pretty well.</p>
          <p>In terms of the government business, we're trying to get ahead in terms of our projections. We were surprised at how quickly that dropped off, and it didn't come back at the end as aggressively as we would like in terms of the direction.</p>
          <p>Having said that, it depends on where you're selling. Our federal business was very solid with growth in the mid-teens or slightly above if I remember right, Rob, on that. Our Asia Pacific business is very strong, and you heard our comments on the 5 key emerging countries and our overall emerging countries averaging 32% growth year-over-year off of tough comps last year that were aided in part by long lead times in terms of people ordering ahead.</p>
          <p>Now, there will always be an area or two that there are competitors gaining a little bit of ground on us. This time I agree with you in terms of the set-top box comparison on that. And part of that depends on which accounts you're selling to and which accounts are ordering within that in terms of the direction.</p>
          <p>So if you look overall, I think the government spending I would be very surprised if we're on this call a year from now and there's a lot of feedback that government spending did not tighten up in terms of the areas. You all see what's going on a global basis as well as I do in the developed countries, developing, Japan, the U.S., Canada, Western Europe, in terms of the direction.</p>
          <p>So are there a couple areas where competitors have gained some momentum? Yes, there will always be. If there isn't, you probably aren't in good markets. But in the majority of areas, I'm very comfortable with where we are and where we're going. And I would hope that the numbers that I shared today gave you a good feeling about where we're doing on those numbers whether it was about orders and we deliberately gave those in collaboration as well in data center and video as well as the revenue numbers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When we think about the government business, is this more legacy products or even some of the next generation products, cloud computing type applications that you're seeing a slow down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's too early to break it that finely. It's a good question, Rob. Something we might want to think about as a group. I think what you're seeing is it varies by government, by country, by city, by state as an example. Some of the states, as you know, have a required balanced budget clause, so you have to do whatever you have to do to balance that. So for those states, you're going to see the brakes hit pretty hard in terms of spending in any category.</p>
          <p>Secondly, where you're leading me, you're absolutely right. Most governments if they're saying I'm going to have to maintain this spending not only at the point in time now but probably ongoing, they're going to begin to look at how they deliver services differently. They'll begin to look at what they can do on cloud, how they combine their data centers, how they get higher productivity as their employees retire over time and direction. So in the long run, this could actually play back reverse to being an advantage for technology spending.</p>
          <p>But if it is truly discretionary spending, I think we're going to see some governments put the brakes on firmly across everything. I think you're going to see some where they're going to have pretty good leaders and pretty good IT leaders who will say the way to put on the brakes is do it selectively and do it like a surgeon and pick and choose where you go and here are the areas that can actually give you more leverage, and then there will be a few who I think basically will say now is the chance, I've got to transform my government, and I'm going to use this as a transition. And I think it's mixed use. You watch our own group in the U.S., and spending is in the mid-teens or a little bit higher, and it varies by state within that.</p>
          <p>That's a nice way of saying, Brian, we're going to take a look at that, but I think it will be probably be A, B, and C in terms of its implementation.</p>

          <p>Well, I think it gives an opportunity for a company to be a partner with an individual city, using our terms, a province or a state, or the country as a whole. What was exciting in what we saw in the Smart Plus Connected Communities, is Songdo, which was the original leader that we worked with in this area where you're looking at literally a couple hundred million dollars in Cisco implementation alone within their city of the future in terms of the early phases, and how that's going to be a model for how you do everything from traffic control to delivering virtual healthcare, to education, to safety and security.</p>
          <p>The key takeaway is there are a lot of cities in China that have &#x2013; remember, I think it's 200 cities with a million plus people that are going to say I really want to position ourselves for the future. But we saw the exact same interest, Rob, in Australia, in the U.S. I mean, the builders out of Australia said this is what we need to put in place in terms of our implementation.</p>
          <p>And what you're leading me toward, Brian, is the message that I think I want to deliver very swiftly is many of these new markets we're in are unfolding exactly as we had hoped and wanted. And they can be almost thought of in four categories, the first one being our traditional router, switching, VoIP, wireless LAN, business, voice within that, and those we did very well on.</p>
          <p>Then there'll be a first tier of opportunities. I would put data center collaboration into that, and we gave you very good numbers of the next wave of big opportunities.</p>
          <p>Then the third wave will be areas like smart grid and cloud. And you're beginning to see those unfold as we're seeing within that. So this is a nice way of saying when people look and say, hey, was this an air pocket, a quick bump that we hit, or something more fundamental? Unless I'm missing something, this is an air pocket that we did hit. We hit a couple of them at the same time. We are sharing that very transparent with you, and we will always, number one, be aggressive but with appropriate business risk involved, and that isn't going to change here. We will analyze where we are, put the foot back down on the gas pedal, and go again.</p>
          <p>Now, to answer one of your peers' questions, you've got to say when you missed on an area, are you going to be analyzing the sales forecasts with Rob and I in more detail with the team? Of course we are. Will we change our operating committee group in terms of spending more time on operation reviews and more detail within that? Of course we will on that. But I view those to be minor adjustments, and unless you're seeing something that I'm not seeing, we're winning our product direction. We're winning on our innovation, we're winning on our big architectural plays, and we've got a couple markets here that are pretty sizable for Cisco, two of which I'd say we would have zero control over, given what the budgets are going to be and the direction in the short term and one that you can say, well, we could have executed a little bit better, which I think is fair.</p>
          <p>If there isn't out of our top 20 markets one or two you say each quarter we could have executed on, we probably either haven't done a good job of sharing that with you or we aren't pushing ourselves in terms of traction. We just did not have a couple other areas that picked up the slack here. And you're talking about probably 30% of our business that was affected here.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks, Brian. Okay, so John, we have time for two more questions. We'll take one real quick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>You go by Richard, don't you?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's great. Thanks, John. John, you've talked about this a little bit in answer to prior questions, but &#x2013; and you've talked about backward-looking market share, but is there anything you can tell us in terms of bid win rates or other competitive metrics that you track throughout the quarter to make us comfortable that the shortfall in orders outside the cable segment, I guess is primarily market and not a competitive issue for you? Were your order win rates or your bid win rates consistent with where you wanted them to be, and it was just simply a fall-off in orders, or what additional detail are you able to provide there, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to take a crack at it. But I'm going to let Rob take the first part, and then I will follow on on it as I think about how I want to answer it. Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I think that some of the questions have revolved around our ability to convert pipeline into orders. And clearly as you've seen, state governments go through a series of elections in the United States. That's a period in which not a lot of projects are converted to orders as new governments get formed and decisions may be pushed out a quarter or two. It's a little bit harder getting orders in some of the state and local governments.</p>
          <p>Clearly we've seen universities innovating and buying technology. Education is out there, but it's a little bit slow on getting E-Rate funding, which then funds some of those projects. So a little bit of this is around project funding and capture rather than wins and losses. And I think what you said is we're winning a lot of major franchises and opportunities, but converting those in orders will depend on the ability of an institution to actually fund and complete those projects, and therefore I don't think we're seeing any change in win rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's get more basic than that if we could, Rob, and then I'll take the second phase. In terms of when you go up against Juniper, when you go up against HP, when you go up against an IBM in a data center architectural play, are you seeing any fundamental change in terms of the win rates in this area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I just wanted Rob to say that rather than me for two reasons: First, is if you look at where we are, there is nobody that matches the CRS-3 and CRS-1, and the area where we were exposed at the edge that you all fairly criticized us on a year ago, we're taking market share, and I was very direct in terms of edge and wireless that you would probably see a major bump this next quarter alone.</p>
          <p>In terms of access, we're at 87% market share according to that analyst. It doesn't get much better than that and we actually gained share. In terms of switching, might there be a quarter or two where numbers go up or down slightly? We do very well. In terms of are some of our competitors in installed accounts, when we start to win, saying, "I'll give you the product for free," so are you seeing some aggressive moves from some of them? You are seeing that in terms of direction.</p>
          <p>But our win rates is very good. You go into data center. We are literally knocking off one service provider after another. We're knocking off enterprise account after enterprise account to already be at 40 that are $1 million plus in run rates there feels very good.</p>
          <p>So I will give you that in terms of set-top boxes, Motorola gained market share this quarter. I will give you that in ANS and WAAS, which out of the nine areas I talked about, we have a couple good competitors there. But by the way, the seven areas that are all bigger than that and even higher strategically for Cisco, so both bigger market opportunity, et cetera, we're doing extremely well in.</p>
          <p>In the wireless LAN just an example, a year ago, we had a little bit of a product mismatch with some of our competitors. Now we're ramping up at a very fast pace in terms of wireless LAN, and we took this most recent quarter 3 points on that.</p>
          <p>So maybe you're seeing something we're not, but I'm very comfortable with where we are on products and this innovation engine is on fire. So I keep going back, an air pocket that we hit, not a dramatic one in terms of change, in terms of where we expect to be in two to three quarters from now. We feel pretty good about our momentum and the direction wise and the issues that we can control or influence, I think we're as strong as ever. So you can come back at me and invite anybody on the phone to come back, but where we are in terms of our product sets and the competitiveness, we're very, very good on that.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One last question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our last question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. It's real two quick housekeeping ones. Excluding the cable operators, John, what was the service provider order growth in Q1? And also what percentage of public sector is U.S. fed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> back into it. In terms of &#x2013; I don't think I have the cable operators outside U.S. broken down, although cable operations in Europe actually grew and we did well on both traditional cable operations, as well as IP set-top boxes. Is that what you remember, Rob? Okay.</p>
          <p>To the second part, the federal business in terms of our overall approach grew in the mid-teens and was very solid on that. State and local, that tends to be &#x2013; go back and forth versus education, probably 45-55, or a 40-60 type of basis. State government was down pretty dramatically as I shared with you all. Local government was down a little bit.</p>
          <p>In terms of education, as Rob alluded to, higher education is actually going well for us. Its growth rate was mid-teens or higher. And that's probably a pretty reasonable expectation going forward. For K1 through 12 and E-Rate is a little bit tougher, as you all know, in the marketplace. I think that was down slightly.</p>
          <p>In terms of total federal business, which I was &#x2013; and total government business in the U.S., I was giving you all time to see if one of you could do the math for me. I'd probably have to look at it in terms of basis, but 22, 24% probably of the U.S. business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess U.S. fed is 24% of the total U.S. or total public sector &#x2013; total U.S. public sector or total global public sector?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me get the numbers and look at that on a follow-up rather than shoot from the hip. We're all looking at tables.</p>
          <p>In terms of the business &#x2013; remember, the Federal business is heavily weighted to the beginning of the fiscal year. So Q2 in Federal while we would anticipate good growth rates there, is not near as big as Q1. So there are seasonalities by segments within this and when orders occur within it overall.</p>
          <p>But I think that the safe number to use is what we see on a global basis. It's 22% of our business is public sector. And our enterprise business is 23%, and our commercial business is 20%. So the 23% which is enterprise and the 20% commercial we feel very good about.</p>
          <p>The government business, again, we think we're well positioned to win more than our fair share there, so I don't think you're going to see us have surprising market share losses unless I'm missing something in that category and we'll get our fair share over time. The one area that I do think that we have room for improvement on is the cable business, and part of that reminding everyone is also dependent on which customers you have, whether their order rates, etcetera, depend on which vendors they standardize on.</p>
