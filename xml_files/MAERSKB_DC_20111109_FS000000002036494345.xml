          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to the A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Q3 Interim Report, 2011. Today, I'm pleased to present the Group CEO, Nils S. Andersen, and Group CFO, Trond Westlie. For the first part of this call, all participants will be in listen-only mode and afterwards, there'll be a question-and-answer session. Speakers, please begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So good morning and welcome to this call on the third quarter of A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk. I'm here as <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:00:28) with Trond, our CFO, Trond Westlie, and we look forward to a good, lively discussion.</p>
          <p>If you go through slide number two, the forward-looking statements reservations, and while you read, of course we are fully aware that we are presenting a mixed bag here. We're coming out with a pretty negative result for the Maersk Line. And we've not been able to alleviate ourselves from the crisis in the shipping industry. Fortunately, I think this was expected. But also some positive elements and continued very good performance in our other core businesses. Terminals is developing well and we are seeing good development in the drilling business and offshore business as well. And of course, the oil business continues to benefit from very strong prices and, hopefully, we will see good results from the heavy investments we're making in exploration and acquisitions we have been making over the last year.</p>
          <p>So a mixed bag, but with that, let's jump into it and to slide three, the highlights. And, as I just said, the majority of the group business unit performed well. We feel we delivered good returns, basically in everything outside the shipping businesses. The liner shipping turned loss-making in the third quarter as our market rates dropped dramatically. We were all in the industry gearing up for price increases and good use of capacity, but unfortunately that didn't materialize. And that meant that we had to withdraw some price increases, and not <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:02:28) others. So, the final result was that rates actually went down during the quarter, which is, of course, highly unusual for peak season.</p>
          <p>But we continued to execute on the group strategy. We signed or an agreement to sell Maersk LNG. We're awaiting some approvals but we expect this to happen in the near future. We continued to be very active in the exploration area and Maersk Oil has expanded its resource base, I'll come back to that in a minute. Maersk Line, with its daily sailings from Asia to Europe, has expanded its service offering, and we feel that this is a new step in the history of container shipping. And so far, although it's very early days, we've only received good feedback from customers and are quite optimistic on the future of this product.</p>
          <p>APM Terminals continue to expand its portfolio. We will come back to the financial figures in a minute. But they are really building up a very nice business with consistent good performance. And Maersk Drilling continued to do well in the operations. And on the back of ordering new rigs, it was. of course, very comforting to see that there's a continued good interest for those rigs. So we've signed one of the very large jack-ups we ordered for Norway <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:04:02). And one of the three very large semi-submersibles have been signed to BP in the last weeks. So that is very pleasing to see and that makes us believe that we are really on the right track with our strategy.</p>
          <p>If you move to slide number four, financial highlights, basically we had improved profits in all core businesses if you look at the nine-month period, except Maersk Line, where the declining rates have led to a loss in the third quarter, a loss that we expect to continue into the fourth quarter. And we'll come back to that.</p>
          <p>Maersk Oil has not increased its profits in the third quarter. We'll come back to that as well. The reason for that being that we have seen &#x2013; a quite big jump in exploration process was foreseen, we have advised that. But maybe it's been more than what's expected in the market.</p>
          <p>The revenue continued to grow and I think this is very important to have in mind that we are in tough industries in the shipping business, but it is still growth markets and the trouble we have in the industries are basically homemade with too much capacity being ordered. The revenue growth has been stable throughout the year, 9% year-on-year, both in year-to-date and in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our profits, on the other hand, declined dramatically with 78% to $370 million &#x2013; $371 million in the third quarter and in the full year, accumulated 26% to $3.1 billion, and that means that the ROIC in the fourth quarter was only 4.8% against a three quarter result of 10%.</p>
          <p>The cash flow from operation remained stable. And also in the third quarter, cash flow from operations of $2.1 billion. So, we feel that underlines the solidity of our businesses. And we did have quite a hefty investment program in the third quarter. One of the big payments we had was the $2.1 billion that we had to pay for SK Energy. And that means that we had a negative cash flow for the quarter.</p>
          <p>And that means that &#x2013; for the year as well &#x2013; that means that we now have an interest bearing of $14.5 billion, compared to last year, $13.7 billion and $11.7 billion at the beginning of the year. So a growth in the net interest-bearing debt but still, of course, at very, very reasonable levels and much lower than just a couple of years ago.</p>
          <p>If you go to slide five, we'll go into the individual businesses, the first one being the container business. And here we're, of course, satisfied with the volume growth. We increased our volumes with 16%. And, I think, again, that underlines that we are in a growth industry. And the problems of the industry are really homemade due to excess ordering of capacity and, probably also, a not too good way of handling excess capacity. And that meant that rates declined 12%. And when that comes on top of an increase of 48% in bunker prices compared to the same period last year, that of course means or leads to a dramatic decline in earnings and we actually went into the red area with a loss or negative profit of $300 million.</p>
          <p>We had an increase in unit costs by 2% in Q3 compared to the same period last year and 5% year-to-date. And this is excluding bunker costs. The main reason for this is that we've seen increased cost for time charters and we had extremely low costs in time charters last year. We're signing up now, also, very low rates but that will not benefit us this year so much. It'll be more into next year. So, the peak of the upturn in rates we had earlier in the year is coming back to haunt us little bit here.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we see also increase in cost for terminals. This is partly because terminals are better at withstanding price pressure than the lines, but also because we're seeing more shipments into areas where the terminal costs are higher. If we look at the EBIT per FFE, we went into a loss, of course, $124 per FFE loss against the profit of $616 per FFE last year, which was probably close to a record we've ever had. So, a dramatic drop and something we're not pleased with.</p>
          <p>The Daily Maersk service concept has been introduced. It's very early days. As I said before, we're in probably three weeks into the program. But so far, the reception has been good, but with the present nature of the industry, unfortunately, it doesn't mean that we can take really superior rates. And so we are, of course, also feeling the price pressure in spite of this.</p>
          <p>If you move to slide number six, we have the oil and gas activities. Here we have a 14% lower production share. And this is a natural decline, plus, of course, the shut down at Gryphon, and then we had one and a half month closedown at Dumbarton for maintenance purposes, which impacted us negatively. On top of that, the high oil prices will, due to the nature of the contract in Qatar, also mean that our share would go down for that reason alone. Of course, the businesses &#x2013; or the business benefited from a 48% higher oil price and, with $113 per barrel, this was &#x2013; remained in very healthy levels, in spite of the much talked about economic slowdown around the world.</p>
          <p>We have increased the exploration cost quite dramatically in the third quarter. This was planned and we have informed about it. So there's nothing really new, but we now can sort of firm up and say that we do expect our exploration cost to exceed $1 billion for the year. We have a very, very intense drilling program ongoing at the moment. And hopefully, we will also see exciting results coming out of it.</p>
          <p>In specifics, new developments in this business, we have a significant increase in the Maersk Oil's share in the Avaldsnes find, based on the operator statements. And we now expect that to be somewhere between 160 million and 360 million barrels our share, against 20 million to 80 million barrels earlier. So it's a properly quoted figure, so no surprise, but I just wanted to mention it here.</p>
          <p>We're also moving forward with our own field development plans and we expect to post for the small development for Flyndre/Cawdor, which is a cross border of development between Norway and the UK. We expect to post a development plan during this quarter. And we do also expect to post plans for Chissonga in mid-2012. We are in the middle of appraisal drillings in that area, as you'll see on the next chart.</p>
          <p>Looking at the pipeline, we have the same chart as we introduced last year. The plans or the fields where we already have field development plans approved, and in preparation, this is Kazakhstan, Algeria, UK and the US. And the only change here is that the Golden Eagle forecast has been upgraded slightly by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:13:45) compared to last time.</p>
          <p>If we look at the individual discoveries, things are ongoing in Chissonga. We are, as I said before, drilling an appraisal well as we speak. We expect one more to be done in 2012 before we have the final vision of the field. We are also drilling at the moment. We've just finalized a well in Itaipu in Brazil, which is one of the SK fields that we acquired and just paid for. And there's a statement out by Anadarko today for this field, they are not the operator, but they made the statement anyway, so you can see that on their homepage.</p>
          <p>Apart from that, as I said before, positive development in the resource estimates at Avaldsnes and then we have drillings ongoing in the Culzean, in Jackdaw and in Buckskin, as we speak. And, of course, needless to say, we hope that there will be positive outcome of at least some of these.</p>
          <p>Going to slide eight, the terminal activities, we are quite pleased or very pleased with this business. It continues to develop well. You'll see at the bottom how the ROIC has developed over the last years. And given that the company is basically not more than seven years old, this is a very exciting development, when considering that this is infrastructure business and investments are really very, very long term in their nature.</p>
          <p>A growth of 11%, 10% like-to-like. This is slightly better than the market. You probably recall that we did a little bit less well than the market last year, so this is probably just normal deviations. The ROIC reached a very high level of 13.5%, and this is an organic growth, so we're very pleased with that. We also continued to expand our portfolio. And we just formed the terminal concession in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:16:07) in Sweden and we've just signed the Moin Costa Rica agreement as well, and have taken over successfully the operations in the Callao terminal in Lima, and it's around the middle of the year. So, good progress in this business. And the investment focus we had over the last years in developing markets we feel are paying off in a good way.</p>
          <p>Going to the tankers, offshore and other shipping on slide number nine, a little bit mixed bag, but generally a very positive development with profits up from last year $109 million to this year $276 million and, with different developments in the various businesses, Maersk Tankers was loss-making. And when you look at the bottom, you can see the figures. These are excluding gains, impairments and so on. So, it's really the underlying profitability. Maersk Tankers is deteriorating a bit. And this is, of course, a very poor crude rates we've seen, but also product rates that remain on very low levels.</p>
          <p>Maersk Drilling continues to do well now in the third quarter, a profit of $138 million. And that means that we continue heading for a very good result on a yearly basis. Maersk FPSO and LNG is also up, driven by good performance of the Peregrino unit and we expect this development to continue. Of course, when LNG is sold, we will not have a positive impact from this business, that at the moment is sailing at very good rates.</p>
          <p>The supply service is also doing well. This is a business that is dependent on spot rates, mainly in the North Sea and they have been pretty good. And on top of that, of course, the rest of the world is doing well with good utilization and most of the vessels on good contracts.</p>
          <p>As regard to SVITZER, it's a relatively small business, but also here we're seeing progress, and that goes in spite of many shipping or many ports having a quite slow business, so we can be quite satisfied with that.</p>
          <p>Going to the other segments, we have, starting with the retail businesses on slide number 10, the retail business has had a pretty tough third quarter. The reason for that is a negative demand situation, in particular, in the full assortment hypermarkets and large supermarkets, where in particular, <mark type="ph" /> non-full (0:19:20) has been affected.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, these businesses have been hit by consumers buying in discount stores instead of full assortment supermarkets because of the eagerness to save money, given the economic situation in Denmark, or maybe even more the expectation of the tough economic times ahead. And fortunately, many of these customers have moved to Netto, that is having pretty good results. But overall, <mark type="ph" /> then (0:19:57) supermarket is negatively affected by this development.</p>
          <p>And we continue to open stores and we'll obviously continue to build out our network of discount stores outside Denmark as well.</p>
          <p>Looking at the other businesses, in general, quite positive. We have a positive result for Odense Steel Shipyard <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:20:25) as we speak, delivering the last vessels and production will stop during Q4. This is, of course, very positive. And the new activities in the <mark type="ph" /> yacht (0:20:40) where we are <mark type="ph" /> renting (0:20:44) out some of the facilities seem to be off to a good start.</p>
          <p>We have a result for Maersk Container Industry continued to edge up compared to last year; this is particular good demand for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:20:57) technology seems to be very, very interesting for the container lines, and in particular in controlled atmosphere we are a world leader. And the situation at Danske Bank is less positive. We have a loss in the quarter compared to a gain last year. With those words, I'll pass over to Trond who'll take you to through figures.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'll go to slide 11 and go through the consolidated financial information. Going to the third quarter, we had revenue of $15.3 billion, ending up the earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortization, at just short of $3.4 billion. That is leading us to the EBIT number of $2.1 billion for the quarter. As earlier this year, we have an increasing tax rate due to the fact that the composition of the earnings is more related to oil and gas than the other businesses. Therefore, our tax rate is high this quarter, and we're ending up at the profit for the period of $371 million.</p>
          <p>The cash flow from operations is on the same level as previous quarters on $2.1 billion, but the capital expenditures is higher. And one of the reasons &#x2013; a major reason is the one-off payment of the SK Energy of $2.1 billion in this quarter, leading us at the interest-bearing debt of $14.5 billion, and that makes the earnings per share this quarter, $73.</p>
          <p>Going to our year-to-date numbers, we see that the trend is continuing. We are increasing our revenue base from last year to $45.3 billion, and an earnings before interest and tax of $8.6 billion, slightly higher than last year. Profit for the period, year-to-date, is $3.1 billion, which is a decrease of approximately $1.1 billion from last year. Year-to-date, earnings per share is $616 and return on invested capital so far this year is 10%.</p>
          <p>Going then to slide12 to see the bridge on the net interest-bearing debt for the full year, we started the year with a net interest-bearing debt of $12.4 billion and having an EBITDA of $11.6 billion. The use of the cash has been on an increase of $800 million in working capital, financing elements of $500 million. Then we have paid taxes on $3.6 billion. CapEx for the first nine months of $7.7 billion and paid out dividends and other <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:24:44) $1.1 billion, leaving out the quarter end of the third quarter to $14.5 billion in net interest-bearing debt.</p>
          <p>Going then to the outlook for 2011 on page 13, we now expect the profit for 2011 to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion including divestment gains. In the container activities, we now expect a negative result for the full-year as a consequence of lower rates on especially the Asia-Europe trade. The oil and gas activities expect a profit at the same level as for 2010. The result for terminal activities, tankers, offshore and other shipping activities, as well as other businesses is expected to be above the 2010 level excluding divestment gains. For retail, the result excluding divestment gains is now expected to be below 2010.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operating activities is expected to develop in line with the results, while cash flow used for capital expenditure is expected to be significantly higher than in 2010. And as previously, the outlook for 2011 is subject to uncertainty, specifically on the development of the global economy, oil price and global trade condition.</p>
          <p>And with that with the fund remarks to Nils.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Summing up, as I said at the opening, we appreciate this is mixed bag. But we are very encouraged by the good results we've had in the other core businesses, apart from Maersk Line. And we, of course, are prepared and really determined to execute on our aspirations in these areas. And we believe for a group of our size and nature and strength, there will be plenty of opportunities also in the shipping area going forward as this crisis &#x2013; and I'm talking not about the growth crisis, but the capacity crisis unfolds further.</p>
          <p>We will continue to focus on service in the container business towards our customers. We do believe that this is the way forward and we do believe that we with Daily Maersk have a winning concept that will help us not only to be competitive on costs, but also to build sustainable advantage towards customer overtime, leading to a better rate situation.</p>
          <p>In Maersk Oil, we are encouraged by the upgrades in Avaldsnes, and we feel that we have a very exciting exploration program ongoing and are very determined to continue to build this business and return to the level of 400,000 barrels per day, which is our exploration in the future.</p>
          <p>Both APM Terminals and Maersk Drilling continue to deliver good operational performance. We feel convinced that the investment we've decided to place in these areas will further build the capacities and the capabilities of these organizations. So, we're very optimistic of the future here as well.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, tough times in shipping, but tough times where we feel we have a good edge to improve our position, and very good opportunities and performance in the other core businesses of the group. And with those words, I would like to hand you back to the operator and look forward to some interesting questions and hopefully, some good answers.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Menno Sanderse from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Three questions, please. So let's take them one by one. The first one, Nils, is on container shipping. Clearly, your strategy makes a lot of sense. The problem is clearly the smaller players are not just going to fall by the wayside because the big bad boys in blue says so. So, what do you think is the risk that it will become a war of attrition for a couple of years, and therefore, these corporate levels are something we need to get used <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:29:55) levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the acoustics here are quite bad. So, I hope I got you right. But we do see a couple of tough years ahead. We have an order book in the industry of around 30%. And given the present pricing we've seen during the peak season, we had to assume that there is already overcapacity in the industry now. So that means that we need some years of no further orders and, even so, probably also some years of, let's say, very unstable earnings. We're not telling the competition what to do, but I do not feel that this is really an environment for smaller players and people with, let's say, not very strong balance sheets. So, obviously, if this goes on for the coming quarters and months as we expect, we also expect some changes in the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then on oil E&amp;P. Clearly, you've not been so lucky in the UK in the last five years <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:31:06) maintenance, faulty equipment, what's your view on your business in the UK? I hear there's a couple of fields that are being appraised at the moment. Do you think it's a business where you can take meaningful steps in production or you're going to refocus more on Norway, Angola, and Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are optimistic that we will develop a good business in the UK. We acquired <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:31:31) UK assets some years ago and the experience has been good in terms of us getting a good organization, some very good exploration ideas and a good basis to build on. But I do agree with you that we have not encountered equipment up to the usual A.P. M&#xF8;ller Maersk standard. And we probably have to realize that we are best at operating equipment that we build ourselves and where we know how the quality is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then, finally on Oil E&amp;P, you currently gave us the group's ambition of 400,000 barrels per day. If you look at slide 7, that's quite a few discoveries under evaluation in the next, let's say, 14 months, 15 months. Do you think you'll be able to put a timeframe around the 400,000 by the end of next year once you've gone through these discoveries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I hope we have a very, very big drilling for our size, anyway, very large drilling program ongoing, including quite a number appraisal wells at the moment. And I think, we will see &#x2013; during next year, we'll see increasing clarity on the situation. But we're quite optimistic and remain very committed to reaching the 400 million barrels level, which for our company and the mix of our businesses would be a very good size.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Lars Heindorff from ABG. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. A question regarding the container business. I'm just curious about how the implementation of Daily Maersk, if that will have any impact on unit cost? I can see that unit cost, excluding bunkers is slightly up in the quarter. What do you expect going forward? And will the implementation of Daily Maersk have any sort of material impact on the unit cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, actually, as we have Daily Maersk introduced, it will mean a very high <mark type="ph" /> central integrity (0:33:35). In my experience, it's actually that that should lead to our cost savings. The quarter has been unusual in the year in a sense that we've had these increases in time charter costs as well as terminal costs, and we will revert to, hopefully, a declining cost situation in the future. And Daily Maersk should be helpful in this.</p>
          <p>So, probably, you will see that &#x2013; we had of course had a low capacity or relatively low capacity utilization as an industry during the year, because demand growth, in particular, in third quarter has been a little bit lower than we had hoped for. But in general, when we get the right capacity and the business starts to grow and Daily Maersk is running, we do actually expect to be able to reduce our unit costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then a related questions to that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:34:46) around your utilization. I mean, hopefully the implementation of Daily Maersk should improve your utilization. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:34:53) appears to be sort of aggressive at least on Asia-Europe in terms of pricing? Can you give us any indication about how your utilization have developed and also what you expect now with implementation of Daily Maersk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, our utilization in the third quarter went down slightly on Asia-Europe, but nothing really dramatic. We did expect to take a bit more business than we did, and that was a pure result, I think, everybody <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:35:23) that market did not developed as we had expected. There was really not a very significant peak. But we did have a 16% growth, which probably is above the markets. So we may have had pretty good utilization compared to the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going forward, on the pricing issue, we don't feel that we are leading a price war in anyway. But on the other hand, we are determined to stand firm and get our right position also on Asia-Europe. And so, the answer is probably here, a little bit more open to interpretations. But we definitely don't feel that we're driving the industry with price reductions on Asia-Europe. And by the way, we also, now we don't have a very big &#x2013; we don't have big vessels coming into trade to the significance that some of our competitors have. So we are probably not the drivers of the development in that particular trade.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then in the oil and gas, I think, we have had now a couple of postponement in terms of the likely announcements regarding Chissonga. You said now you have one more exploration well into June 2012. I think earlier this year, we expected an announcement here in the fourth quarter. I mean, can you give us an update? Is there something going on there which is the reason for these postponements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think basically what is going on is that with having drilled two wells, and with two ongoing, we would like to come out with something that is really well founded. And the well-founded evaluation of Chissonga is a few quarters away, so it's just basically a decision to wait for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then, last on the terminal sites...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But by the way, there's no change. I mean, we'll really soon have four wells in the Chissonga, and there is no doubt that it will be &#x2013; in our minds &#x2013; that it will be a commercial development at some stage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Lastly, on the terminals, the new terminal that you've won in Gothenburg, when will that have impact on your numbers, so that in already or?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Well, it's not a major terminal. It's an 880 million TEU terminal &#x2013; 880,000 TEU terminal. So, it's a mid-sized business. So, you probably shouldn't expect a significant impact on the numbers by this terminal in isolation.</p>

          <p>That doesn't mean that it won't impact the numbers, but it's not going to be significant.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Let's start with Chissonga. If an announcement comes sort of in the middle of next year, should we expect the development CapEx outflow already in the second half of 2012? And then, also related to oil and gas, exploration guidance is up. Should we interpret that as an increase of the run rate going forward, or have you simply brought some of that spend forward a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't really tell you what the exploration budget is going to be for next year, but we believe that $1 billion run rate is not an unnatural level for Maersk Oil and Gas, given the ambitions we have. We have a hefty program at the moment. And I think we'll be much wiser in just a few quarters on what comes out of that, and then we'll see. But $1 billion is nothing unusual in our minds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And for Chissonga, could we see a substantial development plan kick off immediately in the second half as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early to say. We are drilling now the third well, which is an appraisal well. And, of course, that demonstrates that we have a lot of faith in this development. And then, we'll have a fourth early next year. And once we have that, then we will come out with the details. I can't tell you whether it's going to be in the second half that we actually start spending money to any significance. But we are, anyway, in contact with equipment suppliers and so on to see what cost rates we have to expect and what it takes. So, this is not a project where we're just doing the appraisal. We're also evaluating various opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's clear. Turning to liners, can you give us some sense to what your estimates are for the average Maersk rate in the quarter excluding bunkers? And has that mechanism effectively continued to remain somewhat ineffective given the developments from the competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you go back to slide number five, you have the exact average rates, month-by-month so far this year. And what we'll see &#x2013; what we expect to see going forward is basically maybe a small decline and &#x2013; or stabilization in the first months and thereafter it's open. But when you look at the &#x2013; if you look at the development in rate, including bunker adjustment factor, you'll see that we're significantly below 2010. And even though we are above 2009, if you actually include the increase in the bunker rates, we are more or less at the same rates as in 2009, excluding bunker cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And do you have a clear or rough number in mind as to how much capacity would have to come out in your core lane to see some stability given current demand levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably not very much, but some capacity will need to come out. We do expect that there will be some layoffs during the low season or some route adjustments during the low season; this is normal. But we also expect that the demand may not be growing during that period. So we do expect some oil capacity to prevail into 2012 with a relatively large certainty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one very quick last one, if we turn to tankers, can you give us a sense of what the coverage ratio is for 2012 and 2013, just to understand what the exposure is for the rate environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't give you an exact figure. But we don't have an extremely high coverage rate. We have a quite a big order book in the tanker business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Just two questions from me please. Firstly, in container shipping, in your statement, you talk about a target EBIT for Maersk Line, 5% above the peers. I mean, that sounds fairly ambitious. So could you just say a bit more on the timeline and the steps you're taking to achieve that? And then just on Maersk Drilling, on the 75% contract coverage for next year, could you just say whether you're signing contracts at higher or lower average rates, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me start with drilling. The rates seem to be pretty solid in the drilling business at the moment. So, I would say, generally, a small trend upwards on the new contracts we're making. It depends, of course, a little bit on which segment you're talking about. If you're referring to the 5% margin advantage that we're heading for, that objective actually came out of our analysis that we did back in 2007 where we realized that our margin was actually probably 4% lower than the competition, or than the average of the industry.</p>
          <p>And we worked continuously on it since. And I can't remember the exact figure for the first half. We don't have it for the third quarter yet, because we haven't seen the figures from the competition. But looking at the first half, we were approximately 3% better than the industry average. The way forward on that is, of course, working with Daily Maersk to hopefully achieve some premium over the competition.</p>
          <p>But it's, of course, also introducing a very modern vessel like the Triple-Es, where fuel consumption is dramatically lower and then a continued pressure to become more competitive. So, we feel we are on a good track. It's not something that's going to be just moving in one direction. For instance, if the rates are lower on Asia-Europe, it will impact us more than the competition. So there can be short term setbacks, but we feel we're on a very good way to actually achieving that.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Finn Petersen from Nordea. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. I have a couple of questions regarding Maersk Line. First of all, how much capacity reduction do you see is needed to balance the market? That's one question. Number two, who should leave the market? We have seen that the number 15, Yang Ming, is now considering upgrading their size of the vessels, and going into the 16,000 TEU size? And thirdly, your Daily Maersk, does that limit your ability to reduce capacity in the trade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the last one because that's a great question. We have no intention of limiting our capacity in the trade by doing any changes to Daily Maersk. This is a great concept, and the concept will stay in place, even if we have temporary declines in the market. So that's definitely a no-go. There are other opportunities to adjust capacity for low season and so on, but Daily Maersk will continue to sail.</p>
          <p>And then, I have to disappoint you. I'm not going to give &#x2013; to point to specific areas that I think should leave the industry. I think that is really up to the individual businesses. I think already last time, I said I would question small carriers going in for investment in very large vessels. So I would prefer to leave it at that general statement. I think this is a very tough call for the shareholders in a small business to decide to go for 16,000 TEU or 18,000 TEU vessels, but that's really up to the individual companies to make that call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last thing, how much do you think that the capacity has to be reduced before you balance them out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's the same question that we had from the previous question, but really it's hard to say. Because you have a lot of flexibility factors in sailing: you can speed up, you can speed down, you can cut our ports and so on. So it's really hard to give you an exact figure, but it's probably less than we think. In our business, it takes very little overcapacity to see very significant rate reductions. So, I really think we're talking about relatively small volumes or small number of vessels that have to be laid up. But of course, that doesn't go now for the low season, because in the low season everybody will be probably adjusting their capacity somewhat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then just a final question. Where do you see &#x2013; with the current spot rate, where do you see the breakeven in terms of vessel size in the Asia, Europe trade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With the present spot rates, nobody is breaking even in the Asia-Europe trade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, where should we go in terms of rates before you're breaking even on your 15,000 TEU?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that is a very difficult question to answer, but I can give you, easily, the breakeven. With present bunker prices and present rate mix, we're losing on an EBIT level, in Maersk Line, $124 per FFE. And you see the rates have been slightly above $2,800 $2,900 in average during the quarter. So, that's a pretty simple calculation to make. Unfortunately, it changes every day with transportation mix, with port mix, so it's very hard to give you a figure. But you cannot live in this trade on a long-term basis with the present oil prices, unless the rates grow significantly above $3,000.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Three quick questions, if I may. I think your release mentioned adoption of superslow steaming at 10 knots on some backhaul lanes. How material are the potential savings at current bunker prices? And secondly, you talked about a 30% forward order book. Do you think this can be funded, and can that order book ever be delivered in current condition? And the final question on Maersk Line fleet value, I think some industry analysis suggests the value of Maersk Line fleet has dropped sharply. Can you remind us of the process you go through at the year-end to adjust the fleet value in the balance sheet? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, starting with the fleet value, we evaluate the fleet at half and full year. And if we see any shortfalls, we will adjust. And I must say that I don't see any dramatic changes in ship values over the last year. So, we'll see. It's up to the appraisals that we'd do at year-end, but we do that &#x2013; we did that also at half year. So this is our obligation as a stock-listed company. In terms of the &#x2013; sorry, what was the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think the current industry order book can be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:52:02) ever be delivered?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm afraid to say that I do believe that the order book is going to be delivered. It's hard to place orders today without some sort of down payment or at least bank guarantees. And even if it doesn't make a lot of sense, my feeling is that it will be delivered. Some of the vessels may be delayed a little bit, but it really only delays the problem. The slow steaming we're doing on the backhaul is something that it does actually save quite a lot of bunker oil.</p>
          <p>But it's, of course, something you can do on the backhaul and you can probably best do it with modern vessels. When you go down to 10 knots, the load on your machine is quite low, is very low, and that can present some warranty issues on older vessels. So we don't expect this to be a major move in the industry to answer your question. It's not the same significance as going from normal &#x2013; or old-fashioned speed to slow steaming, which is the new normal.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, three questions for me, please. First of all, you mentioned in the context of the container shipping business that terminal costs were rising. I think, I wonder if you could maybe quantify that. Second question on disposals, I wonder if you could give us your some estimate of what the after-tax disposals this year might look like. I guess Netto is the biggest component there, but we have the pre-tax <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:53:54) some kind of post tax indication for divestment gains.</p>
          <p>And then third question, just on tax, I mean, you paid an 80% rate in the third quarter, which kind of makes me wonder if you should <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:54:07). I mean, that's not a serious <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:54:11) oil and gas business means that you have to live with a pretty high tax rate. But my question is, what can you do maybe to try and reduce the sort of penal tax rate that you're paying at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start with the terminal cost, and then Trond will answer on disposals and the tax rate. The terminal costs are going up. It's partly a mix issue. As you will recall, we're introducing a number of vessels in the Africa and South and Latin America trades. And there you have higher terminal costs than you have in the transshipment terminals that we use on the Asia-Europe and intra-Asia businesses. So there's a mix element in it, and as I also said before, the thermals have been better able to withstand pressure through reduced prices than the lines have, which is probably good because if they'd reduced prices as well, it would probably be passed through in the cutthroat competition we have in the liner business anyway. And Trond, on disposals and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the disposals, it's very limited on the gains tax. We have non-gains tax on the Netto UK sale, which is the biggest one of <mark type="ph" /> 700 (0:55:49). And for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:55:52) on the <mark type="ph" /> 150 (0:55:54), there are a few withholding taxes somewhere, but they're all limited in the percentage size between 10% and 15%.</p>
          <p>Coming to the tax rate, this quarter's tax rate is high; it's almost 80%. And that is due to the fact, as I said, that the tax rate in oil and gas is on a year-to-date on a level that it has been earlier on the &#x2013; 75% level. The reason why we get to this higher &#x2013; one thing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:56:26) high tax rate in this quarter for oil and gas is that we increased the exploration and the development of some of the countries that are not positive cash or cash flow or profitable to offset some of those taxes yet. So you don't get the accounting effects for some of that. So that's one of the reasons in the quarter.</p>
          <p>For the whole group, when we're coming into the shipping segment, the shipping segment is in deficit. We're on tonnage tax, and therefore you don't get the deferred tax credits as a result of the negative losses. And that also increased the effective tax rate in this quarter. So that is the element. So when the shipping gets positive, you will then see a dramatic decrease again in the effective tax rate for the quarter.</p>

As you go through your 2012 budget process, do you give your people, your divisions, sort of high-level guidance on macro-assumptions, and fuel prices and volumes? And if so, could you share with us at least a sort of flavor of the guidance that you give them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do give them high-level guidance, but we don't feel that this is the appropriate time to share those assumptions, no. But we do, of course, give them high-level guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you're not prepared to give us a sort of flavor as to whether it's &#x2013; other companies are saying, well, we are assuming more of the same, and then see what happens in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we're assuming more of the same, and we will see what happens in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we are in dialogue with the businesses now. We haven't frozen our budgets yet. We're following macroeconomic developments very close and it does change. So, when we come up with our first guidance for 2012, we will definitely go out with our assumptions as well, but this is just too early for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fine. Second question, also <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:59:00) general, within your sort of group <mark type="ph" /> ROIC target (0:59:04) of 10% across the cycle, how much higher than that number does Maersk Line has to be given the associated risks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maersk Line has <mark type="ph" /> ROIC (0:59:20) which is above the group average. So they will have to be above 10% across the cycle. Exactly how much, I think, is up to evaluation. We also evaluate our <mark type="ph" /> ROICs (0:59:33) every year per business unit. But there is no doubt that if Maersk Line shall be a good value generating business for the shareholders, then it has to be above 10%; not much, but somewhat above 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Third question <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:59:52) detail now. If you look at your &#x2013; there's been a lot of talk <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:59:57) the Daily Maersk. So, if look at your total global capacity, what proportion of that is in that Daily Maersk Asia-Europe service?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't tell you off the top of my head, but you have approximately 40% of our capacity is in Asia-Europe more or less. And the proportion in Daily Maersk is quite significant. So it is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:00:25) we know, it's about approximately at least 80 vessels going in, but the exact tonnage figures, unfortunately I can't give you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But it will be sort of approaching 40%, take off the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:00:39) services to get you there. Okay. And the final question is, I think, you both talked on a number of occasions about wanting to move towards producing a proper oil and gas reserves number. Is there any firming up of the timetable to producing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing we can really comment on at the moment. We are working internally, and that's more for performance management and evaluating our own effort. We are working internally on getting good numbers, but I can't give you any time on when we will start talking about it publically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:01:27) please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:01:32) from RS Platou Markets, actually. Just a quick follow-up on the tax issue there, if I may. In the oil and gas business, do I understand it correctly that it is very high in this quarter due to the fact that, for instance, the cost spend in a country like Norway, where you have little <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:01:58) is the main reason for it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, Norway is not the main reason because the tax effect in Norway is that you actually get paid by the Norwegian government for the payments you spend on some of the developments and exploration. So Norway is not a part of that, but it's very few others countries that have that kind of rule. So, most of them do not. So as a result of basically exploration costs, that actually drives the increase, that actually drives sort of the increase you see in this quarter on areas like Brazil, Angola, US, that actually drives this 5% increase this year and this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And no reason for us to change our assumptions on tax rates going forward as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I've said, it depends on the part of the exploration <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:59).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just one final question. You mentioned in the report that the drilling of the Oceanographer in the Gulf of Mexico have been postponed due to low rig availability. Is that also a read-through to other areas that you now are entering into this larger exploration program for 2012, that rig availability might actually be a sort of a challenge for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, it's really a Chevron operated well, the Oceanographer. So there we are on the Chevron's decision on how to use the rigs that they are contracting. So, the situation is a different one in other parts. For instance, in Angola, we have at various occasions had problems with the rig availability, not just because it's hard to get advance rigs, but also because if you don't have a series of wells to drill, you are more dependent on finding slots in the middle of other people's drilling program. So, when you're drilling one, two or maybe even three wells at a time, you are less flexible or less able to influence the rig availability than when you're simply contracting it for three or four years and drilling a long series of wells.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:04:39). Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yes, a couple of questions. First of all, if you could put a bit flavor on this quite fantastic volume growth you in Asia-Europe, when it comes to inbound and outbound volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you mean, what is backhaul and what is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly. What are the mix there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a minute, we'll &#x2013; I think it is actually in the release on page 14. We have a growth on head haul from Asia increased by 27% and back haul from Europe increased by 18%...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...compared to Q3 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have a volume increase between Asia and Europe by 24%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in total, yes. Then on your guidance, the range we are looking at right now, would it be correct to assume that that range mainly comes up from what to expect from rates or are there other assumptions which could impact that range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the three main value drivers in the Maersk Group is, of course, the rates for containers, it is the volume for containers and it's the oil price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and then if you look at also your volumes have been quite steady and quite predictable. And also the oil prices have been quite steady. And also compared to your guidance, then is it fair to say that we end up with at least the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:06:22) main trigger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the difference between you as an analyst and us as a company. That's up to you to analyze.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then my final question, it comes to the LNG transaction. Reading the <mark type="ph" /> prospectus from Teekay (1:06:38), it seems that they are talking about that the deal should be closed early next year. Is that what we're going to expect? And secondly, they talk about conditions when it comes to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:06:53) and so on, also a termination date in February when it comes to approvals. Are there any changes to the agreement that you've announced when it comes to termination of this agreement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the agreement has a long <mark type="ph" /> stop dates (1:07:08), and they are subject to customer approvals and some financing elements in there. But, it's normal course since the &#x2013; it is the kind of business that the LNG is in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no further questions. I hand over to you speakers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you for many interesting questions. I hope we were able to answer them to your satisfaction, and we look forward to seeing you or talking to you again, if not before, than after the full result publication in February 2012. So have a good day and thank you for listening in.</p>
