          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen my name is Stacy and I will be your conference operator today.  At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the DIRECTV Group's First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.  After the speakers remarks' will be a question-and-answer period.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Jonathan Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Sir, please begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and thanks for everyone for joining us today.  With me on this conference call today are Chase Carey, our President and CEO; Pat Doyle, CFO; Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America and Larry Hunter, our General Counsel.</p>
          <p>On this call we will make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are described in each of the DIRECTV Groups and DIRECTV U.S.'s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC which are available at www.sec.gov.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in accordance with the SEC Regulation G that requires companies reporting non-GAAP financial measures to reconcile these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, we provide reconciliation schedules for the non-GAAP measures.  These schedules are attached to our earnings release and are posted on our website at directv.com.  With that I'm pleased to introduce Chase.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon.  I'm going to just start with a few comments but I'm going to keep them reasonably brief because I think the first quarter numbers really speak for themselves.  Pat will provide probably some more color on the results.</p>
          <p>In a nutshell, we had a very strong quarter in the first quarter.  There's not a lot to be critical of in our results and I do believe that reflect the overall strength of our business and really almost all our metrics in the U.S. were pretty strong in the first quarter, certainly gross adds, net adds, churn, ARPU growth were all good.  We continue to attract quality subscribers and install advanced products in well over half of our new customers.</p>
          <p>Top line revenue growth was certainly solid but the main highlight in the quarter was our improvements in margins and cash flow.  I think we really began to marry our top line growth with success in getting on top of key costs like retention spending, service and G&amp;A that really drive the bottom line.  However, there are still areas we can do better, that's for sure.  For example SAC could be tightened up.  Most of the increase was planned for spending on advanced products or more targeted sales tools but they are clearly things we can do there.  There are also costs like service where we made progress but still have a ways to go to get to where we should be.</p>
          <p>In many ways our Latin America business was even stronger than the U.S.  Net subscriber growth more than doubled to about 200,000, ARPU grew about 20%, overall revenue grew almost 50% and OPBDA grew about 70%.   Clearly those numbers were helped by foreign exchange but overall it was a really good quarter.  Sky Mexico which is not reflected in these numbers also had a strong quarter with a doubling of net sub adds and double-digit percent increases in revenue and OPBDA.</p>
          <p>The one metrics in Latin America that was up more than planned was churned which was at 1.57% per month for Q1.  This increase was primarily due to higher-than-expected sub growth because first year churn exceeds longer tenure customer churn.</p>
          <p>Again, strong results for both the U.S. and Latin America.  I guess with that I'm going to turn it over to Pat and then I'll come back and make a few comments about the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chase.  In many ways our first quarter results were very similar to the trends we've seen in recent quarters where the rapid growth in demand for HD and DVR services had a material impact on both our top line and bottom line results.  We also saw in the quarter some very favorable cost trends that are consistent with the outlook we provided at our Investor Day to increase operating margins.</p>
          <p>Starting first with revenues, DIRECTV U.S. was up 14% to 4 billion in the quarter.  Much of this increase was due to our third consecutive quarter of ARPU growth, over 8% bringing ARPU to 79.70.  In addition to annual price increases, we are continuing to see strong growth in HD and DVR services.  We now have more than seven million subscribers with advanced services or over 40% more than a year ago and paying us nearly $100 per month.  That ARPU is over 50% greater than the subscriber without advanced services.</p>
          <p>We also saw strong revenue growth in areas such as Pay-Per-View, ad sales and in our commercial business.  The increase in commercial revenues is related to increased competitiveness resulting from our new pricing and packaging strategy that we talked about briefly at our Investor Day.  At that time we had estimated that the change in our commercial equivalent subscribers would result in a downward adjustment to our cumulative subscriber count of about 65,000 subscribers.  As we reported in our earnings release this morning the actual adjustment came in at 71,000 subscribers.  More importantly though, we are already seeing higher gross adds in the commercial market segment, particularly in small bars and restaurants.</p>
          <p>Moving on to churn, on the last earnings call we talked about achieving an eight-year low monthly churn rate of 1.42% in the fourth quarter.  We raised the bar a little bit in this first quarter by hitting a 10-year low rate for the first quarter of 1.36%.  Consistent with recent quarters most of our churn improvement came from lower involuntary churn due to our focus on higher-quality subscriber growth and ongoing efforts to tighten our credit policies.  We also had a slight reduction in voluntary churn in the quarter which speaks to the strength of our service in an increasingly competitive industry.</p>
          <p>It was good to see that the tighter credit policies implemented over recent quarters did not negatively impact gross subscriber additions which were up 4% to 964,000.  In fact, higher-quality gross additions which we defined based on minimum credit scores were better than a year ago both on an absolute and relative basis.  Many of the favorable trends we're seeing both in terms of gross subscribers and churn can be attributed to strong performance from our direct sales channel.  Our direct sales team has done a good job capitalizing on our strengths, exploiting competitors' weaknesses and targeting higher quality customers who are more likely to purchase advanced services.  This helps explain why new customers purchasing HD or DVR services jumped from the mid-30% range of gross additions last year to the mid-50% range this year.  In total, the direct sales channel brought in 14% more gross adds than a year ago which more than offset a decline in the Telco channel.  With the loss of BellSouth as a partner on April 1st, direct sales will become an increasingly important sales channel.</p>
          <p>Operating profit before depreciation and amortization was up 22%, but importantly OPBDA margin was up 155 basis points to 26.1%.  From a margin perspective, the largest improvements were in subscriber services and G&amp;A.  These are consistent with the outlook we provided at our Investor Day and are driven by greater financial discipline as well as improved quality and operating efficiencies.  We look to see these favorable trends continue throughout 2008.</p>
          <p>In addition, our programming margins stabilized in Q1 which is also consistent with our outlook.  Partially offsetting these were higher subscriber acquisition costs.  Cash SAC of $712 was actually down a touch from the fourth quarter but was up 7% over last year.  The primary reasons for year-over-year SAC increase was higher new subscribers purchasing advance services, increased dealer payments and more national advertising.  Regarding the higher dealer payments, we recently changed the compensation structure for many dealers to better align their commissions with the acquisition of higher quality subscribers.  In other words, the increase in dealer payments and the higher quality subscriber growth we saw in Q1 are highly correlated.</p>
          <p>Also putting upward pressure on SAC is a shift in sales from the Telco channel to direct sales and other dealers.  Telco SAC is typically below our average due to some of our costs and revenue sharing arrangements.  However, it is important to note that a shift away from the Telco channel will not impact our margins because we will not be sharing revenues or contributing towards their bundled discount offers.</p>
          <p>There was, however, one large silver lining in our cash SAC, namely our capitalized hardware costs were 17% lower than a year ago despite the fact that we had 60% more new customers purchasing HD and/or DVR boxes.  This reflects the aggressive set-top box cost reduction that we've talked about in the past as well as the increased usage of refurbished boxes through our lease program.  These same hardware reductions were evident in our capitalized upgrade and retention costs which were also lower than the prior year.  Also contributing to the lower capitalized upgrade costs was a decline in upgrade orders by existing customers, something we haven't seen in about five years.</p>
          <p>These strong top-line and bottom-line results, combined with lower capital expenditures, drove a 76% increase in cash flow before interest and taxes for DIRECTV U.S. to more than $600 million dollars.  At the consolidated DIRECTV Group level which includes cash from DIRECTV Latin America, free cash flow was also up 76% to 544 million.  I might add that for the first time we received a cash dividend of $32 million from Sky Mexico last month, it will be reported in our Q2 results.  Also in the first quarter but not included in free cash flow was $160 million capital contribution received from News Corporation at the close of the Liberty transaction and share repurchases of $160 million.</p>
          <p>The Liberty agreement announced this morning to cap their DIRECTV voting stake at around 48% will allow us to start buying shares again under our new $3 billion share repurchase program.  To help fund this program, we will issue additional debt of about 2 billion.  We anticipate raising this money through both bank debt and bonds and expect to complete these transactions shortly.  We feel this is an important first step towards improving our capital structure and we will continue to evaluate our balance sheet as the credit market and other conditions change.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we're very excited about the momentum that's building at DIRECTV, both in the U.S. and Latin America.  As we talked about in February, we expect to take this company to a whole new level in terms of profitability and cash flow growth in 2008, and we think the first quarter results are entirely consistent with this bullish outlook.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Chase for some closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Pat.  Looking over the rest of 2008, I think we're on track with most of our plans.  We recently launched our newest satellite which is expected to deploy in the third quarter for customers and will enable us to continue to drive forward in HD leadership.  We currently have about 95 national channels in local HD in 77 markets or about 76% of the U.S. so we'll build on both of those once the satellite becomes active for customers.</p>
          <p>We also took a significant step forward in improving customer care with our acquisition of 180 Connect, which is one of our major third-party installation companies, which will really give us unique insights into and abilities to really maximize the efficiency and quality of the installation process.</p>
          <p>We'll also roll out our VOD product by the end of the second quarter, which we're excited about. I think it's a product that really will distinguish us, first and foremost, in ease-of-use associating customer attractiveness.  And we continue to distinguish ourselves in the content area with the most recent deal is our exclusive deal for Friday Night Lights we announced with NBC, and that show will start broadcasting in about October 1st, or the beginning of October.  Obviously there's a lot more happening across almost every area of DIRECTV, so it's both a busy and exciting time for us.</p>
          <p>From a financial perspective, we're on course with the outlook for 2008 that we provided at our Investor Day a couple of months ago.  As Pat touched on during last month &#x2013; we worked the last month &#x2013; we worked through the transition of BellSouth bundling from DIRECTV to DISH which as most of you know, is effective April 1st.  I guess it's as expected, we had some short-term transition issues in the first few weeks, but we're pretty well on track with implementing our plans to mitigate this transition, although I do want to remind you that our second quarter sub growth is always down significantly on a seasonal basis, but we really do feel we're on track with our plans and expectations there.</p>
          <p>Overall, our business remains as competitive as ever, and I certainly don't want to use our results to gloss over a competitive market.  However, the fact of the matter is that we have unique strengths which we feel in many ways are getting stronger, and we're competing very effectively against the bundle and other market forces out there.</p>
          <p>Finally before turning to Q&amp;A, I want to touch on the $3 billion share buyback we announced this morning.  We're not going to set a deadline for the completion of the buyback, but we do plan to pursue it aggressively, yet opportunistically.  As Pat said, we'll be in the credit markets the next few days to borrow $2 billion plus to fund it.  We recognize this level of debt will not optimize our balance sheet, but we think it's a prudent step in today's challenged credit markets.</p>
          <p>We also want to highlight this buyback is accompanied by an agreement with Liberty to exclude the impact of the buyback on Liberty's vote in DIRECTV.  We're only a couple of months into our new ownership with Liberty and just actually had our first board meeting less than two weeks ago, but I think these steps should be clarification that Liberty and DIRECTV are working well together and working well to move DIRECTV forward.  Clearly, we and Liberty believe there are other steps that make sense for us together and expect to continue to move forward expeditiously as we work through short-term items.  It's a great start under our new ownership structure and we look forward to the future.  With that, I'll turn it back to John.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Chase, and quickly before moving on to Q&amp;A, investors should note that we have members of the media on this call in a listen only mode.  I'd like to remind the media they're not authorized to quote any participants on this call, either directly or in substance, other than the representatives of the DIRECTV Group.  In addition, we're webcasting this call live on the Internet and an archive copy will be kept on our website.  With that, operator, we're ready for the first question.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  Thank you.  Congratulations on a great quarter.  I think all of us are a little surprised by the general outperformance in net adds across pay TV.  I was wondering if you could characterize what's driving the outperformance in context of a slowing housing market.  I was wondering if you're maybe getting some benefit from the analog homes that are out there that need to transition to digital?  And then my second question is on the Sprint, Clearwire announcement today.  I was wondering if that impacts your partnership with Clearwire in any way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess in terms of the subs, I wouldn't attribute much to the economy one way or the other.  I think we've said pretty consistently in the past and I think I'd continue to say it's true for us.  I'd not say none, but the economy has not had a material impact on the results you're seeing from us, and I think that continues to be true.  I think it's pretty early for the digital transition to be having much of an impact, I think changes like that usually end up being driven more around the actual date and time which is early '09.  I'm not saying there isn't some there.</p>
          <p>I think for us, it is mostly continuing strength.  I think for all the buzz about others doing things, like in HD where they say they're going to do more, I think we still have a unique position of leadership and a real window to continue to drive it.  I think we've got momentum to a lot of aspects to our business and it continues to execute reasonably well.  I'm not saying we can't do better, but to take advantage of the strengths we've got in the business.  So I don't think it's probably anything that different than what we have experienced, but I wouldn't cite the economy.</p>
          <p>In terms of the announcement today, Clearwire really hasn't had any meaningful, and I don't mean this in any derogatory way, they've made their focus in other things, but Clearwire has not been a meaningful part of anything we've been doing.  So we have an agreement, but we're not doing a whole lot with it, and they haven't been doing a whole lot with their business.  And I think we'll see where we goes.  I think in general, the whole announcement is probably &#x2013; I view it as positive.  I think anything that happens that creates energy and alternatives in the broadband space is a good thing, and I think more action and more energy are there.  Clearly there are issues about six party partnerships and other things that time will tell, but I think energy and action and alternatives in broadband and anything that helps push it forward is a positive.  But for us, I don't think we've gotten far enough with Clearwire to really end up saying it has any impact.  I think the relevant factor is where will they go and what will they become down the road which will take time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks.  A quick follow up to that, you had real strength in the gross adds in Latin American.  Could you talk a little bit about what's driving that?  And then ARPU is another thing really surprises.  You're seeing continued acceleration there.  Is it just the increasing mix of the advanced services subscriber base that's driving it or is there other things at work?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the second part; maybe let Bruce Churchill answer the first part in a second.  I think in terms of ARPU, it really is essentially the mix.  As Pat said, we had this type of growth really in the last couple of quarters as well, and it is the mix of certainly advanced products, certainly quality subscribers behind that that lead to strength in terms of overall package buying.  We did have the price increase go through pretty well.  So I think it is the mix of elements that have really been there the last couple of quarters.  I really wouldn't say the growth in this quarter is meaningfully different in terms of what drove it the past few quarters.  And I'm going to let Bruce Churchill touch on the growth in Latin America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously Latin America is not one place, the reasons for the growth across the board, in it has pretty much been experienced across the board, in general I would say the economies are doing well so we benefit from that.  And that's particularly true of a country like, let's say, Brazil.  And then on top of that, there are other factors in some big territories such as Venezuela, where our prepaid product continues to be a very big success for us.  And in territories such as Argentina, where there's been a bit of a change in the competitive scenario and some of the cable systems are going digital, has made us, frankly, more competitive than we have historically been.  They were just analog.  So it's a mix of factors but it's been pretty much across the board.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks very much, so a clarification and a question.  A clarification, I just wanted to make sure your comments on BellSouth regarding 2Q where you said you feel like you're ramping back up to plan.  Does that mean you're making up for the first few weeks starting out a little bit softer or does that just mean your first few weeks were soft but you feel good about the trend going forward?  And the question is, wireless is kind of the topic of the day, I think.  It looks pretty clear that DIRECT's been able to compete with cable bundles and adding the wireless phone to that bundle might not change the market for you but what the cable operators are doing is building out mobility not just for their telecom services but for their video services as well.  We also have DISH making tech bets on Sling and the Frontier bid on the 700 MHz.  I guess my question for you is, how important do you see video mobility as you look out rather than just focusing on the data or phone aspect of wireless?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of BellSouth what I'm really talking to is our plans.  Again, I think we talked about overall for the year what we expect, what we're looking to in sub growth a couple of months ago and you get all those things factored in that we knew the BellSouth transition was coming, we had as we said, actions and things we'd be taking that we expected to directly and indirectly mitigate some of those shifts.  I'm not going to get into specific numbers month-by-month, region-by-region that I think are too competitive but it's more an overall comment to say things are going about as we planned and I think we feel okay about it.  So then again, you've got to plan for some aspect of it so is there in the first part of that in the first few weeks of that transition do you get some &#x2013; until it occurs there are things you can mitigate but you sort of work through it and probably be nimble and try and make the appropriate adjustments.  And I think we feel we've done that reasonably well and I think we feel we're on track to the types of results we planned for the year.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of wireless; I think wireless video is part of the long-term proposition but I guess I do emphasize the phrase long-term, particularly if you're talking in bundling.  I think it's going to take a while.  First, even their &#x2013; how long I don't know, they don't even have the mid-way -- WiMAX technology deployed yet and you've got to build it out.  So I think wireless, even the wireless core services are really not part of the bundle today.  So I think if you're saying, if you're thinking three and five year timeframes, do some of this start to emerge?  I think it does start to emerge, nut I think it is a longer term proposition.  I think it's a place we plan to be active.</p>
          <p>I think you've got a lot of forces in there.  You've got the big cellular guys, Verizon and AT&amp;T as they move from 3G to 4G and what are the propositions they push into the market.  And you've still got to define the consumer appetite is what type of content, what type of videos do they want to watch, and in many ways is it &#x2013; how complimentary to the home experience.  But I think bottom line, this is not something that's going to be impacting the business a whole lot in the next couple of years.  It is probably more I think in a five year kind of context, not a one and two year time context, it is a meaningful event.</p>
          <p>So I think there's a lot to be played out and certainly we intend to play in it.  And I think some of the newer plays, whether it's Sprint, Clearwire or EchoStar, again, I think you've got to see what happens.  Building out wireless infrastructures to compete with guys like AT&amp;T and Verizon with 4G is clearly going to be a fairly challenging proposition.  Not that there aren't real opportunities in mobility and video as part of mobility aren't important parts of the business, but I think there's a lot of ground between here and there as it shakes out and I think we want to be smart about how do we play in it.  But I think it is an area over time we do intend to play in it.  But I think in what shape and form is something that we're going to continue to be thoughtful about.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I guess in terms of FiOS and U-verse, if I was you, I probably wouldn't put them in the same bucket.  I think where FiOS has launched, they're probably more of a competitive factor.  First, they're spending a lot more. Anybody who lives in Bethesda, Maryland, all you've got to do is look at the marketing and the offers and the stuff they're throwing at it which I think is why questions around FiOS are probably more economic than anything. I think where FiOS exists, it is a competitive force in the market.  Not that we can't compete against it and don't compete, I think we compete pretty well against it.  But where they exist in a market it certainly adds a third competitor and I think has an impact in the market.  Again as we've said with FiOS, they've talked about building out this 15 plus million household and if they do I think that's kind of what they get five plus million subs and some chunk of that would come from us.  In the overall context of our business it's one of the things you deal with but I think it's manageable and I think it's a competitive factor we can address.  I do still think their questions they've got to address over time as to is what their &#x2013; not just on CapEx but what their spending on programming and marketing and installation and service, is it sustainable and where do they really settle out.</p>
          <p>I think with U-verse it's a different proposition.  I think U-verse has got &#x2013; probably not the competitive impact.  I think there are still fundamental questions to whether &#x2013; IPTV, what's the timeframe before it's really, particularly for somebody who cares about quality television experience, I think there's a ways before it's a viable mainstream television option for American households.  I certainly don't think you'll see the same impact and I don't think, or they're not spending the money.  FiOS is spending to get a home.  What was the other?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>180 Connect, we don't have plans to do right now, we're not doing anything else.  I think we felt this was an attractive opportunity for us on a number of levels and I think in many ways first and foremost to really get a first-hand understanding of what we really think are the right levels of quality and efficiency that firsthand in our installation operation should operate by.  How often should we have to roll a truck to fix something, what is the right target?  I've always said I don't understand why 100% of dishes aren't pointed right and therefore it's very &#x2013; more than 1.1% aren't.  I want to understand why not and it may give us more insight and better insights to how do we really make sure we're hitting the right targets in efficiency and quality.  And I think probably gives the deeper insight to look at other ways that we can do some things that may improve the business for us and our partners.</p>
          <p>I think in many ways this is an opportunity for us to play a leading role in setting the right targets, the right goals, the right efficiencies, the right business practices for all our installers not necessarily ours.  It certainly gives us a foundation to go forward and address all this and understand it better and determine where we go from here.  I think for now our plans are really going to be focused on really getting the 180 Connect to be that operation owned by us to really operate and deliver the results we expect it to.</p>
          <p>It will be a nice financial opportunity, we expect it should be a real &#x2013; value wise I would not say it's what drove it, it's not that big of  a bet, but actually it is certainly something that if we do our job well it's going to be a lucrative, a good investment for us.  And it gives us an opportunity to grow.  I've always thought television is the leading force in household and as people go forward they put more in the homes and more interconnected things in the home.  Can you play what roles and what opportunities are there for us to really broaden and obviously we're going to be doing more in a home as we start connecting broadband to our boxes and the like.  So I think equally gives us a foundation to try and explore growth opportunities both for us and the HSPs.</p>

          <p>Hey guys.  I wanted to focus on the former BellSouth/AT&amp;T relationship again.  Did your AT&amp;T/BellSouth subscriber additions ramp down materially in Q1 in anticipation of the end of the deal April 1st?  And then your latest thoughts on the potential to win back AT&amp;T in the fall, especially given your very strong relative subscriber results and unarguably much stronger HD programming lineup?  Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say in the first quarter BellSouth remained pretty focused on working with us to pretty close to the end of the quarter.  So I'd say most of the first-quarter they remained and I think were true to working and making our deal work for our mutual benefit.  I think in terms of later in the year it's probably not a loss.  Again I probably don't have anything new to say that I've said before.  I presume I know EchoStar has talked to them, I think we are talking to them and again if we can structure the right relationship it would be attractive.  Obviously there are arrangements that would not make sense for us but we're certainly engaged and I think that as with any on-going negotiation, time will tell and there are probably limits to how much we can provide in terms of insight stuff to where it works out.</p>

          <p>I'd probably not comment. I think you're getting into competitive dynamics that I'm probably not going to provide a whole lot of real color on.  I think we've gotten very good at trying to track whatever goes on with any of our competitors in any market and making sure to the degree any changes or ones where we think there's an opportunity to take advantage of we try and do so.  But I don't think it probably benefits us to be telling the world which ones are good and which one are bad.</p>

          <p>I think actually the size is a bit bigger than you cited but I would actually say we made very good progress on the R&amp;D front and the technology engineering front and we have not made the progress we should on the execution front.  So it falls in one of those categories were I guess I can call it a glass half-full but it's an area of opportunity where we're not where we should be and it's because we haven't done a good enough job there.  We actually have had two meetings in the last month.  We've made some progress but we've not done it anywhere close.  A year ago we had some issues in terms of having the right technological solution and the like.  Right now actually we have a great solution that is a competitive advantage for us and we've got to do a better job.  We've got to do a better job executing it in a marketing sales and service context.</p>

I think it's positive in '08 but it's a longer term proposition than that.  And the user, somewhat tricky to reach, there are some that are in large groups but a lot of them require dealing with an array of building owners and the like so I would probably would end up saying this is probably more of a &#x2013; we should be making steady progress, it should start in '08 but I think it's more of a multi-year than a multi-quarter plan initiative.</p>

          <p>On the two-play, I don't say we're specifically targeting.  What we are trying to do is really get ourselves to really be capable of being an overall guide and aid to the customer in understanding their options.  And we've spent a fair amount of time putting in place the capability so what are your options from a &#x2013; particularly for broadband telephony they are compatible with us.  To a degree, cable is one of them.  I wouldn't say it's a focused one but we want to be able to &#x2013; if our goal as we've said is really to make sure customers have options that are compatible with DIRECTV and feel we should be proactive in trying to play a role in helping to inform, educate and identify and obviously they vary by region and place and therefore there has been a fair amount of system and data support required to put it in place.  So that's a part of the mix but I wouldn't certainly say it's a targeted aspect of the mix.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks, guys.  I think in your opening remarks, Pat, you talked about broadly the first-quarter being on track with your full year plan and I wanted to go back to ARPU and also programming costs for sub.  Are both trending a little bit above from a growth rate perspective what you guys talked about at the Investor Day?  And maybe on the ARPU front if you could for us eliminate the Telesat and maybe the activation ARPU flowing through there, if there is maybe a more "organic" number that we should think about for the remainder of the year?  And then on the programming cost front, is there seasonality to the year-over-year growth rate that suggests the rest of the year will be a lower number in terms of year-over-year growth on a per sub basis than Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do have the Telesat lease revenue which is been the first quarter but not in the prior quarter, probably affected the ARPU growth by three to five basis points, something in there.  But again as we look through the year, the first quarter was a great quarter and a strong quarter, it's not necessarily that we will keep that pace through the whole year.  So we're still comfortable with the guidance we've given on our full-year ARPU.  On programming, yes, the first quarter is a little higher; we do see some things down the line, some stuff with mix in some of the contractual rates that helped us in the later part of the year that will bring that programming cost back into line with the guidance that we've given you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we still feel comfortable with where we are.  Again, I think when we try to paint a picture we're not painting it quarter to quarter and in some ways we've tried to give directional, so I think as you talk 5% it doesn't mean 5.0 versus 5.1 for your &#x2013; they are areas and you get down to certain small enough timeframes like quarters and fairly small amounts can move the percentages.  So I think as a picture for the year we still feel comfortable with the picture we painted.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And if I can just ask one quick follow up.  Can you talk about MPEG-4 upgrade spend in the quarter if that was something that coincides with where you are at the end of the quarter in terms of what's left to do in your timeframe there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we continue to try to &#x2013; we actually did get through a part on the West Coast.  I think the rest of it we're not, as we've said in the last number of quarters, we're not looking to accelerate, we're certainly on the back half of what we do.  It continues to benefit us as we stretch it out.  The easiest example would be a fair number of these people actually now would be taking HD DVRs, and HD DVR in the first half of '07 was costing us well over $400.  By the middle of this year it's costing us in the low 200s.  Clearly, the benefit of being able to stretch that out, obviously there is just a natural level of churn and other things that help mitigate it, but that number is actually one that we still have a material level to go but I think we're on the downside of it.</p>

          <p>Thanks.  A couple of quick follow-on questions, if I may.  Firstly, just a follow-up to Ingrid's first question, in terms of the macro trend for the pay TV space overall, I understand what's driving growth in your business specifically and I understand that you don't have a tremendous amount of visibility into your competitors' businesses, but I'm wondering if you just have an opinion on when we look at your adds plus the telco adds plus the cable TV adds, the MSO adds so far this quarter, it looks like there is an anomaly going on in the trend and that the overall market seems to be growing at a faster rate.  And I'm wondering if -- there are still three providers that haven't reported results so far, but from everyone that has reported results have been better than expected.  I'm wondering if you've got an opinion on what might be driving that?  And then on BellSouth, it seems like you were saying earlier that the direct sales channel is at a point now where it would make up for the down draft from BellSouth, setting aside the seasonal pressures in 2Q, that the direct channel would allow you to grow through that?  I just wanted to clarify that.  And then finally on the shift in mix away from telco, what was the magnitude of the avoided revenue share in those deals if you could give us some color on that?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the growth of subs, you guys track the market more than I do, I worry about our business so I'll probably leave it to you.  Again, as you say, some people aren't there.  I know what we've done and we've done it, we're getting the type of subs we want to get.  Not everybody, obviously, was up, some of them were down, but probably leave it to you guys to track the market.  We're focused on us.</p>
          <p>In BellSouth, again I want to clarify, we're not trying to mitigate sub for sub.  As I said, I think there was an aspect &#x2013; what I'm saying is we're on track.  We're achieving what we looked to achieve in the year.  And there are benefits that come out of BellSouth; we take actions in an array of places to be able to continue to drive to get to the type of results we want.  And I guess what I've been saying is, we're on track to achieve the results we talked about at the Investor Day and the type of sub growth we talked about there.  So I think we've been achieving our plans.  Our goal is not to say, how do we go mitigate sub for sub, every sub that related to BellSouth.  It's how do we use channels, replace some of the BellSouth subs and use various strengths we have to complete in the marketplace in an intelligent way.</p>
          <p>But clearly there were some incremental subs that come through at Telco and we're saving money that we can deploy in other ways to effectively capture subs.  Our goal is not how do we sub for sub replace BellSouth, our goal is how do we effective go get subscribers.  Whether we have some resources that we're not deploying that we were deploying with BellSouth and some of that we're redeploying in the BellSouth regions, some of it we redeploy elsewhere.  But what we've been saying is we're on track for what we planned for the year in terms of sub growth.  Probably trying to get down to the dollars in that, again, what I would end up saying is, you're getting into competitive data that we wouldn't really be publicly sharing at that sort of level.</p>

          <p>Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  I think you said that 55% of the gross additions were taking advanced services this quarter.  Is that more of a seasonal effect because of the Super Bowl and Christmas?  Or is that something we can expect throughout the year?  And I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it was that precise.  I think you have a general trend, as I think I said at the Investor Day, I think you'll find in a couple of years, by 2010, 70% of our customers will have advanced products.  I think things like DVR will become just like a VCR or DVD player was at home and become a mainstream part of the experience, as will HD.  So I think they both continue to move.  We saw certainly in excess of 50% in the fourth quarter, so it's not like this was an anomaly or a quarter that went to a whole different level.  We've been seeing steady growth in that really throughout the last number of quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think VOD continues to be probably a longer term proposition.  I've said before I think DVRs and HD are much more powerful forces in the marketplace today.  I think VOD, that's not diminishing anything VOD will get, will continue to grow, but I think it will grow over a longer timeframe.  Some of the content issues in terms of Windows and the like are starting to be addressed but again, I think it takes time, habits take time, customers need to understand and start to use it.  We do plan to launch our VOD product by the end of second quarter.  I think it really is something that will affect something like ARPU over something that's years, not quarters.</p>

          <p>You're facing a digital TV transition in January of next year that, at least some of the studies that we've seen suggest, that signal propagation and the like may force an awful lot of those 14 million over the air households into the pay-TV market and a lot of them are Hispanic and right in your wheelhouse.  Is that an opportunity that you think is something that you're able to get at?  Or are those customers too low value to be interesting given the equipment requirement?  I wonder if you could just comment on that as an opportunity for you and how you think you might go after it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll certainly go after it.  I think it's tough to get a real handle on how big.  I think we view it as an opportunity.  I think it's a positive.  I would not end up saying at this point we're planning for it to be a huge positive.  I think certainly if it's more than we think it is we think we should be able to get more than our fair share of it.  I do think our national reach, and I think we've gotten pretty good capabilities to target customers in the right segments, whether it's ethnic or elderly or some of the segments people have talked about, that we will go after.  But I think we'll have to see how big it is.  We are certainly spending money and we're certainly pursuing it.  I think we'll pursue it competitively as much as anybody.  I'm not as worried.</p>
          <p>I think we've gotten pretty good at building protections in and disciplines in to get the right customers.  And I think we will rely on those to deal with the quality issue and to the degree the customers that we would be concerned with, between the credit card checks, Social Security checks and other protections, I think there's some good quality customers there that just probably have a different appetite for television, yet still want to some degree a reliable quality television experience, and certainly we would like to be there if we can.  We will be.  But again, I would not end up saying we planned on it.  We've talked about numbers or expectations for '08, there's not a big factor in there coming from this.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question.  That will come from Tom Eagan with Collins Stewart.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much.  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about SAC costs or, more accurately, box cost reductions for '08 and '09.  How much do you expect to continue to pull down your box costs?  And also if you could reiterate your relationship with TiVo now and in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  I think box costs continue to be, something like the basic box now that it's into the 40s, I think there clearly are limits to where that goes.  To some degree over the next couple of years we'll actually have some more substantial level, it won't be enormous volume, but a little bit of migration going on.  One of the things will actually add a bit of cost directly to SAC starting in the second half of the year, which I touched on at the Investor Day, is our standard-def DVR we're going to deploy is actually going to cost about $30 more.</p>
          <p>We think we can bring that down as it goes, and the current standard-def because what it's going to be is a DVR that is upgradable with a software download to HD.  So that if a customer that goes for a standard-def DVR wants to upgrade to an HD DVR, we can do it simply by flicking a switch like turning HBO on as opposed to rolling a truck and replacing equipment in a home.  We think it's an overall savings but obviously it's a shift from one place to another.  <mark type="inaudible" /> we start to move to a whole home solution.  So I do think hardware keeps going down though there are aspects of it technology-wise that keep going in which I think is why we continue to look at a stabilizing of SAC and managing these array of intelligent investments with economies and efficiencies.</p>

          <p>Actually I have a follow-up, we're seeing a lot these days in the industry on M&amp;A on cable networks.  I was wondering if you could reiterate a little bit on your content strategy and would you be willing to buy any cable networks?  Thanks.</p>

          <p>Cable networks, I'm sorry I thought you meant cable services, because I don't think we're buying cable networks.  Cable distribution?  Cable channel?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think my general view is that the ones you hear about all seem to be pretty premium priced.  I do think content, and I've said it before, I think content and distribution, they are values, they are synergies and values you can create.  So I think if we're going to pursue something, I think it's something we want to really feel there's real upside in and you go out and pay, I don't really see the benefit of going out and paying retail for something that you've got to do a whole lot of work just to make it pay for itself.  I think if there are opportunities, probably make some more modest, it's got to be more upside.  We'd like to be smart about if there's something there that makes sense but probably to really have the type of returns we need out of it, it probably needs to be something that we can bring a lot of value to.  Something that is more fully developed, my guess is, gets more competition around it and more premium priced and probably tougher for it to make sense.  But I think we'll be opportunistic but I think we'd be selective and opportunistic and I think those are probably more modest bets but I think there are places we think DIRECTV can bring value to them.</p>

          <p>Oh, in TiVo I think we continue to try to &#x2013; I'm sorry I forgot about TiVo. I think we have a constructive relationship, we're not doing a lot in all honesty but I think we have honest dialog that I think is sincere about seeing if there are things that make sense for us.  At our core, the heart of our business is going to continue to get driven by set-top box technologies we've developed there at the core of &#x2013; as we launch VOD and whole home solutions and broadband connectivity and all these things they're all tied into set-top box software that is deployed and operated by us.  It doesn't mean there aren't things we can do with TiVo and if we can find a way to track it I think we've always been open to an intelligent relationship if there was one.</p>
