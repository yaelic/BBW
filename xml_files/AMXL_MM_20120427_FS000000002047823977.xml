          <p>Good day, and welcome to the AMX First Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mauricio Fernandes. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Anthony. Good morning or good afternoon to everyone. My name is Mauricio Fernandes, and I'm the Latin America Telecom and Media Analyst at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.</p>
          <p>We are honored to host this quarter's conference call to discuss America Movil's first quarter 2012 results. I'm in S&#xE3;o Paulo, Brazil and from America Movil team we have Daniel Hajj, CEO; Carlos Jos&#xE9; Garc&#xED;a Moreno, CFO; &#xD3;scar Von Hauske, COO; and Daniela Lecuona, Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Daniel, thank you very much for the opportunity of hosting this call. You may now go ahead with your initial remarks. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mauricio. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being in our first quarter of 2012 financial and operating report. And Carlos is going to make us a small summary of the results of this quarter.</p>
          <p>Carlos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Mauricio for hosting the call. Well, we've had world financial market that served as a remarkable <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:23) in the first quarter, following the strong turbulence in countries in much of the second half of the prior year.</p>
          <p>The economic outlook appears to have improved and in the first quarter consumer confidence in our region of operation was on the rise, with local currencies appreciating in most of the region, particularly in Colombia.</p>
          <p>We finished March with 360 million accesses, which is 7.7% more than a year before, having added 6.1 million accesses in the quarter. Approximately two-thirds of them, 4.2 million, were wireless subscribers. A significant part of the 1.9 million new RGUs came from Brazil, which has become our largest fixed-line operation by accesses within 25.2 million. Brazil also led the way in terms of wireless subscribers with 1.2 million new adds, followed by Mexico with 1.1 million.</p>
          <p>We continue to grow well our postpaid base with postpaid net adds of 1 million subs that represented a quarter of our net subscriber gains. As of March, we had 35.7 million postpaid subs, 17.8% more than in the year earlier quarter out of a total of 246 million subs.</p>
          <p>As regards our 60 million RGUs, half are telephone lines, 15 million are broadband accesses and 14 million PayTV clients, which are growing at a 33% pace from the year before. We are seeing a significant move towards multiple play services as our clients seek new services from us with more double and triple play plans and even quadruple play plans where mobile and fixed services are bundled together.</p>
          <p>On our financial results it is important first to note that we're consolidating the results of Net Servi&#xE7;os from January 1. We're also presenting revenue information in gross terms and not breaking out the commission paid to distributors, which should facilitate comparisons with other operators that also report under IFRS.</p>
          <p>And we're now moving to a definition of EBITDA that first starts with operating profit as defined under IFRS and <mark type="ph" /> adding (3:25) depreciation and amortization charges. IFRS does not make any differentiation between operating and non-operating revenues and costs, which <mark type="indiscernible" /> (3:35) that items like employee profit sharing which are mandatory by law in Mexico, Peru and Ecuador should be considered a cost in the financial statement.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated first quarter revenues increased 12.4% in Mexican peso terms, on wireless revenues that increased 15.8%, and fixed-line revenue that grows 7%. Wireless revenues account for 62.5% of the total.</p>
          <p>At constant exchange rates, revenue growth for the period was 8.9%, led by mobile data revenues that increased 30.7% and PayTV revenues that were up 25.4%. Fixed line date growth came in at 8.5%. Several subsidiaries posted double-digit revenue growth.</p>
          <p>EBITDA came in 58 billion pesos and was 6.3% higher than the year before. Service costs generally rose faster than revenues on account of rapid postpaid subscriber growth, increased content charges and the rolling out and maintenance of larger and more spread-out networks.</p>
          <p>EBITDA margin declined two points to 35.1%. In addition to the reasons mentioned before, the reduction in the margin also reflects the new conformation of our business lines, with Tracfone in the U.S. having become a higher volume, lower margin business, and with our PayTV operations and the content charges that go with them becoming increasingly relevant.</p>
          <p>The appreciation of various currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, particularly the Mexican peso, led to a foreign exchange gain of 19.3 billion pesos that resulted in our posting a comprehensive financing income of 5.8 billion pesos.</p>
          <p>We registered a net profit of 32.6 billion pesos that was 37.5% higher than the one registered the prior year. Our net profit per share rose to 42 peso cents from 30 peso cents the year before, a 43.3% increase, which already reflects the impact of a 4.1% reduction in the average number of AMX shares outstanding, given our buybacks.</p>
          <p>Our net debt stood at 318 billion pesos at the end of March, down from 332 billion pesos in December and was equivalent to 1.2 times EBITDA. Approximately one-fourth of the reduction, 3.8 billion pesos, was in flow terms. The difference was due to the appreciation <mark type="indiscernible" /> (6:04) dollar and various currencies, particularly Mexican peso again.</p>
          <p>Our capital expenditures totaled 24.2 billion pesos. We acquired in the quarter Telmex shares in the amount of 7.3 billion pesos and bought back 6.9 billion pesos of AMX shares for a total of nearly 15 billion pesos that would include other smaller acquisitions. So the buybacks and the acquisitions in the case of Telmex stock and other smaller companies like DLA, they all had a bearing in the final net debt to EBITDA ratio.</p>
          <p>So with that I want to pass it back to Mauricio for the Q&amp;A session. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carlos. Thank you very much. As participants line up for Q&amp;A, I'll kick off asking two questions. First why was ARPUs up year-on-year across almost all AMX markets, the exception being Brazil, given the multiple SIM card issue in the country? But this is notable particularly in Mexico, given the <mark type="ph" /> MPR cut (7:16) in May, last year, wireless data seems to be the driver behind this. So what, in your view, is the outlook for ARPU in coming quarters? That's question one.</p>
          <p>And two, can you please update us on the status of the integration among Claro, Embratel and Net in Brazil, from a network standpoint or from a brand or product standpoint? And when should we expect to see more bundled products and cost synergies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Mauricio, starting with the first question on the ARPU, I think you're looking very good ARPUs all around Latin America. What is happening is that data ARPUs are, and data traffic, is growing. We have 31% data traffic growing year-on-year. And we are &#x2013; it's very good how does the ARPU in voices is doing, ARPU in voice is maintaining and still people is using. We have reductions on pricing all around Latin America, but still people is using a lot voice.</p>
          <p>So, what is happening a little bit from Brazil is that what you're saying competition, is hot in Brazil. The SIM cards only has been really driving the market, really competitive. And the other thing is we have been &#x2013; we don't &#x2013; we haven't had the network for data like my competitors in Brazil have. So we have been working for the last two, three years making a good network, a good data network, and we're getting to the point where we can be a little bit more aggressive and more competitive in the market in terms of data in Brazil. So, we &#x2013; I think that's where we are going to drive ARPU a little bit higher in Brazil. So, that's what I can tell you about ARPUs.</p>
          <p>And in the status around the integration, I think the integration that we have been having in Brazil has been &#x2013; we have been doing in stages. First, we start to do between Claro and Embratel. It seems this quarter we are going to do another stage, that's the integrating also Net. We are doing that on the networks on the &#x2013; &#xD3;scar can talk a little bit what we are doing on the networks, what we are doing on the IT.</p>
          <p>And of course in the future you could see more integration on the commercial side. So you are going to see more products of Net in the Claro stores, you are going to see more Claro products on the Net distribution channels. So you are going to start to see stage by stage, but &#xD3;scar can talk a little bit about what we are doing on the networks on the IT and all the integration on Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure thing. As Daniel was saying we have two main projects of integration, one is in IT and this will include the CRM and billing from the three companies; Claro, Net and Embratel. We already designed, we already have the blueprint to go ahead in the IT integration. We already choose all the platforms that we are going to use, but it's a very large project that it will take around 16 months to have all integrated. But we are doing some integration, not fully, to go to the market with a triple play and quadruple play offering in the marketplace. So that's the IT part.</p>
          <p>On the network side what &#x2013; as well, we already have our blueprint and a roadmap to achieve the integration. By the end of this project what we will have is a unified backbone, all the backbone MPLS, all IP. So by the end of the project we will have different kinds of access that, it could be mobile, it could be HFC networks or it could be enterprise, unified just in one single backbone. And this project has different stages of integration, but it will take us around 18 months to have a full integrated backbone on the IT projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thank you, Daniel and &#xD3;scar. So, Anthony, we may now open the call to Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we'll go first to Walter Piecyk at BTIG. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. Just a follow-up to Mauricio's questions on the ARPU. It looks like first quarter last year number was restated higher. I don't know, Carlos, if you could talk about what revenue might have been reclassed into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think all the numbers that appears here were basically &#x2013; <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:42) there was really no additional change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, because I &#x2013; when you just look at the press release from a year ago that ARPU in Mexico was 160 peso, and now it's 169, so I'm just &#x2013; so there was no change &#x2013; maybe there's just a different classification, though?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know what &#x2013; but there really wasn't any change that would &#x2013; you can call us back afterward -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fine. So, just more conceptually then, that ARPU growth that we're seeing now, which is kind of a change from recent years, should that also start to stabilize the margins, the EBITDA margins, in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we said about the EBITDA margins in Mexico is that, well, talking about only the wireless, we said that we're going to maintain that above 50%. And it's more or less what we're having. What is happening really in Mexico is that people is starting to use a lot data. They are starting to have more plans, data plans. We're selling lot more smartphones, and that's really what is driving the traffic now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Walter, going back to your question, no, I think &#x2013; I mean, there's no changes; only the ones that I mentioned before at the outset of the call. What I said is we are now presenting revenues that are not netting out the commissions paid to the distributors, but they are revenues in gross terms. So we basically changed for purpose of comparison...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...all the numbers of the prior year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And there was still growth anyway even with that restatement, or the &#x2013; changing how you're presenting that ARPU, there was still growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you &#x2013; just the last question on this, Daniel, on the smartphones that you referenced. And that's obviously helping to drive the ARPU. As you penetrate the base further, how do you make those smartphones affordable for the broader customer bases that you have throughout Latin America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think prices of the smartphones have been going down, and that's the way we can make them affordable. Three years ago, you shouldn't find any smartphone for less than $500, and today you are finding smartphones for $200 or a little bit less, no, so I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what about the &#x2013; but, Daniel, what about the very popular smartphone that costs more than $500? Can they &#x2013; how do you get broad adoption there, because there's kind of an assumption that those expenses will &#x2013; yeah, go ahead, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The people that &#x2013; you are still selling the high-end phones to the high-end people, and then you are selling &#x2013; people are starting in the prepaid part, in the prepaid segment. I think people are starting to buy not phones of $80, but yes they are starting to buy phones of $150 or $200 and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:53) prices that in prepaid they are starting to use data. So they are consuming a little bit more, so that's really the reason...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what about a $500 or $600 phone because the theory globally is that those $500 or $600 phones like the iPhone will generate the highest revenue and have the lowest churn. Can you get those phones &#x2013; can those prepaid base afford those $500 or $600 phones? Is there a way to get those phones in those people's hands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. No, of course not, but I don't think the iPhone is only on the $500 phone, if you have iPhone 3, it's much less than $500 phone, than the iPhone 4. It's higher than the iPhone 4S, it's higher so, and you have different type of phones &#x2013; even with 3G, you have with 8 gig, with 16 gig. So those types of handsets have been also going down. So even you are &#x2013; you can find &#x2013; check the stores, but you can find iPhones at much lower price than $500.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, the legacy models.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you for the call. I got a question regarding the antitrust vote on Monday, that's going to take place, regarding the fine. If it turns out negative, what other resources do you have for this line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think on that issue we'd prefer to wait until what's going to be the decision, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:39) and it's going to be on Monday their decision, so let's wait and see what is going to happen and when we know what's going to happen then we're going to take which decision we're going to do, no? But I think what we should do is wait until what's going to happen on Monday.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Michel Morin at Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on PayTV. I think if we look at your very good performance in Brazil, especially with the satellite offering that you launched maybe three years ago, it has just turned EBITDA positive, it seems, towards the end of last year, so it had a negative impact on margin and looks like that's starting to improve. What is your &#x2013; what do you think could be the ultimate profitability of that business in terms of EBITDA margins longer term?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, if you were to get a pay TV license in Mexico tomorrow, what would be a kind of the next steps you'd be taking, and likewise what kind of long-term profitability do you think you would be able to achieve in a market like Mexico? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, that &#xD3;scar can talk a little bit more about that, but my only comment here is that in Brazil, I mean not the other place, I think we can get to the EBITDAs like other companies, satellite companies would have in other places. We know that Brazil is a little bit more competitive, more complex, a little bit more taxes. But if you take out this, we should be on the media similar to other companies. And here in Telmex what technology, if they give us the pay TV, what technology we're going to use. &#xD3;scar, why don't you tell them a little bit, or Carlos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we could do is we could offer through different technology, for example IPTV which has already been instated in a couple of countries in which we have presence. And in terms of the market where we think that could happen would be that there would be more &#x2013; a more extensive portfolio for the market, which basically would benefit customers in terms of a more diverse offering plus', better prices, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And is it fair to say in Mexico then that it'd be the same kind of approach that you've taken in Brazil or you would also be using satellite as well as IPTV? And should we anticipate increased CapEx and maybe some spending as well, as you roll out the services?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in Mexico it's going to depend a lot on what's going to be the authorization.

          <p>Hi, how are you guys? This is Sean Glickenhaus. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your elimination of the unlimited mobile data plans in Mexico. I understand the long-term rationale but if you could go a little bit behind, the basis for that, also customer reactions and perhaps potential &#x2013; or timing to do the same in other countries. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have limited plans in almost all around Latin America. And what we do is it doesn't &#x2013; it's not make &#x2013; at this moment it's not going to make any difference to the customer because, let's say the average of the customer is using the 500 mega, so we cut to 1 giga. So there is not going to be any difference today. But what we don't want is that people starting to use the phone as a router and they starting to use those phones as a router and then start to abuse of the system, so that's mainly why we do it. I don't think any of our good customers are &#x2013; it's going to make any difference for them at this moment. So that's really the rationale.</p>

          <p>No &#x2013; it doesn't have anything to do with the law in Brazil. It has to be with the market and the competition and all of what is happening today in Brazil. Still they have unlimited and the competition is doing unlimited. Let's say in U.S. it's almost everybody has limited and with high caps. What we do in Mexico is limited, with high caps. So well that different terms of ways to commercializes the data. But I think all the customers, we don't have any comment on compliance by any of our customers because we give them much more than what they use.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. My question was regarding Brazilin margins and cost improvements. I mean, &#xD3;scar mentioned it will be another 18 months before you get all the different, start using one unified network. Should we then expect improvement in margin and cost savings coming from these synergies over the next 18 months, is that reasonable?</p>
          <p>And my next question was about sub growth there, appears to be, in Brazil, a change of strategy. You are focusing a lot more on postpaid and therefore you are not having as many as subscribers. How successful has that strategy been in the first three months of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. A lot of the cost improving, yes. We are doing the project to get some cost savings, mainly its improvement of quality and customer services. The project will bring us cost savings due to the integration of the different platforms that we already have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also, adding a little bit of what &#xD3;scar is saying, also the costs are going to be in the future of the CapEx &#x2013; future spending of CapEx, okay. So when you have one network then all the three companies are going to use the same network, so you are going to put less CapEx in the future than what you -.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Less maintenance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Less maintenance and less other things. Scale is very important. And the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When will be &#x2013; I mean, will there be any obvious improvement or notable improvement in margin that we can expect over the next 18 months in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you are not going to see a bigger &#x2013; big jump on the margin. I think it's going to be day-by-day. It's going to depend a lot also on the competitiveness of the market. So it depends on lot of things. Of course, we are going to have savings, but we don't know if these savings are going to be directly day-by-day to the P&amp;L, or there's going to be more competition, or there's going to be &#x2013; markets change a lot. So today Brazil is really tough on competitive market with the SIM cards, with all of those type of things Brazil is becoming really, really aggressive. And your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean regarding sub growth, we've seen a bit of a deceleration in your subscriber growth or at least market share of net adds in the first quarter. And I'm assuming that's your strategy to focus more on postpaid. But the question is, I mean are you getting a lot more of the postpaid subscribers that you wanted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we are getting as much as postpaid subscribes, but we also are interested in the prepaid subscribers. I think every day we are having more penetration. So well, the growth should be at less and lesser required, the growth but I think all the markets are interested for us. We have very loyal customers. Our customers have been with us. They are being changing. They are renewing with us, the postpaid and the prepaid subscribers.</p>
          <p>So, of course, every day you need to give them more things and more services and that's what they are going to do. What you could see as a reason &#x2013; and it's very important, checking number portability. I think number portability all around Latin America has been good for us, positive for us. That means that we have a better network, a better coverage and that the customer is deciding for our products and our networks. And that's really key for us in each country and means a lot. It means that we have the preference of the customers.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My question is about 4G. When do you expect to launch 4G in Latin America, specifically Mexico, and if you need to acquire more spectrum to launch 4G?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first &#x2013; hi, Vera. How are you? And I think 4G we are going to have 4G in some cities, in small amount of cities, maybe five cities or four cities. At the end of the year we are going to start to give 4G. We have &#x2013; we already have spectrum to do 4G. We just bought it last year and, in Mexico, and for the rest of Latin America, they are coming at the auctions of a spectrum. And when they start to do that then we are going to start to launch that. But it's very important that what we have been doing and investing the last two years is doing more on the backhaul, fiber to the node, a lot of investments. So the &#x2013; to put 4G in our networks is going to be much more easy, because we have been advancing a lot of this investment. So 4G is more on the radio side more than on the backbone, backhaul and that. So it's going to be, when Mexico is going to be at the end of the year, and the rest of, also Puerto Rico, we are also going to launch maybe in third quarter. And then as we can have the spectrum, then we are going to launch in the other country.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, hello. Two question, please. The first one was on Mexico, your data revenue growth of 34% was particularly impressive. I was wondering if you could give us some more details behind that. For example, how much is coming from SMS, how much from non-SMS, and in particular how many smartphones have you now sold and what growth are you seeing in smartphones year-on-year as a percentage of the base? And the second question is also on Mexico, it was on EBITDA down 3.7% year-on-year, do you think that's a peak rate of decline once we now start to lap some of the fee termination rate cuts that have been in place? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what was very hard in Mexico was the termination rates. But other thing that could be also impacting a little bit our result is that we're selling much more postpaid than prepaid. We are increasing our postpaid. We are increasing our sales from smartphones and that will give you a little bit more on subsidies. So that would be something. Then we have new, not in Mexico, but in other countries, we have new services that needs more content, and that would give you a little bit less the margins.</p>
          <p>What &#x2013; your first question is very interesting. I think what you are going to see &#x2013; I don't have the detail numbers of what you're asking, but the trend is to sell more smartphones, the smartphones are getting cheaper and people are starting to using postpaid and in prepaid more services. Still we have a little bit of growth on SMS. But we are growing more on broadcasting. We are growing more in other services. And I think that's mainly the big increase on data is more on the broadcasting &#x2013; on the broadband, sorry &#x2013; not broadband and those type of services.</p>
          <p>Prices of data are becoming down, so we have better prices to our clients and that means that they are using more and more, so that's going to be the trend for the next three years. More cost -</p>

          <p>Good morning, nice quarter. Could you give us an idea of your capital expenditures this year and could this be a year of peak expenditures over the next three years?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I think we have seen the peak in terms of CapEx, I think it is for CapEx of our last year. If you look at the Group together including with net CapEx for last year was between $10.5 billion and $11 billion. I think what we are looking at for the year is somewhere in the neighborhood of $9 billion to $9.5 billion. So we are reducing CapEx in absolute terms and it's coming down relative to sales. So the peak year was last year, as you said. We are going to be staying I think relatively flattish, about $9 billion this year and probably the next couple of years as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I was just wondering, is there a possibility that your dividend growth rates over the next two years could &#x2013; do you have a dividend payout rate in your mind or how do you feel towards dividend payouts over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They won't &#x2013; again I don't think that we are looking at changing the financial management of the company because we have been managing to maintain a certain leverage ratio which has been typically close to our one-time net debt to EBITDA. I think that while we are very &#x2013; any amounts in the figure, but we have and that are not spent in acquisitions, basically distributed back to shareholders. That's what we have done every single year. And the distributions, we have an ordinary dividend, we have share buybacks and from time-to-time, we may even resort to pay extraordinary dividends.</p>
          <p>So that has not changed. That's basically how we look at things. I think the question is really whether we need to stay at one times net debt to EBITDA. But that's, all &#x2013; but I think that there is really no change really in our -.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Couple of questions on 3G and 4G, if I could. On 3G, can you talk to us a little bit about the different operating systems you are seeing for smartphones and the success you've had and looking for with Android or BlackBerry or Apple?

          <p>On the different operating systems, as you know, Android has been a growing a lot. It's not different than what is happening in all around the world. Apple has been doing very good also. BlackBerry in Latin America is still doing good. I think their operating system is good. The BlackBerry Chat has been important. It's a big issue for the Latin American and key thing in Latin America. And I'm happy to have a new operating system, but it's going to be Windows being well support by the Nokia phones. And I hope they have been &#x2013; they could be a good operating system <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:33) for us as we have open systems, and a lot of them will be the best thing to come.</p>

You have an Android with more things inside the operating system, we have Androids with less things, and I hope that in the next years we can have an Android or an Apple or a Windows or a BlackBerry less than $100.

Looking at the integration of Net Servi&#xE7;os in Brazil and the driver of growth that it's been, have you considered any transactions to reduce the interest expense on the debt? It seems like there &#x2013; you could save several million dollars at that level in cash if you were to finance at America Movil type spreads as opposed to Net type spreads?</p>

Plus Claro in the wireless, I think. We are doing very good as one company there, and we feel very, very comfortable the way we're growing and the way we're doing things in Brazil. I think you should start seeing us as a whole group. We have all the services in Brazil. Of course we need to do some adjustments in some places like in the data in the wireless, let's say, but all overall, I think, our group in Brazil has been doing really good, extremely good.

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. It seems that pressure in voice tariffs in some countries, namely Colombia and Argentina, have slowed down, whereas in Mexico voice tariffs have continued to post double-digit declines, even without the decline in interconnection rates. So my question is, is if there is anything structurally different across these markets, maybe in regulation or in the competitive landscape, that make you think that the trends we are seeing should remain, or do you think that voice tariffs in Mexico could start stabilizing going forward? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Well, it's a question that is difficult to answer because you don't know what's going to be the competition in the next month. So as competition increases, then prices should be lower. And we have a huge competition in Mexico, and we're well prepared to compete. We have a good network to compete. We have a good name, a good brand, and a good distribution network. So it's going to depend a lot on that. Our most growth, to 250 minutes of usage, it's a lot and our revenue per minute decreased in Mexico 18%. So I think is what you're seeing that and, still with that we're still managing a good increase on ARPU. So it's what's really happening in Mexico.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, sorry, if I am correct, the different landscapes we are seeing in terms of tariffs between let's say Colombia and Argentina and Mexico, is mainly a function of the different competitive landscapes, you would say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. It's also &#x2013; you're seeing exactly the same. I gave you the numbers of Mexico. Let me give you the numbers of Colombia. In Colombia we have been reducing the price 5%, but Colombia was the lowest price in Latin America. So we started, we're still low, so reducing prices in Colombia.</p>
          <p>And Argentina is different because we have a little bit of inflation there. So &#x2013; but all around we are reducing prices. We are being aggressive in Argentina where, with a lot of giving good subsidies to the smartphones, so people will get smartphones and start to use data. So they are using a lot of SMS there. But we want that they use it more in data in Argentina, so more broadband, so that's more or less what we have. In Colombia, we have 16% increase on MoU from 216 to 230. So, it's big in Mexico from 235 to 250, 15% increase. So, all around we're seeing also the same trend.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, guys. On the Brazilian performance we had a very good reading from the Net Servi&#xE7;os and from the Embratel combination there. And my question is the pay TV market is still underpenetrated, there is still some opportunity. Do you guys expect the government to be granting you license so to open up that same speed to other regions that Net Servi&#xE7;os could go or Embratel or whatever? And also how do you see that with the potential competition that you may have, for example from Oi which is trying now to get out of revenue inertia and they have said in the investor data that they intend to be aggressive in the pay TV business? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on the first question that if we are going to ask for a new license in some new cities, yes. With HFC networks, that will extend our reach in new cable networks through Net Servi&#xE7;os. And the other part is that as you know we won the satellite slot as well in Brazil about two months ago. So we are going to expand our capabilities on the satellite.</p>
          <p>As you know the market is moving pretty rapidly to high definition on the offering in pay TV, in satellite pay TVs and the competition is already very tough in Brazil. There is a very large competitors over there, Sky is in the market Oi, Telefonica and other guys. So we &#x2013; how are preparing ourselves is to have the right distribution networks <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:35) a nationwide for satellite TV services.</p>
          <p>As you mentioned the pay TV penetration is still very low, but when you break out the penetration that is different in the different regions. So we are focused on the regions that we see as more opportunity as well. And another thing that we need to work around is the cost of the content. It's becoming a major cost for us. So we are trying to merge, to integrate, to get a new deal, to get exclusivity, some kind of content. So it's another source of, that we need to be profitable in the pay TV business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the competition with Oi?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Oi, we understand last week that they choose already Microsoft for IPTV. They are going to use the same IPTV that we are using in other countries. They choose Alcatel to make the integration as well. So we know the product. It's a good product, but we feel that we have the functionality to compete with this new IPTV that is coming in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with Oi the question as well, it's going to be another competitive market. But we &#x2013; the competition today...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sky is already there. It's already there, Sky and there is &#x2013; Sky, Telefonica, Oi, GVT. So that's not like it's going to be the only competition that we're going to have today. We have a lot of competition, tough competition. So, well I think Oi is going to start to do that. And well we are really prepared to &#x2013; have been doing investments for the last three years on those parts of the market, and I think we're well prepared to compete.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent, excellent. And staying on that same neck of the woods, we are seeing the price of broadband coming down very fast in Brazil. I don't, please correct if I am wrong, we are also already seeing Net Servi&#xE7;os beginning to grant more speed to existing customers trying to already be prepared for the arrival, potential arrival of the Italians or even the French through GVT. What's your reading on the broadband market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You are right. You are totally right. We have really improved the speed with around half of our customers, we need to be giving speed to our customers. We have already offering the marketplace 100 megabit if our customers need it, if it's a heavy user of Internet. And we are moving our customers to &#x2013; let's say the average is now &#x2013; is like 5 megabits in the whole customer base. Around 50% of our customers already have 10 megabits or more.</p>
          <p>So you are right, I mean the speed is &#x2013; we are improving. What we've been doing is to get closer the fiber to our network. So all the nodes in Net Servi&#xE7;os we are getting closest to the customer to have this kind of a speed in all the customers. And another one is digital TV. That is another trend that is coming out as well. If we close the fiber we could deliver as well digital TV.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And adding something of what &#xD3;scar is saying, I think if you check exactly what's happening in Brazil. I think Net Servi&#xE7;os has an excellent, excellent branding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quality.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quality of service. If you say that you received 40 megabit &#x2013; you receive &#x2013; you receive what they offer. So I think we have a very, very good product to offer to our customers. I think we make a survey and the Net Services product is one of the best services in Brazil. So -</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we will take our final question from Will Milner at Arete Research, Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Couple of questions from me. Firstly, could you just, if you are not, I guess, prepared to maybe give us postpaid ARPU, could you just explain how much greater postpaid ARPU is than prepaid ARPU in both Mexico and Brazil? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I just want to ask, is spectrum technology neutral in Mexico and Brazil. Could you run LTE in your existing 800 or 1,800 megahertz bands or do you actually need new spectrum to deploy 4G in Mexico and Brazil? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think what I said is 4G we are going to launch 4G in the license that we buy &#x2013; or that we bought maybe, the spectrum that we bought, I think, one year or one year and a half. The auction that we have in Mexico we buy &#x2013; we bought 20 mega of spectrum and that's where we are going to launch 4G. And in Brazil I think there are coming auctions in the mid of the year. So that's where we are going to launch the 4G networks. Still we have a lot to do in 3G all around Latin America because when you have HSDPA, you have a very good speed and that's all. I think we are in the perfect timing to start to launch 4G and to have more 3G in the, most cities in Latin America. So that's what we are doing at this moment, we are trying to do a lot more coverage in 3G and then we are going to launch 4G in the big cities in Latin America. It's our strategy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, sorry, the question was more a general question from a regulatory perspective, are you allowed to run different technologies in any spectrum band in Mexico and Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we have any restrictions to do certain technologies in certain license, in certain spectrum. I don't think we have that, maybe in one country as a specific thing, but all overall, we don't have any restriction to do anything.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the post-paid I don't have the numbers here.</p>
