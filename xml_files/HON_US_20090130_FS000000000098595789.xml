          <p>Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's fourth quarter and full year 2008 earnings conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO Dave Cote and Senior Vice President and CFO Dave Anderson.</p>
          <p>This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website, www.honeywell.com/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we would ask that you interpret them in that light.</p>
          <p>This morning, we'll review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2008, as well as our expectations for the first quarter of 2009, and of course allow time for your questions.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Murray. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report a quarter of good results, despite a challenging economic environment, closing out what was a great year of performance for Honeywell.</p>
          <p>Our results in 2008 reinforced the great positions we have in good industries, the investments we've made in process improvement through our five initiatives, the talent and depth of our management team, and of course the power of One Honeywell. Dave will take us through the details of the quarter in a moment. Let me say I'm extremely proud of this Honeywell team delivering EPS growth of 7% on a 6% sales decline and free cash flow conversion of 155%, despite some unprecedented economic headwinds.</p>
          <p>Our well diversified and balanced portfolio is really helping drive overall strong performance, and for the full-year 2008, we increased sales by 6% to 36.6 billion, increased earnings per share by 19% to $3.76, and converted free cash flow at an impressive rate of 110% of net income.</p>
          <p>During the year, we completed a total of eight acquisitions for 2.2 billion, including Norcross, Metrologic, Callidus, and IAC, further building our growth platforms. Our acquisition process continues to work incredibly well. We remain disciplined around price, and our robust integration process ensures that we deliver on our synergies.</p>
          <p>We also divested the Aerospace Consumable Solutions business in 2008 for proceeds of more than $1 billion. A great deal for Honeywell, and a credit to Rob Gillette and his Aerospace team. Our key initiatives continue to gain traction in our businesses and functions every day, and we have a lot of room for even further improvement.</p>
          <p>The Honeywell operating system has now been initiated in 70% of our manufacturing cost base, with 80% targeted for 2009. We're starting to see the first sites reach bronze HOS certification, and the results are impressive. Along with the quality, delivery, safety, cost, and inventory improvements, we are seeing real changes in culture and attitude, and that's the stuff that makes HOS a sustainable, repeatable platform for improvement.</p>
          <p>Functional Transformation is basically HOS for administrative functions, the same concepts: standard work and one robust process, all designed to deliver better service at lower cost. We're targeting 5.3% of sales in '09, down from more than 8% in 2004, with plenty of runway to reach world-class.</p>
          <p>Finally, I just spent two days with our top 300 leaders, where we concentrated almost exclusively on delivering results in this tough economic environment. While we should all be rightly cautious about the challenges that are ahead of us, particularly in the first half of '09, I feel good about the investments we've been making in our businesses for the past six years to prepare us for these times. HOS, FT, ERP, Velocity Product Development, emerging region presence, and acquisitions are all the seeds that we've planted to help improve our growth, productivity, and cash flow. We have the right leadership team in place to deliver these improvements, and we've been taking the right, proactive repositioning actions ahead of the curve to prepare ourselves for this challenging environment.</p>
          <p>So in summary, with our great results for 2008 and the momentum we are building with our key initiatives, I feel confident in our outlook for '09, despite some very tough economic conditions. We're looking forward to keeping you updated on our progress.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn the call over to Dave to go through the financials in detail for the quarter. Dave?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks, Dave. Let's go to slide number 4, and let me walk you through the summary of financial results for the fourth quarter, really building on Dave's comments. And as he said and as we all know, in a tough set of challenging economic conditions, we posted overall good results in the fourth quarter, importantly in line with the guidance we provided you in December.</p>
          <p>Reported sales were down 6%, 4% on an organic constant currency basis. However, our two biggest businesses, the Aerospace business and ACS, importantly both grew organically in the quarter. Both were up 2% on a constant currency organic basis. Segment margins for total HON declined 40 basis points in the fourth quarter. But again, importantly, our two biggest businesses posted increases year-over-year. ACS was up an impressive 110 basis points, Aero was up 40 basis points in the quarter. It was unfortunately more than offset by continued weakness in Transportation Systems, which was down over 10 percentage points in the quarter on significant volume declines.</p>
          <p>Net income grew 3%, driven primarily by favorable pension and OPEB as expected, and also lower environmental charges, which we had communicated in the third quarter and our guidance for the fourth quarter. And of course in the third quarter, we took you through the details of the Consumable Solutions gain and the associated actions. But to remind you, we reviewed at that time the tax impacts and indicated that we would have a higher ETR in the third quarter, which we did, 30.5%, and a lower ETR in the fourth quarter, which came in at 22%. We also indicated in the third quarter when we gave fourth quarter guidance that we would offset this lower fourth quarter effective tax rate with repositioning actions; we indicated about $30 million. And in fact we spent $42 million in repositioning in the fourth quarter, which will further support our '09 and '10 outlook.</p>
          <p>EPS grew 7%, partially driven by lower share count. And importantly, as Dave pointed out, free cash flow conversion, another high-quality story in the quarter, 155% conversion. Overall a good quarter, tough conditions, and the end of another great year for Honeywell. Let's go to slide 5 and just summarize that as well.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 5, the total year is in line with our December guidance. We reported sales of 6%, 2% on an organic constant currency basis. Importantly, three of the four businesses posted organic sales increases in the year, with a similar story in terms of expansion of margins. So while margins declined 20 basis points overall, Aero grew 20 points, ACS's margins were up 30 points for the year, and Specialty Materials grew 20 points. All impressive performance in the environment that we are in.</p>
          <p>Net income grew 14% for the year with favorable pension and OPEB again, importantly though, also including more than 400 million of repositioning actions in the year, all of this funded either through operational performance or gains, and of course again will provide great support for us in '09 and '10. EPS for the year, as Dave said, up an impressive 19% to $3.76. We generated 3.1 billion of free cash flow, 110% of net income.</p>
          <p>So now let's go through each of the segments, starting with Aerospace on slide 6. The reported segment sales in the quarter were down 1% for Aero, but excluding the impact of the CS divestiture were up 2% on an organic basis. The segment profit up 1%, and margins up 40 basis points, as I said earlier, to an impressive 19.2%. On an organic basis, total commercial sales &#x2013; that is the ATR and BGA businesses &#x2013; were up 2% in the quarter with continued strong deliveries and the timing of the aftermarket activity in business jets being offset by the impact of the Boeing strike and lower global flight hours at Air Transport, which we had anticipated.</p>
          <p>The organic commercial OE sales were up 2%, driven by our business jet business, which saw strong sales growth, 15% in the fourth quarter, offset by Air Transport and Regional sales, which were down 12% due to the Boeing strike. Importantly, including the impact of Boeing, ATR OE sales were up 13% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Commercial aftermarket sales were up 1%. The AT&amp;R aftermarket sales were flat, slightly higher than global flying hours, which were down approximately 2%. Now, the B&amp;GA aftermarket sales were up 3% in the quarter, driven by the timing of aftermarket events, despite TFE hours, which were down 22% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Defense and Space, a good quarter for Defense, up 4%, driven by the strength in our Logistics and Services business which were up 13%; Space, which was up 18%. And just as a reminder, Defense and Space, of course more than 40% of the Aero portfolio, remains very well positioned, and we expect nice growth out of this segment in 2009.</p>
          <p>So in summary, another strong quarter for Aero, capping a great year where sales grew 3% to 12.7 billion. Margin increased 20 basis points to 18.2%. And importantly, we won over 40 billion of new business in '08, including approximately 30 billion of new applications for our HTF7500 engine. The investments we've made in Aero are paying off. The long-term outlook for this business remains very strong.</p>
          <p>Now, with that review of Aero, let's go to slide 7, and go through the highlights of ACS. Starting with the quarter, sales were up 3%, 2% organic on a constant currency basis, if you exclude the negative 9% foreign currency impact and the 10% positive contribution that we got from acquisitions. And by the way, we had positive organic growth, importantly, in ACS across all regions in the quarter, which is impressive.</p>
          <p>Our Products businesses overall continue to perform well. They were up 7% reported in the quarter. We saw continued strength in ECC and Life Safety business particularly. Both ECC and Life Safety reported mid-single digit organic growth, including both North America and Europe. The Security Distribution and Sensing Control businesses, as expected, continue to be impacted by weakness in residential and transportation end markets. And as you know, you'll recall we discussed this in some depth in our outlook call in December.</p>
          <p>Now, the Solutions businesses continued to perform well. We had organic growth of 7% in the quarter with demand for energy efficiency, as well as the integration of climate, fire, and security controls for critical infrastructure all being important drivers at Building Solutions. And at Process Solutions, the oil and gas production, particularly upstream, as well as distribution projects, continued to be solid. Orders in the fourth quarter in Solutions were essentially flat, reflecting tough comps. We were up 30% in orders in the fourth quarter of 2007. Process Solutions showed continued strength, with orders growth in the high single digits. Building Solutions orders were down in the quarter, but really due to project timing. For the year, orders for both businesses were strong, and we exit the year with growth in our backlog, as well as in our service banks.</p>
          <p>ACS's segment profit was up 12% in the quarter, as you can see, representing an impressive 110 basis points increase in margin to 13.4%. The ACS team made great progress on new products &#x2013; that's a theme, by the way, that's underlying obviously this performance &#x2013; as well as productivity and the contribution of the acquisitions. All of those were positive contributions for ACS in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Sales for the year for ACS grew an impressive 12% to $14 billion. Margins increased 30 basis points to 11.6%. Clearly, what we're seeing is the strength of the multibrand, multichannel strategy, as well as the investments that Roger and the ACS team have made in innovation in new product development. Also the strong positions in emerging regions, that continues to drive positive growth for ACS, and we'll continue to see us increase our penetration in these markets, despite signs of slowing growth in those markets.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to slide 8, Transportation Systems, which as we all expected and as we guided had a tough quarter, capping off a very challenging year for 2008. And importantly &#x2013; and we'll review this in a little more depth as we get into the first quarter and '09 update &#x2013; we expect these trends to continue through the majority of '09.</p>
          <p>So turning to slide 8 for TS, overall sales, as you can see, were down 35%, including a 4% foreign currency headwind, adding to the volume decline impact. At Turbo, which was down 44% reported, we saw continued sharply lower vehicle production rates at European and U.S. OEMs, as well as a continued consumer shift towards lower-displacement engines due to CO2 taxation, as well as a shift to gas engines due to continued high diesel prices at the pump. So in addition to the OE production volume impact, we also obviously had mix impact in terms of consumer pull.</p>
          <p>New platform launches continue to be pushed out for TS, as OEs struggled with lower sales of their current inventories. However, our content on future platforms continues to grow. Despite the current challenges and the expectation for the continuation of those challenges into '09, the overall macro trends for Turbo remain very positive, with energy efficiency and emissions, as well as our robust backlog of attractive new platforms. We've had over 4 billion &#x2013; just as a reminder, over $4 billion of wins in 2008. They obviously give us confidence in the long-term prospects for this business.</p>
          <p>For CPG, it was down 18% reported. We continue to face headwinds in the U.S. automotive aftermarket, the consumer aftermarket. Volumes were down in car care and filtration as economic concerns weigh on consumer confidence in discretionary spending. Segment profit for total TS was down 96% in the quarter, again due primarily to lower volumes at Turbo. And for the full year, TS sales were 4.6 billion, a decrease of 8%. Segment margins were 8.8%, down 280 basis points for 2007.</p>
          <p>So with that let's go to SM, slide number 9. Sales in the quarter for SM were down 12%. Segment profit was down 16% in the quarter, primarily due to lower volumes at Resins &amp; Chemicals and also Electronic Materials due to significantly weaker global demand for commodities such as caprolactam and also ammonium sulfate fertilizer, as well as capacity reductions in the semiconductor industry. Now fortunately, the declines were partially offset by good performance at UOP, which saw increased catalyst sales in the quarter, and also Fluorines Products, which grew 7%.</p>
          <p>For the year, Specialty Materials sales were up 8% to 5.3 billion. Margins increased 20 basis points to 13.7%, including almost 30 million or 50 basis points of headwinds from hurricane impacts. So really a good year overall for SM. And today SM is a much, much better protected business from fluctuations in commodity prices due to its formula pricing agreements. And as you recall, the portfolio is significantly transformed compared to prior downturns.</p>
          <p>So now let's go to slide 10 and just update you on our 2009 guidance, given the increased visibility we have as a result of the completion of '08 and the beginning of '09. Now, on the top of the slide, we've summarized the guidance that we shared with you last month. And at the bottom of slide 10, we've outlined the status with some of the positive variances on the left and negative variances on the right, which are certain items since our December 15 call.</p>
          <p>Now overall, we expect to be in the range of the full-year guidance that we communicated last month. However, if January trends continue into the first half of '09, we would expect to be at the low end of this guidance range, although economic conditions continue to be very fluid. Also as an update, cash flow perspective: We expect to be 100% plus free cash flow conversion for the year 2009.</p>
          <p>So let's walk through some of the specifics in the bottom half of slide 10, starting with pension. Now, you'll recall from the December guidance, our base case pension assumptions were for the 12/31/08 plan returns and discount rate 33% and 7.5% respectively, which would yield an expense for '09 in the range of 130 million. Now, actual returns in '08 ended the year slightly better at 29% compared to that down 33% that was the midpoint of our guidance. However, we saw yields move down significantly during the last few days of December and ended the year for us at our discount rate using the yield curve associated with the expected lives of our plan participants at 6.95%. We're still yet to finalize the 2000 (sic) [2009] numbers for the international plan, but based upon the U.S. plan actuals, we would expect an incremental 40 to $50 million pension expense in '09, bringing the total year to approximately 175 million of expense.</p>
          <p>Now, you note that we also took a 2.6 billion charge to equity &#x2013; that's an after-tax charge to equity &#x2013; at the end of '08, reflecting the accounting treatment of the underfunded U.S. plan as of December 31. We also made our first stock contribution to the U.S. plan at the end of the fourth quarter in the amount of $200 million, which is in line with the funding plans that we communicated to you in December.</p>
          <p>For foreign exchange, our largest &#x2013; the next component that I've highlighted there &#x2013; our largest currency exposure, the euro continues to trade above our planned rates for 2009. You'll recall the 1.25 guidance. And at current levels, this &#x2013; let's call it a 1.30 kind of range or 1.30 plus &#x2013; this benefit would offset the incremental pension headwind. However, it's obviously too early to change our assumptions for FX for the year. But we thought it'd be helpful just to give you a sense of the puts and takes that support the current guidance range.</p>
          <p>Working the way down to the remaining positive items on the left, the highlights that I gave you on ACS, ACS continues to perform well, as evidenced by the 110 basis point improvement in margins and 2% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter. Again, new products and acquisitions are the positive contributors to ACS's results. And Roger and his team, the ACS team, remain confident in their outlook for the year.</p>
          <p>On the purchasing side, we continue to see additional savings opportunities with raw materials at the current levels. And these should benefit us particularly in the second half of '09.</p>
          <p>And finally, under productivity, we see opportunity to overdrive savings across a number of our repositioning and functional transformation projects that are already underway.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we expect to see growth in China muted. Slower expectations for GDP growth in these regions, and well below the expectations &#x2013; and now below, I should say, the expectations that we had in December. We've seen business activity slow in the region, as well as increased levels of project deferrals and cancellations in some instances.</p>
          <p>Within Aero, we continue to see shifts in OE deliveries, particularly with business jets, as our customers work to realign their schedules in the face of increased deferrals and cancellations. We expect Air Transport and Regional flight hours to now be at the low end of our communicated range, down 2% for the full year. Previously, we communicated down 1 to 2. We now expect, based upon the exit rate of the fourth quarter and what we're seeing in the first quarter of this year, to be down now 2% for the full year.</p>
          <p>Business jet engine TFE hours, we expect to continue at fourth quarter levels, which would be down approximately 25% in the first quarter. And within SM, the outlook for our Electronic Materials business is weaker than anticipated as capacity in the semiconductor industry continues to be reduced.</p>
          <p>And finally, as we segue to the quarters, our expectation is for a much weaker first half for both earnings and cash, while the second half will benefit from much easier comps, the improved run rate of construction benefits, and also lower commodity costs, as well as &#x2013; more minor &#x2013; some foreign currency translation differential.</p>
          <p>So with that background for the full year and the update on the guidance for '09, let's take a high-level look at the first quarter of '09 on slide 11. We're planning, as you can see on the slide, for total sales in the first quarter to be in the range of 7.4 billion to 8 billion, down 10 to 17% from the first quarter of '08. Including approximately 6 points of negative foreign currency impact, we expect EPS to be in the range of 0.50 to $0.60, down approximately 30 to 40%. We also expect free cash flow to be soft and below prior year due to the reduced net income, as well as right now, some anticipated one-time cash tax payments.</p>
          <p>Now, clearly these numbers represent significant declines from prior year, and frankly our order books at this point in time are not reflecting these types of declines. However, given the continued negative economic news, this is the way we're planning our costs and managing our business.</p>
          <p>We anticipate Aero sales in the first quarter to be in the range of 2.6 to 2.8 billion, down 6 to 13%, including a negative 4 point impact from the sale of Consumable Solutions, so down 2 to down 9 absent that impact. We expect sales to OE customers to decline due to the platform mix at Air Transport and also reduced delivery schedules of business jets. In the aftermarket, as I said, we expect AT&amp;R sales to decline slightly more than flight hours, driven by buying behavior, and we expect those flight hours to be down around 4%. And by the way, that compares to global flying hours of 7.2% in the first quarter of 2008. And in business jets, TFE hours are expected to be down approximately 25%, as I said earlier, and that compares to 1% in first quarter '08. So that gives you some insight in terms of the tough comps that we're facing, particularly in this first quarter and the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>For ACS, we expect sales in the range of 3 to 3.2 billion, up 2% to down 4% versus the prior year. And by the way, that includes a 4 point net headwind from FX and acquisitions. We expect similar trends that we saw in the fourth quarter with acquisitions, new products, and conversion of Solutions backlog being offset by weakness in Security and Sensing and Controls.</p>
          <p>At Transportation Systems, sales for the first quarter, we expect in the range of 700 million to 800 million, down 33% to 41%, again with similar trends that we saw in the fourth quarter, really a continuation of that Turbo volume declines that we referenced.</p>
          <p>Finally at SM, we anticipate sales of 0.9 billion to 1 billion, down more than 25% due to continued softness in Resins &amp; Chemicals and Electronic Materials and extremely difficult comps at UOP. You'll recall we had the high-margin catalyst sales in the first quarter of 2008; we expect those to be down more than 30% in the first quarter of '09.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we're preparing ourselves for an extremely tough quarter. We think this is representative of the industrial landscape that we think will unfold. However, as we discussed, the environment remains fluid. Orders at this point in time actually continue to be much more positive, and we'll update you again at our annual investor meeting in February.</p>
          <p>So now let's summarize on slide 12, before turning it back over to Murray for Dave and I for Q&amp;A. We obviously had a good finish to '08, despite tough economic and end market conditions in the last few months. We saw particularly in that December month and at year-end much more challenging conditions. We saw a deterioration in markets such as Commercial Aerospace and Electronic Materials, and we're planning for these trends to continue into the first half of '09.</p>
          <p>Now, we're expecting, given the relative strength of the first half of '08, that the comparison to the first half of '09 will be very challenging year-over-year. In addition to foreign exchange, where the euro averaged almost 1.5 in the first quarter of '08, some of our key businesses such as Air Transport and Regional aftermarket, Turbo Chargers and UOP, and Resins &amp; Chemicals will face significant year-over-year headwinds.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we'll see incremental benefits from repositioning actions that we funded in '08 in the second half of 2009, and these benefits, in combination with easier year-over-year comps, seasonality in Defense and Space &#x2013; Defense and Space just normally has a pattern of a larger second-half &#x2013; as well as the tailwind for lower raw material costs, should drive a stronger second half for Honeywell. We therefore remain confident in our outlook for the year. However, we expect higher than usual quarter-over-quarter variability. And as I stated previously, if the January trends continue into the first half of 2009, we would realistically expect to be at the low end of our annual guidance range.</p>
          <p>Now, clearly this environment is going to be a test for all companies. But for Honeywell, our portfolio is stronger, Aerospace is lean, customer focus, it has the stability of its $5 billion plus Defense business. ACS has attractive new products that are being sold through multiple brands and multiple channels all over the world &#x2013; and by the way they're showing the strength of their new product performance as well as their successful acquisition integrations. Specialty Materials is much better positioned today to protect its bottom line than in previous cycles. As always, our planning focus for '09 is around achievable top line growth while aggressively managing cost with contingency plans in place that maintain our flexibility, should economic conditions be more positive or more negative than we've assumed in this guidance.</p>
          <p>We continue to pursue, as Dave said, and see the fruits of HOS and FT. We're targeting more than 80% of our manufacturing cost base to be under HOS by the end of '09 &#x2013; that is facilities implemented &#x2013; and our total functional cost to be down to 5.3% of sales in '09, down from more than 8% in 2004. We've been investing in seed planting over the last six years, but we feel that we're well prepared as a result, for our proactive repositioning actions to weather the tough economic environment.</p>
          <p>And again as a reminder, we'll be hosting our annual Investor Day. We look forward to seeing you all there in New York City on Monday, February 23. Our business unit presidents, Dave, and I will be there. We look forward to sharing more detail about our businesses and to update you on their outlook for 2009.</p>
          <p>So with that, Murray, I'll turn it over to you for Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Hey, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, no surprise you're taking a cautious stance on Q1; it's pretty grim out there. But to Dave Anderson's point, maybe the order trends don't quite get you to a Q1 that looks this tough, just based on what you're seeing so far. But maybe you could just give us a little more color on where the backlogs where as you exited '08, relative to where they were in Q3. And a little more specificity on where the orders are okay versus where they're starting to falter a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I just take a quick shot at that, Dave, and then you can add? As I said, Jeff, in general, the guidance that we've provided you is consistent in terms of the assumptions that we used in December. The two notable sections, really are in the Aerospace, where we've taken down the flight hour assumptions to the lower end of the range, and we've reflected that in terms of the kind of the annualization of that in terms of a lower start to the year. We're actually at negative 4% for the first half of the year in terms of the global flight hour assumptions. That's a big one; that's an important one. At this point in time, we're actually seeing the numbers hold up pretty well, from an order standpoint.</p>
          <p>The second key change that we've made here is really in Specialty Materials, with the assumption on Electronic Materials, where we've seen material softness in terms of order rates and activity, particularly driven by the semiconductor industry, intel, et cetera. If you look at the backlogs and where we finished the year in terms of our, if you will, long-cycle businesses, they actually held up very well. For example in the Solutions business, as I indicated, we actually saw growth in backlog at year-end.</p>
          <p>So the trends that we're seeing overall are consistent with guidance. The notable exceptions and where we've really reflected that in terms of, particularly in this first quarter and what would be implied in terms of our first half guidance, is really in the Aero business with the expectation, the anticipation, that we'll be at the low end annually on the global flying hours and that'll really be manifested in the first half of the year, and then the impact of Electronic Materials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I might add, Dave, if you want, on the ACS new products, that's making a difference also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I'm also just wondering, relative to the restructuring payback, I think the '09 goal is about 500 million gross savings. I think that's an incremental 350 or so off the '08 base. Is that still the right framework? And maybe get a little color on how that builds over the course of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jeff, those are the right numbers. And it really &#x2013; it builds somewhat slowly in the first half, and it's really weighted to the second half of the year. So it's about 60% to 70% weighted to the back of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And we should expect very little new restructuring spend in the first part of '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from John Inch with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Picking up on that last point, if you annualize based on normal historical seasonality the first quarter, really doesn't get you an EPS much above $3 per share. So is there, Dave or Dave &#x2013; other than this sort of $0.35 weighted to the back half, is there anything else about the first half or specifically this first quarter that you could talk to as to why you don't simply use normal historical seasonality to annualize the 0.50 to $0.60 to come up with a sort of target number for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just a overall comment, then I'll turn it over to Dave. But we're in an environment now where I'm not sure normal seasonality always applies. So we're looking at where our businesses stand individually, planning for a tougher environment. The comps are different, as we &#x2013; Dave talked to earlier. And we don't think the normal seasonality applies. It's a very different environment. Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would just add to that that if you look at three of our very profitable business segments &#x2013; Aerospace aftermarket, UOP, and Turbo &#x2013; just, John, to use those as providing insight to your question. As I mentioned, if you look at just the Aerospace aftermarket, in the first quarter of 2008, global flying hours were up 7.2%. We're expecting global flying hours to be down 4% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Turbo volumes, volumes total global Turbo first quarter last year, 2.5 million &#x2013; an exit rate, by the way, in the fourth quarter of about 1.3 million. We're using 1.2 million as our planning assumption, our guidance assumption, for the first quarter, down from the fourth quarter of 2008. But importantly, down 49% from the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>So what you have is you have a distinctly different pattern in terms of how 2008 actually emerged, to Dave's point, with the timing and the distribution of revenues and profitability during the year and the phenomena of that fourth quarter exit rate, now we're rebuilding into the first quarter. So when you look at the second half comps, the second half comps are just dramatically changed and easier compared to anything that we would have ever seen historically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's fair. But to be clear, are you counting on any kind of &#x2013; forgetting about comps &#x2013; any kind of underlying macro improvement as part of the overall guide for 2009, whether it be North America, Europe, or other places?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's some improvement, but the improvement is really driven &#x2013; even if you look at the macro indicators like global flying hours or Turbo volume or even UOP catalysts &#x2013; it's really largely attributable, John, to timing differences. The other thing of course is, I mentioned and it's more minor, is the foreign exchange headwinds. We actually have a sequential tailwind with foreign exchange using our 1.25 assumption for the euro, repositioning as I mentioned in my response to Jeff's question, is &#x2013; the repositioning benefits obviously are weighted to the second half given the timing of the major repositioning that we did in the in the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>So that, together with &#x2013; and then it gets more smaller items, but defense and space timing, et cetera. Really the buildup is really in the comparisons &#x2013; the year-over-year comparisons, together with repositioning the foreign currency, and also the timing and the anticipated timing of lower commodity costs, just getting the lag in terms of from a procurement standpoint in our procurement contracts for other than SM. So for ACS, for Aero, for Transportation Systems, there's a lag effect in terms of when we see lower commodity costs actually translated into lower cost of goods sold and productivity benefits for us. That's also a support to our second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, that's very helpful. Just lastly, Dave Anderson, the shareholders' equity, that was down pretty substantially. Is that going to affect any prospective ability to repurchase shares? I know it's not part of your guide, but assuming some of this plays out, you've still got a lot of cash that you're generating. Do those shareholder equity book numbers affect any kind of sort of thought process, vis-&#xE0;-vis share repurchase or liquidity or debt ratings or anything else that you'd care to comment on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you said it. You said it well, John, which is really those are book entries. They're non-economic. If you look at &#x2013; we took almost as big a hit in terms of our &#x2013; if you did the equity roll-forward from the end of '07 to the end of '08, we took almost as big a hit in terms of our share buyback -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; in terms of our equity as we did from the pension. So it really comes back to the economic view of our free cash flow to debt relationship. We feel good about that, and we feel good about being able to maintain our rating.</p>
          <p>And as we've said, we'll continue to be opportunistic in this environment. The important point that we've emphasized is one of managing our liquidity and ensuring that we've got some improvement in some of our ratios, credit ratios, as a result of the economic downturn and the uncertainty in this environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of things to add to that, John. I'm sure you're familiar with what the accounting looks like when you repurchase shares and the impact that has on equity. I'm not going to say it makes sense, but you end up driving equity down even more as you repurchase shares. But secondly, in the course of the year, we're a very good cash generator. And we intend to focus a lot on generating cash, and that's our first priority right now, is just making sure we continue to do that.</p>

          <p>And we'll take our next question from Scott Davis from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just &#x2013; I think you mentioned that you made a stock contribution to the pension of a couple hundred million, and just looking at your balance sheet, you've got a couple billion in cash on the balance sheet. In the last cycle, you were in a bit of a pinch with asbestos and such and really had to make a stock contribution. But why do so now? I mean, it seems like it's a fairly expensive way at this stock price to shore up the pension.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Scott, we weighed that pretty extensively and felt that in light of again our credit metrics and what we want in terms of continued flexibility and liquidity, that when we look at all the trade-offs, we thought that was the best option.</p>
          <p>The other thing is we stated, when we gave our guidance call, this is our plan. And we have a series &#x2013; we've deliberately staged the share contributions to the pension plan as a set of installments that we'll evaluate over the course of the year. We'll look to see how the pension plan actually performs, what is the return on assets, we'll look at our funded balance on a real-time or updated basis, and we we'll just continue to judge that as we go through the year. But it's a pretty dynamic environment. And we think that's the most prudent thing, all things considered, and importantly, weighed all of those considerations in this decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. I don't want to harp on the same question the other guys asked, but I do think that's going to be fairly topical to how your stock trades. I mean, when you think about &#x2013; your guidance is a little bit back-end loaded, but to play devil's advocate, you've got commercial construction probably by mid '09 is going to get much tougher, same with process automation. So ACS may have some headwinds that it doesn't have right now. I mean, is there some level of comfort to offset that &#x2013; and let's just focus on ACS for now, if you will &#x2013; that you can cut discretionary spending &#x2013; I know you've invested pretty heavily in that business &#x2013; and do other things? I suppose there's been some restructuring in that segment as well to offset those declines. And just to go on a little bit more with this question, maybe you can just tell us how you're thinking about those end markets? Some of us are certainly concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to ACS, as we've said in the past, they generally plan their year based upon contingency spending. So they set up the whole year so that if sales materialize the way they say, then they'll do the spending. But if sales don't materialize the way they plan, there's spending they just don't do. They pull the trigger on some of the spending depending upon how sales look.</p>
          <p>Even when we look at some of the short cycle stuff in ACS, though, as Dave was pointing out earlier, we can't underestimate the impact that the new product introductions have had. These guys are really creating new markets. So it's not just a matter of taking share the way we might traditionally measure it, but the opportunities that we've seen from new products, even in our short-cycle businesses, is quite extensive. And all that seed planting that they've done over the last six years really makes a difference here and helps to mitigate the cycle. And we're planning for it to be difficult. I mean, we're trying to anticipate that in every one of our businesses, to be very wide-eyed in terms of how we look at this stuff and make sure that we understand how difficult it could be and plan accordingly.</p>
          <p>Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The thing that I would add is just on a regional basis &#x2013; and again, we discussed this in December &#x2013; the expectation is that the developed market is going to be down somewhere between 5 and 10%. So if you look at U.S. and Europe, despite the fact that we actually grew, as I said in the fourth quarter in ACS in all regions, we actually are expecting declines in developed markets and with relatively modest growth in the emerging regions. We've got 5 to 10% up in the emerging regions.</p>
          <p>So it really &#x2013; we think that the fundamentals, the contingencies that are in place, the expectation is that we're going to see some softening, obviously, in the non-residential space. Now, importantly, as you know, Scott, we have a very, very large flywheel that's in place in terms of the install base, in terms of buildings, hospitals, government facilities, et cetera, energy efficiency, which generates the retrofit or aftermarket for us, which is actually the majority of our revenues. And in addition, energy efficiency is continuing to grow. We're actually seeing double-digit growth driven by energy efficiency in ACS, in that segment of the business.</p>
          <p>So it's really a balance of all those factors, but I think Dave's point is the operative one, which is the planning assumption in addition to achievable sales is contingency in terms of the spending that &#x2013; and flexibility in terms of that spending &#x2013; that ACS will do only if in fact the market conditions support it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Makes sense. Dave, did you update CapEx guidance? I didn't hear you say anything about it on the call.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would expect CapEx is going be down year-over-year. We're still finalizing some of those numbers, Scott, but it's going to be down in the range of 5 to 10% relative to 2008 actuals.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, just wanted to understand a couple of things. Obviously, under a different team in the last downturn, you went through a time of laying off about 20,000 people and having an $8 billion write-off and no merit increases and things like that. And now you're in a timeframe where you can get on the front foot, given all the work over the last five or six years. Where do you plan to put that emphasis in terms of M&amp;A, feet on the street, R&amp;D in terms of not just product cost redesign, but new products this year? So what are the kinds of things that you're talking about doing to come out faster on the other side of this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the &#x2013; I think that the message that we want to have is that one of the reasons that we'll be able to weather this downturn very differently than we did last time is we've been doing six years of seed planting across the board, whether it was new products, new geographic, getting our costs in better position. And if you recall last time, it was a very different position, because the mergers had just occurred, and there were a lot of moving parts to it at a very difficult time. This is very different, and that seed planting that we've done then is helping us now.</p>
          <p>And that seed planting is going to continue. We're not shorting the future with the stuff that we're doing today. You look at something like a Honeywell Operating System, that's going to continue to expand. Functional Transformation, going to continue to expand. The work we're doing on Velocity Product Development to keep introducing new products that customers want, getting it out there faster, that's going to continue. You can always point to something or a program where we may delay a bit, recognizing that launches may be different on the other side. But at the end of the day, this seed planting is going to continue, because that's what got us here, and that's what's going to cause us to come out very big on the other side.</p>
          <p>Dave, anything you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So maybe to follow that up a little bit, in terms of being specific about &#x2013; on the repositioning side now &#x2013; for the programs that you're talking about coming to fruition in the second half. Can you talk about how execution on that front, across particularly maybe Transportation Systems and Aero, moving to low-cost countries? Are those programs in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I should &#x2013; I mean, starting with the last part first. We're not so much moving things as we are &#x2013; we've been expanding in some of these other places. And we've tried to be very judicious in how we've added people. It's very easy to just keep adding during the good times, and as a result of that when the tough times hit, you have to correct a bunch of that. But if you take a look at what we've tried to do with the census over the last six years, we've been very judicious in how we've added, and I think very thoughtful about it, so we didn't find ourselves in the same predicament. So you're not going to see a lot of big actions from us there. And the restructuring that we have launched in the, say the previous 18 months, it takes time for the benefits of that to show up. And we're expecting to see more of that arising in the second half, or the benefits of it.</p>
          <p>Dave?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on Transportation Systems, just more color again around given all the program wins and all of the activity there. On the cost side, can you provide some more color about what's going to be different this year in terms of the cost structure of the company to handle this massive downturn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in Transportation Systems, it's developed into a difficult market. And one of the things that we've always told ourselves is that we had to have such a superb cost and technology advantage that we'd always be the best alternative for any customer. That focus hasn't changed. And you saw some of the restructuring that occurred there, where we have combined our CV and PV organizations, streamlining that further. So we've been reducing the overall structural costs while continuing to maintain just the terrific product costs relative to our competition. And that's going to continue also. That focus is not going to change.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, you mentioned obviously that the first half is going to face some pressures, particularly on the SM and Transportation. I was wondering if you could give us a feel for what the operating profits might be in those two divisions in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're really not providing specifics on the first half, Robert. We've given you revenues for the first quarter for each of the business and then again for total HON, and that's the just the level that we're prepared to go to at this time in terms of the guidance that we're providing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You mentioned on the business jets aftermarket that it was up slightly in Q4. You were expecting flight hours to be down considerably in the first quarter, and probably into the second quarter as well. What do you expect the business jet aftermarket to do in the first half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the -- we talked about that in terms of the &#x2013; specifically in terms of the business jet aftermarket, we expect that to be down considerably, measured in, for us, an indicator. There's no published global flying hour number like there is, as you know, in Air Transport. So we use as a representative number in terms of activity TFE flight hours, where we've got some visibility. And we would expect that to be in the range, for the first half of the year, down 20 to 25% compared to the first half of 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there was nothing particularly unusual in Q4, then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Q4 was the precursor of what we believe will happen in the first half of this year. I mean, if you look at the pattern for 2008, the TFE hours were up, as I said earlier, 1% in the first quarter of '08, down 4 in the second, down 11 in the third, and down 22 in the fourth. So the down 20 to 25% range, this level, seems pretty logical and reasonable to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Robert, there's always timing differences between TFE hours and then service events on the business jet side, but you're never going to have a one-for-one correlation in any quarter. So that's always going distort the comparisons between hours and then aftermarket events in any one quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Dave, with respect to working capital, the fourth quarter shows pretty big growth in receivables and inventories. Sort of two points. What are you doing to &#x2013; and it looks like it's a little bit higher than it was last year. So what are you doing to sort of manage that? And then, are you looking at credit losses, and how are you making sure that you mitigate that problem?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me take the second one first. First of all, let me just give you some overall numbers. 2007 to 2008, we actually improved the inventory turns from 9.0 in '07 to 9.5 in 2008, and overall working capital turns went from 5.5 to 5.9. So the backdrop is a positive story here in terms of what we've been able to achieve. You're right that we did see some growth in inventory at the end of the year, really reflective of the fall-off of some of the OE demand, primarily in Aerospace, and some of the deferrals and delays that we've experienced, and is included in our guidance, in that cash flow guidance that I gave you, that 100% plus cash flow conversion for the full year.</p>
          <p>Really what we're doing in terms of the receivables is aggressively day to day managing and monitoring the collections process and also our past-dues. Frankly, we really haven't seen any meaningful movement in terms of past dues, and we haven't seen anything in terms of significant insolvencies or otherwise that have impacted the quality of our receivables to date. Our businesses are very, very mindful of that, Howard, very, very much on top of it. And as you recall, we actually write off, take to the P&amp;L, anything past 180 days. So if we're beyond that in terms of &#x2013; 180 days past the terms, I should say, in terms of collections &#x2013; we take that. We take the accrual for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At 100%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At 100%. So we're very &#x2013; all of us are very, very, very focused on that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the inventory, we'll see some further inventory pressure in the first quarter and into the first half, mostly related to Aerospace. And that's included, as I said, when I said that the cash would be down year over year in the first quarter. That assumption is included in terms of some of that overhang in terms of Aerospace inventory as they work through some of the deferrals and some of the delays on the OE side, both on the BGA side and on the ATR side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I appreciate &#x2013; I mean, in fact at some point, it could very well be a fairly positive story as we move on. But I don't want to do too much positive. And then for Dave Cote, this is in some ways an unprecedented downturn, and some of it requires just changing the way people behave. And some of it requires just managing factories and facilities a little differently. And since you spend a lot of time doing that, could you sort of talk about what you're doing and asking your operating executives to really address to get most out of the people and the most out of the facilities to deal with, in some cases, 40% plus declines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say the first important point that we try to stress, Howard, is that how you think about your business is no different during a tough time than it is a good time. That focus on expense, really understanding your working capital, focusing on process, recognizing that you're always trying to do two competing things at the same time, none of that really changes. And I think it can be a mistake in business to have people start to think that, oh, times are different, so we don't do new products, we don't focus as much on the customer. And we steadfastly try to avoid that.</p>
          <p>And instead, we continue to reinforce the point that we also make during the good times, which is first, plan your sales conservatively. Even if times are good and you think your sales are going to be up 10%, think about it in terms of 6. If you think your sales in a tougher time are going to be down 5, plan for down 8. Then get your costs in line, your CapEx in line, think about your working capital that way, think about your SIOP planning &#x2013; the sales, inventory and operations planning. Think of it that way and plan accordingly.</p>
          <p>So it's really just a reinforcement of the same points we make during the good times. And the biggest thing is just to make sure that people are conservative enough in their planning for sales. And we steadfastly try to avoid this idea of the hope-cast, the idea that it can't possibly be this bad. The biggest thing we contribute is making sure that people address how bad it could be, and making sure that we plan accordingly.</p>
          <p>So it's not so much a "Hey, times are different, throw everything out the window that you've been working on." It's more of a reinforcement about planning conservatively, really thinking about your costs, how can you win at a time like this, recognizing that we want let others be the guys who cut back on customer service or new products. It's more of a reinforcement of what we're already doing and just making sure that people face the reality of their marketplace.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have time for one more question, Lisa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Shannon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey so, just on UOP, I mean last year, in the first quarter, Specialty had kind of this blow-out upside margin quarter driven by UOP. So the first quarter makes sense. Can you give us a little feel for what you're looking for for the year for UOP and what you're hearing from customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're right, Shannon. Just to kind of remind you, the first quarter last year UOP was up 23%. They were up 27% in the second quarter. And so what we have is obviously a pretty significant headwind; I mentioned that earlier. It's one of the three drivers in terms of the year-over-year comps, in terms of the business drivers year-over-year, that's really contributing.</p>
          <p>What we're seeing actually, we mentioned earlier, two important things. Number one, in the guidance call what we said is for the first half of this year, we actually expected some deferrals and delays in terms of catalyst reloads based upon particularly refining capacity utilization. We expect that that's going to continue to play out. That's one data point and one input.</p>
          <p>The other one is that we actually saw a stronger-than-expected finish to the year for UOP. And when you look at the diversification of UOP &#x2013; and that's a very, very important point to remind us of &#x2013; is UOP has really expanded in terms of their offering and the breadth in terms of the, if you will, the markets or sub-markets that they serve, particularly in the natural gas segment. And also in terms of treatment of heavier crude, which is a much more significant input in terms of the whole petroleum refining chain.</p>
          <p>So right now our expectation is that we're going to see very, very tough comps for UOP for the first half based on this phenomena of the very, very strong first half of '08 and the deferrals &#x2013; delays in terms of the catalyst reloads as a result of just the slowdown, if you will, in terms of the refining universe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then on the ACS margins, you guys have been getting beaten up for a couple years now on these margins, and then had something of a breakout type quarter here, even in a tougher environment. I mean, can you give us just a little more feel of what drove the quarter and were there things that are unusual? Or is this some of the cost actions that you've put in that segment starting to pay off, new products? Give us a little more feel there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's really &#x2013; I think you captured it towards the tail end of the question. I think it's really &#x2013; we saw very, very good productivity contribution out of ACS in the fourth quarter. It's interesting because historically &#x2013; Murray and Dave and I have laughed about this a little bit this week &#x2013; because historically we talk about mix and acquisitions, and we actually had an important acquisition contribution in the fourth quarter, not only to the revenue but actually to margins. I mean, the acquisition integration that I mentioned earlier is actually working and showing up in the numbers.</p>
          <p>The second thing is we talk about mix; we actually had positive, if you will &#x2013; negative mix, you could say, but positive solutions to products revenues in the quarter. But we had very, very nice margin contribution across the full business of ACS, which really points to the things that we've been talking about are actually working. And it's also, in addition to productivity, the point you made about new products, and Dave emphasized that earlier, it's hard to overemphasize it, because what we're really seeing with ACS is as they introduce new products, as they create more value for their customers, as they, if you will, increase the penetration in terms of the share of dollars that they can get in a particular sale &#x2013; the new wireless technology for residential application is a great example of that &#x2013; we're selling a higher value to the consumer. And rather than the consumer paying the installer to bust through the wall, to drive all the wires, do all the connections, they're paying ACS for the technology. So we're getting the greater share, if you will, in terms of that consumer spend for a comparable, if you will, end product.</p>
          <p>That's what happening. It's a phenomena that's happening in ACS, and it's one of the things that gives us confidence, as we look to 2009, despite the fact that our guidance is for revenue reduction in ACS, and as I mentioned for developed market sales decline and more modest emerging market growth, the fact of the matter is we think this is a business that's just going to continue to outperform.</p>

          <p>The times really are unprecedented. This is a very difficult time for all companies out there. You've heard me make a lot of statements to that effect. And it's true. Everybody is going to be affected by it. Some look at it and say, what's going to happen to us, and wonder if they'll see a reprise of what happened last time, and they won't. And you take a look at all the changes that we've made, the fact that we invested during the good times to make sure that we could do the seed planting that would show up during tough times, and then make it even better coming out is going to bode for a much better future for Honeywell. And we look forward to being able to show you during the course of the year how true that is.</p>
          <p>These are tough times, but this is a different company, and that seed planting is going to continue, and it's going to continue to pay. Thank you for listening. And hope you have a good day.</p>
