        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brock. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our 2009 fourth quarter results. With me today are Mr. John Lau, President and Chief Executive Officer; Alister Cowan, Chief Financial Officer; Rob Peabody, Chief Operating Officer, Operations and Refining; and Terrance Kutryk, Vice President of Midstream and Refined Products.</p>
          <p>In today's call, John will discuss the financial results and give an overview of the operational highlights. Terrance Kutryk will provide an update on the Midstream and Downstream divisions and John will then conclude at which time we'll open up the call for questions, starting with analysts, and followed by the media.</p>
          <p>Please note that today's comments contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risk factors and assumptions that are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings, which are available on SEDAR, EDGAR, and on our website.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to John.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick, and good afternoon to everyone. As you know, 2009 was a challenging year for the oil and gas industry. Commodity prices fell from the record highs of 2008 and the global economic meltdown raised many uncertainties for energy supply and demand. Husky took early actions to contain costs and focus on operational efficiencies. As a result, Husky was able to achieve significant reductions in operating costs for the year.</p>
          <p>The company enters 2010 with an enviable position of strong growth projects, a solid balance sheet with huge financial flexibility, and reliable and efficient operations. Results in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflected a stronger commodity price environment with cash flow from operations significantly higher than the amount generated in the fourth quarter of 2008. Earnings were up 39% to 320 million or $0.38 per share from 231 million or $0.27 per share in Q4 of 2008.</p>
          <p>Sales and operating revenues were 3.61 billion compared with 4.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. Cash flow from operations doubled to 657 million or $0.77 per share from 330 million or $0.39 per share in the same quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Husky's production in the fourth quarter averaged 292,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with 2008 fourth quarter production of 358,000 barrels of oil per day.</p>
          <p>Total crude oil and natural gas liquids production was 203,000 barrels of oil per day in the quarter compared to 263,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2008. Liquids production in the fourth quarter was lower mainly due to the shutdown of White Rose and Terra Nova fields, which extended into the start of the fourth quarter for maintenance turnarounds and</p>
          <p>the tie-in of the North Amethyst facilities to the White Rose field.</p>
          <p>Total production levels at the White Rose field will be ramping up when the North Amethyst satellite begins production in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Average natural gas production was 529 million cubic feet per day, down from 571 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gas production was lower because of the planned reduction in capital expenditures on drilling and tie-ins as a result of lower commodity prices, flowline restrictions and reservoir decline.</p>
          <p>For the year, Husky's sales and operating revenues, net of royalties were 15.07 billion compared with 24.7 billion in 2008. Net earnings for the year were 1.42 billion or $1.67 per share compared with 3.75 billion or $4.42 per share in 2008.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations was 2.51 billion or $2.95 per share compared with 5.95 billion or $7 per share in 2008. Cash flow in 2009 was impacted by cash taxes of 1.3 billion, which were based on record earnings in 2008. Current taxes in 2010 are expected to be around 500 million based on earnings generated in 2009.</p>
          <p>The company remains in a strong financial position. Total debt at the end of 2009, net of cash and cash equivalents was 2.84 billion.</p>
          <p>Debt to cash flow and debt to capital employed ratios at December 31st, 2009, were 1.3 times and 18.3% respectively. We are pleased to advise that Husky's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, payable on 1st April, 2010, to shareholders of record on March 1st, 2010.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, Husky progressed on mega projects in line with our medium and long-term growth plan. Front end engineering design facility work for the Sunrise Phase One project was completed. Optimization and re-design of the project has reduced the capital costs of Phase One by over $1 billion to about $2.5 billion for the project. Government and regulatory approvals for the revised design are in place and corporate sanction of the project is expected later in 2010.</p>
          <p>On the East Coast of Canada, Husky completed a major turnaround on the SeaRose FPSO, the floating production, storage and offloading vessel, as well as completed the North Amethyst sub-sea tie-in work. Production from the North Amethyst will begin in the second quarter and ramp up in 2010 as additional wells are brought into operation.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, Husky and its partners in the Mizzen Discovery in the Flemish Pass Basin applied to C-NLOPB, Canada &#x2013; Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board for a significant discovering license.</p>
          <p>In China, front end engineering design work for the Liwan 3-1 Deepwater Project was substantially complete. The overall Development Plan is being finalized with expected submission to partner and regulatory authorities in early 2010. Project sanction is expected this year.</p>
          <p>Block 29/26 continues to show excellent exploration potential. In December, Husky announced another significant discovery with the Liuhua 34-2-1 exploration well located approximately 23 kilometers northeast of the Liwan 3-1 field. Delineation of the new discovery and development engineering work are about to commence to tie-in the field into the planned infrastructure for the Liwan 3-1 field, with first production from both fields in the 2013 timeframe.</p>
          <p>In addition to the Liuhua 34-2 discovery, three appraisal wells were drilled by the West Hercules on the Liwan 3-1 field. The rig is currently drilling another exploration well at Liuhua 29-1-1 and when compete, will move back to Liuhua 34-2 discovery to drill an appraisal well.</p>
          <p>In Western Canada, Husky continued to build its position in a number of gas resource plays and in 2009 acquired an additional 89,000 net acres around established areas in the Alberta Foothills and Northeast British Columbia.</p>
          <p>Terrance will now talk to you about the Midstream and Downstream divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks John. While Husky's heavy oil production benefited from the low light to heavy oil price differential in the quarter, Upgrader earnings in the quarter were impacted realizing a unit margin of $13.67 per barrel compared with $24.60 per barrel during the same period in 2008.</p>
          <p>This decrease was partially offset by lower unit operating costs in the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>The pipeline and other infrastructure segment of our midstream business continued to perform in line with expectations. U.S. Refining And Marketing earnings increased in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of improved product margins offsetting reduced sales volumes.</p>
          <p>The Lima and Toledo refineries continue to be impacted by low crack spreads and falling crude oil prices which resulted in inventory write-downs resulting in net earnings of a negative $43 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The Lima refinery completed a major maintenance turnaround in the quarter with operations resuming on November 30th. At Toledo, Husky and its partner announced the sanction of the Continuous Catalytic Regeneration Reformer Project. The project will improve the competitiveness of the refinery by reducing energy consumption and lowering operating costs.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2009, our Canadian refined products division benefited from a higher ethanol gross margin of $19 million compared with $3 million for the same quarter in 2008.</p>
          <p>The higher gross margin was due to higher sales volumes combined with the receipt of funds earned under government incentive programs.</p>
          <p>Ethanol production in the fourth quarter was 11% higher than in the same period of 2008. In December, Husky signed an agreement to purchase 98 retail outlets in the southern Ontario market, increasing the company's network by 20% to 571 retail outlets. The stations will be rebranded over the second and third quarters of 2010.</p>
          <p>I will now pass the call back to John for his concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Terrance. Husky achieved solid financial performance in 2009. Operating and administrative expenses are well under control and good progress has been made in these strategic projects. I'm very pleased to say Husky position is not looking at cut-back or reduce of our head count.</p>
          <p>Husky has exciting major projects, including the Liwan discovery in the South China Sea, the Sunrise Oil Sands Project in Alberta and White Rose and its satellite developments on the East Coast of Canada.</p>
          <p>The company also has its extensive Western Canada heavy oil, light oil and natural gas portfolio. Husky enters a new decade positioned to create shareholder value with a core asset base to grow in the near, medium and long term. Husky has a bright future and thank you for your continued support.</p>
          <p>Back to you, Patrick.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question today comes from Terry Peters of Canaccord Adams.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have two questions. The first is whether you could make any comments regarding the impact that the new SEC reserve regulations might have had and also related to that, when you expect to file your year-end reserves? And the second I'll give after you answer that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Terry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's Rob Peabody. I think the only &#x2013; I mean, clearly I'm assuming you are referring to sort of going to the average first day of the month versus sort of the final year constant pricing, is that sort of the focus of your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and whether the change in the definition of PUDs beyond five years as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the answer is there has been no substantial impact on our reserves. Clearly, in the previous years, because of the pricing mechanisms that were used sometimes heavy oil was impacted. Under this year's regulation under constant pricing, there is a bit more impact for gas reserves. I think you'll see that across all the companies who report, but our focus frankly still is on &#x2013; is sort of on the real underlying reserve additions using our sort of price forecast going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you expect &#x2013; when do you expect to file your reserves? Last time, you did it with your fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, it's Alister here, due to the changes that the SEC's required, we won't be able to file probably soon until we file our Form 40-F with the U.S. in mid March and the reason for that is any earlier disclosure would be considered early adoption by the SEC and therefore, we are not able to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. And my second question has to do with your dividend policy and if you can get a comment, if I look at just even Consensus Estimates, your current dividend is about 50% payout and I just interested to know whether you're driving your dividend policy off your &#x2013; off an earnings payout or if you even look on a cash basis with your current budget and the current consensus cash flow, you're just about matched between your capital and your dividend requirements and your cash flow. So, what's the driver for the dividend decision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, this is John here. That is a question supposed to be answered by the Board, because it is a dividend policy. I can only speak from the company point of view, give you a bit of highlight. From our dividend structure, we are completely comfortable about &#x2013; if &#x2013; dividend at a movement, the pay level. We are maintaining a top quartile dividend policy, dividend payout is in line with all the peers company, as you appreciate, we rank at the top; on average, we have 4%. Over so many years from the Husky, especially from the operation point of view, we very seldom have drawn money to pay dividend. We always look at our position. Our budgets are very conservative and we look at the total long cash item, so I am looking at the cash flow statement. We are comfortable more than in not to pay the dividend even if the Board decides to maintaining at this level, plus our capital requirement. So, I don't visualize there will be any change &#x2013; any material change during the coming year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question relates to your announcement last year that you had planned the spin-off of your Asian operations and I was wondering if that is still being considered and if so, what the timing is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that strategic planning still is our &#x2013; on our agenda. We're working very closely for this spin-off and look at the strategic benefit for our shareholders. And in view of the China project, we are drilling another exploration well. We expect there will be some result come out and that &#x2013; I hope everything will be good. So, I look at the strategic position, we will consider that subject to test driver, test is the big driver on the rearrangement and also that benefit for creation of shareholder value as a separate company. We will make that decision in this year.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Hello. My question relates to the downstream, following the deal that you did with Suncor late last year, I was wondering whether you were looking at any other potential acquisitions in the downstream, whether it's refineries or retail or anything you are looking at?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before I ask Terrance to answer, I think we will continue to look at opportunities and especially, we are integrated oil and gas company I want to maximize the whole carbon change. This is a wonderful opportunity we have to acquire their 98 petrol stations. So Terrance, you want to address to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Lauren, thank you for the question. I think that John has answered actually quite well. It is a regular process for us to investigate these opportunities and to pursue our integrated strategy when we see appropriate. We'll continue to do that investigation on an ongoing basis.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I guess I am curious about the integration overseas, are there any plans or is there any investigation into the possibility of opening up a refining presence in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on market opportunity and at the moment, quite a lot of proposals, you're talking open in or viewing refining in China or Upgrader in China. So, I can't comment on that until we really decide to make the move. So, just going to China, I think at this time, I say no, but we'll continue to look at opportunity and work with the government if the time comes.</p>
