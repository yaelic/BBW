          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Barclays 2012 Full-Year Results Analyst and Investor Conference Call. I will now hand you over to Chris Lucas, Group Finance Director.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for joining us. As you know, this is an important day for Barclays. We announced the key conclusions for our strategic review this morning and Antony will give a presentation on them this afternoon. The executive committee will be there to answer questions and the event will be webcast. The purpose of this call is to focus purely on the results for 2012. As usual, we're using adjusted numbers to give a better understanding of our underlying performance.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the headlines, we've made good progress across most of our businesses during the year. Adjusted profits increased 26% to &#xA3;7 billion. Total income was up 2% to &#xA3;29 billion despite Gilt gains of &#xA3;1.1 billion from the sale of hedging instruments in 2011. Impairment improved 5% to &#xA3;3.6 billion, mainly as a result of favorable trends in our UK businesses, which resulted in net income growth of 3% to &#xA3;25.4 billion. We've continued to reduce costs which decreased 3% to &#xA3;18.5 billion and our capital liquidity and funding remain strong. Our Core Tier 1 ratio was 10.9% and out total capital ratio was 17.1%.</p>
          <p>Adjustments to statutory numbers include a &#xA3;4.6 billion charge on own credit, a provision for PPI of &#xA3;1.6 billion, an &#xA3;850 million charge for redress on interest rate hedges, and a gain on BlackRock. As a result, statutory profits were &#xA3;246 million. The provisions which include additional charges taken in the fourth quarter which we announced last week, &#xA3;400 million was provided for redress of interest rate hedges. This is based on the FSA's report after a pilot exercise conducted in the fourth quarter. A charge of &#xA3;600 million was made for PPI. This is largely the result of higher than expected response rates from proactively contacting customers ourselves. The PPI balance sheet provision at the end of the year was &#xA3;990 million.</p>
          <p>Return on equity increased from 6.6% to 7.8%. We'll talk more about our plans to improve this later today. Our four largest businesses all increased returns. There were strong performances from UK RBB and Barclaycard, which reported returns of 16% and 22.1% respectively. The investment bank delivered returns of 13.7% and corporate banking continued its turnaround. Returns there were 5.5%, up from 1.7% in 2011.</p>
          <p>Returns by business is shown in an appendix of the slide pack. I've told you we'll be allocating more head office results to the businesses going forward. We'll issue details of this before our first quarter. The business returns we're reporting this morning exclude this allocation so head office is reflected in our group returns.</p>
          <p>The group's cost/income ratio improved from 67% to 64%. Adjusted earnings per share increased to &#xA3;0.345. And we've announced a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of &#xA3;0.035, bringing the total to &#xA3;0.065 for the full year. This is up from &#xA3;0.06 in 2011. We understand the importance of dividends and aim to pursue a progressive policy which Antony will talk about later.</p>
          <p>The decrease in net tangible asset value per share mainly reflects the own credit charge, provisions for PPI and interest rate hedges, and other adverse reserve movements.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the individual businesses, in UK RBB, profits were up 4% to &#xA3;1.5 billion. Total income was down 5% to &#xA3;4.4 billion reflecting the non-recurrence of Gilt gains and a decline in the underlying contribution from structural hedges. Excluding these impacts, income was stable as growth from higher volumes on customer assets and deposits was offset by increased funding cost.</p>
          <p>Impairment charges halved to &#xA3;269 million. This reflects improvements across all portfolios, especially in personal unsecured lending. The loan loss rate also halved to 21 basis points, 90-days arrears on unsecured personal loans improved by 33 basis points to 1.34%. Excluding PPI, costs reduced 1% to &#xA3;2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>At Barclaycard, profits were up 25% to &#xA3;1.5 billion. Income grew 2% to &#xA3;4.2 billion. Impairments improved 22% and the loan loss rate was 282 basis points compared to 391 in 2011. 30-day arrear rates improved in both the U.S. and the UK, excluding PPI and goodwill impairments in 2011 costs grew 3%.</p>
          <p>In Africa Retail and Business Banking income decreased 12% to &#xA3;3.2 billion. This is a result of adverse exchange rates and non-recurring Gilt gains. Impairment grew 39% as a result of provisions taken in the second and third quarter on mortgages in the Absa recovery book.</p>
          <p>We believe impairment in this book has now stabilized and early arrears are improving across almost all portfolios including mortgages. Costs decreased 10% reflecting currency movements. Profits were down 44% to &#xA3;468 million.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter we announced plans to combine the majority of our Barclays African operations with Absa. The terms of the transaction are supported by the independent fairness opinion and will be voted on by Absa shareholders later this month.</p>
          <p>Europe Retail and Business Banking made a loss of &#xA3;239 million, income fell 25%, reflecting the economic environment. Impairment increased 26% or &#xA3;67 million mainly as a result of deterioration in mortgages. We reduced costs by 31% as savings flowed through from the restructuring in 2011. We also reduced the local funding gap in Europe. Customer assets reduced slightly in euros while deposits increased, notably in Spain.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the Investment Bank, profits grew 37% to &#xA3;4.1 billion. Total income grew 13% to &#xA3;11.7 billion. Within this, fixed income, currencies and commodities increased 17% to &#xA3;7.4 billion. Equities and prime services grew 14% to &#xA3;2 billion and investment banking was up 5% at &#xA3;2.1 billion. This income growth reflects share gains in many product areas and was achieved despite the 5% reduction in RWAs to &#xA3;178 billion, and a 33% reduction in daily value at risk to &#xA3;38 million. Impairment increased from &#xA3;93 million to &#xA3;460 million. This increase includes a charge relating to legacy CDO assets. There's also a one-off release of &#xA3;223 million in 2011.</p>
          <p>We reduced the bonus pool and other incentive awards granted in 2012 by 20% while income grew 13% and profits were up 37%. The full impact of this reduction will feed into results in future years due to the IFRS treatment of deferred bonuses.</p>
          <p>Our reported costs in 2012 fell 1% to &#xA3;7.2 billion. Performance costs were down 3% to &#xA3;1.7 billion despite an increase of &#xA3;210 million in charges relating to deferrals from prior years. Non-performance costs were broadly in line with 2011 after absorbing &#xA3;193 million of the LIBOR settlement. Excluding LIBOR, non-performance costs fell 4%.</p>
          <p>The costs to net operating income ratio improved from 71% to 64% and the compensation-to-income ratio reduced from 47% to 39%. We continue to reduce our legacy assets. Credit market exposures decreased by almost &#xA3;6 billion to &#xA3;9.3 billion and we exited these positions at or above our marks.</p>
          <p>We believe that annual trends give a better understanding of performance, but we also report quarterly numbers as we know you'll be interested in them. You can see the quarterly income progression in 2012 has a similar shape to 2011 but at a higher level. Comparing the fourth quarter last year with the third quarter, total income was down only 2% at &#xA3;2.6 billion despite tougher market conditions.</p>
          <p>As we've said before, our flow business model is designed to protect us from downside market risks. As a result, we may outperform in weak markets and underperform in strong markets. You see the fourth quarter as further evidence of this.</p>
          <p>Moving down to look at the current quarterly progression by business line, fixed income, currencies and commodities were down just 8% in the fourth quarter. Equities and prime services were down 9% as we grew share despite low market volumes. Investment banking was up 29%.</p>
          <p>In Corporate Banking, profits more than doubled to &#xA3;551 million. Within this, the UK was up 22% to &#xA3;910 million, losses in Europe reduced to &#xA3;381 million and other regions reported a small profit compared to a small loss in 2011. Income was down 6% to &#xA3;2.9 billion. Impairments improved 24% to &#xA3;872 million. There was a 30% reduction in Spain to &#xA3;337 million resulting from lower exposure to the property and construction sector. We reduced costs 14% to &#xA3;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>In Wealth and Investment Management, profits grew 52% to &#xA3;315 million as our investment in the business gained traction. Income grew 4% to &#xA3;1.8 billion driven by high net worth business and related increases in both customer loans and deposits. Costs were down 2% despite continued investment. Current assets under management increased 13% to &#xA3;186 billion mainly as a result of net new assets in the high net worth business.</p>
          <p>Losses in head office were &#xA3;1.1 billion compared to &#xA3;1 billion in 2011. There was an improvement in the income line of &#xA3;148 million. This was mainly due to a one-off gain on hedges relating to employee share awards which we closed out in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>This was more than offset by an increase in the bank's levy and other operating expenses amounting to &#x2013; sorry, to &#xA3;243 million. Operating expenses include &#xA3;97 million on the LIBOR settlement and financial service compensation scheme charges which increased by &#xA3;90 million.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to capital, liquidity and funding, our Core Tier 1 ratio at the end of 2012 was 10.9% on a Basel 2.5 basis. Our total capital ratio was 17.1% and RWA was slightly down at &#xA3;387 billion.</p>
          <p>Our liquidity position remains strong with a pool of &#xA3;150 billion. This compares with a wholesale funding maturing this year of &#xA3;101 billion. At the end of December, we had liquidity coverage ratio of 126% based on the latest Basel trends. We are already compliant with net stable funding ratio proposals.</p>
          <p>We had &#xA3;27 billion of term debt maturing in 2012 reaching &#xA3;28 billion in term funding, which enabled significant pre-funding of our term maturities this year which are &#xA3;18 billion.</p>
          <p>The issuance included &#xA3;3 billion of tier 2 contingent capital notes, which are fully allowable as primary loss-absorbing capacity. We also raised &#xA3;6 billion through the Bank of England's lending &#x2013; sorry, funding and lending scheme.</p>
          <p>Our retail banking, corporate banking, and wealth businesses are largely funded by customer deposits, so loan-to-deposit ratio for these businesses improved from 111% to 102%.</p>
          <p>Let's talk to you more about the impact of Basel 3 based on implementation in January. As you know, the implementation didn't take place. To allow comparison with our previous disclosure we've shown the ratio reported at the year-end alongside pro forma ratios as if we had applied Basel 3. We've also included the impact of IFRS changes that apply from January.</p>
          <p>Our latest Basel 3 estimates show a pro forma transitional common equity tier 1 ratio of 10.6% as of January 1. We also show the fully-loaded ratio which is 8.2%, a slight increase on the position disclosed at the end of September. Detailed calculations are in the appendix of our slide pack. We continue to believe that we're well-capitalized and we'll discuss our capital structure and targets this afternoon.</p>
          <p>Turning now to margins, as I've mentioned before, we look at margins in two parts: customer margins, which drive the vast majority of our own net interest income, and then the secondary margin derived from structural hedges.</p>
          <p>I'll start by talking about hedging. Across the group as a whole, the total contribution from structural hedges fell from &#xA3;3.3 billion to &#xA3;1.7 billion as expected. This was mainly due to the 2011 Gilt gains which we realized as we shortened the duration of hedges. The reduction in underlying contribution from these hedges is expected to be less pronounced this year.</p>
          <p>The businesses which contribute to our net interest margin analysis are Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth. Overall, margins from these businesses fell 18 basis points to 1.85%. 14 basis points of this decline or &#xA3;800 million was from the reduced hedge contribution. This shows the relative stability of our customer margins.</p>
          <p>Increased volumes, mainly on the liabilities side, broadly offset slight customer margin contraction so that net interest income generated from customers was stable at &#xA3;9.8 billion. Overall, net interest income from these businesses decreased 7% to &#xA3;11.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning now to costs, we reduced overall costs by 3% to &#xA3;18.5 billion. Performance costs for the group were down 4% to &#xA3;2.4 billion, while income grew 2% and profits were up 26%. We reduced non-performance costs for the group by 3% to &#xA3;16.1 billion. This includes the LIBOR settlement of &#xA3;290 million and bank levy of &#xA3;345 million. Without these items, the level of non-performance costs would have been &#xA3;15.5 billion which is in line with our cost savings target. Bonuses and incentive awards granted in 2012 across the group were reduced by 16%. This reflects action taken to reposition our compensation in the marketplace and various conduct issues.</p>
          <p>That's all I have to say on the 2012 results. Looking at current trading, it's been a good start to the year across the group in January. So in summary, we're reporting good results for 2012. Adjusted profits grew 26% to &#xA3;7 billion. Income was up 2% despite Gilt gains of &#xA3;1.1 billion in 2011. Impairments improved 5% and we reduced costs by 3%. Our capital liquidity and funding remained strong with a Core Tier 1 ratio of 10.9%.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much. We look forward to speaking to you again later today and I'm happy to take questions on the results now. Thank you.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Today's first question comes from the line of Chris Manners from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Good morning everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I just had a question which was on your Barclaycard impairment charges. I could see the &#x2013; it's actually been rising for a couple of quarters. And maybe you might be able to just give us an update on what you think of the trajectory there and whether that's something that we should be concerned about. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask Robert Le Blanc who is with me to add to the comment. But my overall view is the performance of Barclaycard in the credit area has been extremely strong and there's nothing that I see that makes me worry about it as we look forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's right. Good morning, Chris. We've seen improvements in card impairments over the last couple of years principally in our U.S. and UK portfolios as the economies have improved as well and the card portfolios, of course, are all over the world including Europe and South Africa. So, although they do move around the trend has been positive and I'd say we expect it to remain fairly steady from this point, so no, nothing there particularly concerning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Robert. Would it be possible maybe just to ask you to expound on how you see the credit outlook across the group in that case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You certainly can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, certainly. Just &#x2013; I'll make just a brief comment on that, if I may. I mean, you'll recognize that we've seen a very significant reduction in impairment over the last three years. But if you look closely, the general trends in the second half of 2012 were broadly steady compared to the first half. And so, the strength of the improvement we've seen has started to steady out, I think, as we had expected and guided you on.</p>
          <p>I think the trend issue will be steady across most portfolios in wholesale and retail. There is some room for a little bit further improvement, but my outlook for this year is a broadly steady one with potentially some slight improvement and we think that will come through in the impairment numbers for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And today's next question comes from the line of J.P. Crutchley from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, chaps. Can you hear me okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, J.P. Yes, we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's a broader question, I guess, in terms of context for numbers. At the last Financial Policy Committee, clearly, the FSA was sent away to have discussions with the banks on three broad topics: forbearance; making sure legacy costs have been properly put into numbers; and risk-weightings. Clearly, you've taken charges on legacy items and that's pretty apparent. You've talked about in the UK retail results about risk assets going up because of a more comprehensive approach to forbearance. I wonder if you can discuss around that.</p>
          <p>And on the third point, on risk-weightings, I wonder if you can maybe just elucidate how that discussion has progressed and can we conclude from this and given that in the strategic statement you talk about increasing dividend policy, but as far as you are concerned, those debates with the FSA on capital and the like are closed and therefore the debate around &#x2013; for Barclays in particular, though, is likely to be a subject of needing more capital with this debate that's going on between the FSA and FPC is done and dusted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start and ask Robert to touch on forbearance and then we'll pick RWAs. I think, J.P., in general terms, we share, as you can imagine, pretty much everything with the FSA on an ongoing basis. So they have been with us and briefed on the strategic review that we're talking about later on today, and also those areas of forbearance, RWAs, CVAs and the impairment on certain areas.</p>
          <p>Whilst I don't think we'd ever say that they have to make our decisions for us, that's very much our job, we have a constructive dialog with them and over time, understand their position, they understand our position. And you can be sure that we've briefed them as to these results. We've briefed them as to the forward-looking views that we'll be talking about later on, and I think it's a very constructive dialog. How that plays out as we go into the future, only time will tell, but I'm very pleased with where we are at the moment.</p>
          <p>Robert?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I would only add that when we look at forbearance from a capital point of view, firstly we have been carefully measuring and monitoring the levels of forbearance themselves, which is disclosed in the results this year, and really, what's changed from an RWA point of view is simply the recognition of forbearance as an impairment event or as a default, and that's been changing and being adjusted through our RWA model so it's had an effect during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I look more generally at RWAs, probably the best place to be is on slide 33 which shows the bridge from &#xA3;391 billion RWAs at the end of December 2011 and &#xA3;387 billion at December 2012. And you can see in there there's some quite sizeable individual items of methodology change of &#xA3;20 billion, operational risk uplift of &#xA3;18 billion, offset predominantly by business reductions, which are real business reductions including legacy assets of about &#xA3;28 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's some big moving parts but it shows that, like most of these things, lots of big moving parts sort of net down to almost no significant change year-on-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on risk weights, has that all sort of been methodology changes or is that something which hasn't changed materially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a mixture of methodology changes. It's a mixture of business reduction where the returns are insufficient. And to give you a flavor, if you look at methodology changes in the &#xA3;20 billion on slide 33, it's made up of an increased market risk charge, changes to sovereign loss-giving defaults and slotting of mortgages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And today's next question comes from the line of Michael Helsby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Yes, good morning, everyone. I've just got a question on the investment bank's costs. Comp ratio was 39% and your bonus pool was down 15%. One of the ways I look at it is to look at the bonus as a percentage of net revenue and that was 11.5% versus 15.7% last year. And your deferral rates changed slightly. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color around how you see both the deferral rate evolving in the next couple of years in the light of your plan, and also whether an 11.5% sort of bonus as a percent of net revenue, if that's now consistent with this sort of the mid-35 comp ratio that you'll be looking for, i.e. can we take 2012 as a reasonable base forward because that makes quite a difference? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess there's a couple of elements to your question. First, I've been on record several times as talking about our comp income ratio I see normalizing in the mid-30s over time. And you have to recall, as I know you know, that what you're looking at is the actual in-year charge that gets hung up with the actual bonus pool in year but over time, I would expect those things to kind of come into line with each other.</p>
          <p>Now, that would mean that I would also see the deferral rate decreasing over time. We've had some extraordinary circumstances and for very good reasons had higher than I would say are normal deferrals in the last couple of years. But I would see those decreasing in time. They decreased this year actually.</p>
          <p>And as I say, I think over time best-in-class investment banks and banks for that matter will have comp to income ratios in the mid-30s and we're on a journey to get there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when we look at all the different measures of comp to income, yours, Michael, is a new one that we haven't used before. We'll certainly sort that out and if there's anything that we want to add to what we've said, we'll do so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have a question on slide 35 please, on the pro forma CRD IV capital and RWAs. Two questions related to that, I guess, if I split it up, first on the numerator. If I look at your tangible book value per share, you just reported &#xA3;0.0373, but adjusting for IAS 19, the &#xA3;2.5 billion shareholders' equity hit, and IFRS 10, the &#xA3;0.5 billion shareholders' equity hit, I guess that's pro forma &#xA3;0.035. But I just wanted to check that both of those aspects are already captured in your fully loaded Core Tier 1 guidance on slide 35?</p>
          <p>And then the second half of the question, on your RWA number, back at the nine-month 2012 stage you were guiding to &#xA3;485 billion of Basel 3 RWAs by the year-end. You're now guiding to &#xA3;468 billion and the two big moving parts in that look to be the CVA which has dropped from 46 to 29 and securitization which has dropped from 39 to 25. So just intrigued what the big driver of those two changes has been. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer to your first question about whether the accounting changes have been included, the answer is yes, they have.</p>
          <p>In terms of RWAs and I think if I heard you right, you're talking about the &#xA3;468 billion. So there's a number of things in there: there is securitizations as far as the impacts of IFRS 10 goes and the net capital change flows through there as well.</p>
          <p>The other area of reduction is CVA. And I think one of the things which is becoming clear to us is the volatility of the CVA number arising from changes in spreads. So, you were very correct in what you were asking. And I think the 268 is a more accurate current view of where the numbers are going to turn out.</p>

          <p>Can I just have one question on UK retail's performance? It seems to be quite good loan growth pickup there in the second half of the year and looking at the Bank of England data, Barclays seems to outperforming the other banks in terms of the FLS [Funding for Lending Scheme] loans extended. Can you comment on how the performance was in Q4 on both absolute balances and margins and how you expect that to trend forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're absolutely right that we think we're taking market share in the FLS. In terms of trends, we've seen an upward trend, and it's particularly noticeable in an upward increase in deposits.</p>
          <p>And I think there's not much more to say. We've got a good performance. There's a couple of individual items within there that have a bit of an impact on the fourth quarter. But overall, good volume growth, continued gains, and asset growth. So I don't know whether that fully answers your question, but we're pleased with the performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Chris, I guess my question was more towards the underlying pace or momentum within the business heading into next year and especially as deposit costs come down, are you seeing a pickup in margins? And perhaps I can follow-up later in the day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think we can cover that in more detail later today, but I would say the underlying performance is good. We think there's growth there. We see particular area for growth in volumes of customer deposits which will offset a sort of flat margin that we expect to see. So net-net, flat margin, increased volumes, improved net interest income, and good performance overall.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, everyone. My one question, I'll go back to slide 35 please, the pro forma impact. I noticed that you've shifted the PVA adjustment out of the transitional into the fully-phased numbers as of day one, I wonder what's driven that and it obviously doesn't impact those on a fully-phased basis, but do you think it will impact your ability to issue further contingent notes which tend to be based on transitional measures and this obviously is quite a negative for that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is. This is one of the outcomes of the dialogue we would have had with the FSA where it was thought to make more sense and certainly more prudent to put this in the fully-loaded rather than transitional over a period of time. So you can debate the matter either way, but we think doing what we've done sets out the ratio at the most prudent basis of calculation rather than anything else.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just coming back to the UK retail performance and in particular, mortgages. As we heard in the previous question, your balance sheet growth has been strong. I think your mortgage growth across the full year was about &#xA3;7 billion H2 weighted.</p>
          <p>In terms of your current pricing, clearly you're being more aggressive than some of your peers. In 2012, arguably you had it easy while Lloyds and Santander UK were giving away share as fast as they could. Is it your intention going forward to maintain your more aggressive pricing to broadly sustain the pace of balance sheet growth even in a slightly more competitive market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'd have to look at that on a case by case basis. The important thing from my perspective is that we look at the return being made on the products and we look at the return on equity that we make in the business and any decision we make would make about to be aggressive or not aggressive in terms of pricing would be very dependent upon being able to pass and exceed the return on equity targets that we've set for the business and you will hear more about this afternoon.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just got a few questions, please. Your liquidity coverage ratios, you published 126%. Presumably that's on the new Basel 3 basis. I was wondering if you could give some indication on how you'd like to run that. Would that be closer towards the 100% and therefore, you'd be able to reduce your liquidity pool there?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I answer that one, Andrew, rather than queue them up? Let's try and answer them one by one. But...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, no problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...the answer to that is, it is based on the latest view of the LCR rules and we would expect that 126 to come down, but if it gets down as low as 100, I don't know. We would have to look at that over time, but it would certainly trend it down and that, of course, would have the benefit of reducing the cost of the liquidity pool which is the important thing that we've been aiming to do.</p>
          <p>So, I hope that answers your first question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, that's fine. Thank you. On page 35, referring back to the capital disclosure, you're the only UK bank to have this PVA adjustment, &#xA3;1.2 billion for yourselves. I'm just wondering with what kind of certainty can you say that that's actually applicable going forward? I mean, how much can we take that as a concrete adjustment to be made there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. And then thirdly, could you clarify what your outstanding existing Tier 1 and Tier 2 hybrids are? How much these are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bear with us, could we look at that answer and we'll come back to you with a response? This is regarded as about &#xA3;9 billion.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a range of things in there. I think the best thing to do is to wait until we've restated with the allocation of head office expenses and income and look at it on a go-forward basis. What I would say is that if you look at the overall head office number, it's been creeping up but when you look at it year-on-year, it has a relatively small impact on the overall group with the exception of the group return on equity. And of course, our objective will be to allocate that out more fully and I think that will be a good time to catch up on the individual component parts of it.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Apologies, I had a technical issue, so I might have missed some comments. My first question is on just what do you see as a picture in mortgages in the UK? If I look at SVRs of bank, they are north of 4%. Whereas if you look at two-year mortgages, you can get them now at 3.1%. So, are you seeing switching behavior from your customers to move from SVR to new lower-priced fixed deals? And how do you think about headwinds from this re-pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Sorry, headwinds from?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From this re-pricing of moving from a 4%-plus SVR to a 3% new fixed rate deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think maybe you missed the comment, but our view on mortgage pricing is that we will be competitive, and in particular, we want to look at the returns that we make on a product-by-product basis and look at whether it meets our return on equity requirements. The direction of travel that we're seeing is very low SVR volumes, mostly fixed and tracker, and increased numbers of buy to let, increased volumes, so really, across the board increase in volumes and good performance as a result of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. The second question was on some of the targets that you've given. If I think about the &#xA3;16.8 billion cost target, add to that the &#xA3;700 million restructuring, with the mid-50s cost/income ratio, that seems to imply a 10% revenue growth for a 9% cost reduction. I'm just trying to tie the two together. What you're saying here is you'll grow revenues and yet cut costs by about 10% each.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I suggest we get ready to answer that question after the strategy session we're doing this morning and afternoon? Because one of the things we tackle is exactly how you get that cost performance line as you've been trying to derive. So it'd be easier done once we've released the slide packs and information later on today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Gary at Shore Capital. I just wanted to come back to the issue of bonuses because I didn't quite understand, given the sort of current hype around bonuses and banks' attitudes towards bonuses, why you've increased the current year cash bonus and again, why are you talking about reducing the amount of deferral? I'm a bit surprised. I would have thought the route to be going down would be the opposite of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Gary. It's Rich. It's a good question. I think what I'm referring to is we've had extraordinary events. We clearly have a conservative deferral profile, but because of some of the events we've had, we've increased deferrals. What you want to do is try and get the balance right between making sure the interests are aligned, but that you're not overloading your deferral rate in any one year. That's irrational for the shareholder, because you want to make sure. Because you have the constant roll in of deferrals, so if that rate is too high in any one year, if you're working to a cost to income &#x2013; comp to income ratio, it could really limit your flexibility one way or the other.</p>
          <p>So, it's about getting the balance right. And I think we just had a couple of extraordinary years where we've been particularly conservative in our deferral rate which might not be in the interest long term to the shareholder in terms of what we can pay the franchise versus pay them.</p>

          <p>It's both. But the cash payments, we're not talking about a significant increase, the way we've skewed our deferrals this year, it's mostly toward the top of the house. So, we're trying to get the cash that is released into the hands of the more junior people in the organization.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. A question really I suspect for Rich I think and it's really looking at the fixed income trading numbers. I mean, if I look at the big banks who've reported to date, we see quarter-on-quarter the average decline as being 24%. You managed just 8% and also I think for the first time in a long time you actually earned more than Deutsche Bank in fixed income trading. That's quite a remarkable performance.</p>
          <p>Could you perhaps comment a little bit on the skew of that, how perhaps was due to the U.S. business and your strength there and how much perhaps just to your taking market share and where you took that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Sure. We like your comparisons, Chris, and so I'll ask Rich to...</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Chris. Let me talk about first what we did gain, we certainly saw market share gain in credit and rates. We saw some reduction in securitized products. There was a reduction in FX. Certainly the U.S. was strong. Lower market volatility has more broadly reduced the quarter, but we've said previously that we've been very consistent in our income. We don't run a lot of inventory. We have been taking market share. You've seen some players drop out of this space. But certainly in the quarter-to-quarter comparisons, it was really down to improved performance in credits and rates mainly driven by the U.S.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, good morning. Just a quick question on the provisions that you've now taken on PPI and interest rate hedging redress. I just wondered if you can give a bit more on interest rate hedging as to what sort of share that would represent. And what I'm really looking for is just a degree of comfort now around the level of those two sets of provisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's difficult because they are moving targets but we take them individually. It's on page 91 of our results announcement. But if I look at the interest rate hedging redress, you know that we've had the guidance from the FSA, so we've got a pretty clear route map as to what we need to do in terms of the number of the customers we deem not to have complied with relevant regulatory requirements, the nature of redress offered, and the look of the reasonably foreseeable consequential loss.</p>
          <p>So all of those are estimates we've had to make to include in the provision that we've made. It's our best view and I should say that out of the &#xA3;850 million we've spent, something like &#xA3;36 million, so it's a very big provision against a very small cash payments at the moment. And we think, though, based on the best available information that the &#xA3;850 million is a good number.</p>
          <p>If I look at PPI, it's a different product range. It's a much greater number of individual claims and therefore, it's a more volatile set of statistics and particularly if you look at trends of claims that are coming in. So, I feel pretty comfortable about the interest rate hedging. It's less easy to be comfortable on the PPI. But in both instances, we've taken our best view of the situation that prevails and provided accordingly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Sorry; just one more question. I was wondering how do you think about the Tarullo proposals from the Fed about the subsidiarization of the U.S. operations into an intermediate holding company? And have you sort of thought about how much capital and liquidity could be trapped there, what the potential costs could be, and what the impact to the business would be if you try to mitigate that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>...the requirements are still being completely developed. And Antony will talk more about it this afternoon. But we're looking at different options in intermediate holding companies, what the funding costs will be and what we need to do to be able to comply with it. Let us get through this afternoon and then we'll come and have a conversation with you. But a lot of work is being done in the area.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Thanks for that. Just I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on your comments on January. It feels like fixed income equities and primary are all off to quite a very good start, certainly relative to January of last year. So, I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color to be helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will certainly be helpful. I think as I've said, it's been a good month. But one month is a relatively short timeframe to carry over the whole year. But across the board, different products have been doing well, different businesses have been doing well. So, I think it's a good base to go into the rest of the year and the strategic review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on bad debt, I think you mentioned that you have this sort of bottoming out process. But I think clearly, Africa you mentioned still inflated, Spain, Western Europe still inflated. Could you just sort of drill down into those two areas and maybe talk a little bit about the outlook, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask Robert to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I think those are areas where there is still &#x2013; particularly in Western Europe, still risks driven by the economies there. And we've seen increasing rates of impairment. Remember our businesses in Western Europe are &#x2013; our largest books are on the mortgage side. So, that went up last year. Potentially it could go up higher this year. So the rate is higher, although the absolute numbers are relatively small for the overall impairment performance.</p>
          <p>Africa had some impairment in mortgages in South Africa last year, which was an LGD or a legal recovery increase and we don't think that continues this year but I think the Western Europe portfolios will remain under pressure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, helpful. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the last question we have time for today comes from the line of Jason Napier from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two if I could be cheeky, please. The first for Robert I think. Thank you for the new disclosures on forbearance on the wholesale side. I just wondered, could you confirm that there isn't really much contention around the definition of forbearance? Considering this is one of the things that the FPC wants the FSA to look at, the numbers don't look particularly large and the provision coverage looks pretty high. So, I just wonder is there an issue around definition of forbearance? That's the first question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is always a question of &#x2013; there has always been a question of interpretation of forbearance on the wholesale side. I wouldn't &#x2013; you may not be choosing your words too carefully but call it &#x2013; I wouldn't call it an issue. But I think there are interpretations and refinements we've made. We've done them also together with the regulator in terms of what we think the RWA effects will be. But we think it's a fairly wholesome picture and we'll continue to update on that as we release these on a regular basis.</p>
          <p>So, there are interpretations you have to make on the wholesale side. I wouldn't call them issues so much as interpretation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, your broad definitions are in line with the way the regulator looks at these sorts of things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. And then a question for Rich, please, the gain in market share at Barclays in the IB is obvious. So, I just wondered to what extent you look at the loss of traction at the likes of and CS and UBS and other banks that have perhaps been at cost cutting for longer? And I wonder whether the sort of targets that have been set for the overall group, how much of that is sort of already done or how much you fear some retrenchment of the gains that you've made as you embark on this? I mean, how far along the road, I guess I'm asking, are you at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Jason, what I would answer that is that over the last few years, we haven't been standing still and we really started reductions in force across the business as far back as 2009. So, I think ours has been more of a steady focus on costs. I think that the cost reductions that we are deploying now is certainly more targeted, and I think towards areas where we need to right-size for opportunity.</p>
          <p>You're right about some of our competitors exiting in a larger way. I think for the scale players, which was four or five of us, will continue to pick up passive market share and that's good news. I think there's more to come as others continue to retrench. But I think as far as we're concerned, I don't see any retracement, if that's your question, of our gains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, most of the savings, do they relate to areas that you'd like to de-emphasize rather than just reducing or sort of re-sourcing across the board?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I wouldn't say de-emphasize. Certainly, I think that when we built out our equities and investment banking businesses around the world, the estimates for what fee pool might be were quite large at the time. I think as those fee pool estimates have reduced, we've reduce our size and scope. That doesn't mean we're going to be global or disinterested in the business. But certainly, I think we want to right-size for the size of the opportunity. So, that's where the cuts have been made. Well, you will hear more about that this afternoon.</p>
