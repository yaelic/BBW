        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>As you've seen from our press release this morning, a tough quarter on the top-line, but exceptional execution across the business. No surprises here, just the type of execution you've come to expect from the UTC team.</p>
          <p>Our focus on cost continues to pay off. Segment operating margin reached a record high of 14.9%. That's adjusted for restructuring and a one-time gain. With aggressive restructuring and cost reduction actions leading to 50 basis points of margin expansion.</p>
          <p>We also saw excellent progress in driving down working capital this quarter. As a result, free cash flow was 140% of net income even with $400 million of contributions to our domestic pension plans.</p>
          <p>As far as the order rates, no significant changes in the year-over-year order rates in the quarter. However, order rates do appear to be stabilizing. Strong execution and relentless cost reduction give us confidence even in the face of difficult markets that we will resume earnings growth next year while delivering on our commitments this year.</p>
          <p>The evidence of the cost reduction is in the segment operating margins. All were double-digit and four of six, Otis, Fire &amp; Security, Sikorsky, and Pratt &amp; Whitney, saw operating margin gains of 100 basis points or more, again adjusted for restructuring and a one-time gain. Otis led the way at 21.9%. That's 210 basis points higher than prior year.</p>
          <p>Carrier delivered double-digit margins this quarter as a result of a relentless focus on cost take out despite very difficult end markets. This margin performance was achieved even while UTC's revenues decreased $2.7 billion or 17% to $13.2 billion. Revenues decreased 11% organically and 5% from foreign currency translation. Net divestitures accounted for the remaining one point of the revenue decline. Again, no surprises as we knew the compares would be the toughest this quarter against a very strong second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.05, that's 20% lower than last year and in line with the first half expectations we've been communicating throughout the quarter. Current quarter results include $0.22 of restructuring costs and $0.06 non-taxable gain related to acquiring a controlling interest in an Otis joint venture. Last year's second quarter you'll recall had a $0.06 charge for restructuring costs.</p>
          <p>Absent the impact of these restructuring costs in both quarters and the one-time gain this year, earnings per share was down 12%. Approximately two-thirds of this decline or about $0.11 was from foreign currency translation combined with the negative impact of Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada's currency hedging program.</p>
          <p>On revenues, only Sikorsky saw growth. Revenues at the other five businesses were down with particular weakness in our short-cycle segments. Carrier revenues declined 29% in the quarter, 21% organically.</p>
          <p>While we would all like to say that the economy is improving, we've really seen a simply stabilization in order rates across the businesses. Consumer confidence does show some indication of improvement, but the U.S. housing starts outlook is more or less the same as we saw in March and the outlook for commercial construction and aerospace traffic are somewhat worse.</p>
          <p>China on the other hand has started to show the positive impact of the government's stimulus program. As we said before, we've always expected China to recover first, and we did see early signs of that in this quarter. New equipment orders in China at both Otis and Carrier, commercial HVAC were down about 18% year-over-year in the second quarter on a constant currency basis compared with the decline of almost 40% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide three. As a result of the continued weakness in order rates, we're revising our full-year revenue guidance from 55 billion to 53 billion. That's down 11% from our last, or from last year rather.</p>
          <p>We still expect to spend about $750 million on restructuring this year, and we now estimate one-time gains to be only around $200 million. So restructuring in excess of gains looks to be around 550 million at the high end of our prior range of 400 to 550 million.</p>
          <p>With the lower revenue outlook and the higher net restructuring, we're tightening our EPS guidance range with the top end at $4.20 compared with 4.50 previously. Better than expected traction on cost reduction actions, higher savings from restructuring, and a weaker U.S. dollar give us confidence in the bottom end of the range <mark type="inaudible" /> in spite those significantly lower revenues. We're now assuming the euro at 138 for the rest of 2009 versus our assumption of 127 going into the year.</p>
          <p>On restructuring, we spent about 300 million this quarter, that's 464 million year-to-date to address volume declines and to eliminate structural and overhead costs across all of the businesses. Both 2009 programs are now expected to yield a run rate savings of $700 million, $300 million in 2009, an incremental $300 million next year, and then another $100 million in 2011. All this will make the company more cost competitive when the economy does recover.</p>
          <p>In addition to restructuring savings, we're also seeing the benefits of other cost reduction actions in areas such as travel, furloughs, E&amp;D, and employee attrition. As an example, our overall head count has now gone down by more than 12,000 since December and that excludes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. About 70% of that 12,000 decrease results from the 2008 and 2009 restructuring programs.</p>
          <p>As I noted before, free cash flow in the quarter was 140% of net income attributable to common shareowners at 1.4 billion. That included 400 million of domestic pension contributions. The solid cash flow resulted from strong working capital performance across the business particularly in collections. While we've made some progress reducing inventory, there's still a lot of work to do there particularly at the aerospace businesses.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date free cash flow is now at 99% of net income. And for the full-year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be equal or excess of net income. I'll come back and talk a little bit more about the outlook for the rest of 2009 in just a minute. But let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the business unit in detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Greg. Turning to page four, let me remind you that I'll talk to the segment results adjusted for restructuring and non-recurring items as we usually do. Otis delivered another strong quarter as Greg said with margin expansion of 210 basis points to 21.9% despite the downturn in global construction. Operating profits in the quarter were down 6% on a 15% decline in revenue.</p>
          <p>At constant currency, operating profits grew 5% on 6% lower revenues as aggressive cost reductions and continued strength in the contractual maintenance business helped mitigate the impact of lower new equipment volume. Since the beginning of the year, Otis has reduced head count by over 2,600 employees or 4% of its work force.</p>
          <p>New equipment revenue was down 9% excluding currency with mid teen declines in Europe and North America. Revenues in Asia were flattish with China up mid-single digit. At constant currency, new equipment orders were down 38% from last year's record level, which included a large order for the World Trade Center. Year-over-year orders in China were down high teens compared with down around 40% in Q1.</p>
          <p>Given that first half order rates, Otis now expects full-year revenues to be down near double-digits compared with 2008. However, in light of Otis's strong operating margin performance, good traction on cost reduction actions, continued strength in the maintenance business and improved foreign currency translation, we now expect profit for the year to decline by $50 million, a $100 million improvement from the midpoint of our previous guidance range.</p>
          <p>On slide five turning to Carrier, operating margin exceeded 10% in the quarter, down 210 basis points on 29% lower revenues. Carrier continues on the path of aggressive transformation to a simpler more focused higher returns business.</p>
          <p>Cost reduction and restructuring actions contributed more than 250 basis points of margin in the quarter and helped mitigate the impact of the steep volume decline. Since June of 2008, Carrier's head count had been reduced by 5,200 or 13% of the workforce before the impact of net divestitures.</p>
          <p>Carrier's organic revenue declined 21% in the quarter. As in Q1, Carrier's most significant volume decline occurred in the higher margin transport refrigeration business with sales down about 40% at constant currency driven by container and Europe truck trailer. The commercial HVAC business was down mid teens organically, and we saw new equipment orders there decline about 20% again at constant currency. U.S. residential was down 16% about in line with the market.</p>
          <p>Carrier's prior guidance assume an improvement in business conditions in the second half of 2009. In light of continued weakness in order rates, Carrier now expects organic revenues in the third quarter to be down in line with first half and expects profit growth to resume in the fourth quarter on the back of easier compares and continued cost reductions.</p>
          <p>For the full-year, Carrier expects revenues down in the mid 20s and earnings down in the range of 500 to $550 million with second half earnings down approximately 100 to 150 million versus prior guidance of flat second half earnings.</p>
          <p>On slide six, UTC Fire &amp; Security delivered a solid quarter with operating margin expansion of 180 basis points to 10.6% on 23% lower revenues. Organically, revenues contracted 8% with both fire safety and electronic security revenues down high-single digits in the quarter. Unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced revenue 12% and net M&amp;A activity accounted for three points of the year-over-year revenue decline.</p>
          <p>Operating profit decreased 8%. Excluding FX, profits grew 9%, reflecting the benefits of integration of field operations, restructuring and continuing productivity and cost control initiatives. We remain confident in UTC Fire &amp; Security's 2009 guidance of flat profits on revenues down mid teens.</p>
          <p>Turning to the aerospace businesses on slide seven, revenues at Pratt &amp; Whitney declined at 13% in the quarter driven primarily by lower overall aftermarket volume and Pratt Canada engine shipments. Revenues were also adversely impacted by net hedging activities at Pratt Canada. Large commercial engine spare revenues were down in the mid 20s, and book-to-bill was slightly below 1. Engine shipments at Pratt Canada were down about 25%.</p>
          <p>Operating profit declined 7% in the quarter. The impact from lower revenues, adverse mix and unfavorable foreign currency impact at Pratt Canada was partially offset by benefits from restructuring, productivity improvements, and fewer large commercial engine shipments. E&amp;D was also favorable in the quarter. Operating margin at 16.8% was up 100 basis points.</p>
          <p>Turning to the full-year, we now expect large commercial spares revenues to be down around 20%. At Pratt Canada, we expect engine shipments to be down in the high teens. Our prior expectation for both was down double-digits. Pratt's large engine MRO activities are also lower than expected, as airlines conserve cash in face of lower traffic and yields.</p>
          <p>Overall, Pratt &amp; Whitney 2009 revenues will likely be down mid to high single digits. Operating profit is now expected to be down $100 million year-over-year as compared with the prior guidance of down 0 to 50 million. Pratt continues to aggressively reduce operating costs, and rationalize capacity in manufacturing operations, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul networks.</p>
          <p>On Slide 8, in the quarter, Hamilton Sundstrand's revenues were down 15%. Organic revenues were down 9%, with aerospace aftermarket down double-digits, the industrial business down 25%, and aero OEM flat. Operating profit declined 20% primarily from lower volume in higher margin businesses. Commercial spares revenues were down over 20% again. Lower E&amp;D, discretionary cost curtailment across the business, favorable mix in aero OEM, and productivity improvements in the repair shops partially offset the volume impact.</p>
          <p>Orders for the industrial business continued to reflect the impact of the global economic slowdown, and were down about 35% in the quarter including three points from foreign exchange. Commercial spares book-to-bill was above one including a few large long lead-time orders. Depressed order rates in high margin businesses continued to put pressure on Hamilton Sundstrand's 2009 outlook. We now expect commercial aftermarket to be down in low teens for the year, and the industrial business to be down in the mid 20s.</p>
          <p>In total, we now expect Hamilton's revenues to be down mid to high single digits, operating profit to be down 75 to $100 million, as compared to the prior guidance of flat. Hamilton continues to reduce operating costs through workforce resizing, furloughs, merit deferrals, and other actions in response to the challenging market conditions.</p>
          <p>Turning to Sikorsky on Slide 9, operating profit grew 26% on 6% higher revenues. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 50 large helicopters, 40 based on military platforms and 10 commercial. Sikorsky continues to target delivery of between 230 to 240 large aircraft in 2009.</p>
          <p>Operating margin expanded 160 basis points in the quarter to 10.1%. This improvement was primarily due to better aircraft mix and lower manufacturing costs. Sikorsky continues to expand its footprint of international suppliers. During the second quarter, it completed an agreement to manufacture S-92 helicopter cabins with the Tata Group in India. Sikorsky is also making progress with the international Black Hawk in its facility in Mielec, Poland.</p>
          <p>While we see continued weakness in the commercial market, we expect Sikorsky to continue its strong performance for the remainder of the year with revenues still projected to grow in the high teens, and operating profit expected to increase approximately $125 million.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Greg for a wrap-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'm looking at Slide 10 now on the webcast. A very strong quarter in terms of execution and very strong cash performance, and very, very strong cost traction in the face of difficult end markets. Continued focus on what we can control resulted in over $350 million of discrete cost reductions, including the restructuring savings in the quarter. And, this limited the impact of the $2.7 billion revenue decline. Just a reminder, this 350 million of savings follows 200 million of cost reductions in the first quarter. So, even more traction from aggressive cost actions in the second quarter than what we saw in the first.</p>
          <p>Wrapping up, our full year 2009 revenue expectation is now 53 billion. That's down 11% from last year, and this $2 billion decrease from our prior guidance reflects the expectation of an incremental $2.5 billion decline in organic revenue, and about 500 million from recently announced divestitures, partially offset by the weaker U.S. dollar. The negative margin related to this volume decline is expected to be partially offset by incremental benefits of early cost reduction and restructuring actions as well as more favorable net commodities. And the weaker U.S. dollar also helps.</p>
          <p>Our full year 2009 EPS guidance as I've said before is a range of 4 to $4.20, down 14 to 18% from 2008, excluding the impact of acquisition-related costs. Excluding restructuring expense and one-time gains, we see earnings per share down 7 to 11% compared with 2008, and a revenue decline of 11%. A big slice of that revenue reduction coming in our high margin aerospace spares and our transport refrigeration businesses, making the lower EPS drop-through even more impressive.</p>
          <p>As for other guidance for 2009, our expectation for free cash flow for the year remains unchanged, at equal to or in excess of net income. Capital expenditures in the quarter were down 43%, or 37% year-to-date. And, as a result, we now expect the capital expenditures to be down about 30% for the full year. Our 2009 M&amp;A placeholder remains at $2 billion, although our acquisition spend year-to-date is only 153 million net of divestitures.</p>
          <p>As always, deals happen when they happen. And we'll continue to be aggressive in identifying and pursuing acquisition opportunities, but we also will remain disciplined in our approach. On share repurchase, our share repurchase guidance remains at $1 billion. Second quarter share repurchase was 150 million. Year-to-date, $350 million.</p>
          <p>Okay. Slide 11 now, a couple of thoughts on 2010. I've been getting a lot of questions about whether we expect earnings to grow next year.  While there are many moving pieces at this point, I would simply remind you that the strength of UTC is in its market leading franchises, the geographic customer and product diversity, along with strong aftermarket businesses. This portfolio of businesses and the aggressive cost reduction action we're taking this year will position the company to resume earnings growth next year.</p>
          <p>To be clear, we do not anticipate a significant economic recovery in 2010. And as we begin building our detailed 2010 financial plan, the business units are developing cost-led plans without much reliance on top line recovery. We will see some tail wind next year from restructuring actions taken this year, another $300 million.</p>
          <p>And while there may be some weakness in our long cycle businesses next year, such as commercial aero OEM, Otis new equipment, and commercial HVAC, our short cycle businesses such as the commercial aero aftermarket, residential HVAC, and transport refrigeration should be among the first to recover when the economy does improve.</p>
          <p>Our continued focus on process improvement is driving cost reductions we've seen across the businesses. Currently, 54% of our businesses are operating at the gold and silver level, well on our way to meet the goal that Louis laid out of 70% by the end of this year. Also, our ace initiative with suppliers is gaining traction, with 44% of key suppliers spend now with gold or performing suppliers, well on track to Louis' target of 70% by 2011.</p>
          <p>With our relentless focus on cost, seasoned management team, significant aftermarket content, and continued investment in innovative new products, we believe we're well positioned to outperform again in 2010.</p>
          <p>With that Erin, let me stop here, and open up the call for questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hello?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got Carrier in the question mark column, yet you called out growth in 4Q EBIT, which implies that you're pretty confident it's first half growth at least in 2010. So, I'm just wondering why that would be in that column rather than the plus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you have Carrier &#x2013; there's a lot of pieces to Carrier. I think the long cycle part of Carrier which is the HVAC, commercial HVAC, piece is a bit of a question mark for next year. We actually would expect that to be down slightly. I think the real question on Carrier though goes to the nature of the economic recovery, and when we're going to see a rebound in housing, and when we're going to see a rebound in demand for the transport refrigeration products. Again, those are very economically sensitive businesses. They have been first as the most -- the quickest and the most I would say. And so, until we see some real signs of an economic recovery, I think Carrier remains in that question mark column for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And then on the &#x2013; I mean, the revenues obviously you kept on going $53 billion that's not too much of a surprise, but do you think that at this point, do you think revenues are becoming a bit more predictable for fiscal '09? I mean &#x2013; so is the rate of change in your projections for month to month starting to moderate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has, Nigel. In fact, if you think about it, the order rates have stabilized, as we said. Really, since March, we've seen the order rates fairly stable albeit at these low rates. So, as we look at the back half of the year, and we are sitting here in July, we're fairly confident in this 53 billion. Now could be it be a little better or little worse? Yeah, depending upon FX. But, I think for the most part, we've got pretty good visibility, and I would say realistic revenue guidance here based upon what we see today in the markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and then one more from me, a quick one. What's the buffer right now protecting the low end of the range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Nigel, one more time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the buffer, the contingency at the bottom of the range right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the $4 level, we have about a $150 million of contingency left. You'll recall back in March, at the time we talked about a $350 million contingency. That's obviously been eaten up a little bit by the revenue reduction as well as the lower gains on restructuring, but was offset by some good news on cost traction, as well as FX. 150 million, it feels like about the right number as we sit here in July, again with half of the year behind us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that 150 still there at the end of, beginning of December, do you then use that for additional restructuring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a great question for Louis to ask -- to answer in December, but I would say probably as we sit here today, if the business remains strong, and cost traction improves, I would say there's probably more restructuring in the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, yeah, on the restructuring, you're well above of half on your 750 so far, how do you think this plays out next couple of quarters and I mean, how much more than 750 could you come in at if the dollar weakens say or something else happens in your favor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We were little bit above this year, this quarter I think we'd talked about 250. We actually launched a little over 300 million, so I think 467 year-to-date. We feel good about the restructuring list that we've got. It is a robust list. It is well north of the 750 million that we have targeted. I think the issue that we've got as it looks it towards the back half of the year is execution. And all of the businesses you'll see with the exception of Sikorsky have taken on significant restructuring activity. So, there's a lot of things going on out there. There is pressure to probably spend more. I think we'll even see a little bit of restructuring follow into 2010, and we'll just have to again play it by ear. But the number will only go up from where it is today, and certainly you can expect to see some additional next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Joe, with regard to your calendarization question, I think we're right now putting about 200 million for third quarter and the balance in Q4 to go up to the 750.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In China, that's where you're seeing your best results in the company, and of course that's where the GDP looks by far the best. How sustainable though do your people there particularly in Otis think that this recovery is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we've seen in the last quarter, Joe, is really a recovery at the low-end of the market. In terms of order rates, our XOEC business orders I think are actually up about 15% or so. And that low end is where the government stimulus program is helping the most. This is on the residential construction market. I would tell you I think that looks to be sustainable, the 7.9 or 8% GDP growth is all very good. We've also seen foreign direct investment start to come back to last year's levels, still down year-over-year. But again as foreign direct investment picks up, and I think the compounding effect of the stimulus picks up, we've got a lot of confidence. We're going to see a good back half for Otis in China as well as Carrier and even a strong 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just two more quick number questions. What's your commercial HVAC backlog down year-to-date first of all? And then secondly, could you just discuss your Hamilton E&amp;D spending, and where you're running versus where you thought you would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hamilton, E&amp;D was a little bit of a reduction in second quarter, Joe, on a year-over-year basis. Overall as you know, we had E&amp;D down about 50 million this quarter and Hamilton was roughly 40% of that in terms of year-over-year decline. We do expect continued decline in the second half there primarily as the 787 spend comes down although you can imagine with the delay in the first flight there is some pressure on that.</p>
          <p>With regard to commercial HVAC I think the orders have been worse than these revenues that we have generated, so backlog is down. The orders have been down roughly 20% plus for the first half while the revenues have been down organically in the low teens, so you can do the math. It's down slightly not huge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks.</p>

          <p>David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, Could you maybe touch on the outlook for Otis new equipment shipments, as you think about 2010? I think you had previously guided, originally we started thinking about flat, then I think you talked about down five to 10. Just given the order rates you're seeing now, how do you think about Otis new equipment in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think for this year we expect Otis new equipment to be down kind of in that 10ish percent range. It was down 9% in the quarter, and certainly with orders down around 40% on the new equipment side that nine or 10% down will play out next year. So I think again another 5% down next year is probably in the realm of reasonable. I think part of the question here is how quickly China recovers. You have to remember, China accounts for a third of the new equipment business at Otis, so even though we've got these big order rates coming down, China is recovering as well as there were a lot of deferrals at the end of this year that will probably play out next year. So, as we're thinking about it, I think there's obviously pressure on new equipment next year, but I wouldn't think -- I would say 5%, but it's a little early. And we'll come back obviously at the end of year with some better visibility there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the revenue side overall for this year, I mean order rates are relatively stable sequentially, yet you're looking at I guess in the second half of the year that the revenues are going to actually increase I think 10 or so percent sequentially second half versus first half of the year in total. What specifically other than a little bit of a benefit on the FX side, what else is going to be driving that? I guess what gets better on the revenue side in the back half of the year versus the first half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>FX clearly is a big driver as you pointed out, David. The other factor is that there were -- sequentially we do have some improvement in the second half particularly in our commercial construction-related industries every year because more projects get completed in Q4 as people are running to complete their budgets, if you will. So there is some seasonality which we see every year in our business in the second half versus first half sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, I would point out that the benefit from easier compares. If you recall, Pratt spares were down mid-teens in third quarter. Similarly, Carrier organic revenue was down 7% in fourth quarter. So we're coming off some easier compares, better FX and just a normal seasonality with the businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last one, Greg, what was the net pricing benefit, if you had one on the quarter, how much was it in total?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There was a small net pricing benefit. It was about $40 million for the quarter across the business.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to get into the restructuring a little bit more. Greg, you mentioned furloughing and other actions kind of driving the 350 in Q2 versus the 200 in Q1. Just wondering if you can kind of separate what's going on in terms of structural cost reductions relative to things that will eventually kind of swing back the other way when we do get a volume turn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about it, the $350 million of savings we've talked about in the quarter, about a little less than 150 million of that came from actual restructuring, which I would consider to be structural type of cost take out. We've also of course had a lot of just cost control, cost containment. We have seen for instance travel, it's down more than $50 million in the quarter. We have seen the benefits of furlough across all of our businesses, and furlough's simply people taking days off with out pay. I think every one of our businesses have done that.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing the benefit of net attrition. In fact, attrition is more than 3,000 people in the quarter, and we're just, or year-to-date rather, and we're just not backfilling those jobs. We've also deferred merit increases out of the year. So if you think about it, some of that will obviously come back. I would say two-thirds of our savings is probably -- two-thirds of savings rather is structural, and one-third is probably timing that'll come back.</p>
          <p>You also have to point out I think the employees have been remarkably good about all of the cost take out. There's been a lot of sacrifice across all the businesses from the furloughs. Flying coach to Singapore is no fun thing to do, but all of that is part of what we've been doing here to contain costs. So again, it's good traction, and of that 350, we'll get a little bit of that back because we will have merit increases. We won't have furloughs forever. But I would say roughly two-thirds probably structurally out of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if I think about the 700 that you rolled up 300 this year, 300 next and 100 left in '11, those are all structural cost take outs, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. Those are run rate savings that'll repeat year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then kind of changing gears a little bit, I wonder if you could just give us a little more granularity on Carrier as it relates to kind of the price and cost dynamics in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, we still saw some pricing benefits in Carrier this year although we would say that you'll recall that in third quarter last year, U.S. residential Carrier raised prices by up to 6% for its latest products, and we are continuing to see some benefits of that. The Carrier team will tell you though that there is increasing pressure, and you would see probably, particularly on U.S. residential side, and on the commercial HVAC side, increasing price pressure in the back half. However, on the opposite side, you would see increasing benefits on the commodities. As you know, they have a rolling blocking practice with the copper consumption that they have, so the back half benefits on the commodity side will be greater than they have seen in the first half. So net-net I think first and second half are balanced. The dynamics are just different, pricing more in first half, less in second, commodities, gross commodities less in first and more in second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just finally, Greg, when do you pull the lever a little harder on share repurchase if the deals don't start to materialize?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guys, that's clearly a second half action for us. You can see we're really pretty light to the $1 billion guidance here, and quite frankly we've been conserving cash in the first half of the year as cash was very, very light as you remember back in first quarter. So I would expect that you would see share repurchase run rate ramp up here in the third and the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually just one more quick one if I could. Given the growing importance of Chinese new equipment as it relates to Otis and any update on kind of service attachment rates there, are you making any better progress on the market side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, service has been growing at a slightly faster rate than new equipment, but this is a long-term opportunity for us. It's not something which will happen in a quarter or in a year even, but we think the install base that we are creating in China will help Otis over the long-term over many, many years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, if we compare your commentary back in March about M&amp;A, there was an expectation that UTC might be a bit more aggressive going after deals, and since then the tone has gone back to a little bit more of the placeholder comments staying disciplined. Just can you give us a sense of what the pipeline looks like? Were there deals closer that you thought you might get at the beginning of the year, and how do you expect that to play out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that we've been any less disciplined or more disciplined. I think it's just typical UTC acquisition reviews, and we were hopeful I think earlier back in March when we saw equity prices so low that there would be opportunities for us to do some deals that quite frankly would be very accretive to the business. But, it's just taking time and quite frankly it may take some more time. I think people's expectations of price have not really come down to what the level of their stock price is, and so we're just going to wait this out. I think again we don't expect the economy to recover anytime soon. We expect as these 52 week highs go into the rearview mirror, people will become more receptive I would say to some of the discussions. It is a very full pipeline. I think we've got a lot of good targets out there, but it just takes time. So, I wouldn't say we have toned down the aggressive nature of the pursuit. It's just simply a realization as we get here in July. It's going to be probably tough to get a lot of things done yet this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. And if I could just go back to Otis for a moment, the 8% decline in backlog, how do you measure that in months versus where we were in the beginning of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Given the decline being of about 9 to 10% in new equipment revenues, I would say the 8% decline at the backlog is still about 12 months worth of revenues expected based on the 8, 10% decline that we have talked about on new equipment. There's still about 12 months worth of backlog.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then any commentary regarding quote activity, and then obviously it doesn't look like you've seen a lot in the way of push outs or deferrals, but any comments there would be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's clearly -- in China there is clearly a lot more interest, lot more dialog with the customers, project developers, et cetera. I would say geographically Europe has been pretty consistent at a low level and same in the case of U.S., which had very, very tough compares in the second quarter, but the activity level is pretty stable at low levels there. But China and Asia is showing some increasing signs of discussions with customers.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Your R&amp;D, are you still looking for it down 100 million for the year given that it was down as much, it was kind of as low as it was in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Cai, we were down 50 million or so and 53 million year-to-date. You'll remember first quarter was essentially flat, but we still expect down $100 million or so for the year. So, probably third and fourth won't be as dramatic as what you saw here in Q2, but we're also going to see a ramp up on spending in the back half of the year on the C-Series as well as the MRJ. So, that will be good news. We'll see a little bit of a ramp down on 787 which will offset some of that. So, I think the other piece is probably Columbus with that being deferred by Cessna is also going to take some of the back half pressure down. So, the 100 million still seems about right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you would still see a sequential build as we go through the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And do you have any recovery from Textron for the cancellation of Columbus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do not believe that we have. I believe that the program has been deferred as opposed to canceled. And as a result we're actually continuing to work on the core of that engine because the core to the Columbus is the same core as we're using on the MRJ. So, it's not as much of a savings as you might otherwise think from the deferral of that platform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you talked to Jeff's question about one-third of the savings were kind of timing related things like merit deferrals. Do those &#x2013; so that's basically what, that's like 110, 120 million something like that, should we expect that timing impact to continue at that level in the third and the fourth quarters, and you mentioned it's probably going to come back at some point. How should we think about it coming back next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, clearly Cai I think the pressure on cost is not going to let up this year, and I would even tell you into next year as we don't see a recovery in the markets, there's going to be this continuing focus on cost. It's really nothing new to UTC. We've been doing this stuff for a long time. We've done $3 billion of restructuring over the last 10 years. The furloughs and the merit deferrals, those are a little bit tougher. But I think you may well see some furlough activity next year if the aerospace markets don't recover. Merits, obviously, that'll come back a little bit next year for headwind. But, I would actually &#x2013; I wouldn't think all of that's going to come back next year. You may see a piece of it, obviously, but not the whole 30% or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last one I mean, you had this huge cash flow in the quarter, and yet you didn't buy very much stock. Was that just timing that the cash flow came in the back part of the quarter and you were blocked out because of reporting the earnings early on when the price was so low, or how come you were so cautious on share buyback?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would tell you we entered the quarter after the kind of the disappointing first quarter cash flow performance, so we were a little bit weary of ramping up share repurchase right away until we saw what the markets were going to do. Obviously as the quarter progressed, we started to taking up share repurchase as the prices hovering there in the &#x2013; kind of low 50s, high 40s. Also a big piece of the cash flow in this quarter came from collection activity. That's something that really was back half of the quarter loaded, so back half cash wasn't very strong. And we also took the opportunity to fund the pension plan by that 400 million. And we had planned to do 400 million for the year, but only going to do a couple of hundred million in the quarter. We saw the strong cash coming in. The best thing to get behind us is that pension contribution. That earns us 8.5%, and share repurchase we will be aggressive in the back half of the year. When the price remaining is the mid 50s range, it is still a very, very good deal for us. So, I would expect to see that much more aggressive back half.</p>

          <p>On the overall restructuring gains, when you went to the lower end of the range, the 200 to 350 million down to 200, what led to that? Is this just taking longer? Is the opportunity less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we actually -- we had seen a, had visibility to I'll say a sizable back half gain that looks like it's just going to get pushed out into 2010. And so we, again because we had given the forecast of 2 to 350 as we were going to close out the quarter here, it really became apparent we weren't going to get this last transaction done this year. So it's just a timing issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, what's pushing that back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the completion of the deal, and I really can't be more specific, Doug...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Other to say that it's a deal that we look to close sometime here in the back half of the year, but probably won't see the gain until sometime next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And then, on pricing you described the pricing benefit, and then I would assume at Carrier you're getting some benefit from efficiency incentives related to residential. If you look at the &#x2013; if you look overall at Carrier and I would say also Fire &amp; Security and Otis, what are you seeing as the pricing trends in the market, and how are you responding to those trends today in terms of your aggressiveness on pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing has become very difficult I would tell you at Otis in the new equipment. It's always difficult in China. I would say there has been no let up there. We have also though seeing pricing pressure in North America and in Europe, and again as the volumes have come down, the competition has of course ratcheted up the price pressure. So we are seeing pressure there. Really no different at Carrier on the commercial side. Again, we're still seeing price pressure there. As far as the efficiency from the stimulus program, we're actually seeing a big increase in our SEER 15 plus product, more than 30% increase year-over-year in volume there. So that's actually been a plus for us because obviously the higher tier SEER product, better margins for us. So, not as much price pressure there. Still a lot of price pressure at the low end as you can imagine with the amount of excess capacity in the residential HVAC business here in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one last thing on Hamilton Sundstrand. This is the unit that other than Sikorsky you'd talked about the least amount of restructuring effort, but it looked like there was a fair amount in Q2. What are you &#x2013; what specifically are you going after in Hamilton Sundstrand in the restructuring area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's really two areas. One is on the industrial side. They have been very aggressive in terms of taking out capacity on the industrial side and taking out people as well as Alain Bellemare has been just taking out overhead cost. I think they're reducing overhead &#x2013; their G&amp;A type positions by 17 or 18% up there. So, we talking about structural takeout, that's exactly what they're doing up there. And I think they've spent over 50 million year-to-date up there on restructuring, and I would expect more in the back half of the year as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And next, we'll hear from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I want to go just first to restructuring for a moment. When we look at the natural class statement, Greg, when we look at SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales, it's 11.9% in the second quarter versus 11.1 in the year-ago numbers. Now, I know a chunk of it is the restructuring items in there. Can you give us a sense of what you'd like to target for SG&amp;A going forward so that we can actually get a tangible sense of the improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you see in the quarter, if you back out restructuring for both this year and last, you'll actually see that SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales is down to about 11.1 from 11.2 year-over-year. And I think that's what you're going to continue to see is that trend of holding SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales down slightly quarter-over-quarter. Now, if you think about taking out 17% of your revenues and holding SG&amp;A flat to slightly down, that means we're taking out a huge amount of SG&amp;A. And, I think that trend is going to continue here in the back half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, the goal really is that when volume comes back, it'll just drop to the bottom line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the idea.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then to talk about inventories, this is always the promise, and never quite the result. It always seems to be one area or another that's not. Could you talk through maybe some of the business units where -- I mean you talked about aerospace still being a challenge. What is it in particular? We've seen this destocking at the back end of the channel fairly substantially. Why can't you get ahead of the curve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in fact the businesses, especially Carrier and Otis, have gotten ahead of the curve. I look at Carrier performance year-over-year, their inventory is down over $600 million. Obviously, the market's down, but, even sequentially, Carrier was down almost $200 million. Otis took inventory down, F&amp;S took inventory down both sequentially and year-over-year. The real challenge for us remains on the long lead aerospace side. And I think that's the continuing frustration of inventory here. And, Pratt has been working very hard on it. But, they still saw inventory go up sequentially just a little bit. And Sikorsky saw more than $200 million of growth on inventory. So, really good work by Ari and his team on the commercial side, in terms of getting inventory down. And Jeff down at Sikorsky's faced with a different problem, and that is a good problem, having a lot more volume. So, his inventory continues to go up. But I'll tell you his turns are nothing special. And he's &#x2013; they're aware of that, and they're continuing to work on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, just a follow-up on Carrier. The fact that you were down sequentially 200 million with the usual seasonal build means that the turns were up fairly sharply then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then last, could you just talk about transportation a little bit? I mean, I remember at the analyst meeting, the surprise by Geraud, at how bad the numbers were. And could you talk about the environment, and what you've done to either improve it because I know those funds sustainably low levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the numbers that Geraud talked about back in March where he talked about truck trailer and container being down 70-80%. Obviously, those that have recovered from that level. I think Transicold for the quarter was down just about 40% or so, a little less, about 35/40% in terms of orders. And we still see container being very, very weak. Truck trailer in North America has gotten a little bit better, and even in Europe, truck trailer we're starting to see some signs of some activity in that market. You've got to remember the underlying demand for the refrigerated transport as best we can tell is only down two or 3% around the world. So, the fact that we have seen this remarkable reduction in order rates, in my mind, it is a temporary thing. Because if demand is there, eventually, we will see orders come back.</p>
          <p>Part of it is of course the credit markets. We've been talking about this for the last few months is the unavailability of credit is really what's hurting that business. Shipping business of course is in trouble. There's lots of excess capacity out there. Everybody is constrained by capital. But, until the credit markets really free up, and our customers have access to credit again, I think, we're going to see a pretty tough market there. Again, that will come back. Underlying demand has not evaporated for refrigerated transport. That is foods and medicines being moved around the world. So, we like the business long-term. It's just a very tough year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one last thing, is if you were to kind of look at all your businesses, are there any managers that are coming to you and saying, I'd like to either add some hours on direct labor, or hire some people in direct labor. I know I'm being optimistic. But, I'm sorry...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The one area, I'm sorry &#x2013; this is the one area you might see it first, or in service at Otis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think service at Otis continues on the maintenance side to be a strong business. But, I would tell you, even at Otis, we are taking head count out as we continue to drive productivity in that business. It is not the time to be adding direct labor or any kind of overhead right now into the business end. Obviously, the idea here is to get productivity as the markets improve, and not bring back all the people that are being let go now. So, I would tell you around the business, we are not adding much anywhere.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Greg, Akhil, and Maria. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about Europe. You've talked about China coming back. What's happening in the developed economies, Europe and say Northern Asia, for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Europe has been very slow. We look at both at Otis and at Carrier, and we're not seeing many signs of life in any of the European markets. I think Spain has been particularly bad. Italy not much better. Ireland of course has been down because of the housing bubble there. Eastern Europe still looks to be promising. Although Russia with the commodity meltdown we've seen over the last 12 months, we've seen a fairly large contraction there in order activity. So, I think our own view is Europe is probably behind the U.S. in terms of the timing of the recovery. And we would expect to see it here first. So, I just don't have much good things to say about Europe. I guess the Tour de France is going on so we can say that. But, other than that, not much good activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, on Northern Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Korea actually has come back a little bit. I think Otis actually saw some good traction there in Korea in the quarter. Japan not so much. In fact, Japan was down significantly. But, as far as China, we already talked about China, but those are really the two other big markets for us in Northern Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, just switching to aerospace, Boeing and Airbus, perhaps surprisingly to many, continue to stick to their no cuts, or if any, modest cuts. Are you thinking along the same lines? I mean, have you revised your OE outlook upward other than 787 shipments? Or are you still thinking that Airbus and Boeing probably will have to make some cuts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're continuing to work with both Boeing and Airbus on the long-lead production items. I think we all realize that with air traffic down seven or 8% this year, there's probably a lot of excess capacity. At some point, we believe that volumes will have to come down. At the same time, you still look at the backlog, I think there's almost 7,000 aircraft in backlog between the two. So, long-term demand remains strong. But, we would not be surprised, in fact, if we saw a cut in production next year or at the latest 2011. But, right now, we're working very closely with them. I know they're both concerned about suppliers making cuts in production. So, they can't be supported. So, we're making sure we've got the long-lead items in place. But, I think from a financial planning standpoint, we're pretty cautious about the near term outlook I would say for production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the small engines, Greg, we've &#x2013; there's a lot that's been announced. Are you thinking that we've kind of seen it, and we get down to these new lower, much lower run rates, and then we hang out there? Or is the small engine business a place where there is another round of output? I'm not talking any one guy, but just sort of collectively across the board here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think which &#x2013; what we would fully expect is another down year next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you would get that if you just see &#x2013; the back half of the year is just down from the front half and from Q4 last year, and I'm, what I'm asking is now that you're down there, does it sort of hang out at those rates, or does it take another notch down from sort of the Q4 levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what you're going to see is a continued reduction in the run rate of engine production at Pratt Canada. I mean what's driving the biz jet market is the same thing that's driving our transport refrigeration business, and that is customers can't get credit. On top of that, the corporate profitability is a great precursor in terms of when biz jet production will increase. And we wouldn't expect to see that probably until 2011 or maybe even 2012. You've also got of course a lot of used planes on the market. So, it's a &#x2013; it is a tough market. I would not be surprised to see run rates come down again even into next year as the OEMs build out their backlog this year, and try and pull airplanes into this year for delivery to fill slots that they're building. So, it's a pretty tough market, and I would not expect it to be any better next year, and probably a little worse.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. I was wondering if we could focus on Otis a bit in terms of the EPS guidance revision there. A nice upside to the prior expectation, obviously, the top line coming in lower than previously expected. And I know one of the moving parts would be ForEx. But, can you walk us through that 75 to 125 million improved outlook at Otis on the EBIT side? How much of that is ForEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Myles, if you look at it, if their revenue decline would result in some margin impact as well. And that has been pretty much more or less offset by the strong execution on the cost side and the restructuring and other actions that they are doing on the field performance. So, big strong cost reduction benefits offset pretty much entirely the negative impact from volumes. And then the improvement is pretty much all FX, if you look at it. So, benefits of cost reduction and fee performance offsetting volume decline, FX improvement flowing through to the improved guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay, that's perfect. And then, so, Greg though put it, to put in context your prior comment about OE Otis being down maybe 5% next year in a constant FOREX environment even under that scenario could you see Otis up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, absolutely. I think again just because OE production is down, doesn't mean we're going to stop driving cost out of the business, and you've also got to remember 55% of that business comes from the service side, which traditionally continues to grow. We've had a 1.6 million elevators under service contract around the world and that population continues to grow at two to 4% every single year. So between productivity improvements, cost reduction in our factories and the service side of the business, we would certainly expect Otis to grow earnings next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, could you give us a little bit of color on the portfolio shaping you're doing at Carrier? Both from a standpoint of how much of these businesses that you're shedding or spinning into JVs where sources of restructuring in the past, restructuring spend in the past that won't be there on an ongoing basis. And also kind of the size of the further portfolio shaping to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've taken about a $1.1 billion of revenue out of Carrier on a run rate basis so far. That includes the transaction we did earlier this year with GL Byer to get rid of our European commercial parts refrigeration distribution business. That includes the part that we joint ventured with Watsco, and also the exiting of the commercial refrigeration business here in the U.S. In terms of restructuring, we've done some restructuring as part of the exit of those activities. It has not been a source I would say in the past of huge restructuring spend though, so I wouldn't expect that to be any kind of year-over-year change in restructuring.</p>
          <p>What we said all along is there's probably another billion dollars of additional revenues to take out, and Geraud and Ari have been working on that. They've talked about that plan I think at length. It takes time to execute, but I would think over the next 12, 18, 24 months you'd see that continuation of the more focused Carrier start to emerge. And again it's not magic; it's just a lot of hard work and focus.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, you've been I guess very cautious about the economy in terms of talking about stabilization. What would you have to see to become more positive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a great question, Ron, because I think we all are looking for the positives in the economy. Clearly, consumer confidence and the leading economic indicators are pointing upward. Unfortunately what's happening is consumer spending or savings I should say continues to soak up some of that good news out there in the economy. I think when we start seeing credit return to more normal levels and where our customers aren't saying, look we'd love to place an order, but we can't have access to credit. That'll be the real sign for us, and we'll see it in some of our short cycle businesses.</p>
          <p>We will see it at Transicold because again underlying demand is there. I think we'll see it obviously in the housing market as well, when -- mortgage rates are at record lows here and we're still only talking about 550 or 560,000 new housing starts this year. So, again we hear some good news. There are some things out there that might give us confidence that things will get better. But quite frankly as we look at the order rates today, and we look at the underlying inavailability or unavailability of credit I think we're still very cautious about any type of return to growth next year.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I think we -- the test last fall at Airbus I think we've gotten all the data back, and I think the test program exceeded everybody's expectations in terms of the fuel burn and even in terms of the noise levels of the engine. I think everybody was very excited about those results. Right now we don't have an engine on test for the CSeries. We won't have an engine on test for either the CSeries or MRJ until next year. But we are continuing with the development program.</p>
          <p>We've got about 20,000 cycles of testing now done on the gear set, which is of course the heart of the Geared Turbofan. And as we've taken that apart after those tests, it all looks excellent in terms of the predictability of the wear on the unit. So, making progress. Spending's going to ramp up back half of the year. It'll increase again next year as we get first engine to test. But I tell you right now, we're all on track, and there's been no show stoppers in terms of technology development.</p>

          <p>Yes. Our final question will come from Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Greg, I actually want to get your thoughts on sort of a bigger picture item on Pratt. Can you talk a little bit about what you see as the long-term margin potential structurally there? I mean as we look at the puts and takes, I'm just wondering about the feasibility of the high-teens margins at Pratt. I know it's been something you guys have long had a goal on, and there's always something that interrupts it, and every year you take restructuring charges and I know R&amp;D is coming down.</p>
          <p>But as we think over the next several years with the installed base continuing to decline, and it looks like the CSM engine venture really hasn't panned out. Pratt Whitney Canada's coming down. Your military engines volumes are probably flat to up. But do you have the structural underpinnings to get to those eventual high-teen margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question is....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Heidi, come on. I think if you take a look even at this quarter is over 100 basis points of margin expansion in a market where you see Pratt Canada down 25%, spares down 25%. Those are high margin businesses, and we still have margin expansion. Dave Hess and the whole team over it Pratt are focused on this 20%. I think it's realistic. You got cost take-out and cost potential from low cost sourcing on the engineering side. You've got low cost manufacturing that we've done in Poland.</p>
          <p>You've also got a very strong future because of the JSF. Remember, that's a huge program. We're not going to see a big benefit until probably 2013, but clearly there is margin upside to the 20%. Pratt's military engine business is great. The small engine business is wonderful, and even the commercial business with the GTF, it will return to high levels of profitability in the future. So 20% is not out of the question, and Dave's not letting his foot off the gas there. They're going to get to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you refresh us as to what your installed fleet of large commercial aircraft engines is today and where it's going to be the next couple of years by your estimates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About 16,000 engines today, and that includes a few that of course have been part, but about 16,000 out in the fleet. That's obviously declining every year. Some of the old JT8s and JT9s get retired. I don't know that we have an actual forecast of fleet size. But we can get back to you with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, basically you're saying that the low cost sourcing and the manufacturing changes in Poland and the growing volumes in military are going to help more than offset the change in the installed -- the decline in the installed engines that you have now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you think about it Heidi, we've already seen a dramatic decrease in profitability associated with a big piece of that installed base, that's the JT8s and JT9s. Couple of years ago that was -- well in 2001 that was a $1 billion of revenue; two years ago that was 350 million; this year it's going to be less than 200 million. So I would tell you most of that if you would be concerned about has already happened, and Pratt has been able to overcome it. In the V2500, parts continue to be very strong on that program, and you've got enough other things in the hopper, I think to offset this. Again they've done a good job over time. It's not something that's just going to fall off the cliff right away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't say it'd fall off the cliff, but it's interesting to say, to see what has happened between Hamilton Sundstrand in 2001 and Pratt &amp; Whitney where margins just continue to be -- I mean you're fighting a good fight at Pratt, but it seems it's always hard to kind of get above a sustainable 16% and higher, and volumes have doubled at Hamilton and gone from 13, 14% on to 17, where as Pratt Whitney in the early 2000, 2001 was doing 16 and 18. And now we're looking at 14, 15. So again, with sales just about doubling. So I'm just wondering, as we think about the global recovery and aftermarket demand picking up, whether Pratt &amp; Whitney was going to see the benefit as well as whether that benefit was going to be feasible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Come on, we like this challenge, right. This is what we come to work for to do every single day is to drive margin improvement at each of the businesses. Obviously, Hamilton's maybe they've had a little bit better recovery over the last five or six years, again they're on more aircraft around the world. But Pratt has done a tremendous job in terms of offsetting the decline instead of that old installed base and driving cost reduction. You think about the low cost sourcing that Pratt has done has been tremendous both on the engineering side and the factory side, and there's more of that to come. So 20% and Dave's going to get there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Minor point Heidi, also remember that collaboration accounting drives margins down effective this year by almost 100 basis points for Pratt. That's just an accounting change. That's not an operational.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair. Well Greg, will you give us a sense as to how many years from now we could look for that 20%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a great question to ask Dave when you see him next March.</p>

          <p>All right. I want to thank everybody for listening into the earnings call today. Obviously, a tough market out there, but I think what you've seen here is tremendous execution across all of the businesses and 50 basis points of margin expansion in this market is really something remarkable. So, I thank everyone for listening, and we'll be in touch over the next couple of weeks. Thank you.</p>
