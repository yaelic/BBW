        <plist>
          <p>Well, good afternoon and thank you for joining us for this second quarter 2008 presentation about the BNP Paribas results. Actually, it is for the fourth consecutive quarter since the beginning of this financial crisis last summer that BNP Paribas has been in the select group of large global banks that are holding up the best. It would certainly be false to say that we are not being affected by the crisis. It still translates into a drop in our earnings and forces us to be even more vigilant and reactive about risk as well as costs.</p>
          <p>However, BNP Paribas is one of the rare banks that are still profitable each quarter in all business lines since the crisis began, and indeed, one of only two CIBs platform in the world, the other one being Goldman Sachs, to have been profitable in each quarter since the start of the crisis.</p>
          <p>In the global banking race we can really say that BNP Paribas is moving away from the pack. That being said, the crisis hasn't dented our ability to meet our client needs and innovate, nor has it dented our growth potential and medium term profitability.</p>
          <p>How have we succeeded in growing BNP Paribas over the recent years, making it more international while maintaining a favorable rich profile? I do believe that it is because at the heart of a corporate culture is the synthesis of our rich culture with our growth culture. It is this combination which allows us to keep the benefit of this growth during tough times, such as those we're currently experiencing.</p>
          <p>So, while remaining vigilant in the face of an ongoing financial crisis and confront the economic slowdown, our group intents to make the most of these relatively healthy situations, continuing to grow organically and to play a role in the real economy, winning customers and offsetting ourselves as a leader in banking and financial services in Europe and throughout the world.</p>
          <p>And now to the figures. Well, the key group figures for the second quarter, we start with revenues at &#x20AC;7.5 billion, down 8.5% second quarter of last year. Operating expenses &#x2013; well, flat, actually increase of 0.1% at &#x20AC;4.9 billion, and with income &#x2013; to the gross operating income down 20.8% at &#x20AC;2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Cost of risk underlies at &#x20AC;700 million, and therefore, the operating income at &#x20AC;2 billion and the net income group share at &#x20AC;1.5 billion, down 34%. This &#x20AC;1.5 billion in profit in the second quarter is without any significant capital gains, which explains why at the level of the Operational Divisions the results are even &#x2013; well, are better.</p>
          <p>As you can see here, the revenues of the operating divisions are down only 4%, exactly 4.2%, to last year's second quarter with operating expenses up 0.7%, and therefore, gross operating income is down, I would say, only 11.5%. So these are the group figures.</p>
          <p>Looking at the revenue momentum, I think we had in the second quarter quite a quite efficient revenue momentum. Starting with the retail, well, retail banking, as you see here, makes 57% of Group revenues. And there we have the French Retail Banking, revenues were up 3%, the BNL banca commerciale in Italy revenues up 6.5% and International Retail Services revenues up 8%.</p>
          <p>Actually for the first half and at constant exchange and rate and payments to be compared with some of our competitors, the number will be &#x2013; the increase in revenues will be 7.7%, so close to 8% including &#x2013; so the retail revenues have quite a good revenue momentum in the first half.</p>
          <p>Then Asset Management &amp; Services, I think it was a very good performance that revenues were up close to 3% and close to &#x20AC;1.4 billion, a record number of revenues for Asset Management &amp; Services so far for BNP Paribas. And then, CIB, the revenue of &#x20AC;1,852 million. It was certainly down 24.5% to last year 2.4 billion, but on a steeper bound of over 41% to the &#x20AC;1.3 billion of revenues of the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>I think we can say that actually altogether we are seeing the revenues of Operational Divisions being altogether higher by 10.5%, 10.6% exactly, compared to the first quarter of this year. So quite a rebound in revenues and quite a good revenue momentum altogether at BNP Paribas Operational Division.</p>
          <p>Cost control. Well, cost control, certainly we remain very vigilant on cost control. The costs were up a mere 0.7% for the second quarter compared to last year second quarter, therefore enabling us to gradually restore the cost/income ratio at a better level against the 67.5% for the fourth quarter of last year and 64% for the first quarter. The second quarter cost/income ratio was 62.7%. Well, this is the way we like telling customers should go down.</p>
          <p>And now on to the cost of risks. As regard to cost of risks &#x2013; for the second quarter, the cost of risk stands at &#x20AC;662 million, an increase certainly compared to the &#x20AC;258 million of the second quarter of last year, which was a very low figure and a very low credit crisis figure for BNP Paribas, an increase of &#x20AC;444 million. And certainly, compared to the third quarter of this year at &#x20AC;550 million, there the rise is, well, only &#x20AC;10 million. And the rise between the second quarter of last year and then this second quarter for &#x20AC;400 million, that's the overall rise, is entirely due &#x2013; well, principally it's not entirely, due to three entities of the group, mainly BancWest for &#x20AC;100 million; and Personal Finance, consumer finance and for &#x20AC;90 million; and Corporate and Investment Banking for roughly &#x20AC;150 million. So I will get back to those three entities in the &#x2013; following the presentation. The cost of risks is therefore altogether at &#x2013; moderately compared to the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>As far as the cost of risks by business unit, what kind of trend we have. For French Retail Banking the trend is very simple. Staying at a very low level you see the measuring big responses in risk-weighted assets, the cost of risk stood at 14 basis points for the first half of this year against 15 for the first half of last year. So, quite stable at a very low level. Quite the same for BNL banca commerciale in Italy &#x2013; stable at 55 basis point for both half.</p>
          <p>BancWest: at BancWest, I will get back to it in detail because we &#x2013; there we have exceptional provision for the portfolio basis and the investment portfolio, certainly on the rise. I will come back to it when we get to BancWest. Personal Finance, well, on the rise from 151 basis points in the first half of last year to 191 basis points for the first half of this year. This is principally due to the economic environments, the working of the economic environment especially in Spain. I'll also get back to it.</p>
          <p>And then for CIB. For CIB what we are seeing is the reverse of situation last year's first half we still had write-backs for 15 basis points, actually for &#x20AC;59 million. And this year, we've seen, well, very little provisions for 14 basis points. So that's a change from write-backs to write-offs that's still on a very limited basis.</p>
          <p>As regard to the divisional contribution to pre-tax profits, we see the robust model in the face of the crisis. French Retail Banking was up 7%, I think it's &#x2013; we see that the French Retail manage to still increase its pre-tax income in difference &#x2013; some of our competitors. BNL bc profits increased pre-tax of 13.3% and International Retail Services, 24% reduction in the pre-tax profit. This is due to the rise of provisions at BancWest in Personal Finance</p>
          <p>Asset Management &amp; Services, well, nearly stable, down 4% to the record level of the second quarter of last year in terms of pre-tax profit and at CIB, &#x20AC;523 million of profit, certainly 57% less than the 1.2 billion of last year second quarter, but quite a rebound compared to the &#x20AC;318 million of pre-tax profit for the first quarter of this year. Altogether, the pre-tax income of operating divisions are 6% higher in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter of this year, very much in line with the revenue rebound I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the first half figures. The first half figures, we get to revenues were close to &#x20AC;15 billion, down 9.2% compared to the first half of last year. Operating expenses were nearly flat, an increase of only 1.2% at &#x20AC;9.5 billion. Therefore, our gross operating income at &#x20AC;5.5 billion down 22%. Cost of risks of &#x20AC;1.2 billion and therefore a gross operating income of &#x20AC;4.2 billion and net income group share close to &#x20AC;3.5 billion, down 27% to last year. So altogether, I think that coming out in this two challenging quarters making this a quite challenging first half of 2008 with the &#x20AC;3.5 billion net income group share profit is a strong performance and that translates into a half yearly net earnings per share of &#x20AC;3.8 per share. As you see here also the operating division did better and that also the revenue were down only 7.4% at the operational level.</p>
          <p>I'll now move on to some &#x2013; well, quick comments for each key division of BNP Paribas, starting as traditionally we do with our French Retail Banking operation. There I think the first comment is that the revenues have been growing at 3%, which I think is quite a good performance in the present environment of the French market. This is due to the net interest income growing by 3.4%. Financial fees down only 3.3% compared to a 16% decrease in the first quarter and certainly a good comparative performance for financial fees in an unfavorable equity market environment.</p>
          <p>Banking fees up 6.2%, thanks to the strong consumer acquisitions that I will just comment in a minute and substantial cash management volume and attractiveness of our new death and disability insurance product. Operating expenses well under control at &#x2013; I must say only 1.2%, so getting close to 1% cost increase is I think a good cost control. We're therefore having a very low cost of risk and having a positive dual effect between the 3% revenues and the 1.2% cost of 1.8% positive dual effect. We therefore &#x2013; all this results in a pre-tax income up 7% and compared to the second quarter of last year at 461 million total. Overall, a good performance in a difficult environment.</p>
          <p>Quite naturally, this translates into a very strong commercial activity and business trend. We've seen continuing pricing growth in loan and deposit outstandings. You see the loans up 12.1%, the outstandings &#x2013; and the deposit outstandings up 11.2%, so quite a good activity. Our customer acquisition I just said 40,000 net opening of cheque and deposit accounts for &#x2013; by individual customers, quite a strong performance. Mortgage outstandings up 7.5% and continued growth of the private banking franchise.</p>
          <p>In terms of corporate customers, accelerated pace of cross-selling with CIB at 19% with good market share in cash management, and with the sharp growth in deposit actually out &#x2013; the loans to corporates have grown 20%, the deposit growth has outpaced the loan growth. So, overall, strong sales and marketing drive at French Retail.</p>
          <p>At BNL banca commerciale in Italy, revenues are up 6.5% with an accelerated pace of new customer acquisition. You see that 16,500 customers compared to, well, 9,000 customers in the first quarter and quite a reversal to the trend a few quarters ago. And strong sustained growth in outstanding loans at 15.8% and well we've just implemented the revenue synergies and the quite dynamic commercial policy.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses, here we see the impact of the cost synergies, up only a mere 0.9%. We have renovated 142 branches, 20 of our branches weekly in the first half of this year, and we are going to open this year 54 new branches, quite a substantial part of the 100 branch opening program we've scheduled for 2008, 2009, 2010.</p>
          <p>We are &#x2013; we see a further improvement of the cost/income ratio, down from 66.3% to 62.8%, so 2.5 points of improvement. The gross operating income is up 17.5% and the cost of risk is up 16% to the very low second quarter. Just as a reminder, the past due over 90 days at BNL are already testified as doubtful provisions because this is the BNP Paribas Group centers. The Bank of Italy has made some local &#x2013; well, that they want this to change, but this is already done at BNL. The pre-tax income therefore &#x20AC;187 million at 13.3%. So, overall, continued strong performance at BNL.</p>
          <p>International Retail Services, well, here we see a strong sales and marketing drive. Since the June &#x2013; the end of June of last year, in one way we gained 1.4 million new customer in Emerging Retail Banking and our branch banking. We opened 200 branches in the last 12 months, including 34 in the second quarter of this year, primarily in Turkey, Russia and North Africa.</p>
          <p>We've seen a sharp growth in outstanding loans at constant scope and exchange rate in all the key business lines at year end. Emerging Retail Banking is up 41%, BancWest is up 12%, Equipment Solutions is up 6% and Personal Finance is up 14%. We've also seen a strong growth in deposit in branch banking, over 6% at BancWest and over 31% at Emerging Retail.</p>
          <p>Strong marketing and sales drives from &#x2013; certainly illustrated by a major revenue and gross operating income growth. Revenues are up 8% this year versus old and 11.6% at constant scope and exchange rate. BancWest at constant exchange rate we've seen a revenue growth of close to 14% with 13.7%. This &#x2013; it confirms the success of other growth initiatives and enhanced company position of BancWest in the retail U.S. market. And the net interest margin at BancWest, as you see has improved that's 3.19 basis points against 3.11 basis points in the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Emerging Retail Banking revenues are up 27.2% with a very vigorous growth, notably in Turkey, Ukraine and North Africa. Personal Finance, 10.2% revenue growth in the second quarter, very much as you inline with the last two quarters, where it was always at a double-digit growth at Personal Finance. We're seeing sustained revenue growth not only in emerging markets and we're seeing certain margin pressure in Europe in the mature markets for consumer finance.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses up 6.3% and with that positive dual effect and improved cost/income ratio by about at 56.8%. So therefore the total gross operating income &#x2013; full gross in, in gross operating income, 10.4% and even close to 13% at constant scope and exchange rate.</p>
          <p>Now to the risk &#x2013; to the cost of risks at International Retail Services. As you see in the upper part of the chart just about, the overall cost of risk stand at &#x20AC;471 million for the second quarter of this year and it's certainly up on the credit crisis level of second quarter of last year, which was only &#x20AC;240 million. It is equivalent in magnitude to the previous two quarters namely 482 for the last quarter of 2007 and 383 for the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>And rise from one-off transactions in the Equipment Solutions, the rise comes well, entirely from BancWest and Personal Finance, so I am going to concentrate on those two. Regarding BancWest and looking at the lower part of the chart on the slide, BancWest posted a sharp rise in risk in the first quarter compared to the pre-crisis very low level of the second quarter of last year. Actually &#x20AC;123 million in the second quarter of this year, compared to &#x20AC;22 million in the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>The first point is to mention a further &#x20AC;44 million impairment in the first &#x2013; in the second quarter of this year of investment portfolio. After, well, we already impaired some of the investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of last year and again in the first quarter of this year. We only remain with a net exposure in investment portfolio to subprime, Alt-A, CMBS and related CDO securities of &#x20AC;200 million. I think that most of that is now behind us.</p>
          <p>Apart from the investment portfolio, the other items which stand for &#x20AC;79 million is due to the loan portfolio and there you see impairments in line with the level experienced since the crisis started from the third quarter of the 2007 and we've seen there &#x2013; the second is &#x20AC;73 million, &#x20AC;86 million, &#x20AC;66 million and &#x20AC;79 million.</p>
          <p>The second comment I will make on BancWest is the ratio of the non-performing loans to total loan portfolio. It now stands as of the end of June at 115 basis points against 151 basis points for the peer group of comparable Western U.S. and Swiss banks that we closely follow.</p>
          <p>That 115 basis points is now &#x2013; is well below the &#x2013; as I said the peer group. This was not the case before. In the second quarter of last year, we both stood, BancWest and the peer group at 50 basis points. Actually, exactly 50 basis points for BancWest and 49 basis points for the peer group. So certainly the deterioration has been much greater, much deeper at the peer group than it has been at BancWest. This is a sign that BancWest stringent origination standards and high quality portfolios stands. And also in our own portfolio, let me remind you that in subprime and Alt-A mortgages, we've only &#x20AC;200 million in our overall loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now another important premature is the low delinquency rate that was secured. In First Mortgage, the loan delinquency rate stands at 115 basis points at BancWest against 390 basis points for the peer groups, so it's about 1 to 4. For Home Equity, it stands at 72 basis points at BancWest against 210 basis points at the peer group. So that's a ratio of about 1 to 3 and for consumers loans, it stands at 115 basis points at the BancWest against 250 for peers, so a ratio of 1 to 2.</p>
          <p>So what we see is that the rise in cost of risk at BancWest is certainly mitigated by the quality of the portfolio, the written past, group provision efforts and we should continue outperform the peer group significantly into the U.S. economic downturn.</p>
          <p>Now moving from BancWest to Personal Finance, we've seen the cost of risk at Personal Finance up &#x20AC;91 million this quarter to &#x20AC;274 million. It is due mostly to the deteriorating risk environments in Spain. Spain contributes to &#x20AC;37 million of increase to that cost of risk.</p>
          <p>The other certainly point is the volume effect because as we've seen the loan are up 40% at constant scope and exchange rate. So, what the gain is, this results in the pre tax income for year end &#x2013; for the quarter of &#x20AC;481 million, down 24.1%.</p>
          <p>Now moving to Asset Management &amp; Services, I think there the picture is quite clear. The revenues are strong. They are growing close to 3%, getting close to 1.4 billion to historical heights for BNP Paribas despite the difficult environment. Security services did very well with their revenues up close to 15% with transaction at 20% and BNP Paribas financial services having won many new mandates in the markets through requests or proposals by many banks or institutional players. Insurance revenues are up 10.4%. We've see an increase in the financial margins and assets. In France the gross asset outflow in licenses is down 8% at BNP Paribas insurance very much in line with the market.</p>
          <p>Wealth &amp; Asset Management have been affected by the dropping markets and lower order from individual customers. That's why the revenues for that counterparty is down 6%. Operating expenses altogether are at 6.5% compared to the second quarter of last year. This is the slowdown across all business. Let me remind you that the cost growth was 8.3% in the first quarter, so we're going to continue to slowdown that and for Wealth &amp; Asset Management the cost increases is now down to 1.4%. So the cost will be managed in a way, in line with the revenue trend as you can expect.</p>
          <p>The pre-tax income therefore is down only 4% compared to the second quarter of last year to &#x20AC;533 million, but it is up close to 25% compared to the first quarter of this year. So I think the slow performance in a difficult market environment for Asset Management Services altogether.</p>
          <p>In terms of assets under management, we've seen a well a slight but negative net asset outflow in the second quarter, &#x20AC;1.2 billion and because the net asset inflow was strong in the first quarter, altogether we have a positive net asset inflow of &#x20AC;4.2 billion for the first half.</p>
          <p>And in the second quarter private banking had a positive growth of &#x20AC;3 billion of which over 1 billion in Asia. Against that asset management had a negative asset outflow of just over &#x20AC;6 billion due first of all to general rotation of household savings in Italy, we have seen the negative net outflow for the Italian market in the magnitude of &#x20AC;70 billion and BNL has taken its share of that in the second quarter. And the other thing is that we've seen, especially in France, monetary funds out for seasonal reasons, corporate clients taking, well, due to the cash requirements reducing the funds they have in monetary funds and that represented around &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>
          <p>All together, as of the end of June the assets under management stood at &#x20AC;546 billion, very stable compared to the &#x20AC;548 billion, as of the end of March. And we have made the acquisition of IMS, the UK-based multi-managers. We therefore had some premature effect in this.</p>
          <p>And now to Corporate and Investment Banking. Corporate and Investment Banking, we have revenues of &#x20AC;1852 million in the second quarter. That's down 24.5% compared to the record second quarter of last year. That comes after &#x20AC;457 million of net impact negative on revenues from the non aligned credit adjustment. I must say that we have no other significant fair value adjustments either positive or negative. I think it's very important to mention that these revenues of the second quarter are higher by 41.3% compared to the first quarter, and to say that the continued strength in the client-driven business was very &#x2013; well, very pretty. Actually we had double-digit growth in client revenues in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of last year in our Corporate and Investment Banking division.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses were down 8% with continued targeted expansion of key franchises, apart from that high increase at CIB and some rightsizing efforts in securitization in LBO and in <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; in the activities mostly affected by the crisis. Therefore, the cost/income ratio of CIB was brought down from 72.6% in the first quarter of 2008 to 67.8% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Cost of risk, as I already mentioned, moving from &#x20AC;50 million write-back in the second quarter of last year to &#x20AC;86 million of provisions in the second quarter of this year. So this minus 20, minus 15 basis points, and then 14 basis points, so still quite a fairly low level of cost of risk from the CIB division. And this will result in a pre-tax income of &#x20AC;523 million of which &#x20AC;153 million pre-tax profit from Advisor and Capital Markets. And so a quite significant revenue rebound and pre-tax income rebound in the second quarter compared to the first quarter despite the significant impact from the monoline risk.</p>
          <p>On monoline, the gross counterparty slightly increased to &#x20AC;3 billion from &#x20AC;2.9 billion from end of March to end of June. The deterioration of mortgage related CDOs was a bit higher than the improvement of corporate related CDOs which explain this slight increase in counterparty exposure &#x2013; gross counterparty exposure.</p>
          <p>We have seen a sharp rise in the monoline CDS spreads in the second quarter, and therefore, to take that into account, we impacted the revenues by a further &#x20AC;645 million of credit adjustment which were partly offset by 188 million in gains on hedging instruments taken into the P&amp;L. So, the net impact on revenues was that &#x20AC;457 million already mentioned several times.</p>
          <p>For two monolines that we have classified as doubtful, we have taken 85 million impact on the cost of risk as to provision 100% of this exposure to these monolines, as we've done previously with the ACA monoline already &#x2013; well, somewhere in the middle of last year.</p>
          <p>So after all of that, we now stand as of the end of June with a net exposure of &#x20AC;1.15 billion on monolines against over 1.5 billion as of the end of the March, which is a reduction of 25%. And we have a quite negligible net exposure to the most downgraded monoline insurer. So I think we have made quite significant effort to reduce the net counterparty exposure &#x2013; BNP Paribas monoline insurance, bringing it very much to a level of provision and to an absolute level on net exposure, which I feel is satisfactory at Group level.</p>
          <p>As regards the revenues of Corporate and Investment Banking, Equities and Advisory had a very good performance in their geographic market, &#x20AC;750 million of revenues for the second quarter against 316 in the first quarter this year and against 825 for the second quarter of last year. Client-driven revenue were up in this quarter in all regions of the world. I remind you that we just recently acquired Bank of America's prime brokerage business. We're now working to integrate it, which is a very good start, both from staff and hedge fund clients' response to this integration. And we believe we're going to consolidate these operations in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Fixed Income had a very good operating performance aside from the significant write-downs on monolines. We had a record quarter in interest rates, forex and commodities businesses, thanks to a strong client-driven business, and we had a very limited impact of the euro yield curve sudden move in June.</p>
          <p>In terms of Financing Businesses, the &#x20AC;713 million of revenues of the second quarter of this year stand to a record number compared to the 702 of the second quarter of last year and to the 603 of the first quarter of this year. We have seen a very strong revenue growth for energy, commodities, projects and also for corporate acquisition finance, where the <mark type="inaudible" /> position of BNP Paribas is fairly showing into numbers and how we position ourselves in this business. We are certainly actively adapting the terms maturity, covenant and spreads, of the final thing we now put on out balance sheet. So, we've seen an overall strong amount of revenues in each case.</p>
          <p>I think it's important to see that now that we are four quarters into the crisis since last summer, the <mark type="inaudible" /> model of BNP Paribas has confirmed, its level of love with nature . And we've seen in these four quarter only two corporate and investment platforms in the world have been both constantly profitable each quarter and overall showing a fitting profit over the period. One is Goldman Sachs and the other is BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>This is due to a very favorable business mix and geographic breakdown at BNP Paribas. We have been talking at length &#x2013; since last July that it's vibration LBO and credibilities, we are making only about 10% of our revenues and we have seen that's now showing and we've seen also that one set of our revenues come from Asia and emerging market.</p>
          <p>So we are strengthening our credit franchise. We have kept our stringent risk policy. And because the business model was not endangered, we escaped much related to fully working with customers and for customers . Therefore we can enhance company position for BNP Paribas CIB and I think it is important to say that four quarters into the crisis.</p>
          <p>One word on liquidity. Liquidity is very important, as we all know or as we are being reminded in the crisis, the long-term deposit ratio of BNP Paribas has been fairly stable at 132%, and as of the end of June of this year, no change to the end of 2006 or to the end of June of last year. We have raised 34 billion in medium and long-term funds in the first half of this year. This is comparing to 29 billion in the first half of last year and this is in terms substantially better than both of our competitors.</p>
          <p>Take for example the two years maturity when BNP Paribas got 3.5 &#x2013; got &#x20AC;3 billion at 20 basis points, current credit swap. We're seeing Credit Agricole at 50 basis points, a week later SocGen at 42, <mark type="inaudible" /> at 45 and Deutsche 47. And for the three years maturity, in the last few weeks we've seen BNP Paribas for &#x2013; gain &#x20AC;3.250 billion at 20 basis points when Credit Suisse was at 73, Compania at 58, UBS at 88 and Fortis at 87.</p>
          <p>So this makes a quite a major competitive advantage in funding which is important. And I think anybody has to measure that and certainly the dividend that will not push us to lend at the lowest present level that has put us in an important competitive position to &#x2013; in the peer group.</p>
          <p>Well, we've expanded the investor base and went towards the securitization spending, which were few because of the of the group and strong effectiveness. We've seen in Asia and America everywhere in the world, an increased level of funding raised from institutional &amp; corporate platforms, also from Central Banks and not from the interbank market. So this is very important.</p>
          <p>This enables BNP Paribas to be secure and much more diverse funding and to get the funding at a cheaper price. So we will be also raising the liquidity reserve that can potentially be modernized from Central Bank. It's now coming to a very high figure. And I think the liquidity position of BNP Paribas is, therefore, both very competitive and very solid.</p>
          <p>Moving to growth in risk rated assets, sustained growth of risk rated assets is very much something that we like to do certainly keeping the vigilance high on the creditor risk and risk reward of this transaction. We have seen in the first half risk rated asset's growth at 5.8%. I would say very much inline with the 10% year forecast that was our risk rated asset growth for this year. This volume growth, as I have already commented comes well across all the business units of BNP Paribas. And we're seeing by the way the increase in the level of growing and confirm that it is quite marginal. It's 1% with CIB, it's 2% for French Retail. So, it's not an issue.</p>
          <p>The Q1 ratio of the growth stands at 7.6%. It is stable compared to March and it is higher compared to the 7.2 or 7.3 of last year. And actually, our Tier 1 capital for retail earnings is up 5.6% at the middle of the year, very much in line with the growth in risk rated assets. The Management committee is working on a few revisions to the market risk framework that will have a limited impact of BNP Paribas. We can get back to that for the Q&amp;A. This relates mostly to market risk, which make only 4% of our group risk rated asset. So this shouldn't be a real issue for BNP Paribas. So we have a capital generation, which enables the group to finance a sustained organic growth.</p>
          <p>As we've done our capitalization, I do consider as Group's Chief Executive of BNP Paribas, that at 7.6% our Tier 1 ratio is entirely adequate. Given BNP Paribas risk profile and it ensures to BNP Paribas the effect of debt to liquidity as confirmed both by rating agencies and by the markets, if we look at the 5 year CDO, CDS spreads.</p>
          <p>In terms of rating, Standard and Poor's reaffirmed on the 1 of July, well just a month ago, the AA+ rating of BNP Paribas stating that this strong and highly diversified business profile, the sound financial position being characterized by contained risk, satisfactory profitability, and adequate capitalization and high financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>Fitch rating, two days later on the 3rd of June reaffirmed the rating of BNP Paribas, also commenting that the high income diversification, respectable and stable profitability, strong risk management, sound and good quality capital ratio make it deserve this rating. The AA+ rating by Standard and Poor's makes BNP Paribas for Standard and Poor's one of the four best rated banks in the world.</p>
          <p>As regards the CDS market, over the last few months as mentioned it has been volatile. The BNP Paribas CDS market is always, well best in peer group sometimes in line with Rabobank is, well Rabobank and BNP Paribas, but all the other CDS spreads stand steady, well significantly higher than BNP Paribas. So we have, I feel and we have at BNP Paribas low pressure to raise capital.</p>
          <p>In the conclusion, I think that the second quarter performance of BNP Paribas remained fairly strong, especially all the operating divisions in the challenging environment of the continuing crisis we are going through. The BNP Paribas Group, because of its capital generation towards profit, and its liquidity position is quite enabled at Group level to self finance a significant organic growth on which we certainly want to concentrate and therefore BNP Paribas is well placed to continue in the next few quarters, whatever challenging conditions we have in the environment to continue to improve its competitive position.</p>
          <p>And so we have run out, but maybe you want to...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Phil Richard from Execution. I have got three questions, if I can. The first one can you tell us what your target is for NDI growth is in French Retail Banking this year, <mark type="inaudible" /> against a background of rising regulated rates and also SocGen are giving guidance of 1 to 3% growth this year.</p>
          <p>Second question is, you've given us what you think is the normalized standard charge in the Personal Finance division, pretty hike on standard charge. And thirdly is on one write down, I guess if there, I think a quite people focus this in particular comparing yourself to SocGen and at the same time your write down on absolutely higher then by sending us quarterly features for the underlying procedures and the required license do they expect on those assets. I'm wondering if you can give a little more detail on the basis of the underlying procedures, you are taking on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll answer the first question, Jean will answer the second and Philippe will answer the third. As regard French Retail revenues target for this year, I would say that the first half will be running at 3% and to the end of this year because of the rise in regulated rates that took place on the first of August, will put pressure on the second half. I hope to get as close as possible to 3%, but I think it would be close to but maybe not 3% for the full year, that's the target. Now Jean, you can answer on the, what we consider normalized cost of ratio for Personal Finance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's a very difficult question to answer to because it depends on several things. The first one is the geographic mix, because the more you develop your business in the emerging markets the more you are increasing the level of risk, you are increasing at the same time the level of revenues, but you are increasing the level of risk so as we are growing our activities in some emerging markets, I think that for the future, we should have more revenues and more risks than before. Okay, so that will be productive, but anyway if you are having normal level of risk is difficult to answer .</p>
          <p>And second point, it depends as well on the kind of products you're distributing. The more you are focused on revolving credits, the higher the cost of risk is. Okay, if you are in times of you have a lower level of risk. Anyway, based on what we have seen, the level we have currently is the level which is the crisis level because it's much higher. So based on the permanent I should say risk mix with no evolution &#x2013; the more normal level of risk is more what we have enjoyed in the last year. We have to take that currency in the.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Philippe Bordenave. As regard the monoline exposure, I think we should maybe go to slide 73 which is the disclosure according to the <mark type="inaudible" /> study from that. Well, so we give the detail of our underlying instruments that <mark type="inaudible" /> the three first lines relating to mortgage based underlying, CDOs of US residential mortgage &#x2013; subprime <mark type="inaudible" />, CDOs of commercial mortgage based securities, and then there's the three &#x2013; the three following lines relating to corporate exposures, corporate loan CDOs, corporate loans and CLOs. And the last line being money credit related, basically you know foreign exchange for example derivatives or interest rate derivatives with monoline. All those exposures are trading exposures. They are exposures coming from trading counterparty exposure; it's a derivative trading exposure- related exposure. And as such, when it came to assisting the TVAs, the credit derivatives adjustment, and we &#x2013; well, came to the natural conclusion that the best way to do it was not to make any assumptions, but just to stick to the market. So we fully stick to the market valuation and it may explain some differences with competitors because we've seen competitors in different positions, especially competitors having kind of investment fixed books and partially hedged with monolines, being in a different situation and deciding to <mark type="inaudible" /> their exposure. And on the basis of assumptions they were doing, we have &#x2013; it's very difficult to make any assumption, especially about the future like <mark type="inaudible" />. And so we prefer to take the mark &#x2013; play the mark-to-market and it's really consistent with the books in which they are &#x2013; those exposure, so we think it's the best way &#x2013; so we have &#x2013; what you have on the yellow column is the present value of the exposure to the growth competitor. It's a plain present value of the exposure and then starting from there, from the bottom, we have given the hedge &#x2013; of course, we are debating for the hedges and this time you are seeing that the present value of the hedges have gone down because those hedges are operating results in the P&amp;L which is quite normal as hedges. So there is a &#x2013; we had a decline in the present value of the hedge down to 0.6 billion. And then the credit adjustment and the allowances have been taken on the basis of the mark-to-market given the strength of the monolines themselves. And so we are left with those figures. So it's clearly mark-to-market, and so we can't explain more than that. it's not &#x2013; it's purely mark-to-market.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just come back to that, just on the CDOs and subprimes <mark type="Inaudible" /></p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Neuez from Goldman Sachs. I just have two questions. The first one is on CIB, we've seen among the peer group that this quarter had very strong revenues in businesses such as concourse, currencies, fixed income and so on. I'm just wondering to what extent you can actually begin to hire at a sustainable volume. That would be the first question. And secondly, in asset management, we've seen record revenues and if we <mark type="inaudible" /> and we're just wondering to what was behind that expansion and whether there was any external factor there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we can complement &#x2013; on the CIB strong revenues, I don't think there is anything really special in this quarter. What we see is that, as I said, continued strength in the client-driven business. I therefore believe that it will be certainly difficult to predict precisely that this will continue at that level, but on your side there is nothing really specific as predicted one-offs that we've seen the client coming in this quarter. And on the &#x2013; on units, I don't know if you had &#x2013; on units I think that's very good we've seen &#x2013; I think the units, as I've commented that security services and insurance has been fairly strong with double-digit growth in revenues against the Private Bank and Asset Management Services we have seen neutral revenues. But I think we &#x2013; this is a &#x2013; the business mix of the BNP Paribas Asset in that division is such that security service additions need quite a big part of that  against other, well, banks, whose asset management are much more asset management part of the bank only. So I think this, we have a business mix which so far is more resilient.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on &#x2013; and about the instrument business which is more <mark type="inaudible" /> your question I understand, it's due to the fact that even if the production of new cash has gone down, in fact the new cash is piling up with the rest and because that kind of investment are very long-term ones. So there is much more tax coming in than out, even if the new cash is lower than the predecessor it's added to the outstanding amount and so the margin, and the volumes are growing and the revenues are increased at what...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> I would like to come back to- question related to higher volatility- maybe higher volatility has induced <mark type="inaudible" /> business but if you look at the figures, you can see that the trading profits were very limited to this quarter. So that means that we didn't benefit, basically good conditions on trading to cost revenue we have shown to you. Okay, so the level of trading is lower than 16% Okay, so we didn't have any significant trading revenue related to the high volatility in the markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> double-digit to the cost growth that you have in France. And I am wondering if this is only <mark type="inaudible" /> from asset under management as well corporate <mark type="inaudible" /> given the prices that you are keeping this tough double-digit spend. The <mark type="inaudible" /> cost of risk in CIB, I am wondering if you can give more color on sector or maybe what is the kind of expectation that we should have at least for a competitive peer. And then the third question is on the cost <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Philippe will comment on the cost one. Regarding deposit growth and &#x2013; I think that some of the strength in the deposit growth at the French branch banking network is some switch from money market funds to see to term deposit into the French Retail, so I think partially you are right. You couldn't have a 12% increase in deposits only by fighting because it eventually run strong on customer acquisition and new customers. So that's the third question. Second question regarding the 14 basis point cost of risk in CIB, I think it is safe to say to you that most of the specific provisions inside the &#x2013; in the second quarter relates to the doubtful monoliners and that quarter the &#x20AC;85 million, which is as close to the 89, so they are doing some, some write backs and some &#x2013; so there is a specific provision on corporate files into the second quarter if you see that 85 million relates to doubtful monoliners it seems very limited. So that's the comment. Yes, tell me.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Ronit Ghose from Citigroup. Just to follow-up on a couple of questions that Antonio asked. On the new accounts &#x2013; on the French Retail new accounts and deposits, Second quarter-first quarter it's gone down and the first half of this year is down with the first half of last year. And I just wondered if there is any particular trend here either within the French market that you're seeing <mark type="inaudible" /> which is why your new account generations have been slowing despite good volume growth in deposits?</p>
          <p>Second question is a follow-up on the CIB provisions, it's remarkable as you've said that you're almost underlying net zero loan loss provision CIB and I wondered if you can give us any more color on the growth amount, is there- are there big recoveries still coming through and from and it's just coming through from other than the downturn of &#x2013; I'm taking to slow down it seems the downwards is taking the corporate factor one of this in more provisions in the corporate side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Philippe do you want to answer the first question; I'm not sure I've got the question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the second one really the growth numbers are a few tenths, so not a lot, we have a few writebacks on old files coming from dating back from the present crisis, energy crisis which are recouped again this quarter, that is in the region of 40 or something like that and we have a few new safety provisions and the net is one as we have said but- apart from the monoline, but it's really a small amount, a few tenths each way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the gross recoveries are quite limited you are saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The recoveries are now limited yes, certainly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No huge amount on competitive price and huge amount</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What needs to happen now for the gross amount to start going up in terms of the actual gross positions, because I know you are more conservative than Tiers but if you look back to 01, 02, off the top of my head, it must have been about 70 basis points or so in the CIB division.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think that in between, there has been a lot of up trend in the market and in between you have seen the strong development of high yield bond market and of the credit derivatives and so the &#x2013; at that time 100% of the corporate risk was in those bank books. It's not the case today, so the &#x2013; given there will be probably some increase in the cost of risk in the corporate business and CIB, we are not expecting a huge increase in that at the moment.</p>
          <p>On the second integration, I thought that your question was basically decrease of saving deposits, saving accounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No sorry, it's the number of accounts, the number of new accounts...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh the number of new accounts. The trend is 40,000 for this quarter, which is a little bit lower than the first quarter, but anyway keep in mind that what we are seeing so far, to maintain our market share, we need more or less to have 70,000 new accounts per year, which means that we are growing on market share.</p>
          <p>Second point is, that is related to the marketing campaigns we are launching and keep in mind that last year we had a very good product related to, it was an interest product, specifically designed for young clients, and it was very, very, very efficient. So I think that the level of 40,000, I mean, that we are gaining market share and that we are very rich and if you look at the evolution of the revenues, the levels at this time compared to where it was <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and you also see it as I've said in the banking service fees going up 6.2%. You couldn't get that 6% increase unless you have more customers, because you, I think one of the important points is that in terms of price increases on our fees over the last few year is between 0 to 1%, so you don't...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Inflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, with inflation, so we haven't been increasing 6% by raising the prices of our services. So you have &#x2013; you need more customers buying more products, because with that kind of price increase you will never get into 6% increase, unless you really get new customers. And, but &#x2013; we really know that by now we have like about 8 products per customer, so when the customer is at 8 products it compares. You will need customers because we're not going to 12, so that's why we have emphasized so much in the last few years the customer acquisitions that we've done &#x2013; or rather a few years going to equip with well 1, 2, 3, 4 and that's how we build up revenues in the banking service fees by having the new customers being equipped which easily goes over a few years.</p>

          <p>I am Kian Abouhossein from JP Morgan. On slide 8, can you maybe talk a little bit about normalized condition levels that you would see over this cycle with different businesses to just get a bit of understanding of what you would consider as normal?</p>
          <p>And in respect to coverage ratio, your coverage ratio declined, can you tell me at what level you would argue that coverage ratio needs to be beefed up again?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, in terms of risk-weighted asset growth, you are very anti-cyclical in the sense that most banks are reducing risk-weighted assets at this point &#x2013; or looking to reduce.

I think the rationale for increasing risk-weighted assets is exactly that at this point in time into the current environment, you <mark type="inaudible" />, you will be able to get very good business at very good price &#x2013; and even dealing with existing customers or dealing with new customers.</p>
          <p>And BNP Paribas, we're in the banking business and the banking business is to serve customers, to lend to customers for their projects, if they make sense, and to make sure that we lend against &#x2013; well projects, cash flows, collateral, everything that makes sense. So that's our business.</p>
          <p>And I think that banks will stop lending, maybe it's because they are short of capital or because they are short of funding or because they are short of, I don't know, morale. We are running the business of being bankers, and as bankers we lend. We also check the credit &#x2013; that's banking. Some people have forgotten that business and have done other things over the last few years, but if you are in banking, that's your business. And we are not in the factory business, we are in the banking business, and so we lend.</p>
          <p>And at this point of time a lot of banks are so much &#x2013; their management, their business model, they are in shambles. And if you are in shambles, I don't know &#x2013; they do something else. But we are in banking.</p>
          <p>And we see a lot of customers coming to us that have been trusting their friendly bank and &#x2013; but their friendly bank is not doing business any more and we are happy to do business with them. And certainly we will keep our front line and our growth risk people all of other world very much busy, day and night to double check what we put on the balance sheet. But we are happy to do so.</p>
          <p>At present, with the momentum at around 10% a year &#x2013; and I see some other banks in the world who are also strong <mark type="inaudible" /> do that. I won't quote names, but a few of them. And we are very happy to be not in the crowd of the banks that have stopped, sitting on the sea with the engines down, and then waiting to see what happens next. So we don't do that, if that answers your question.</p>
          <p>Then regarding your &#x2013; now I'll get to the first question. Normalized credit risk, I don't think I can answer that question. I mean, if I knew how to predict normalized credit risk over the next few quarters, over the next few years, I would not be a CEO, I would be a magician. So I can't say that. What I can tell you, as much as I can tell you, the foreign exchange price with regards to the euro or interest rates over the next few years.</p>
          <p>But if I can't say that, I can say two things, BNP Paribas has outperformed its peers over the last few cycles and we are going to continue to do so, and that's my job. My job is to outperform peers in every part of the cycle. And I will try to make sure that if you invest in BNP Paribas shares you get a cost outlook in different divisions that over time beats the others. I don't know &#x2013; but then &#x2013; you know, what it will be exactly quarter-after-quarter, how it's going to be the road to do that, I can't predict precisely.</p>
          <p>I think that the cost of risk to make a quick summary in each core business. In French, we say, I make two comments. I'll pretend very much in this room but the French market is the best market in Europe. I love it to U.K., I love it to Spain, I like it &#x2013; I prefer to Italy, even logically I know it's the best. Okay? That's my market. That's my home market. And in that market BNP Paribas is best in terms of cost management, so that will be the best of the best, that's what in French we say.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the P&amp;L, I think it's very good in Italy and we will also <mark type="inaudible" /> in Italy so I don't know what will be the basis point, but that will be equal. BNP Paribas &#x2013; is a difficult &#x2013; that's United States, that's a difficult market, and I will remind you that BNP Paribas has listed operations in the western part of the United States <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; so $2 in subprime and that was the country were subprime was invented. So we didn't go into that business because it didn't make sense. We didn't do it <mark type="inaudible" />, we didn't do it at the CIB platform. So comparable to bank laws, we will wonder why because this is a cyclical downturn in the U.S. But I do believe I've shown figures that we're going to outperform peers significantly in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Personal Finance, well, some of that I have already commented on Personal Finance. It's on the rise today for accumulation of that <mark type="inaudible" /> emerging markets <mark type="inaudible" /> risk is high because it is different risk management, you get much more revenue but with higher cost of risk. And it's also higher cost of risk because the &#x2013; in Spain the turnaround of the economic cycle is rather good, so then get feedback on the consumer loan and loan loss ratio in Spain.</p>
          <p>As regards CIB, I think that regarding CIB, you will see some hopefully gradual, should I say gradual, should I say slow, should I say slight, increase of the cost of risk from the <mark type="inaudible" /> level approaching basis point. Now how high is it going to go, how fast it is going to increase, I can't say that. I believe that we're going to do better than peers and we will see that in following quarter-after-quarter in the next few years. That's seems like a good answer on the cost services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just an additional comment on the increase because if you compare the cost of risk to our peers, you can see that it is a bit higher. Because we cover the risk, we do not do over-night deals <mark type="inaudible" /> over one 180 days and the in the back room continue changing the rules, but there are obviously new rules in place <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to give an example in the French Retail I think our cost of risk presently is the half of some of the competitors that are also on the road and half the cost of this because the competitor in the same home market is a quite a different especially if it's repeated to second quarter. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just quickly on the coverage ratio to complete the answers. We stand at 87% throughout, which, well, which is the level where we used to stand when we switched to the Alcala at the end of 2005. So in between it has been a little bit higher to 90 &#x2013; 11%, 91% already at the end of 2007. I think that kind of movement around 90% is nothing significant, actually. Each five is reserved, I would say, on a case-by-case basis, depending on the recovery rate of each five, and you know if you have the five coming with a group higher quarterly rates you need less provisions and so it may <mark type="inaudible" /> coverage ratio changes. But it should depend on the kind of range we are seeing with that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's <mark type="inaudible" /> with MF Global.  Two questions, one on CIB. You had a target of about 8 billion in revenues for CIB and then moved away from the target. Now that you are reaching almost 1.9 billion from quarter in revenues, where would you put your target if you were to put a target again? And then, would you see that the revenues that you've realized the second quarter as attainable considering that a number of your activities were related to FX energy and commodities and we have seen a sharp decline in commodity prices and energy prices in the second quarter of this year and the first quarter of this year?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is for Philippe -you correctly predicted after the second &#x2013; the first quarter results that would be an after shock and would be offset <mark type="inaudible" /> widening and we saw that in June &#x2013; do you expect to see another after shock in the-for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Philippe. Can you repeat the question? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You correctly predicted widening <mark type="inaudible" /> in the second quarter of the year after your first quarter results. Do you expect to see another aftershock after March, the month of March, shock has passed <mark type="inaudible" />? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that as regards the present target for CIB for this year, certainly, and <mark type="inaudible" /> following our first quarter results and at the time given the market situation in March, as you rightly say, we dropped the target to try to repeat this year the record of '07 would be overwhelming.</p>
          <p>I think that, that being said we're pleased with the level of revenues we've reached in the second quarter of this year and certainly we won't play the game of setting a new target now because it's &#x2013; I don't think it would make sense for this year. But we will try to get as high as possible revenues for CIB into this year. And I think that we've been &#x2013; I don't say we've been surprised but I would say we've been pleased to see that in all activities of CIB once again that the client revenues have been up on the double-digit rate in the second quarter. I think &#x2013; we are gaining market share in BNP Paribas and we are therefore, I hope, that we're will be able to show again in the next few quarters that we are doing better in the revenue generation at BNP Paribas than the overall market. That would <mark type="inaudible" />...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Every time you mentioned a record revenue level you said that you were facing, in the commodities and FX and product finance and energy division productivity, I mean considering the drop in energy prices and commodity prices would you expect to see, assuming that they normalize at a lower level, would you see the same level of revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and for <mark type="inaudible" /> mention energy and commodities, often, I would say, the diversity of CIB revenues is such that I don't think that it is so directly linked to the oil barrel price so I would remain cautiously optimistic that these revenues, well &#x2013; will continue on a trend basis to be fairly strong in the next few months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just keep in mind that the higher the oil price is, the sector could be in a worse position because we have the cost of energy as an expense for example, if you take airlines for example, the optimum price of BNP Paribas, the cost of energy is not <mark type="inaudible" />, for energy and commodity business it's true that it's better and one of its <mark type="inaudible" /> 118 but you know 118 is a fairly high price, so currently I don't see the problem because of the oil price being lower than 100. I think that it is positive of the rest of the economy to have a lower oil price. But for our energy and commodity business, we'd better have a higher point but liquidity for BNP Paribas, I am not sure that it is the best position globally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's about you'll recall that, yes, when we had the last conference call in early May, around about early May, it was just after the release following the peak in March. And I said that while it was a relief, it's not necessarily the end of the crisis.</p>
          <p>Today I think we are, anyway we have to behave as if the crisis would go on. It is always difficult to know, probably, maybe some &#x2013; the bulk of the write downs linked to the subprime crisis are behind us. Probably the bulk of the monoline credit adjustments are behind us as well, but nevertheless we still see some pressure on liquidity, the spread the &#x2013; the LIBOR/OIS spread is still there.</p>
          <p>There are imbalances here in a lot of places. The beginning of some crisis in real estate is coming to certain places in Europe, in the U.K., in Spain. So we, I think we can't say that the crisis is over. It's too early to say so. Well, and as long as the crisis is not over, there are ups and downs.</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Jaap Meijer from Dresdner. A couple of questions. There was a bit of an echo when the operator was actually calling may name and I hope the line is all right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, excellent. I am happy that you take bigger hair cuts on your insurance structure and credit portfolio if you can compare to <mark type="inaudible" />, however if your net exposure is still in fact on about 53% which is comparing basically with SocGen, which is about about 67%. So how do you read the probability of default if you analyze how much will property will be taken in to account. How is the hedging taking actually place? Is it on the TDSs of the monoliners itself, and do you have any insurance through multiliners or investment banks on your &#x2013; on your monoline exposures?</p>
          <p>The second question relates to unrealized losses about less than 700 million. and is it possible to prevent let's say in equity, fixed credit and other fixed income, particularly on the equity portfolio, how much are your reserves, because at low point address profit sharing which your <mark type="inaudible" /> has come to an end. I don't know, 95% I guess is profit sharing, but I guess on the negative side, that has to stop at one point. Third question is -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure, I personally didn't get your second question to this issue. I think I should answer question by question, because it's not...</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The line is not so good, but we can have 12 question in a row. So please Philippe did you get the first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take the first question. On the first question I have already answered to a certain extent to <mark type="inaudible" />. We have not taken any extension in the calculation of the monoline credit adjustment and provision. And we had just stick to the market price. So yes at the end it makes kind of coverage ratio of 53%, but I am not sure that this percentage is meaningful.</p>
          <p>In fact we have just taken line by line the market price as shown by the CDS from the monoline. So when the monoline CDSs are widening we will oblige to take a bigger credit adjustment, and this is why we have such a bigger bill I would say in credit adjustments in this quarter because the price of monolines have widened quite a lot. So we are strictly mark-to-market because &#x2013; so in the trading book we are strictly mark-to-market. So I think this is very clear.</p>
          <p>On your second question about the unrealized gains and losses and on the balance sheet, this total of minus 0.7 billion is mix of mainly two things in fact. The conversion reserve meaning the foreign exchange impact on our balance sheet and the licensed capital gains on the securities portfolio.</p>
          <p>And the capital gains on the securities portfolio remains positive, in fact, by 1.4 billion, and so we &#x2013; you can see that in the financial statement and so we have &#x2013; we still have licensed capital gains on the equity portfolio, in the available equity portfolio, and we have a negative figure in the conversion, the forex element, due to the trends of the euro and especially of course on some of the goodwill we have paid in dollars. So we have a negative impact there of 2 billion in total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what is the good run rate for your equity and advisory business in the current environment? Because Q2 was excellent only down 1% year-over-year and it's like more than that up 137% versus the first quarter. So is that a fair run rate or should we actually take the mid-point of the two quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've been &#x2013; If I may, on some we are not seeing &#x2013; the figure is okay, but as you can see it's much bigger than it used to be. So we don't see that as an exceptional.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's also the proposal of the Basel Committee. If you can just reach your slide. If you expect already 4% high-risk effort because of adding market risks?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, four percent is the <mark type="inaudible" /> of the market risk. It's not an incremental &#x2013; it's not an additional increase, it's not an additional. The two, two market risk of the group represents 4% of the total weighted access of the &#x2013; it's a very limited amount.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, the evolution of the regulation is focused on two things for which BNP Paribas is not really involved in, in fact. It is the pure market risk, because it's not the capital allocated to the market activity, because the capital allocate to the market activity is the addition of the market risk and the counterparty risk, and of course the capital which is needed by the competitive risk is relatively high, as we have seen, with the monoline issue.</p>
          <p>But this reflects only the market risk element which is what is at stake in the Basel 2.5 and it's relatively little bit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe you also disclosed to your want to the regulator excluding insurance. Would you like to share that with the outside world, in fact? After subtracting your insurance unit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, while the insurance in the Basel ratio, the insurance assets are not taken into account as such, and the insurance business is taken into account from the minute you have the ratio by a deduction which is made there, in order to deduct the capital which is kind of devoted to the insurance business. So it plays the role as it's a minus in the numerical and it's not a plus in the denominator.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

And we had said that, when we switched to Basel II because under Basel I it was not taken into account at all almost, and when we switched to Basel II at the beginning of the year, we explained that it has costed us a little something like 15 basis points on the Tier 1 ratio, if I am right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing. There wouldn't be any P&amp;L impact because the &#x2013; we put in the balance sheet and it would be put in the balance sheet at fair value by dissolution, and then there wouldn't be any impact at all. In fact because the lines we are giving to those, we are granting to those conduits, are already taken into account in the Basel II calculations.</p>
          <p>Now as you know on the Basel II, those conduits are much better tracked if you want in the risk rated assets, and it's much closer to the economic reality and so the risk if you want is already reflected in the weight which is put on the line which we are expanding to those conduits. And so if we have to reconsolidate them, which in <mark type="inaudible" /> in fact.</p>

          <p>Please ask your questions one-by-one in order to allow the speakers to answer them. We'll take our next question from Peter Testa from One Investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. I have two questions, please. The first one is when you look at the other activities line without the private equity gains and so on, obviously it's a less positive result and pretty negative result. I was wondering if you could give us some thoughts of you as to how we should look at this line going forward, given the less brilliant market for private equity whether there are any risks of write-offs. The first question and then one more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; concerning the corporate center, we have &#x2013; in fact, this year, we have no capital gain at all. And in this quarter and the first quarter, we had a significant amount of capital gains precisely. So, it &#x2013; the results of this corporate center has been relatively volatile in the past due to this level of capital gains which, of course, are not smoothed out in the &#x2013; well and come when they come. So, in the first quarter, we had the sale of the <mark type="inaudible" /> stakes, for example, which had bought a significant amount. This quarter, we have completely nothing, I would say. And so, it's a low level. That's what I can say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Quickly, just going forward, the extent to which when you look at the possibility for gains, do you expect this line &#x2013; the headquarter line to grow at a lower rate than in the past? Do you think there is risk of write-offs in the private equity book or is it fairly safe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it is difficult, well, I am not sure I completely understood your question. But it's difficult to give you any guidance on what is the kind of normal level for that. It moves around zero, I would say, depending on the quarter and depending on the level of capital gains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is, is there the opportunity to realize gains in the same way as in the past? Is there risk in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would tend to say that given the current level of the stock exchange, we have less opportunities to realize that gain at the moment, yet. So, you shouldn't expect a huge amount of capital gain in the near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The other question I had is a very general question. Just looking at the cost income ratio, just could you give your thoughts and views as to what sort of climate or environment is necessary to bring the cost income ratio back below 60% please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question relates to <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Relates to Group as a whole. Slide six, you talked about having your share implied as a cost income ratio trend <mark type="inaudible" /> in Q2. And it's really been looking on a group-wide basis to bring that ratio back below 60%. What sort of environment do you think we need? Do you think we need a improving environment and the write-offs, just your view and comment please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the Group cost income ratio, the commentary <mark type="inaudible" /> should be distinguishing between recent activities and CIB activities. And as regard with CIB cost income ratio, we still have the objective of running CIB platform at a 60% cost income ratio and below 60%. Certainly, as I said in the first quarter of this year, you can't be sure of the <mark type="inaudible" /> 72.3% and then back into 67.8, so we're still fairly above 60%. I think that it will be &#x2013; in this &#x2013; in the present kind of environment, it would be challenging to get back to 60% rapidly. To do that, in my view we would have to somehow cut costs in a manner of the CIB platform that would, well, that would endanger the ability of our platform or the security of operating the platform. And we all know that from an operation risk perspective, from control perspective, we need to keep the platform in good shape. So, I think that we want to get back to 60% and certainly below 60% for the CIB platform that we &#x2013; I don't see it's going to be, well, in the next quarter or in the near future.</p>
          <p>As regard the rest of the Group, yes, well &#x2013; and then regarding the rest of the Group, as regard the retail cost income ratio, we want to continue to progressively improve the cost income ratio of our France retail banking operations, certainly at BNL. And, well, IRS, there the cost income ratio, if we look at the cost income ratio at BancWest is I think fairly competitive. So, overall, you should continue to progressively improve it on the retail part.</p>
          <p>As for the last division, which is Asset Management Services, the cost income ratio for AMS at BNP Paribas is altogether fairly competitive. So, I think that the improvement on CIB on one side, which will be progressive, and the continuous improvement of retail banking cost income on the other side should contribute to a lowering of the cost income ratio. That will come progressively, but excluding, but thirdly that depends also on the kind of environment in which we will live in the next two quarters, which is somehow difficult to predict today precisely. That's my comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then the last thing, just a comment &#x2013; it was really just congratulations on the credit quality and what you have done there. I know you can tell from questions that people are somewhat almost amazed, but it's very good. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question from Guillaume Tiberghien from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Guillaume Tiberghien at Credit Suisse. I've got three questions. One relates to the slide 26 where you show the risk-weighted assets for the Group with the flow impact and before the flow impact. If I compare the Q2 with the Q1, not the Q4, the risk-weighted assets before the flow are going up 23 billion, but after the flow, they are going up by 13 billion. So I just wanted to know why there is 9 billion of difference.</p>
          <p>The second question relates to the drawdown of credit line. I think you highlighted that there is a pickup in the drawdown rate of credit line. Is it something &#x2013; can you give us a bit of flavor as to how much gets drawn usually, how much more is being drawn at the moment and what we should expect going forward?</p>
          <p>And finally, on BancWest, you say that the revenues are growing at 14% year-on-year. But if you actually look at Bank of the West and First Hawaiian, they are growing at Bank of the West at 6 and First Hawaiian at 12. I know there are some consolidation impacts. Could you just elaborate, because it seems a bit of a big difference between the two. Thank you,</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the risk-weighted assets, well it's &#x2013; congratulations. It's an interesting question. It means that the risk-weighted assets before the flow they've <mark type="inaudible" /> risk-weighted assets have increased faster than the <mark type="inaudible" /> risk-weighted assets, which are affected in the 90% flow we are planning. And this is an interesting evidence of the prosecutality of Basel II in fact. And we have &#x2013; if you remember when we started the beginning of the year, we said we want to see during the year how the Basel II ratio is evolving and the risk &#x2013; the Basel II risk-weighted assets are evolving and what is exactly the magnitude of the prosecutality of Basel II. And we have here a case where in the kind of, well, a quarter which had been a quarter of kind of crisis. Basel II, there has been an impact on the Basel II risk-weighted assets. So, it's interesting to see how it will evolve in the future and to which extent it will continue on up front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On BancWest, just to give you a quick answer, there are several differences between the U.S. GAAP and the International Accounting Standards. But one difference that is worth noting, which is that in group accounts, recurring cost of acquisitions and goodwill are booked in the corporate <mark type="inaudible" /> In U.S. GAAP, you have this impact in the Bank of the West itself. So, it induces a difference, which is significant. But in the end, what is interesting for BNP Paribas is the way we see Bank of the West &#x2013; BancWest, based on the International Accounting Standards. That's why we are very often a little bit baffled to reconcile the U.S. standards published by the banks and our camp. But you can rely on the International Accounting Standards. No problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I think to the other question regarding what happened with the growing of <mark type="inaudible" /> facilities, I think the best I can say, to repeat, to say that what we've seen in CIB is only a 1% increase in the rate of growing, if I may say. And in French Retail a 2% increase. So basically, it's another way to say that we haven't seen any significant pattern of structural change in the way the last corporates have been growing on their lines in the last few quarters. So, I think that the -</p>

          <p>Next question from Pascal Decque from Natixis Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Pascal Decque, Natixis Securities I have a few questions please. I wanted to know if you participated the commentation process that took place between SCA and Merrill Lynch and others, which we don't know the name. Second, this is very marginal, but I was a little bit curious of the increase in depreciation for Equipment Solutions, if it was linked to  <mark type="inaudible" /> and the original value story? Then in <mark type="inaudible" />, I was a little bit impressed by the growth in the loan book SMEs. It's a bit contradictory with the signals we have from the economy. And I wanted to &#x2013; don't know if you could give us a few information on the quality of the portfolio and the margin of the new prediction. And lastly, I'm sorry, this is probably the third or the fourth time I'm asking the question, what about the end of the FIN domestic story? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can start by the last one because it's the easiest one to answer to. I always expect that the problem will solved by the end of the year, but who knows. The arbitration process is still going on. It's not &#x2013; specifically, <mark type="inaudible" /> and I don't expect any significant change during the summer time. Your second question, if I understood it correctly, it was related to the Equipment Solutions Division?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question is the growth in SME lending in the French Retail. The 20% growth in SME lending. I think the answer is we have seen the actually 26 &#x2013; we are now being 27 business corporate centers of BNP Paribas in the French SME market being very effective and we are &#x2013; we have been certainly looking carefully at those. As you mentioned, the quality and the spread at which this new lending has been realized and we have been satisfied with both the quality and the spread. Getting to the Equipment Solutions, I think that was your second question, on Equipment Solutions, the question relates to the sum out one-off exceptional provisions that we've mentioned, prices of the second hand vehicles, I didn't get the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did your question relate to the revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or to the cost of risk for Equipment Solutions in this second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To the cost of risk, and absolutely was it linked to result value in</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think regarding the cost of risk we have had two or three exceptional corporate files to provision and which should really be considered as one off. I think that certainly &#x2013; it doesn't give the figures &#x2013; the cost of risk of this quarter for Equipment Solutions shouldn't be taken as an online basis for cost of risk. And as regard the monoliners, if I understand your question, the question was whether BNP Paribas was involved in any communication regarding those monoliners at this point of time. And the answer is to that is no, because we are not such a big counter player in any of the present monoliners discussing communication to have already been involved in such discussions at that counter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey good afternoon everyone. The first question regarding the question that you made about Spain, can you explain where it is coming from and is it a one-off? And the second element was, have &#x2013; I would like to have a little bit of feedback about your views about external growth. At the beginning of the year you mentioned that it was mainly Europe and Eastern Europe and I just wanted to check if it was clear, still the same?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure &#x2013; can you repeat the second question, I'm not sure I understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question was about the external growth. You mentioned at the beginning of the year, at the time of your full year presentation that you're looking to potential acquisition in Europe or Eastern Europe. I was just checking if it was still your target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer the second question. As regard acquisition, I think clearly at this point of time we at Group management concentrate on organic growth. Why? Because as we are seeing the reinforced position of BNP Paribas, both in terms of brand, funding and overall attractiveness of the BNP Paribas brand to consumers in most of our businesses creates not a unique, but a strong window of opportunity to the organic growth, which certainly in terms of. Well, with organic growths you have no goodwill and with organic growth, I think its better than external growth if you can, if you can do it. So we will concentrate on that.</p>
          <p>Apart from that, regarding acquisitions we've lately done two acquisitions and only two &#x2013; one which was the prime brokerage of Bank of America, I think we did it quite in line with our stated strategy that within CIB, we would never make a large acquisition for CIB, because we don't want that and we would only make some bolt-on acquisition to complement some key franchises and certainly acquiring the prime brokerage of BOA was very well complementing our equity platforms into the U.S. market. We were convinced that we couldn't get into prime brokerage and <mark type="inaudible" /> operation that we needed to acquire. And because we were the only left buyer of the Bank of America, I think we got a good price. So that was a good opportunistic move and I'm very pleased after a few weeks on how goes the stuff and the 550 hedge funds consumers of that prime brokerage operates in U.S. respond to the new BNP Paribas owner of the business.</p>
          <p>And then you have got as well 35% stake in this Dutch private bank with its strong brand and that will compliment our current banking platform in Holland. And so you &#x2013; I think that, apart from that, for the moment as I said we are going to concentrate on organic growth. Our priority in terms of geography, in terms of business and our criteria, strict criteria in terms of financial criteria and execution risks for acquisitions hasn't changed. And if anything, I think, in this kind of environment we should remain very, very strict on how we look at potential acquisitions. Regarding your other question....</p>

          <p>Okay. So, you know we say that we had an increase by &#x20AC;37 million, I can give you a slip of this increase, 10 million is related to the mortgage business and the remaining is coming from the consumer finance business. Well, clearly we changed &#x2013; we have changed our scope threshold. We are importing the collection team in order to &#x2013; so that we can maintain the constant risk at a decent level but I cannot tell you that the problem is completely over, I think that Spain is in a difficult shape currently. So, well, it's something which is under scrutiny and I that It's something which will be sold probably very quickly but I cannot tell you the problem is completely over for the time being.</p>
