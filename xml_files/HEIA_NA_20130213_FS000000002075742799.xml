        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Heineken's 2012 full-year results. I'm joined by Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois van Boxmeer, CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board; and Ren&#xE9; Hooft Graafland, CFO and Member of the Executive Board. Following prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.</p>
          <p>So, let me now turn the call over to Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>A very good morning to everybody, and let me immediately jump to the presentation and go for slide four on your screens. Let me start by saying that 2012 was a very exciting year for Heineken with significant strategic and operational progress being made in a challenging environment. And during the year, we further transformed our exposure to higher growth markets through acquiring full control of APB and APIPL. This has secured direct access to the highly attractive beer markets in Southeast Asia, where we are the market leader, and China, where we will have a single focus on the international premium segment with the Heineken and Tiger brands.</p>
          <p>In 2012, Heineken's revenue was up 7.4% with an EBIT (beia) growing 8% and diluted EPS (beia) rising 8.9%. On an organic basis, EBIT (beia) was broadly in line owing to higher input costs and upfront capability-building investments as we have announced earlier.</p>
          <p>The benefit of continued brand investment is demonstrated with the Heineken brand growing 5.3%, once again ahead of international premium segment. The Heineken brand achieved growth in every region, maintaining its global segment leadership. Innovation was again a key driver for Heineken's growth in 2012, reaching 5.3% of total sales in 2012 from 4.1% in 2011.</p>
          <p>And during 2012, we grew global market share with gains across several of our key markets including Mexico, Nigeria, Vietnam, France, Russia, the UK and the U.S. Profitability continues to be underpinned by our wide-ranging TCM2 program, which in its first year contributed cost savings of &#x20AC;196 million, and this leaves us well on track towards achieving our revised target of &#x20AC;525 million by the end of 2014.</p>
          <p>So, let me now turn to the next slide. In 2012, we sustained our top-line growth momentum with organic revenue growth in four regions with Western Europe stable. This growth was led by the Africa and Middle East region with organic revenue up 12%, following strong gains across many key markets. In Nigeria, despite market growth moderating in 2012 due to local inflationary pressures, investment behind our brands and new capacity resulted in higher market share.</p>
          <p>In Central Eastern Europe, group beer volume grew 3.8% organically led by Russia, Poland, Romania and Austria and partly offset by lower volume in Greece. We're pleased with improved performance in Russia, resulting in a market share gain of 170 basis points to 13.4% at the end of 2012 based on production volume.</p>
          <p>Organically, regional EBIT (beia) grew marginally with strong improvement in profitability in the second half of the year. We will focus on driving continued profit improvement across the region through brand investment, pricing initiatives and leveraging regional scale across innovations.</p>
          <p>In the Americas now, revenue and EBIT (beia) were both up 8% organically, led by another strong operating performance in Mexico. In the U.S., depletions were up 2% reflecting an improved volume trend for the Heineken brand and accelerated growth of the Mexican brand portfolio. Our premium strategy in Brazil supported the Heineken brand growth of over 40%.</p>
          <p>Then in Western Europe, the regional volume performance was resilient amidst the challenging economic backdrop. Organic revenue was in line with last year, with lower volume offset by higher pricing. Profitability was adversely impacted by less spending in the on-trade channel and higher input cost. However, the success of our marketing programs and innovations supported market share gains in the UK, France, Ireland and Belgium.</p>
          <p>In the Asia Pacific region, group beer grew by 6% organically, reflecting solid performances in Vietnam, Indonesia, South Korea and our joint venture in India.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to slide six. At the beginning of last year, I shared with you five key business priorities that will define Heineken's future success and drive sustainable business growth. I'm pleased with the significant progress we have made on each of these in 2012. A few of the initiatives we have undertaken are highlighted on the slide, and I will further expand on some of these shortly.</p>
          <p>As a result of this progress today, we are better positioned to fully exploit our unique brand portfolio, further leverage our global scale and continue to win in a marketplace with customers and, most important, consumers.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, Heineken volume continues to &#x2013; in the premium segment, grew 5.3% organically, again, outperforming the overall beer market and the international premium segment. The largest contribution to growth came from the U.S., France, Russia, Nigeria, China, Brazil and Mexico. We continue to witness an improving trend in the U.S. from the Heineken brand with depletion or sales directly to retailers for Heineken regular, in line with last year.</p>
          <p>Globally, we improved the brand equity of Heineken, following the success of the Open Your World campaign. This was further reinforced by our sponsorship and activation of the Skyfall film which generated strong brand awareness, Skyfall, James Bond.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide eight, on innovations, we want to win as a consumer-inspired, customer-oriented brand-led company to continue delivering sustainable top-line growth. In 2012, innovation contributed &#x20AC;1 billion of revenue. The innovation rate increased to 5.3% from 4.1% last year, and we are well on track towards achieving our target of 6% of annual revenues by 2020.</p>
          <p>The high rate in 2012 reflects a successful rollout of both local and global brand innovations. Our Radler flavored beers, a mix of beer and natural fruit juice, were launched into further eight markets in Central and Eastern Europe. Radlers are now available in 12 markets in Central and Eastern Europe and reached 1.5 million hectoliters, with volume more than doubling over the past year.</p>
          <p>Our Desperados global priority brand grew 15% while Sol in the premium segment grew 10%.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide nine, following completion of the acquisition of APB last year, our attention has now turned to realizing the significant future growth in APB's markets. Our integration efforts are focused on aligning APB's systems, policies and IT infrastructure into Heineken. At the same time, our current businesses in Asia will be operationally integrated into APB's organization to create one single regional platform.</p>
          <p>Roland Pirmez, currently CEO of APB, will combine his role with that of President, Asia Pacific, and will also join Heineken's executive committee, as was previously announced. We believe that the faster and more aligned decision-making process that will result from the above initiatives will help us better realize the growth potential in this region. Theo de Rond, current region president for Asia Pacific will return to Amsterdam by midyear to take up a new role as the Executive Director, Partnerships, where he will represent Heineken of the boards of existing operations in Thailand, Indonesia, Japan and Indonesia. The integration process is expected to be completed by June this year.</p>
          <p>APB further extends Heineken's emerging market reach, thereby enhancing the company's future growth profile. On a pro forma 2012 basis, emerging markets now represent around two-thirds of consolidated beer volume and just under 60% of EBITDA (beia). In addition, around 45% of the total Heineken brand volume is sold in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Now turning on slide 10, with an update on Mexico, our largest market. Mexico continues to benefit from strong underlying economic growth and favorable demographics during the year. We continue to implement our value growth strategy in the country, delivering strong profit growth. This reflects the benefit of higher pricing, positive operational leverage and ongoing cost savings.</p>
          <p>Beer volume grew in the mid-single digits with revenue growing twice as fast and EBIT growing around four times ahead of the volume, as you can see from the chart. The solid volume performance was driven by the Tecate brand franchise and accelerated growth of the Dos Equis brand in Mexico. The Heineken brand continued its strong growth from a low base, supported by targeted outlet expansion and strong activation progress and grew overall volume and value share in Mexico in 2012, driven by increased distribution and strong execution of our commercial plants.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to the last slide of my bit of presentation. It's the 2013 outlook. In 2013, we expect continued top-line growth momentum, as revenue growth in Africa, Latin America and Asia is expected to more than offset volume weakness in Europe, which continues to be affected as we all know by economic uncertainty and government austerity measures. Despite the lower expected volumes, particularly in Western Europe, we will continue to look for opportunities to drive, improve price and sales mix in the region in line with our value focused strategy.</p>
          <p>Now, with regards to input costs, we expect the rate of inflation to moderate compared to the significant pressures we endured in 2012, resulting in a slight increase versus last year. Of course, we will continue to focus on supporting top-line growth and will therefore maintain a broadly stable level of marketing investments as a percentage of revenue.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, we will continue to prioritize our investments towards higher growth markets, adding new capacity and commercial assets to support top-line growth. In addition, part of the increased capital expenditures spend in 2012 of around &#x20AC;1.5 billion will reflect the consolidation of APB. Finally, the acquisition of APB is expected to be marginally EPS accretive in 2013, adding a couple of cents to the earnings per share.</p>
          <p>With that, let me now hand over the call to Ren&#xE9;.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, and good morning, everybody. Let me take you through the key financial highlights of the 2012 results. In 2012, we achieved a solid top and bottom line performance with revenues up 3.9% organically and EPS (beia) on a diluted basis growing 8.9% to &#x20AC;2.94. And this was achieved despite the higher expenses related to continued upfront investments in business capability building.</p>
          <p>EBIT (beia) grew 8%, reflecting a positive contribution from consolidation and currency movements. On an organic basis, EBIT (beia) was 0.5% lower, the drivers of which I will explain you shortly. Reported net profit growth more than doubled in the year to &#x20AC;2.9 billion. This includes a post-tax revaluation gain of &#x20AC;1.5 billion related to the acquisition of APB and APIPL.</p>
          <p>Free operating cash flow of &#x20AC;1.5 billion was lower than in 2011, mainly reflecting the increased capital investments in higher-growth countries to fully capture the future growth potential of these markets. The net debt to EBITDA ratio increased to 2.8 times due to the higher net debt position from new financing related to the acquisition of APB.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the drivers of our revenue and EBIT performance. Revenue on a reported basis was up 7.4%, and this includes favorable currency effect of 1.5% and positive consolidation impact of 2%. Organically, revenue grew &#x2013; revenue growth of 3.9% is made up of total consolidated volume growth of 1.5% and higher revenues per hectoliter of 2.4%. And this 2.4% is net of negative country mix effect of 0.6%.</p>
          <p>This mainly reflects the benefits of higher pricing in Africa, Western Europe and the Americas and a positive sales mix from continued growth of the Heineken brand and margin enhancing innovation. EBIT (beia) grew 8% with a positive consolidation impact of 6.1% mainly related to the acquisition of APB and the Galaxy Pub Estate in UK.</p>
          <p>Favorably currency movements added further 2.4%. EBIT (beia) was 0.5% lower organically, as higher revenues and realized cost savings were offset by increased input cost of 8% per hectoliter and the upfront capability building cost in the global business services, commerce, and supply chain functions. A large portion of this capability building cost are reported in the head office or in the head office and elimination contributing to &#x20AC;58 million organic decline in EBIT (beia) in this region.</p>
          <p>By the end of 2013, we expect this reporting region to reach profit breakeven as operating companies are charged for the activities undertaken by the global functions at the center. The related cost will be incurred by operating companies with around half expected to be recognized in Western European region and the balance primarily in Central and Eastern Europe and the Americas regions.</p>
          <p>Net profit was up 7.1% while organically net profit (beia) grew 1.6%. This organic performance mainly reflects lower effective tax rate, a decrease in interest cost and higher dividend income. The increase in diluted EPS of 8.9% is made up of higher organic net profits, gross positive consolidation and favorable currency impact, and lower overall weighted average number of shares following the completion of the ASDI program in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Over the last three years, diluted EPS has grown at an average rate of 11%, reaching &#x20AC;2.94 in 2012, reflecting significant growth of the business. At the start of the year, we announced our three-year TCM, total cost management program, targeting pre-tax cost savings of &#x20AC;500 million. We have increased this target to &#x20AC;525 million following the identification of &#x20AC;25 million of cost synergies under the APB integration which will be &#x2013; which we will report under TCM2.</p>
          <p>In the first year of this TCM program, we realized &#x20AC;196 million of pre-tax savings. At the functional level, 60% of these savings came from supply chain, while at the regional level Europe contributed 62% of the savings. Around two thirds of the overall savings were realized in fixed cost spend areas across supply chain, commerce, wholesale and global support functions. This follows a reduction in employee numbers in Europe and productivity improvements across our breweries. The balance of variable cost savings has been achieved &#x2013; primarily achieved in the logistic and product-related spend areas secured by our newly formed Heineken procurement group.</p>
          <p>We remain committed to investing ahead of the growth curve in high-growth markets. In 2012, we increased capital expenditure by &#x20AC;400 million to &#x20AC;1.2 billion. Nearly three-quarters of this investment was directed towards emerging markets. This includes capacity expansion in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Rwanda, the DRC and Brazil. And we also invested in expanding and upgrading of our returnable bottle fleet in Nigeria and Mexico. In 2013, we will further increase capital expenditure to &#x20AC;1.5 billion, partly reflecting the consolidation of APB and the continued investment in high-growth markets.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on strong cash flow generation. Over the past five years, we have grown cash flow from operations by around 80% to &#x20AC;3.5 billion, again demonstrating the step change in the skill of our business. Free operating cash flow in 2012 of &#x20AC;1.5 billion represented a cash conversion ratio of 80%. And this cash flow compares to the &#x20AC;2.1 billion last year. The decrease in free operating cash flow can be mainly explained by the higher level of capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>We expect our cash conversion ratio to be low &#x2013; to be below 100% again in 2013 due to the increased capital investments, as I already mentioned earlier. Despite this, we expect cash flow generation from operations to remain strong, further reducing the level of net debt in 2013 and returning to a net debt to EBITDA ratio of below 2.5 times by the end of 2014.</p>
          <p>During the year, we successfully issued a total of nine bonds amounting to &#x20AC;3.1 billion and $4 billion at very low coupons. The maturity on these bonds ranges from 3 to 30 years, resulting in a well-spread debt maturity profile.</p>
          <p>Let me now briefly discuss the pro forma 2012 financials for the combined APB and APIPL businesses which are consolidated in Heineken's results as of the 15th of November of last year. Assuming the acquisition had occurred on the 1st of January 2012, the 12-months pro forma 2012 revenue and EBIT (beia) for APB and APIPL would have been or would have amounted to &#x20AC;1.7 billion for the revenue and the pro forma EBIT (beia) would have been &#x20AC;425 million.</p>
          <p>The incremental EBIT (beia) contribution from APB and APIPL to Heineken's results in 2012, on a pro forma basis, would have been &#x20AC;239 million. This is calculated by subtracting the following from the pro forma EBIT of &#x20AC;425 million from the acquired businesses. First, you subtract Heineken's share of net profit in APB and APIPL of &#x20AC;93 million, which was prior to the consolidation and which is already included in the Heineken's 2012 EBIT figures. Secondly, you should subtract also another &#x20AC;93 million contribution from the acquired businesses for the period 15th of November to the end of December as this is also already included in Heineken's 2012 results.</p>
          <p>Now, let me summarize. Overall, we are very pleased with the significant progress we have made in 2012. Effective brand marketing and successful innovation continues to drive solid top-line growth momentum. The Heineken brand continues to outperform the global beer market and the international premium segment and improve &#x2013; and we improved global brand equity. Our TCM2 cost-savings program and capability-building investments are expected to deliver further cost savings for the business.</p>
          <p>Further, the acquisition of APB provides direct access to a number of important beer markets in Southeast Asia and China. Although we continue to experience a challenging economic environment in Europe, our well-diversified emerging market footprint provides a solid platform for growth to support long-term value creation for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>On that note, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator, could you open the line, please?</p>

          <p>Thank you sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question is from Lauren Torres from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I was hoping if you could talk a little bit more about your largest market, Mexico. It seems like there's good momentum there. You made improvements on the distribution side, but just curious on your outlook for this year with respect to the environment. Pricing opportunities, if you could maintain that mid-single-digit volume growth that you mentioned for last year. And also, an update on the cost savings, if most of that upside is realized or there's more benefits coming on the cost end? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have been benefiting from a strong economy, pricing and volume growth. So, overall, our volume has been growing slightly ahead of our revenues in the competitive game, but we have been gaining absolutely share in Mexico so an excellent performance.</p>
          <p>The very noteworthy part of it is the increase of the franchise of Tecate. Tecate regular and light altogether has been growing double-digit in the country over the last year, as well as a very strong and solid performance of the Dos Equis brand.</p>
          <p>Now, we don't give you a forward look on how 2013 is going to pan out in Mexico in particular, but our position is good, and we have still some cost-saving measures to be taken in there. But one has to realize that all factored in, in the TCM2 program, that we are absolutely on track to realize that. That is what I can say about Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then maybe one thing to clarify because I'm not sure if that was clear. Revenue is growing ahead of volumes, and not the other way round. So &#x2013; and that's on the slides, well, well explained.</p>

          <p>On cost savings, as you have seen, we started the TCM2 program well with &#x20AC;196 million savings, two-thirds in fixed costs, one-third on the variable part. Going forward, we are committed to deliver on our promises which now including APB is the &#x20AC;525 million for the three-year time period. And as you can imagine, the contribution of GBS over time will increase while other parts will decrease, but we are pretty well on track with the overall program.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Samar Chand from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Three questions if I can, please. The first one, I'm just trying to understand the volume &#x2013; the underlying volume trend in Western Europe. So, can we please have some color on how you've seen year-to-date trading? And then also specifically for the French market, you said that excluding the excise build, you were flat for the full year. So, I was just trying to work out what your underlying rate was for Q4 in France?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the pro forma number that you've disclosed for APB, the &#x20AC;425 million. Given what you did last year, that implies barely any growth for the second half in the APB business. So, Ren&#xE9;, can you just please give us color on what's happened in the second half for APB?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, if I'm right in the release, it looks like you need to include an expense of about &#x20AC;99 million for the IAS 19 on the pension side of things. Should that be an expense that we assume for our 2013 forecast and 2014? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll take the questions in the reverse order to start with the pensions. Indeed, there is a different IFRS regulation, and the impact of that will be &#x20AC;99 million. So, additional cost, &#x20AC;31 million will be in EBIT, and &#x20AC;68 million will be in other net financing costs, together &#x20AC;99 million. What we will do is we will restate the 2012 figures to make 2013 comparable with 2012, because this is an accounting change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we cannot give you &#x2013; you should not see that as a forecast for 2013 and 2014, because that will depend strongly on the interest rates.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is the effect in 2012. Then, you well spotted the development within APB where the growth in the first half was different from the growth in the second half. When you look at the revenue growth, you see that the business performance was much more balanced, and here you see also on the revenue level a strong growth in the second half. So, it has very much to do with a number of cost factors, the accruals for the phantom share scheme over the different years. There was a big, big accrual in the first half of 2011. So, there, the development in the first half of 2012 was benefiting from and there was again an accrual in the second half of 2012 which did the opposite.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we report here from Singapore dollars back into euros, but obviously in APB, you see the different currencies. Going forward, we can single that out. Here, the currency effect, for instance, the Vietnamese dong down to the Singapore dollar is taken operationally and not singled out, and there you see a different development in the first half and the second half.</p>
          <p>So, overall, you see that from a top-line perspective, the second half was continuing to grow. From a bottom-line perspective, you see a slowdown. But there are a number of specific elements causing that, so that is not a cause for any concern.</p>
          <p>Then on Europe...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And we estimate that this 250,000 hectoliters which we benefited from France. And as we say, I think somewhere in the release, we had an opposite effect in Finland where we stopped the business, some non-value adding business in Finland. But so, there is loading and you will see that opposite trend, obviously, in France in the beginning of this year, apart from what the effect of the excise increase fundamentally will do to the French market. And there, it's early days to say. But if you look at the huge price increases as a result of the 160% excise increase, you can expect that that market will be under real pressure.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, Ren&#xE9;. Just two questions, please. First of all on Spain, in Q4, you said that the volumes were down mid-single digits. Is it a start of the trend or should we expect this fall for 2013, bare any one-offs in this number?</p>
          <p>And second question is on your input cost guidance for 2013, how much of this is actually hedged and how confident are you that you will not have to increase or to at least change this guidance for the year like you did in 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Spain, Q4 was weak and Spain has held up very well in the last couple of years despite all the weak economy. But beer is relative affordable and going to the pub and have some tapas and beer, it's continuing to be a habit in Spain. However, we saw in Q4 a slowdown. We thought it was good to mention it. Is that the new trend? We don't know. But obviously, we are very cautious about what is happening in Spain. And because country already saw many years in economic decline, a country, which saw such a high unemployment rates, yes, you wonder how that market will further behave.</p>
          <p>Having said that and that applies to the whole of Europe, that doesn't mean that we don't invest behind our brands, that we don't launch new innovations. We stay active in these markets, because overall, Europe is a big profit pool.</p>
          <p>Concerning the input costs, yes, luckily, 2013 won't be a year like 2012. So, input costs will be less of an issue. We guided you to a very slight increase. We can do that comfortably because we have covered a lot of the &#x2013; all of our needs as well in volumes as in price. Obviously, there can be some fluctuations but we are practically sure on this guidance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I guess just to get a little bit more color around the input costs, it sounds like you're fully hedged but I just wonder, how does that look across all the different inputs, barley versus packaging? And does it vary much by region or is that a similar guidance across all the regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, it differs a bit on the different categories. You have some pluses and minuses but, overall, the guidance is as we have given it. And also, the effect on the regions will be slightly different, but it's not a major factor in 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to be clear, when you talk about a slight increase, I mean this is certainly less than mid-single digits. I'm reading this as a 1% to 2% type increase.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good. I'm glad we're on the same page. If I could just ask a follow-up just around really disposals, I mean, we've probably seen a slightly more proactive stance towards disposing assets like <mark type="inaudible" /> and obviously you're looking at Finland. Is this something we should expect to continue going forward or are those really sort of one-off-type reviews?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have to see it as a one-off view. We don't have a lot of businesses which are not really core. So, it's able to assess whether a business which is not totally focused on beer is strategic for the market we operate, whether the market is strategic and making a call. So, you don't have to see it as a very broad strategic review, but on Europe, where the market is highly competitive, we are reviewing these kind of positions in that light.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I have a couple of questions, please. One, if you could provide a bit more color on the substantial recovery in profitability in Central and Eastern Europe in the second half, which you achieved in obviously difficult input cost environment. You mentioned profit in Russia and Romania being up, not Poland. So, if you could sort of say what sort of differences there are there between what's going on in Romania and Poland in terms of profit, and whether there any sort of specific or one-off factors which may have impacted the performance?</p>
          <p>Then on Africa, Middle East. Nigeria had a relatively soft second half but it looks as if the government may not be further reducing the fuel subsidy. So, on this basis, what's your sort of view on how 2013 should be in this &#x2013; in Nigeria?</p>
          <p>And the last thing on the DRC where there's obviously some fighting going on in the Goma area. You mentioned that the DRC was down. What's the sort of &#x2013; how do you expect that to pan out? And if you could remind us how big it is approximately in terms of profit for the region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take it in the reverse order. DRC, yes, the difficult &#x2013; well, the war climate that we have at the northeastern part of the country is not helping our business, obviously. It's a very &#x2013; DRC is a very difficult environment to operate in lately, and it will continue to do so. So, that's perhaps a little bit of a weak spot in Africa, though long term, this remains very highly populated, densely populated country, and we see that as long term still promising. This is a country which makes profit. So, there is no &#x2013; and the relative importance to Africa is not of that size that it kind of impacts the results in any fairly significant way.</p>
          <p>On your question on Nigeria, difficult to say. We &#x2013; if you look at Nigeria over the last past 10 years, it has been a trend of growing, and from time to time, the speed of that growth goes up and down a little bit but the trend is positive. So, we take it for that in Nigeria. Our outlook is obviously positive. But from time to time, you have some inflationary spending or cutting the public spending or security issues, which might impact from time to time for a short while the growth that you are observing. But long term, we remain absolutely optimistic about the potential of Nigeria.</p>
          <p>And then your last question was on Central and Eastern Europe, yes, a much better H2 than H1. That has to do with better pricing across the region, also lower costs, and a few costs where you'll have a bit the shift between H1 and H2. So, H1, as we said before, was a bit more negative than it really was and H2 a bit more positive but, overall, the year gives a good reflection.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, all. For me, a question related to Asia. A bit more an update on Taiwan, how is the Heineken brand progressing there? And the second is you're quite optimistic on keeping the A&amp;P spending flat in 2013 compared to 2012 which was down about 60 basis points. Is that basically because you don't see any further synergies in that spending or you expect basically that there is still synergies but that the underlying spending is actually going to go up? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've a one big question and one small question. The big question is about the A&amp;P spendings. As a percentage of our revenue, it stays stable but our revenue is increasing, so the spendings are increasing. It's not that much the quantity of the spendings you unleash at the market than, well, the quality. And so, for us, it's a game of quantity.</p>
          <p>We think that at the current level of spendings, and we gave that in our outlooks, we feel comfortable that we can do what we want to do, i.e., nurture our key global brands and our key local brands, as well as continuing to invest in innovation as to attain the 6% of revenue in innovation that we target. This is a virtual circle. And with the kind of level of spending in terms of our revenues that we're currently spending, we feel comfortable that we can get there. That is the guidance we gave to clarify.</p>
          <p>And Taiwan, I don't...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Taiwan, the Heineken brands after many years of very strong growth was more or less stable, felt some pressure from the fruit beers which are at a high pricing premium level introduced in Taiwan. Taiwan is clearly a market where we have to be very sure not to overstretch the brands. We have a very strong position there, and we are continuing to invest to keep it there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Chris Pitcher from Redburn. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Good morning. Some follow-up questions on APB please. You've mentioned that the step-up in CapEx to &#x20AC;1.5 billion is largely due to APB. If we assume &#x20AC;200 million of the &#x20AC;300 million uplift for APB, that's twice the level of CapEx that the business has been currently putting into the business. I mean is this a level that you'll need to sustain for quite some period of time? It looks to be roughly twice the level of depreciation.</p>
          <p>And then as a follow-on from that, the &#x20AC;25 million of cost savings for APB imply about 150 basis points of margin uplift, but given increased investment, would it be imprudent to assume margin growth in APB in the short term? And a final point on APB, I don't know if you did before but the percentage of net sales that would be sales and marketing in APB relative to the group, just to give a feel for what the APB effect within your sales and marketing guidance would be? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the CapEx, you'll have to realize that not all the APB and APIPL businesses were in APB. Mainly, China is separate. So, therefore, you will see a different &#x2013; a different amount. But it also reflects the ambitions and the growth which is there in Asia, which needs &#x2013; or which asks for these investments. So, in that sense, I always say it's good news when you need to invest more because that means that the business is growing.</p>
          <p>Relating to the A&amp;P spend, you see on average, if you calculate it on the same basis as we do that their percentage of spend is more or less in line with what we do. So, there will not be a big impact in that respect on the overall A&amp;P as a percentage of revenues.</p>
          <p>Concerning the margins, well, you have seen the margins in Asia are very high. That has to do with the very strong focus on premium brands in the portfolio. And I think the main goal in Asia is further to expand our positions and not to optimize the margins per se. I think it's more important in these fast-growing markets to make sure that you follow and drive that growth that will come with investment. You get higher depreciation, of course, and that will have some effect on margins maybe on the short term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you say short term, is doubling the rate of CapEx, whatever the exact figure, is that enough for one to two years to get your footprint to where it ought to be to meet the growth or is this an ongoing process? I remember when you bought APB, one of the comments was finally we've got one owner with one use of the cash flow. Is this somewhat of a remedial spend or is it &#x2013; I'm just trying to get a feel for how long this higher level of depreciation will keep compounding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's hope that that will be a long time, because that means that the markets continue to grow very fast.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, gents. A couple of questions from me. Firstly, on Mexico, can you talk a bit more about Q4 dynamics as your market-share gains throughout the year decelerated?</p>
          <p>And the second one on Poland, can you just give us an update on the underlying trends in that market in the second half of the year, particularly with one of your competitors <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question was about the dynamics in Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think in the previous questions we addressed that, that we have been getting some share in Mexico, that it panned out well, that we have two brands which are doing particularly well, which are Tecate and Dos Equis. But also, the Heineken brand is growing nicely. So, we have positive momentum in our Mexican business. So, we are very happy with that, and please do allow me also not to comment further. We live in a competitive world here, so that's one.</p>
          <p>The second, this &#x2013; your question about Poland. Poland isn't so far, and I'm making a general comment, it's a difficult market because price levels went down in Poland. Competitive dynamics over the last few years, this is the trend. This is not something that happened just in a few quarters. This is a trend, which we've observed already for three years.</p>
          <p>I would say the stagnation of the beer consumption has led to increased price competition and that meant &#x2013; and perhaps also the economic slowdown at some times have left this market in a general trend of down trading. And that has extracted a lot of &#x2013; or made a lot of value out of the total market as operating, I have to say. So, that has been the structural problem affecting the whole market. So, we were not immune of that.</p>
          <p>And nevertheless, we will continue to work on the portfolio of brands, and we do that in every country. We always try to, I would say, "turbocharge" the part which is above 100 in the index. That is where we concentrate on. We are famous in the world for the Heineken brand, but also by extension to building a strong brand and we try to build brands conventionally above index 100.</p>
          <p>Now, arguably, in Central and Eastern Europe where price levels are substantially lower than in Western Europe, you have to also &#x2013; on the backdrop of revenues for people who are also much lower, so that market is very competitive. In general, lowerly priced but offers in the years to come, if not a absolute growth, it offers a fair good amount of growth potential for premium brands like Heineken and other innovative propositions like Desperados, Radler extensions, et cetera.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a follow-up on the Central Eastern European region, how much of your organic margin increase in the second half of the year was a function of lower marketing spend in Russia following the restrictions for advertising there and to what extent is that margin then sustainable into 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't want to be too specific, but as what we have said, we increased profitability in Russia but that is mainly driven by the volume growth and the pricing we are taking. Yes, you may note advertise, that doesn't mean that you don't spend money in the commercial arena. So, you do it in a different way, but it doesn't mean that there is no commercial spend.</p>

Obviously, your percentage of CapEx to sales has gone up substantially &#x2013; is going up substantially relative to 2009, 2010, 2011 rates.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Give or take. And how significant is the growth rate differential, if you could &#x2013; if there's a ballpark figure we should think about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But what we said, the Heineken brands back to growth but obviously very limited, but very positive that we are back to growth with the Heineken brands. Obviously, a brand like Dos Equis, and it's the fast-growing but premium brand in the U.S.A. is growing at a much, much faster rate, and I would say, yes, 20-plus percent than obviously a brand like Tecate. That is very much driven by very successfully the efforts behind Tecate Light. But so there is an absolute different growth perspective between the Heineken brands and, for instance, brands like Dos Equis. They're in a different phase also of their development.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the CapEx relative to where we were two or three years ago versus next year and going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the &#x2013; once more, the CapEx was at that moment when we were very much at a CapEx diet, but also in a world which was not growing. We have now a different growth perspective for the company and that asks for a capital expenditure. I don't want to give any guidance further than what we do this year. And the only thing I always repeat is I would be happy to spend on CapEx, because that means that the business is growing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Karel Zoete from Rabobank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions please. The first one is on pricing and how you look at 2013 given lower input cost inflation and some difficult markets in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Sorry. Could you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, can you repeat you the question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. The first question is on pricing because &#x2013; how do you look at pricing going into 2013 given low input cost inflation and some difficult markets in Europe, but at the other end good price increases in other markets in the second half of the year. And the second question relates to working capital which seems to have deteriorated somewhat in 2012. Should we expect material improvements in 2013, for example, also within the APB part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all on pricing, as we say, we will further drive opportunities for price and mix improvements, and that will be different across the globe. And certainly, in Western Europe, it will probably be more mix than pricing. In Central and Eastern Europe, we will work hard to get &#x2013; continue to get more pricing. You see in the emerging markets with high inflation, obviously, you will go after pricing. And in the U.S., at the end of this year, we have taken in a few states some pricing, and there, we will have the full-year benefit of that next year.</p>
          <p>On working capital, if you look at the cash-flow statement, you see that there is still a contribution coming out of working capital, not as big as last year but it is still an improvement. Looking at our working capital, obviously, we will continue to try to improve that, but the big drivers of improvements are behind us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Dirk Van Vlaanderen from Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Just a question zooming in on Q4, it seems that there has been a slowdown in the organic growth rates &#x2013; revenue growth rate in Q4. And it seems to me that a lot of that has been driven by lower revenue-per-hectoliter growth on an organic basis. I was wondering if there were any specific regions or reason behind that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We see that Q4 actually was certainly not best quarter. We had stronger comparables in some regions certainly in the Americas, but overall, there is not something where you say Q4 is fundamentally different in its price mix than the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a follow-up, just on Egypt, if I may. You referenced some continuing unrest in Egypt. I was wondering if you could maybe give your thoughts as you look into 2013. Obviously, 2012 saw a good recovery in volume and profitability there. I was just wondering whether you thought that was sustainable in 2013 given some unrest continuing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Egypt recovered quite well. Obviously, it's shaken again by political circumstances. So, it's very difficult to say where it's going to land. The business is in good shape. We have been &#x2013; after the first spring, if I can call it like that, so-called spring two years ago, the business went down just because everything was halted. Tourism was also halted and it accounts for half of the revenue. What we have seen afterwards was a slow recovery but a very strong recovery essentially on the domestic market which played well, and then tourism came back marginally also. And so, we look back in 2012 from a very strong year and coming back to the levels of before 2010. So, we were quite pleased with that. It is very difficult now to say how the situation is going to pan out.</p>
          <p>What we have learned from previous crisis is to reinforce our business. We have worked on footprint. We have worked on the cost base of our business, but look, I remain confident about the sustainability of this business going forward. One has to realize that Egypt has 10% of Coptic population, which is Christian Coptic, and on the other hand, relies heavily on its tourist sector. So, our industry has a reason to exist in that country going forward. But again, I cannot give you the absolute certainty. We are watching that very closely obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Holland from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. A couple of questions. Firstly, just relating to the contribution from APB in the final six weeks of the year, if I've done the sum right, that &#x20AC;93 million represents about 22% of the annual EBIT of &#x20AC;425 million that you indicated. So, that's 22% of the EBIT coming in 12% of the year. I just wonder if you could talk through the seasonality of that business.</p>
          <p>Secondly, can you tell me what's happened to your market share in Vietnam this year, and if you possibly can put a figure on what that market share is as well as the direction?</p>
          <p>And then, thirdly in relation to China, are there any circumstances in which you would consider entering the mainstream market in China rather than just sticking with the premium end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>China, do you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me first answer the second half of the question which is China. The answer is plain no. In China, we concentrate on the premium end of the market like we do in the U.S. We have done it so far with Heineken but also Tiger, and we will concentrate on doing and developing an approach like we do in the U.S. You know our low appetite for the mainstream market in China, seeing structural overcapacity, very low prices.</p>
          <p>Margins are conventionally improving but margins on very, very low prices. So, we have been divesting all our joint ventures in the mainstream market lately and concentrating on what we call segment leadership and we don't intend to change course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the seasonality, you noted well that the fourth quarter is a strong quarter in Asia or in APB, and that is an annual thing that quarter four is strong. On the six weeks, I would not be too strict. If you start consolidating half of the month, you will have some costs which were taken in the first two weeks because they are monthly booked at the beginning, at the end. So, there, I would not take it too literal, but that Q4 is a strong quarter in Asia, that's absolutely right</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, sorry, the third question was just your market share in Vietnam. What the growth has been and what the percentage is now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The market share is over 20%. And the growth in Vietnam, do we have the full &#x2013; has been double-digits for sure. Yeah, very good growth and excellent performance of the Tiger brand. And I'm filling in the gap whilst Ren&#xE9; is looking at his numbers because with all the operations we have. But, no, very good growth in Vietnam, particularly the Tiger brand has been performing superbly in past year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operator, we'll take one more question at this time, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. The next question is Henry Davies, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I've got three questions, please. The first is on the IAS accounting changes, is that included in your coupon guidance of 4.5%? Secondly, on input inflation, you say that's excluding currency moves. Maybe just as currency stands today, is that going to be a positive or a negative? And also does that include the negative pack mix that you highlighted at the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>And lastly on Europe, if I look at the fourth quarter volumes, if I adjust out the French stocking impact and I adjust out the effect of one extra trading day, it looks like volumes are trending down 4% or so. Is that a &#x2013; do you think you can improve from that into next year? And do you &#x2013; and can you just remind us what the retail price increase you put through in France was? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all on the input cost, that is &#x2013; once more, we guide you on like-for-like so what a can or bottle, a ton of malt, et cetera, is costing and you make that balance and you see what the increase is. If we then start changing the packagings and upgrading packagings, et cetera, that will be a difference on that but that's back in revenue. So, the guidance on input cost is really a like-for-like in input cost.</p>
          <p>Your second question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was on IAS, the changes, whether that's in the coupon guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The IAS charges, is that included in your guidance for 4.5% coupon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't see what you mean by the 4.5% guidance on coupon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The 4.5% net finance charge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's other net financial cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is in other net financing cost. And the 4.5% is real on the interest line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last one is on the Europe trends in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the fourth quarter in Europe has had some one-hand influence by France. If you subtract that, you get to a lower level. The difference with the overall development in the year is a bit &#x2013; the weak fourth quarter we had in Spain which we discussed earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Trevor Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two quick questions, gentlemen. One technical. Ren&#xE9;, you talked about the IAS and the &#x20AC;99 million as the pre-tax. Will any &#x2013; will there be any tax relief on that or is that the post-tax effect likely be the same &#x20AC;99 million?</p>
          <p>And the second question more broadly, 2012 was a difficult year for margins with the TCM savings being eaten up by the input cost and GBS. But as I look forward with TCM continuing, much less input cost pressure, GBS costs flat, I'll be right in expecting that the margin volume looking much more positive for 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the IAS 19, these costs are tax-deductible, and this asset will be mainly in the UK and the Netherlands. You have to calculate with around 25% tax effect on that. Then, we don't give specific guidance on margins. You see that developments in individual countries can have a major impact, and we saw that in Central and Eastern Europe. The decline of Greece affected fundamentally the margins in Central and Eastern Europe. So, it is very difficult to give the guidance for the group, and we stay away from that at this moment in time.</p>
