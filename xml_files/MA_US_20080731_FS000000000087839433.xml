          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience, and welcome to the second quarter 2008 MasterCard Incorporated earnings conference call.  My name is Fab, and I'll be your coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fab.  And good morning to everyone, thank you for joining us today either by phone or webcast for a discussion about our second quarter 2008 financial results.  With me on the call this morning are Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tara Maguire, our Corporate Controller.</p>
          <p>Following comments by Martina, highlighting some key points about the quarter, we will open up the call for your questions.  In total, the call will last up to one hour.  This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com.  The earnings release and slide deck have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC this morning.  A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one week until August 7th.</p>
          <p>Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance.  Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today.  Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will now turn the call over to Martina Hund-Mejean.  Martina?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Barbara, and good morning everyone.  We are pleased with our overall second quarter results. And while we remain mindful of the current economic environment, our business fundamentals continue to provide a solid foundation for us to meet our business objectives for 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning to page two of the slide deck.  In the second quarter, we delivered net income of $276 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, excluding a special item related to this settlement of our antitrust litigation with American Express. Under the terms of the settlement, we will pay American Express up to a total of 1.8 billion. We recorded in the quarter, the pre-tax net present value of this liability of 1.65 billion. On an after-tax basis, the charge was just over 1 billion. While our results have been impacted by the settlement, we are pleased to have brought this issue to closure.</p>
          <p>Including the special item, we recorded a net loss of $747 million, or a loss of $5.74 per diluted share. Net revenue totaled 1.2 billion, up 25% over the comparable period last year. This was driven primarily by strong growth in worldwide GDV and process transactions as well as cross-border volumes, which grew 18.9%. Additionally, pricing changes contributed approximately 5 percentage points of the revenue growth in the quarter. Currency fluctuations also represented 5.4 percentage points of this growth. Finally, demonstrating the continued leveragability of our business model, we saw our operating margin improve 6.1 percentage points to 33.4% from 27.3% in the second quarter of 2007, excluding special items.</p>
          <p>Before getting into the detailed financial results, let me just step back a minute and talk about what we are seeing across our business and the economic environment, both here in the United States and abroad.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page three, the slowdown in the U.S. economy has had an effect on our growth in the United States. Over the last few quarters, we have seen a steady decrease in U.S. GDV growth from 10.6% in Q4 of 2007 to 8.9% in Q1 2008, and now the GDV growth for the second quarter was 6.2%. During the second quarter, credit volume growth was only 0.7%, but debit grew at 15.8%. U.S. purchase volume was slightly higher than GDV growth, while cash volume growth was down.  Process transaction growth is still ahead of volume growth at 7.8%.</p>
          <p>As I said with you on our last earnings call and at our annual investor meeting, in the U.S., we are still seeing consumer spending patterns shifting to more non-discretionary purchases. Our process transaction data as well as MasterCard Advisors spending price analysis continues to show an increase in sales of necessary goods, such as gasoline, food and healthcare, largely due to increasing prices.  The impact of higher inflation and lower housing prices are compounded by the fact that consumers are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain credit as financial institutions tighten their criteria for loans and credit extensions.</p>
          <p>However, we continue to see double-digit growth in markets outside the U.S., which contribute a little more than half of our revenues in the quarter. While there are economic downturns in the U.K., Spain and a few other European countries, in general, European markets continued to represent strong growth for us.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we still see healthy cross-border volume growth.  While down slightly from the 20 plus percent growth levels we have seen over the last &#x2013; past two quarters, the second quarter growth rate of 18.9% is higher compared with the same quarter last year. As in recent quarters, this growth continues to be primarily driven by Europeans traveling in Europe and overseas, and we have not seen any significant change in travel patterns on a year-over-year basis for any of the regions.</p>
          <p>Last, as we've discussed before, much of our growth has been driven by the secular shift of electronic payments, which we believe is somewhat independent of the cyclicality of current market conditions.</p>
          <p>We continue to collaborate with our customers to help maximize the value of their payments businesses, recognizing that they're experiencing extraordinarily challenging conditions in the current economic environment. We are partnering with them as they refocus their efforts from account acquisition and marketing, towards the maintenance of the existing business and areas such as fraud loss prevention. We are not insulated from the pain that our customers are feeling, and we are actively working our expense structure to deal with the changing demands of our customers. In a few minutes, I'll reference a couple of examples of actions that we have undertaken.</p>
          <p>Switching now to some business highlights, on our last call, we discussed our announcement of our debit processing platform, Integrated Processing Solutions, or IPS.  I'm very pleased to report that we are now in live production with our first customer, Security Service Federal Credit Union, having successfully completed the critical first stage of a multistage conversion and implementation program.</p>
          <p>With respect to our U.S. litigations, I have mentioned that we have entered into a settlement agreement with American Express in June.  We will pay AmEx up to 150 million for 12 quarters beginning this September. And the payments will not exceed a total of 1.8 billion. There are two recent developments related to the Discover case. First, this week we entered into a judgment sharing agreement with Visa, that apportions cost and liabilities both companies may incur in the event of either an adverse judgment or settlement of the case. This agreement provides that Visa would be responsible for the substantial majority of any judgment or settlement based primarily on relevant volumes. Second, the District Court recently indicated that it expects to issue decisions and summary judgment motions no later than August 18th, and have rescheduled the trial to begin on October 14, 2008.</p>
          <p>In mid June, we announced that we would comply with the European Commission's ruling by temporarily repealing our default intra-EEA cross-border consumer card interchange fees effective June 21, 2008.  We continue to hold discussions with the Commission to see what interchange fee setting methodology we might employ in order to be compliant with the decision.  In any event, we will take appropriate action to ensure that we remain competitive in Europe.</p>
          <p>With respect to our repurchase program, during the second quarter, we purchased approximately 1.3 million shares of Class A common stock for a total of 355 million. We have now completed the approved 1.25 billion repurchase program. We regularly review our capital structure with the Board and will continue to evaluate additional share repurchase programs in the future. Further, this past February, our Broad authorized the conversion of up to 13.1 million shares of Class B stock into Class A stock during 2008. In the second quarter, we implemented and completed the conversion program with all of the 2008 authorized shares of Class B common stock converted into an equal number of Class A common stock, which were then subsequently sold or transferred to public investors.  Class A shares now represent approximately 76% of total shares outstanding.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to page four of the slide deck. Net revenue for the quarter exceeded 1.2 billion, an increase of 25% versus the year ago quarter. Currency fluctuations of the euro and the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar contributed 5.4 percentage points of the net revenue increase, resulting in underlying business growth of 19.6%, approximately 5 percentage points of this was due to pricing changes.</p>
          <p>Excluding the special items related to the litigation settlement, our operating income of $416 million resulted in an operating margin of 33.4% for the quarter, a 6.1 percentage point improvement over the second quarter last year. As we've mentioned in the past, our strong revenue growth enabled us to leverage our operating margins. The contribution from foreign exchange was less than 1 percentage points of this increase. Net income was $276 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, excluding the special items.</p>
          <p>Turning to page five, gross dollar volume grew 12.8% on a local currency basis in the second quarter, and 18.2% on a U.S. dollar converted basis to $655 billion. This quarter was the 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit worldwide GDV growth on a local currency basis. Growth in the U.S. was 6.2% and purchase volume growth in the U.S. was higher at 8% versus the second quarter in 2007. Although not shown on page five, on a local currency basis, worldwide purchase volume was up 14%. And cash volume growth of 9.3% was slightly lower than the comparative quarter last year. Additionally, cross-border volume or the volume that is generated from cardholders who travel outside of the country where their card is issued, was up 18.9% over the comparable quarter last year.</p>
          <p>I'd like to point out that, beginning in the second quarter, we refined our methodology for calculating our cross-border volume to use the merchant country rather than the acquirer country.  The effect of this change only relates to volume growth rates, which is very small and has no impact on our reported revenues. Prior reporting periods have been restated, and can be found within the supplemental operational performance data on our investor relations website.</p>
          <p>Processed transactions, or transactions processed across MasterCard's network, increased 13.6% to 5.2 billion in the second quarter. We continue to benefit from the global diversification of our business with our ability to generate significant volumes, transactions and revenue from economies outside of the U.S. Net revenue yield was 19 basis points in the quarter versus 18 basis points in the second quarter of 2007. Pricing changes were the primary driver of this improvement.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to page six. Here you can see the net operations fee increased 28.7%, or 209 million, to 938 million in the second quarter. Gross operation fees increased 27.5%, or $225 million, to a little more than 1 billion. This growth was driven by several factors. First, growth in process transactions, cross-border volumes, and gross dollar volumes that are previously described on page five. Second, new pricing changes implemented in January of this year on cross-border acquiring volumes and on retail purchases in the U.S. by non-U.S. cardholders. And third, revenue for other payment related services such as new account enhancement program launched late in the second quarter of 2007 in Global Cardholder Services.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, net operation fees as a percentage of gross operation fees improved slightly due to a continuation of lower rebate to customers who did not achieve contractual performance criteria.</p>
          <p>On page seven, we show that net assessments increased 14.9% or 40 million versus the second quarter of 2007. Gross assessments increased 15.9% versus U.S. dollar GDV growth of 18.2% or 80 million to 583 million due to strong GDV growth, slightly offset by mix. Net assessments as a percentage of growth assessments declined somewhat compared to the second quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page eight for some detail on expenses. During the second quarter, excluding the special items, total operating expenses increased 14.6%, of which 4.5 percentage points were related to currency fluctuations. The increase was mainly driven by two factors: first, a 15.7% increase in general administration expenses, of which 3.3 percentage points were related to currency fluctuation.</p>
          <p>The growth in G&amp;A was driven by higher personnel costs. Excluding the impact of FX, personnel costs increased 18.1%, primarily driven by the hiring of new personnel as well as higher severance costs as we continued to align our business needs against our existing talent pool.</p>
          <p>Second, we recorded a 13% increase in advertising and marketing expense. Currency fluctuations represented 6.6 percentage points of this increase. A&amp;M growth was primarily due to the timing of expenses, mostly from sponsorship activities related to the UEFA and European Championship soccer events as well as ongoing investments in high growth markets.</p>
          <p>Moving to the cash flow statement and balance sheet highlights on page nine, we generated 319 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter. We ended the quarter with 2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. This includes the repayment of 80 million of subordinated debt. The available for sale securities decreased 84 million in the quarter, mostly due to the sale of short-term bond funds.</p>
          <p>The American Express litigation settlement had in impact on primarily two areas of our balance sheet. First, litigation liability increases by 1.65 billion. Second, our deferred income tax assets increase by 530 million. Most of these totals were broken down into their short and long-term components and booked through the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In April this year, we formally integrated the operating structures of our operations in France with Europay France, forming in new entity, MasterCard France. This resulted in a 70% equity interest for MasterCard. We accounted for this transaction as 100% acquisition and we recorded a liability for the present value of the fixed purchase price of &#x20AC;15 million, which will be paid by MasterCard in three years. At that point, we will own 100% of the entity. As of quarter end, we have finalized the repurchase of approximately 1.3 million Class A shares in the open market for $355 million.</p>
          <p>Before moving to the Q&amp;A, I would like to spend a few minutes on slide 10, highlighting a couple of items for your consideration as you refine and update your model for the remainder of 2008. In light of what we currently see for our business, the longer-term performance objectives that we talked about on May 29th remain unchanged. However, we have refined our outlook for full year 2008.</p>
          <p>We continue to expect slower net revenue growth than the 22.3% growth we experienced in 2007, but still at double-digit rates, and assuming constant FX. Year-to-year, our revenue growth has been &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> 1.8% excluding FX.  Lower U.S. growth <mark type="inaudible" /> our net revenue growth for the rest of the year <mark type="inaudible" />...performance criteria in customer agreements and our continued strong <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>Our outlook for G&amp;A expenses, excluding special items, remains unchanged. We should grow at a rate that is both slower than 2008 net revenue growth, and below the 2008 G&amp;A growth rate of 16.8%. Similar to revenue growth, our 2008 outlook assumes constant FX. On a year-to-date basis, G&amp;A growth has been 10.3% excluding FX. With respect to A&amp;M, we now anticipate to spend roughly the same amount as in 2007 based on current FX rates as we adjust our efforts in line with our customer activities. We don't anticipate as much marketing expense in the second half of this year, particularly in Q4. Previously, we had been expecting to see a modest increase in total A&amp;M spend for full year 2008, assuming constant FX. These thoughts continue to assume no global recession and no event which significantly disrupts cross-border travel.</p>
          <p>Finally, while we do not plan to break out the interest accretion impact associated with the American Express settlement as a special item, we do expect it will increase interest expense by 44 million for the second half of 2008. We have included an amortization schedule in the appendix to this presentation which models the increased quarterly interest expense amount over the settlement payout period, over the next 12 quarters.</p>
          <p>To wrap up, we are very pleased with our second quarter results, but are mindful of the economic conditions that we operate in. We are managing our business plans in light of a tougher market, and are taking the necessary expense management actions as we see our customers realigning their plans. We remain committed to growing our business while managing costs and investments in order to drive shareholder value. Barbara?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for all the details. I had a couple of questions I guess, first on U.S. credit growth. Last quarter, you mentioned, Martina, a contract termination. Did that occur in the quarter, and if so, what was the impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we talked about that in the last quarter already. That was where a customer of ours sold their business to somebody else, and the impact in the quarter was actually relatively small, very small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the growth of, I think you commented 0.7% growth in credit, is that where it would have hit? I'm just curious what the growth would have been excluding that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tien-Tsin, it would have not significantly been different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good. And then maybe if you can just comment on monthly trends in general on U.S. purchase volume growth in the second quarter, particularly in credit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what we saw, obviously, we saw during the quarter it came down a little bit. In June, it came down a little bit too. It wasn't a cataclysmic decline.  But you know, as I can tell you, that really what we are seeing here on average for the second quarter we are seeing as a trend also for July.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Just quickly on G&amp;A, did you quantify the higher severance cost, Martina, and what kind of savings you expect to get out of this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we can certainly do that. I mean if you just look at the G&amp;A expenses overall, you saw a 15.7% increase, of which 3.3 percentage points were related to currency fluctuations. And then in terms of the severance, I think that was about 3 percentage points of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the savings you expect out of that, going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean pretty much our run rate in terms of what we spent on average per employee, so we do obviously expect some savings. Otherwise, we wouldn't have done this. But it's really a realigning our work force with the kind of business needs that we're seeing forward. So again, as you know, we are still investing in the business, but we are also seeking to expand our operating margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Pat Burton from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. My question is on cross-border travel.  As you approach the year ago numbers, where you had some pretty hefty growth, how much do you think that 18% number will decelerate?  Are we talking like 5 points sequentially something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pat, that is a very difficult question. I mean what we have seen is that cross-border growth has actually accelerated over the last year. I mean in particular when you look at the fourth quarter of last year and that had kind of continued into the first quarter of this year.  We're talking relatively still extremely healthy growth rates at almost 19%. We have not, what I can tell you is we really have not seen any change in travel patterns. The travel patterns are really still pretty much the same from what we saw before. We saw the Latin Americans maybe traveling a little bit more in Latin America versus coming to the United States. We really saw no discernible difference between what the Europeans do and what people in Asia Pacific do. So we still believe that cross-border volumes going forward will be healthy, but I think it will be really hard for us to guide you to any particular number for the future.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>And your next question will come from the line of Adam Frisch from UBS. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks good morning.  Martina, as you see the top line potentially enduring some more headwinds, whether it be from year-over-year comps being tougher in the second half or a slower consumer. Obviously, your growth has held up really well so far, but I think expenses are going to become a bigger part of the margin equation going forward. Good to see that A&amp;M is doing steady year-over-year. But what can we expect from G&amp;A going forward? Because that's really the expectation I think of a lot of your investors with where there is operating leverage in the model to achieve higher operating margins going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Adam, we are very mindful obviously between the top line growth and what we have to do on the G&amp;A perspective. That's where we pretty much reiterated our thoughts for 2008. We are very mindful of what happens in the United States, and how it could possibly impact our growth rate. Despite that, as you know, we have some pretty good levers to moderate any kind of impact, be it what happens in terms of a tiering perspective from our customer agreements, be it more than half of our revenue growth is actually generated out of the United States.</p>
          <p>And from a G&amp;A perspective, again, we are pretty much reiterating what we have said before. And when you put the numbers together, you should see some pretty healthy margin expansion, which you already saw for the first six months as well as for the remaining six months of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll take that offline, but thanks for the color there. The only other thing I wanted to ask was on the credit portfolio. Tien-Tsin brought up a customer loss, you said it was small, was there anything else going on in your credit portfolio that would explain the growth there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is everything that we can really see, this is what is happening in the market in the United States. As in my opening remarks, I told you that the economic environment is pretty tough. We obviously still see the move from non-discretionary purchases to discretionary purchases. But we also do believe that the housing crisis and the restrictions on credit for consumers have an impact on the consumers utilizing their cards.</p>

          <p>Okay, last question on debit, obviously, you're making a bigger push into that market, IPS, you have your first customer close to up and running. What are your other plans for debit growth going forward, do you plan on doing it organically or potentially via M&amp;A? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, we really have all options open. IPS is obviously a significant investment that we did over last year and the first part of this year. So that is our primary focus, to make sure that we get Security Service Federal Credit Union up and running, and then focus on the next customers in the pipeline. But depending on what kind of things will come in the market, we have an open mind.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Last quarter, you guys talked about I think one customer falling sort of volume thresholds that caused you guys holding back on your rebates and incentives.  I'm just wondering what kind of multiplier effect I guess might have happened in the second quarter?  How many customers might have been affected by falling short of volume goals? And I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Chris. I mean, as you said, in the first quarter we had actually a significant impact from one particular customer, and that's really why we pointed that out. In this quarter, there is no really particular customer, any particular customer, who impacted this. But when you can &#x2013; I mean you see how the volume growth in the United States, in particular, on the credit side was lower than in prior quarters and in the year ago. And that is where our customer agreements are actually working from a rebate and an incentive point of view, and the kind of performance hurdles that our customers have to achieve in order to get into the next year. So we have a little bit of an offsetting lever, but there is no particular customer in this quarter that we would be pointing to. I think it's a general part of the environment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've really looked at our data to see whether we can see any discernible difference on, especially where we're hearing that people are spending, those kind of checks. And we really cannot find from our network data, any appreciable difference.</p>

          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Liz Grausam from Goldman Sachs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, I wanted to ask a question on SEPA, and looking into the next two years as you're reaching some of the critical hurdles in that regulatory framework out in Europe. How should we think about that as possibly some offset in your process transaction growth where we could see some decoupling between your GDV and your process transaction growth trends, as you're gaining share in the processing landscape out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Liz, that is a good question. As we have talked about it before, SEPA is really a guideline, it's not a law. People are supposed to &#x2013; or the banks in Europe are supposed to comply with the guideline, I believe by the end of 2010. However, this is a relatively slow process. I think at our Investor Meeting, Javier did a really nice job in terms of pointing out where we are actually going with SEPA and the kind of wins that we already had.  And just to remind you, we are not just working with banks in the market, but we are also working with merchants in the market, because at this point in time, merchants can actually re-point wherever they would like to have the acquiring activity to go through.</p>
          <p>And obviously, given our network and the cost effectiveness of our network, we found ourselves to be the first choice in a number of those engagements. These kind of things are going on Liz. There is nothing in particular that we want to disclose at this point in time. But these efforts that Javier was talking about have continued in Q2, and we are believing that it will definitely continue for the rest of the year, in the next couple of years. But given that it's so early still in this evolution, and given that a lot of the European banks really have to grapple with what are they going to do with their own processing facility.  It's really hard for us to give you a particular guidance in terms of how this might impact our GDV or process transactions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then just another question on the cross-border trends that you're seeing. Visa reported last night that they saw a little bit of softening as well in cross-border trends, but mostly pegged it on the U.S. consumer not going overseas, and that's where the softness is coming with really no major change in trend in the foreign consumer traveling. Is that similar to what you're seeing? And have fuel prices affected the ability for Europeans yet to pursue cross-border travel, and how are you thinking about that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Liz, I mean at this point in time, I pretty much said we are not seeing significant changes for region-over-region. I mean we see a little bit of a variation in the growth rate in this region versus that region, but it's nothing significantly different than what we saw over the last, I would say, three quarters or so. Even in, where people are often traveling by car and obviously with these high gas prices, have to spend a lot more money in order to get from, whatever, Germany to France.  We are not &#x2013; we are really not seeing any appreciable difference than what we've seen before. So from a trends perspective, again, as I said I guess in the past, it's really hard to say where this is going to go, but at this point in time, 18.9% is still a pretty significant growth rate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks, good morning. One of the issues you talked about last quarter in regards to the slowdown was you would see or you may see transaction growth slow less than volume growth, as you lower average ticket. And looking at the numbers for this quarter, my calculations in the U.S. credit program, particularly, for the most part, the average ticket actually went up a little bit, so that did not have an &#x2013; any insights on what exactly is happening in U.S. credit?  People would be pulling back, I would think you would see the ticket slowdown. Do you think it's more issue related and do you see any evidence of consumers just moving away from credit cards given their more limited budgets, and trying to stick more to a budget on a debit card product? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chris. I think it's a mixture of things. Obviously, what's happening with the issuer environment, and the way that they have to manage their portfolio in order to make sure that their existing accounts continue to be very profitable for them, and the work around that they have to do on the credit side. That does have some impact, and we really said that. We do see some step up on the average tickets, but mostly related I would say to what people pump at the gas stations as well as a little bit related to food.</p>
          <p>The one noticeable difference that we are seeing is related to fuel in this country. So, this is a U.S. comment. Actually from a transaction point of view now, I think it's the second quarter in the row that we actually have debit transactions being equal to credit transactions. And before, you had credit transactions were bigger than or the number of them were bigger than debit transactions. So that is the only real discernible difference. But I do believe that inflation does drive some of the things that you are seeing on the average ticket.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one other follow on the same kind of topic is, the big drop off in cash transactions, particularly in the U.S. credit program. Did that have a big impact on your revenues? My understanding is that cash transactions are a lower margin product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that really comes at a lower margin. That really does not have a significant impact whatsoever on our revenues. And I think when you see the growth in the credits, U.S. credit, and the fall off in the cash volume, and that does explain, that fits together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then finally, I guess if you had any color from your issuers and your customers, and your issuing customers. Do you think that we have seen the worst of them pulling back or do you think that there is more to come in the second half as we get into this tougher economic environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this is really hard to tell. Obviously, quite a number of our customers have made sure that they are really surrounding their portfolios, their credit card and debit card portfolios, with you know the right kind of discipline that they need to have in order to keep those portfolios profitable. Never mind, these portfolios are still very profitable for each of the banks. So I think it really depends which customer you are talking about. Some of our customers are feeling actually that they could take advantage of this environment at this point in time, and are more aggressive in terms of the account credit acquisition side, the marketing side. And some customers just don't feel that way.</p>
          <p>So I think it's a mixed bag, but in general, I would say that people are probably more cautious still at this point in time because you don't know what more is going to come or how long this kind of slow down is really going to last.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Craig.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How's it going? I had a few questions, first was regarding pricing, just an update on your thoughts regarding where you are in the competitive marketplace with Visa, both on the acquirer and issuing side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, on pricing, I think we had in the first quarter, around about 6 percentage points in this quarter, about 5 percentage points, and I think, for the rest of the year, we see pretty much a similar impact. We did disclose some of &#x2013; what kind of pricing we did, which is a significant part is related obviously to cross-border volume. As well as a number of other services and products that we &#x2013; sounds like we really needed to adjust the prices in line with the value proposition that we have for our customers. It's obviously good that we were able to move forward with these kind of things.</p>
          <p>In terms of comments of us versus our competition, Craig, we are really not seeing on the pricing front itself, we are not seeing two different things than what we already said at the Investor Day.  We believe that we are doing obviously the right thing from a pricing point of view given how we work with our customers. And our competition has to think about what they have to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in comparison, do you feel you're at relative parity on a global level or has one moved ahead of the other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think &#x2013; first of all, it's really region-by-region specific. And then you really got to have to think about what is the pricing environment on the issuance side versus the acquiring side. And on the issuing side, as you know, it's not just list prices in terms of what you actually charge to issuers, but it really is dependent on what kind of customer business agreements we strike, which have often rebates and incentives really attached to performance hurdles in it. So you have to take all of this into account. And we do believe that when you take all of this into account, that we are very competitive in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the Visa agreement that you've just entered into regarding sharing of liability, why now on this agreement, what changed all of a sudden that prompted this agreement, just curious?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I don't think I really can talk about the timing on why now.  But obviously, you've heard what Discover said publicly in the market in terms of damages, and Visa and ourselves feel very similar in terms of &#x2013; that there is, we feel very strongly about our proposition. We are very aligned in terms of how we look at that case. And it happened to be the right time for us to be entering into this kind of agreement. You might recall that there was actually court mandated mediation prior to June 30, which was both Visa and us together with Discover.  And that Court mandated mediation, which we did enter into, it did not really lead to any results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And where are your focused &#x2013; you had commented on a shifting of resources, where are you focusing your new hiring these days as opposed to where it might have been a year ago or two years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, the one big area that is of difference is our integrated processing solutions platform. Obviously, a year ago, a little bit more than a year ago, so really I'm taking you back to the beginning of 2007, we did not have a lot of people related to development of that platform as well as implementation for customers. That has ramped up significantly over the last 18 months. And that is going to continue to ramp up, as we are having more customer implementations. So I would say in terms of one area, that's a big area. Another area that's important for us, but it's from a numbers point of view is, it's not quite as what I just talked about from an IP &#x2013; for the IPS platform, is high growth markets. High growth markets are important for us.  We are making significant investments in there and, we will continue to do so, because we do believe that that's where we see the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And where is it shrinking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The areas where we are &#x2013; I would say, really massaging our head count and putting it into the right kind of business propositions where we want to see is, one, in the U.S. of course, given that now the majority of our revenues come from overseas. We have to make sure that our workforce is very much aligned between what we want to see in the United States versus overseas. And then, in a number of other areas, related to our products, we need to do some alignments in order to be appropriately focused on the kind of things that we want to put out in the market here in the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. I just had a question on the assessment rebates and incentive line. I mean with the deceleration on the U.S. volume side, I would have thought we would have seen a little bit lower accrual or that come down a little bit more than it actually has. I mean, is there any color you could provide on that line? And then I got a follow up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sanjay, that's pretty hard to do because I think we've said that in the past, you have to be very careful not to torture rebates and incentives on a quarterly basis. Because it all depends not only on what's happening in the volume in the quarter, but it also depends on what kind of new agreements we actually signed in the quarter. And we happened to have signed new agreements in the quarter. And some of that actually can drive the timing in terms of when we book the rebates and the incentives. So I don't think there's really anything particular that you should read out of this. But I would encourage you to really look at it over time rather than on a quarter by quarter basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there like quick rule of thumb on how much of that line is U.S. versus international?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't really give that out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one question, I want to drill down on the volume growth in Europe. As you mentioned, it has become kind of a hot topic recently. And it may tie in with the SEPA question. But how much of that growth in Europe is organic growth versus new customer addition, because the growth still remains relatively strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say it's a mixture, okay. But I just want to give you a couple of examples. This is really going and coinciding with the secular trends that we see from paper based payments to electronic payments. But when you just compare the U.S. to let's say France, okay, a Frenchmen uses their credit card maybe five times a month. A German uses their credit card maybe one time a month. So the things that Javier and their team do in terms of really encouraging higher use of credit, and obviously all the uses of the debit card. In terms of the categories that they are actually opening up from a merchant acceptance point of view, and I think we speak to the number of those positive examples. The Lufthansa deal, the Co-op deal in Switzerland, Auschron in France, et cetera.</p>
          <p>I think that really does influence in how we work with our banks. That really does influence the end customer in terms of where they find the utilization of a card much easier than utilizing cash or a check. But then it's an evolutionary trend. So I'm definitely &#x2013; there is a big impact from that. Customer agreements, we are, as we have said before, we are very encouraged by all of the different activities that we see there, and the agreements that we actually sign across Europe. So that does have an impact. It's really hard for me, Sanjay, to tell you this is how much is driven organically versus acquisition, but both factors are important in driving that growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And one final question, just on the cash balance, I mean post AmEx settlement, I mean, should we expect that the carrying amount to come down a bit and that to factor into capital management strategies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For sure, it needs to factor into the capital management. As I said, we are reviewing with the Board constantly where our capital structure should be taken through.  We do have the Discover case out there with a trial date. We are probably taking that into account in some fashion, but you're absolutely right. We have moved through one major issue, which is the AmEx litigation issue, and you'll be hearing from us in the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good morning.  A question around international, one was were there any trends in what you would describe as maybe your more established international markets as you went through the quarter. Even though they may not have looked like the U.S., did they maybe look like a lighter version of the U.S. in terms of slowing growth as the quarter progressed?  And then a follow-up is, can you just give us some qualitative thoughts around margin profiles of the various regions of the world? Do they sort of, does their operating contribution approximate sort of the revenue contribution or some of the larger more mature established markets much higher and much lower margins versus the corporate average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Tim. Let me take your first question first. On the international front, let me just take region-by-region, but on Europe, we do have a mixture. I already quoted the U.K. as well as Spain, there are a couple of other countries that seem to be feeling the heat from an economic point of view, like Italy, Portugal, France and Ireland. That does not really show up that significantly in our volume growth. Again, I truly believe in terms of what Sanjay and I just talked about, the secular trend, opening up the merchant categories, making end consumers more comfortable using their cards, does definitely have an impact on this. So despite the economic environment, we feel very comfortable on the growth over there. In Asia-Pacific, Asia-Pacific, again, you can see that the growth is still very healthy. But when you look at China and India, and a couple of the other markets, they are impacted by the higher commodity prices that we see across the world.  We're watching that very carefully, but given the significant potential for moving people from cash to electronic based payments, I think you will see a really good balance there. So, I think we feel good about it. Latin America, I think that's like a two-headed story a little bit. Mexico does feel the credit crunch more, and we do see that a bit more in our data, versus Brazil. Brazil is just going gangbusters, and we're feeling very healthy there. So I think you have a bit of a mix.</p>
          <p>So there is not a one-size fits all, but you really have to take it market by market. But what's really happening in the U.S. and how deep the U.S. went down from an economic downturn point of view, probably the U.K. is maybe closest to that. But we're not quite yet seeing the other countries being there and there are other countries in the market that would offset that. In terms of your second question, the margin profile question, as you know, we really don't disclose this kind of data from a regional point of view. I mean the only pointers that I can kind of give you is where we not only see the volume where we charge the assessment fee, where we also process the transaction. So where we also get a transaction fee, those are obviously very good markets for us. And I think as you know from our filings, there are really five markets in the world where we do process most of the volumes, and that's a particular focus, that's really important.  That's where we want to expand to.</p>

          <p>I mean, is it inappropriate to think that in some of the more emerging economies, while they might be smaller now and are experiencing extremely strong growth, that just the investments you're making in brand and resources. What have those obviously being a lower margin region for you with a lot of margin upside over time?</p>

          <p>Tim, it depends, it depends totally on what the infrastructure in the market is. It depends on how we're acquiring it to get down in the market. So, for some markets, you're absolutely right. We're making investments with &#x2013; we're encouraging the right kind of behavior in order to get to electronic payments, and that's where you might see some lower margin. But there are actually some other emerging markets where the infrastructure is in such a way where we don't have to do that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Martina, I was wondering if you could update us on what you have seen in July for cross-border GDV and for process transaction growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really cannot. The only thing that we see on a weekly basis is process volume at this point in time. Actually, we also see process transactions. And I think from what I said before in response to one of the other questions, I think it was Tien-Tsin, is that we really see in July the same kind of things continuing as we saw it in the second quarter, okay.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And as a quick follow-up, I was wondering if you could clarify the outlook for A&amp;M spend. Should third quarter be lower than second, and then fourth be lower than third?</p>

          <p>Yeah, I just would like to say thank you, first of all, for joining us this morning. Obviously, we talked about the difficult economic environment in the U.S., but I just want to say how pleased we are with our results for the second quarter. We really believe that our business fundamentals continue to provide a solid foundation for us to meet our business objectives, not only in 2008, but also for the longer term. We definitely remain committed to grow our business and we will manage our costs in order to drive shareholder value. So thank you for your time today.</p>
