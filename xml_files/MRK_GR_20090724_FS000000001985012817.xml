          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Presentation Results Merck KGaA Second Quarter 2009 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Becker. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, very much, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the discussion of our second quarter results, and thank you for joining the Merck KGaA call and webcast.</p>
          <p>With me today are my colleague Elmar Schnee, and our IR team with Uta Kemmerich-Keil, Head of Finance; Claudia Nickolaus and Thomas Kornek.</p>
          <p>I will first take you through the financial situation of the Group. Here, I will refer to the figures of the second quarter unless stated otherwise. Then, Elmar Schnee will present the highlights of the pharmaceutical sector; I shall finish with the chemicals and the outlook.</p>
          <p>On balance, we had a pretty unexciting quarter. The excitement brought into this call by the news related to Erbitux, I could personally do without as you may understand. Because of these news, we will be brief with regard to the other topics.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide six, the economic downturn continues to affect our figures. While total revenues were stable compared to last year at &#x20AC;1.902 billion, the operating result fell by 29%. Merck Serono again showed good growth rates compared to last year. Chemicals saw a significant improvement of the Liquid Crystals business compared with the first quarter. Some cost items, especially R&amp;D and administration, grew more than is the norm for us.</p>
          <p>The Group core operating result fell by 29% to &#x20AC;330 million and core EPS by 28% to &#x20AC;1.10. Our underlying tax rate of 25.9% is also the reported tax rate as there were no exceptional items in the second quarter. The financial debt decreased to &#x20AC;636 million compared to &#x20AC;821 million last year.</p>
          <p>Currency effects on Group level were negligible as effects within the individual divisions balance out on Group level as presented on slide eight. The same is true for the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>The key balance sheet data for the Group are on slide nine, comparing these figures to December 31, 2008, the main difference is a 750 million Eurobond, and the decrease of the net financial debt is due to the dividend paid in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow before acquisitions and divestments was &#x20AC;79 million and it remained more or less unchanged as shown on slide 10. It is pleasing that the weaker profit after-tax could be balanced by a favorable working capital development.</p>
          <p>This already concludes the finance part. And Elmar Schnee will now give you more details on the pharmaceutical business.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael. A warm welcome also from my side. I will start with our yesterday's very surprising and extremely disappointing news flow on Erbitux in lung. We, I think, you as well as the key opinion leaders were completely surprised and did not expect the CHMP decision to adopt a negative opinion for the U.S. use of Erbitux for the treatment in lung cancer. As you know, lung is among the most difficult to treat types of cancer and the data of our FLEX trial demonstrates clinical relevant benefits to patients. Therefore, we consider appealing the CHMP opinion. Erbitux is the first and only compound in clinical development in more than 10 years to increase overall survival in a broad patient population. However, Erbitux has still a considerable growth potential in its approved indications.</p>
          <p>Let's now start with the key financials for Merck Serono on slide 11. As already highlighted by Michael, Merck Serono continues to be the growth engine of the Group with a 6% increase in total revenues. Sales were up 7.5%, mainly driven by double-digit growth rate of our top products Rebif and Erbitux. However, royalty income dropped by more than 15%. We post a deliberate 26% increase in R&amp;D spending due to an increasingly advancing late-stage study program, as well as new Phase III study starts having now an unprecedented 11 trials in Phase III. This is the main reasons for the 17% decline of the core operating results to &#x20AC;270 million. Free cash flow jumped by 63% to &#x20AC;140 million.</p>
          <p>Let's talk now about our main products to be found on slides 12 to 14. Rebif continued its strong growths and reported a 21% sales growth for the second quarter compared to the last year. The 45% U.S. sales rise was a result of price and volume growth as well as a positive currency impact. Last U.S. Rebif price increase was in May. In Europe, we grew 11%, which is entirely volume based.</p>
          <p>Our lifecycle management aims at supporting our leading edge in the various therapeutic areas. We launched the first electronic device, RebiSmart, in the European Union and Canada in June. This caused an increase in our spending on marketing and selling.</p>
          <p>We achieved a key milestone in EMEA accepting our marketing application for cladribine tablets, starting their review procedure yesterday. The filing to the FDA is planned in the current quarter. The applications are based on the positive results of our CLARITY Phase III trial, which were also presented at AAN and ENS during the second quarter. The trial data showed that the primary and all key secondary endpoints were met.</p>
          <p>In addition, we showed that the effect on the annualized relapse rate was significant as early as 12 weeks after initiation of the treatment and sustained through the 96 weeks of the study.</p>
          <p>Regarding the development of our late phase candidate safinamide, we initiated SETTLE, a second Phase III clinical trial against advanced Parkinson's disease. Study will support an application to the EMEA, which is not expected before 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to the oncology developments starting with Erbitux performance in the second quarter. Erbitux grew 18% versus last year of second quarter boost by strong sales in Japan and Latin America, and continued its sequential growth quarter-on-quarter. Our strategy of personalizing cancer care is paying off.</p>
          <p>Erbitux is the first and only cancer drug being recommended by NICE for first-line treatment in colon patients with KRAS wild-type tumors and liver limited disease. At this year's ASCO, we presented further data for Erbitux for Impetreve, which is the new trade name for cilengitide and for Stimuvax confirming the promising potential of our oncology franchise. Furthermore, we initiated a Phase III study with Stimuvax, our therapeutic cancer vaccine for the treatment of breast cancer.</p>
          <p>I would now like to move to slide 16 illustrating our pipeline portfolio. Michael and I reported a chunk of our R&amp;D investments, which is trimmed by the high number of late-stage and new clinical trials, which were initiated during the second quarter. The more advanced our trials are, the more cost intensive they become. But as you know, a promising, innovative pipeline and successful studies are essential to support Merck's success in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>We stick to our targeted R&amp;D spending at 20% of annual revenue in the long term. But please bear in mind that there might be occasions when we will temporarily exceed this target ratio for good reasons.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, we present the key financials of the Consumer Health Care division. Total revenues softened by 2.7% to &#x20AC;104 million and we're still impacted by the inventory destocking at the wholesale level in Mexico. The division has been hit by strong negative currency effects and the economic crisis leading the organic growths to be almost flat.</p>
          <p>Operating results of &#x20AC;10.4 million was down by 32%. However, the previous year's second quarter operating results included a &#x20AC;4 million payment from a supplier for contaminated raw materials.</p>
          <p>CHC is continuing its emphasis on strategic brands within our four key health themes as presented on slide 19. Six out of our seven strategic brands grew organically and the strategic brands now account for more than 50% of the division's business.</p>
          <p>This is all from my end. I would like to hand over to back to Michael who will give you some more details on the Chemicals division and the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Elmar. We are now on slide 20, where you will find the performance of Liquid Crystals. Revenues have been growing steadily since the beginning of the year. Revenues for the second quarter were &#x20AC;189 million, a 21% decrease compared to the last year. However, sequentially revenues improved by 44% in comparison with the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Positive development is the result of the recovery of our business and the new PS-VA technology, which is exclusively offered by Merck and offers more proprieties to include the performance of displays.</p>
          <p>The ROS improved to 27% compared to 10% for the first quarter of this year. We are confident that this recovery will be sustainable and will be translated in our figures for the full year.</p>
          <p>Key financial data of Performance &amp; Life Science Chemicals are to be found on slide 22. As our pigment business has been hit hard by the economic situation, we had a 7.5% revenues decline compared to last year, mitigated by 2% positive currency effect. The operating result of &#x20AC;18 million, a 55% decline compared to last year was negatively affected by low capacity utilization.</p>
          <p>We'd now like to draw your attention to our outlook for the full year 2009, as given on slide 24. We affirm our Group guidance given in April. We'd still expect Merck Serono's revenues to grow by 6 to 9% at a Core ROS of 20 to 25%.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health Care, we slightly adapted the outlook from 5 to 9% revenues growth to now 3 to 6, and an unchanged ROS of 5 to 10%. This very small adjustment leaves no trace in the overall guidance neither for Pharmaceuticals nor for the total company.</p>
          <p>Liquid Crystals, we narrowed our revenues outlook from minus 20 to minus 30% to high end of our initial range to now minus 20 to minus 25%. Return on sales outlook remains unchanged at 20 to 30%. Despite the 7% revenue decrease, our Performance &amp; Life Science Chemicals in the first half of the year, we are confident to deliver unchanged revenue with an ROS between 5 and 10%.</p>
          <p>As a conclusion, I would like to stress that we confirm our guidance for the Group that we gave in April. We expect to achieve a revenue growth of 0 to 5% and Core ROS between 15 and 20%.</p>
          <p>Last word perhaps with regard to exceptional, as usual we give no guidance on exceptional because it is the nature of the exceptional line that unexpected and extraordinary items are charged to this line. I remind you that we've already charged 70 million in the first quarter because that was in our mind necessary to be close to the event, namely the withdrawal of Raptiva.</p>
          <p>I confirm after the first payments at settlements have been reached that this is a generous provision. And at this point in time, we can exclude that we will need to edge to this provision.</p>
          <p>Another event, which is already a fact as well, but will only lead to an adjustment or a charge at the end of the third quarter or maybe even at the end of the year, is the effect of bankruptcies in Germany.</p>
          <p>All German companies who have company pension schemes form a pool, where they support each other in the case of breakdown. And since we have a lot of breakdowns in Germany due to the economic crisis, we will have a substantial charge. We estimate this now to be as much as 20 million, and it is not decided yet whether this will be an exceptional or digested in the operating results. This is just a thing that we see now, and we will book only later when we know the precise amount.</p>
          <p>This is it. Many thanks for your attention. Elmar and I are now prepared to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We will take our first question today from Richard Parkes of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. And just a couple of questions on the CHMP decision first of all, I'm just wondering if you could give us a bit more color on the reasons of that decision, were they questioning the clinical relevance of the survival benefit, or did they actually question the magnitude of the benefit? And also, I'm just wondering whether they raised any additional safety concerns other than those unknown in other indications?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unfortunately, we did not get so far the response letter from the CHMP. So, I cannot tell you what they claim. In the discussion, we thought that they thought that the risk benefit ratio, that's the speculation which our people -- is not in favor, which in my view is ridiculous.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just a follow-up. You said that you're considering an appeal of that decision, just wondering why are the reason for the caveat, is that just are you still just waiting for that opinion letter before you make that decision, or is there anything else that it's dependent on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just a nice formulation before we have to respond from the body who neglect or denies the decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then, just one more question on Cladribine &#x2013; oral Cladribine, I'm wondering if you can tell us any more about the carcinogenicity studies that you submitted with the application? And I'm also wondering whether you'll be asking the FDA for an expedite review?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have carcinogenicity studies. In our view, they are perfectly okay. And yes, we will ask the FDA for priority review. Since we had already fast-tracked. So actually that should be quite okay, and a good chance that we could realize this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll go back in the queue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now take our next question from Matthew Weston of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and thank you. Three questions, if I could, the first two focusing on the CHMP decision. Clearly at the moment, you don't have any information as you've said. But is there anything in the Q&amp;A process that you've gone through with the EMEA over recent months which can point you in the direction of what the problem could be? And could you also remind us of the timeframe of any appeal on how that process works?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, just looking at royalties within the Pharma division, can you please explain to us why they were so weak in the second quarter and whether or not that is now a fair reflection of the royalties that you expect going forward, or whether or not that was just a one-off and that we should get back to a more normal level over coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start with the Q&amp;As. We had some discussions, of course, with exchanges with the EMEA in the process of the CHMP. And in there we never detected that a 'no approval' could be an option. We had some discussions if there might be a need from their point of view to maybe have the label somewhat decreased from the white label, but certainly there are options and highly clinically benefits to patients, in non-adeno for example, and that was discussion all the way along. But we can't be more specific at the moment. I know on the -- and our opinion leaders know that patients get denied an effective treatment in lung cancer. In areas like non-adeno, where there's absolutely no treatment possibility in the last 10 years.</p>
          <p>Regarding the timing, we have to see how the process goes. We have 15 days to appeal and the whole process might take &#x2013; so we have to put the new dosage together. We have to get new information to them. We have to decide how we would like to approach this and it will take us until we reach a decision six to eight months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is Michael Becker speaking again. I'll answer the question on the Merck Serono royalties because I take the full blame for this decrease. As you may know, it is not so easy to post royalties from partners, which are dependent on the partners' business, because we get the final balance only after the event.</p>
          <p>So we do an estimation based on analyst expectation. And in the past period, we accrued too much revenues based on this estimation. We had to correct this after the settlement. And this went into the second quarter and the decline is due to the over-accruing in the previous periods, not to decline of our partners' business. In fact, our partners' business is doing well, and we do not expect this to be a model quarter for the future development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. So if we were to take the average of Q1 and Q2, that would give us a more fair reflection of the real royalties booked in Q2. And then, we can decide what to do given your partners' revenue growth as to what to do with that revenue going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good idea.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question today comes from Cornelia Thomas of WestLB. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Actually, my colleague just now asked two of my questions regarding the Erbitux timelines and the royalties, so I've just got one question left. It concerns the new trial in Stimuvax, which you started in a few months or months back. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on the rationale for starting this new trial because so far all therapeutic cancer vaccines have been sort of high risk developments and you've already got one Phase III, which doesn't have data yet, so what's the rationale for this new one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rationale was potential for the future. We have obviously quite some experience with Stimuvax, we have Phase II results. And we had also earlier in our development a drug called Seratop. Seratop is very close to the mechanism of Stimuvax, and Seratop was studied in breast cancer. So we have some results there which were never published. You can find them if go for search. And this gave us together with the Stimuvax experience enough confidence that this is something which we should do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question today comes from Sachin Jain of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Three questions; just one follow-up on Erbitux and then two on margins. Firstly on Erbitux, if the discussion and the problem is related to risk-benefit ratio as you suspect, what's your plan of action for resolving that in the dossier you would submit? Any color on what you'd be able to do? Re-analysis of data or would this require a new study?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on Merck's Serono margins, you maintained your guidance of 20 to 25%. Just wondered on how achievable the top end of that is given first half margins of roughly 20.5 towards the middle end of that range?</p>
          <p>And then, finally, related to that previously you've commented that second half margins may be a little bit light relative to first half given launch costs. What do we think about in terms of Erbitux launch costs for lung? Are those off the table now pending decision from EMEA? Just a check on that, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The philosophy of giving a range as a guidance is that the range stands and will not be narrowed during the discussion. So the 20 to 25% margin is a 20 to 25% margin and will not be lowered or narrowed in this discussion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the risk benefit, I'm puzzled how you can come to this conclusion in this severe disease with the data set which we provided. When you looked at ASCO, if you look at The Lancet on the first page, standard therapy in the future, so each opinion leader can't really follow the argumentation which supposedly will come out. Therefore, I think, we have just to do one thing, re-work the data, have them represented and show them somehow that maybe their decision taken on the first time was maybe influenced by some misunderstandings.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we might limit the indication. That's also a possibility because in some areas we have stronger data than in other. So we have to take now time, not too much of course, and we will resubmit as we see fit.</p>
          <p>Regarding the launch cost, yes, we were very convinced that we get to the indication. We hired reps, we put that infrastructure, we have some launch activities ongoing. We will now cancel the launch activities, of course, but we'll redirect the reps which are trained and ready to go for lung. They're also trained to go after head and neck and colorectal. So until we have a decision on appeal, we will maintain our infrastructure and just use them to drive more sales out of the given indications which we have  But there will be some costs which we cannot recuperate through these activities.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. Three questions if I may. The first one is on Erbitux; a follow-up question. We know that's that KRAS mutation is not an issue in lung caner, but some scientists discuss the potential impact of the EGFR mutation. Would that be an issue for the CHMP and would it be a requiring the mutation to be tested?</p>
          <p>The second question is on R&amp;D. You are saying that sometimes the 20% target of sales will potentially be beaten. Will that be the case this year? And the last question is with regard to PLS, you said that the low capacity utilization weighed on profit this quarter. Can you please give us a trend on the previous quarters and also your view on the future? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is right. KRAS has absolutely no impact in the lungs. And we did not have any discussions about some other biomarkers which currently we don't know some relevant ones, so there are none to actually get this resolved via this.</p>
          <p>Regarding the R&amp;D for 2009, yes, I do expect that R&amp;D will stay higher than our 20% for the given reasons because I would like to take advantage of our pipeline for the future. So I think, if we stay somewhere between what's it's before now, that might be a good assumption for this year.</p>

          <p>Okay. Capacity utilization of PLS, the underutilization was more or less the same as the first and second quarter, and we do expect that this level of underutilization will also prevail in the third quarter, and we fear that it will stay there also in the fourth.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking my question. I just have one simple question really. The cost of goods in terms of cost of sales for Pharmaceuticals, or particularly for Merck Serono in Q2 seem to be somewhat higher than certainly we were expecting and historic quarterly data in general. I just wondered is there anything specific in the manufacturing costs within Merck Serono that we should be aware of? Were you building up inventory of any particular product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I don't think so. You can see that based on the product mix that the cost of goods can vary and that's only what is there.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now move to Dani Saurymper of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Dani Saurymper from Goldmans. Just a couple of questions, if I may; one on Erbitux, but are there any additional registrational studies are there ongoing studies that you are looking at in lung with Erbitux that might report out that could be complementary to your dossier?</p>
          <p>And secondarily, I wanted to touch base on the Consumer Health Care guidance; I'm just wondering what's going to drive such a strong double-digit performance in the second half to get to that revenue target you've highlighted?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, can you just maybe discuss the cost pressure that &#x2013; your price pressure you're seeing in Liquid Crystals. Because obviously we're seeing a good pick up in revenues and then likely given the commentary coming out of panel manufacturers to continue into 3Q. So just wondering what's going on in terms of the operating margin performance and perhaps your conservatism there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The margins on Liquid Crystals will certainly be under pressure in the old product line because we have continuous price pressure. We always said there is continuous price pressure and we balance this price pressure by more efficiency in production and by new technology, new products which are with better proprieties.</p>
          <p>Now, in the downturn, we were of course unable to increase efficiency in production, we had low utilizations, smaller batches and so on, but we have a new technology as I mentioned PS-VA, and that relieves some of the pressure. I think we are on a good way out of the low margin area. We still don't run at full capacity utilization, that will still take a couple of months. But we expect that by the end of the year we are back to old levels and then can start introducing more efficiency in production again.</p>
          <p>As far as CHC is concerned, the guidance has been lowered. But having said that, the second half in CHC is always stronger than the first because of seasonal effects; for example, in the U.K. that is the pattern of our business. We think that this is a conservative revenue guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there are no other registration studies ongoing in non-small lung cancer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I just maybe just cheekily follow-up and say in terms of the guidance you gave for Merck Serono this year, what revenues would you assume from the lung indication in the sort of the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, we're not guiding revenues per product. So you have to look in your own model.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just two questions, one on Erbitux. The EMEA have actually just posted the question and answer document on their website and they appear to be questioning the length of the survival time in terms of stating that they believe it's modest. I'm just wondering how could you go about sort of answering that concern given that they seems to be just saying that the benefit appears to be modest in terms of time. And also, they're sort of questioning the lack of PFS benefit in FLEX. So I'm just wondering if you could give us some idea of how you may be able to answer such a concern. And actually I think all my other questions have been answered. So that's it for now. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, up to now in lung, agreed by every opinion leader, mortality counts. Number two, they approved a drug on appeal, which is Tarceva in -- not in gastric, in pancreatic cancer, which had 16 days, it got approved. So I'm a little bit lost at the argumentation. If we look at Avastin, got approved on PFS, but then the second study which they did was negative. So I'm wondering if they now retract it from the market, which I doubt though.</p>
          <p>So I think, yeah, they are flexible in the expectation of what they want to see. The fact is, as already pointed out, what also our key thought leaders say, patients have a benefit, a clinical relevant benefit, to them in the lung. So I haven't seen the document. So I'll just get it now, and we will analyze this and for sure we'll have some answers to those questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just a couple of more questions on Erbitux. I'm just wondering if you could update us on where you currently see penetration rates in the first line colorectal cancer indication. And then secondly, could you just remind us what pivotal studies in other indications, I'm thinking about the gastric cancer studies and the adjuvant colorectal, and when we can expect to see data from those studies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the nature of the studies, we get COIN and CRYSTAL results; CRYSTAL is still ongoing from a mortality point of view and COIN is a study in the U.K. which has prospective corrupts (36.16) in it; should expect those results later in this year, which we have some high hopes on it that they will be positive. And then you have clear cut mortality advantages over some other drugs in the market.</p>
          <p>Regarding the other indications, we have gastric ongoing, as you just said. This is currently the only registratable trial. We have some supported activities for adjuvant <mark type="inaudible" /> (36.48) which might be able to get a claim, but they are longer term studies coming out somewhere in 2012, '11. And we have, of course, quite an intensive program, which investigates, initiates the trials to support although some lung information on it depending how far they already are. So that's quite a program going on, but a registrable Phase III trial is only the gastric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the penetration rates in front-line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have no data available at the moment about penetration line because you have to make a primary market research to get this because you can't find them in the panels. And we do this not too often because it's a hell of a money to do so. But as you can see as our turnover, I think we start to see more penetration into those lines.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. My question is about the Liquid Crystal business. Clearly, historically, you've had a dominance, if not essential monopoly, position in high-end Liquid Crystals. As we are moving into a new phase with OLEDs, could you perhaps update us on where you are in terms of market share for the various types of technology that you supply?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't give market shares by technology. We give our total market share, and we say that we have lost some market share because we didn't join the down spiral of pricing, while no sales were there. The downturn, we are determined to regain this market share of 60%, and I am confident that my colleagues from the business will achieve that. We have at the moment no monopoly on TV technology, but we have the monopoly on one TV technology, which is the PS-VA. But this is a growing segment, and we never had a monopoly on TV. We had a monopoly on VA, but not on the other technology, which was IPS.</p>
          <p>We still enjoy a very strong position in TV, but if need be, we can also fight back on the TFT for displays that goes into monitors. So I think our position in the market is still very strong. What is pressing on our margins is the one-year gap that we have on our ability to balance price pressure with more efficiency in production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you give me some sense how big the PS-VA market is then if that's the area where you have complete dominance?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The PS-VA market is potentially the whole TV market, but how much shift will there be towards PS-VA, only time will tell. And as I said, we don't give details on technologies.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions if I may. The first, your amortization costs were higher than expected. Can you give us kind of feeling for your Q3 and Q4 this year? And you mentioned that exceptionals costs were -- or you mentioned insolvencies. And my question is of which area do you expect these insolvencies and are they already ones or some or -- and if not, where do you expect these insolvencies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The amortization is up because of currency. Most of the amortization is in the Swiss franc area, and the strong Swiss franc means higher amortization. Okay. And these &#x2013; I think I need to repeat the insolvency business. The pool is all German companies who run company pension schemes, and it is any old company that goes bust that increases our liability to jump in with the other surviving companies. As you know that there has already been a high number of insolvency in Germany all over the place in nearly all industries. I mean the most &#x2013; if a company like Opel, which is in receivership, stays in receivership, we are there to pay for the employees' pensions.</p>
          <p>And the same goes for the retailer that has gone into receivership. So it's not something that is limited to certain industries. It's all over the place. Of course, we are not alone to carry these costs. This is the &#x2013; all the BSFs and Siemens' and Daimlers and BMWs that share the burden. So it is just that in the time when there are a lot of insolvencies that this contribution will increase.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Yes. Amit Roy from Nomura. Please, apologies, if this question has been asked already. I dialed in late. Just on terms of the label that you're asking for in terms of platinum-based chemotherapy, were you asking for a patent platinum-based or was it just the cis-platinum &#x2013; cisplatin-based chemotherapy that the FLEX and the BETH study was based upon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am talking about the chemotherapy backbone that was &#x2013; that you applied for, because the press release seems to say platinum-based. Does that include both cisplatin and carboplatin or just cis alone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Both, I see. So in terms of -- I am reworking the dossier, could we in terms of think about you and look in terms of restricting this to just cisplatin-based and possibly obviously just the squamous cancers, would that be a possible route you could take?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are so many possibilities which one could think about, this is certainly one. But it is too early to call this. We go for as much as we can. And currently I cannot see why we should not get a broad one, but at the end it comes down to negotiation.</p>
