        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, a great pleasure to be back in New York. 2009 has been a strong year for us. Let's get to the first slide, thank you.</p>
          <p>Not only a strong year in terms of financials, but a very strong year in terms of qualitative progress. On the one hand we completed the Genentech integration and as you will see, we strengthened also our industry-leading pipeline.</p>
          <p>You have seen that we have achieved all the targets we have guided you during last year and, again, out-grew our markets in our two businesses, Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics, with an 11% and 9% growth, respectively.</p>
          <p>In terms of profitability, we brought it to the bottom line. Operating profit before exceptional items has grown by 14% in local currencies, ahead of sales. And as you have seen this week, the Genentech integration has already contributed to earnings for the Roche shareholders in the first year with a nine-percentage growth in Swiss francs before exceptional items and a core EPS growth of 20% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Now let me just emphasize that that point, the huge impact we have seen in terms of currencies, currency fluctuations, and let me emphasize it because we are the only company reporting in Swiss francs. So you can see core EPS 20% growth versus 10% in Swiss francs and you see also a very huge impact on the numbers for the two divisions Pharma and Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>As part of the Genentech integration we reviewed our supply chain and we decided to reduce inventories at wholesalers in the fourth quarter and you can see that this has a substantial impact on the reported sales of 4% for the Pharma division in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>But as you will see in Pascal's presentation, the prescription data has remained strong and actually we also had a very good start into 2010. Again, we brought down the top line to the bottom also in terms of operating free cash flow and in terms of core EPS where we are committed to continue to grow in the double digits for 2010.</p>
          <p>Let me just say a word to Genentech. I'm extremely happy about the progress which we have made in a record time. We have completed the integration successfully by the end of last year and I'm in particular glad that the top people have stayed with the company.</p>
          <p>I think this is also due to the fact that from the very onset we were clear to keep a diversity of approaches in research and early development, to keep Genentech research and early development as an independent unit, while at the same time we make use of our global scale, of our global reach for the global functions such as product development, manufacturing and marketing.</p>
          <p>We actually did a survey at the end of the third quarter last year during the integration and we were positively surprised about the feedback which we got from the Genentech employees. You can see that over 90% of our employees are committed to the merged company; over 90% are committed to stay with the company for the long-term. And you see this also reflected in the fluctuation rates which we measure on a continuous basis and which actually have been lower than the fluctuation rates we have seen before the announcement of the transaction.</p>
          <p>Now if I had one slide to choose for this presentation it would be this one about our pipeline, about our future. You can see that today we have a unique pipeline with 10 new molecular entities in late stage.</p>
          <p>We have moved six new molecular entities alone last year into late stage and on top of it, of course, we have a number of very important new indications for marketed products. You can see here that we will have on the one hand as we go further into the future 2011 a positive impact, depending on the clinical data from important lines.</p>
          <p>New indications such as Avastin and, of course, as we go forward in 2012 we will see some of these new molecular entities coming through. A word to the R&amp;D expenses, related to this strong increase of late stage trials as we have filled up the portfolio we have seen an over proportional increase into R&amp;D expenses over the last three years. As we go forward into 2010 we except R&amp;D to slightly decline and the key reason is that a number of important Phase III trials have peaked or come to an end, mainly for Avastin.</p>
          <p>Let me also take this opportunity to mention that we will be back here in New York on the 18th of March to take a bit more quality time to give you our overall strategy and to dive a bit deeper into the progress in our pipeline.</p>
          <p>With this, let me close for the outlook for the current year. We expect the growth in the mid-single digits for the Group in Pharma. We expect to continue to significantly outgrow the market for Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>We expect to deliver on the synergies, as we have guided you already last year, for 800 million in 2010, a billion as of 2011. I mentioned the decline in R&amp;D investments for 2010 and we expect to grow our core EPS in the double-digits. At the same time, we will step-by-step repay our debt as we keep an attractive dividend policy.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and with this I'd like to hand over to Pascal Soriot.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Severin. Good afternoon, everybody. It is really a pleasure to be here and present to you this 2009 results because, first of all, financially they are good, as Severin just explained to you. But also from a clinical neutral viewpoint we really achieved a lot of great milestones.</p>
          <p>A lot of great clinical data came up in 2009 and we really have a strong base to prepare for the future and we achieved this in the middle of a massive reorganization. As you would imagine, merging Roche and Genentech absorbed a lot of our expert and energy, but it didn't distract anybody in any of the two companies from achieving those financial goals and progressing that project, which I really do believe is a tribute to the people at Roche and Genentech, who absolutely focused on what it is we are here to do, which is progressing projects to make a difference for patients.</p>
          <p>If I start with the financials, you've seen those before. I would only say that we exceeded growth, the market growth in every region around the world.</p>
          <p>You see in total here our total sales grew by 11% in local currency and in every region but Asia-Pacific, we outgrew the market, even excluding Tamiflu. Even if you exclude Tamiflu our growth rate was higher than the market growth rate everywhere.</p>
          <p>In Asia-Pacific we've made some changes to address this and we look forward to a higher growth rate. In particular, we should be launching Avastin in China at some point in 2010. That will help us accelerate our market penetration there.</p>
          <p>So as you can see here, very good growth. The question, of course, that everybody may ask themselves is what does this mean if you exclude Tamiflu and what about your last quarter?</p>
          <p>The last quarter growth rate was lower. So we calculated this. We prepared this table to give you a sense of what is the underlying growth rate of our business if you take out Tamiflu, but if you take also out the effect of the inventory valuation that happened in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let me just give you a little bit of background on this one. As we went through the merger of both Roche and Genentech in the United States, we looked at our total manufacturing capacity on a worldwide basis, including the United States and we decided to close some plants. But we also looked at the supply chain all the way down to our customers and the retail inventory that exists with the wholesales or the specialty distributors around the country.</p>
          <p>And so in the United States we actually concluded we could leave with a lower inventory level, which helps us from the point of view of managing our total cash, but also helps our customers, who do not want high inventory of our expensive products. And so as a consequence we reduced inventory of both Genentech and Roche products, a little bit more for the Roche products, which historically had been running at a level of inventory that was a bit higher than the Genentech products, but it also had a small impact on the Genentech products in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And I would argue today probably we are one of the companies with the leaner inventory out in the retail trade at present. So having concluded this in the U.S. we decided to look at the world and re-assess what we had been doing a little bit mechanically for many years without necessarily re-thinking whether we could reduce our inventory level.</p>
          <p>And so we decided we could live with a maximum of 30 days in any countries around the world. And we've gone through a substantial downsizing of those inventories, trade inventories in China, in Russia and Brazil, Mexico and in a number of other markets. That is the impact of 4% on the growth rate in Q4 that Severin was mentioning a few minutes ago.</p>
          <p>So if you exclude this, if you exclude Tamiflu and also the effect of CellCept in the U.S. which we generate the underlying growth rate is about five, 5.5% to be compared, by the way, to a Q4 of the previous year, which was a strong Q4. And so this is in line with the kind of guidance we've given you for 2010, excluding Tamiflu, this kind of mid-single digit growth rate.</p>
          <p>Now if you look at the P&amp;L now, this 11% growth rate translated into a growth rate of our operating profit of 15% and what you see in this P&amp;L reflects exactly our strategy. Our strategy is focused on innovation, it's focused on developing drugs that make a difference in the marketplace and so what's you see here is good control of our manufacturing costs, good control of our promotional cost, in fact good control, in fact reduction of our general and administrative cost.</p>
          <p>We've been able to reduce those essentially though the synergies we were able to generate in the United States by merging the admin infrastructure of Genentech and Roche and relocating our U.S. headquarter from Nutley to San Francisco. And on the other side you see a growth in R&amp;D of about 13% that includes someone of one-off impairment that we decided in 2009 on the basis of the streamlining of our portfolio, the streamlining we went through as we look at the combined company portfolio. So certainly an investment in R&amp;D, which reflects the strength of our portfolio and we come back to this in a minute.</p>
          <p>Now from a Phase III flow, a news flow, it was a very rich year last year and I won't go through this whole list of key clinical results. I just want to mention a few.</p>
          <p>I think one of the most important one here is PRIMA. As you saw, MabThera in the United States is certainly not experiencing the same kind of growth rate as before. We have slower growth rate now because we have high penetration in every indication. We have also a slightly slower growth rate in Europe.</p>
          <p>We have a high growth rate in rest of the world. PRIMA in the maintenance setting is one indication that will help us to accelerate the growth essentially in Europe, the rest of the world, but also partly in the U.S. And that is an indication that could generate more than half a billion in sales. The other one that is of note here is Avastin in second line breast cancer, the RIBBON-2 study that will also help us boost growth in breast cancer.</p>
          <p>We've made some good progress in 2009 with Avastin in first line breast cancer, ToGA in gastric cancer with Herceptin. This is not a very large indication in the United States; it's probably $50 million. It is bigger in Europe and importantly it is very big in the rest of the world, essential in Asia. It's a large market in Japan, in Korea, in China. And we already got approval in Europe, in the European Union where &#x2013; a week ago, and that reflects the strength of the clinical data. We got really quick approval.</p>
          <p>And then also in inflammation and great results with Actemra, with tocilizumab and finally taspoglutide, actually all the studies that read out in the last quarter of 2009, they all hit their end &#x2013; their primary endpoint. We're happy with taspoglutide and we're moving forward with this agent.</p>
          <p>We had a number of regulatory filings that will fuel our growth in the future. The most important one is the RIBBON 1 and AVADO studies that will support our first line extension of label in the U.S. As you know in Europe it's already expand &#x2013; the label is already expanded to include docetaxel and with RIBBON 1 we'll be able to expand it to include other chemotherapies, notably Xeloda and in the U.S. we also will &#x2013; that will &#x2013; we will add docetaxel and other chemotherapy to the label.</p>
          <p>MabThera, CLL we are expecting both for the CLL first line label and the relapse label, we are expecting approval in the U.S. anytime now. It should really be very, very soon that we will receive approval from the FDA. The ToGA study in &#x2013; with Herceptin in gastric cancer, I've talked about it as far as Europe. It's again too dark from this chart, which means more than half a billion in sales potentially. In the U.S. we should file this year and this is essentially an indication that we'll generate sales in Asia, two to 300 million potential in Japan and then we have the other markets that will also drive growth.</p>
          <p>If I look at our sales, if I look at our business franchise by franchise now and I start with oncology, oncology as you know, represents about 50% of our total sales and grew by 8% in 2009. So essentially the story of this oncology franchise is if you look at Herceptin and MabThera/Rituxan, we are going to get slower growth rates for Herceptin and MabThera in Europe and in the U.S., accelerated growth rate in the rest of the world, with Herceptin thanks to adjuvant breast cancer but also gastric breast cancer, with MabThera, thanks to the maintenance indication and the CLL indication. And so I believe both Herceptin and MabThera have still quite some growth ahead of them because of this new indication. And if you project yourself a little bit further ahead, we will also be able to rely at some point on the results of HER2.</p>
          <p>As you know, this is looking at longer treatment duration with Herceptin. And if we demonstrate that two years of Herceptin delivers better patient care, this would make a substantial difference to the Herceptin franchise, potentially doubling the treatment duration and as you can imagine with the relevant impact on total savings.</p>
          <p>So slower growth but still reasonable growth with both Herceptin and MabThera. And of course substantial growth with Avastin being driven by breast cancer but also lung cancer and the additional indications that we can hope to see approved for Avastin in the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>If you look at these three key products across U.S., non-U.S., what is interesting to see here is that if you look at Avastin on the left-hand side of this graph, it grew by 21% in total but 31% outside the U.S. And in fact if you look at Eastern Europe it's even faster. You see here also despite the impact, the negative impact of inventory reduction in the last quarter, you see still a strong growth rates for MabThera and Herceptin, 9% each outside the United States.</p>
          <p>But importantly if you look at the right-hand side of the graph, you see here that Herceptin sales outside the U.S. represents about 70%, two-third of our global sales. That gives you a sense of if you have a product with strong clinical results you can drive sales outside the United States very substantially. And for MabThera/Rituxan and Avastin we are only at the 50, 50% break today.</p>
          <p>Now, with MabThera/Rituxan the maintenance data are so strong that they should really help us drive growth, convince payers around the world of the strengths of the clinical benefit that MabThera delivers, and it should really help us accelerate growth in the emerging regions in 2010, 2011 and beyond. And we hope to be able to achieve the same kind of results with Avastin. So you can see here through this graph that there is still a lot of way to go for those products.</p>
          <p>Now in the spirit of transparency we decided to show you those graphs. Those are graphs we use to track demand sales in the United States. And these are kind of equivalent of prescription data if you wanted in-market demand data. And we're listing this here for Avastin, Lucentis, Rituxan and Herceptin. And essentially what you see here is that the world is not falling apart for Herceptin and Rituxan in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Of course we are not experiencing double-digit growth rate with Herceptin and Rituxan, we know that. We are experiencing single digit growth rate in volume. And of course we have on top of this a small price effect. But the world is not falling apart. So that's supporting the message I wanted to leave with you, a slower growth rate in the U.S. on Rituxan and Herceptin, still growth rate but a slower growth rate there and the growth will come from outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>But importantly you see that Avastin is seen on a growth track and there is no change to that growth rate. And Lucentis accelerated at the end of 2009 essentially due to a change of reimbursement of Avastin by CMS, which you may be aware of. This has now been a reversed and so of course this strong acceleration that you see in the last quarter of 2009 should not necessarily be extrapolated fully in 2010. But still growth &#x2013; strong growth for Lucentis and further out we will have the RVO indication that should bring further support to that product.</p>
          <p>Finally to close this explanation of in-market demand sales versus the ex-factory sales, you see here reported for both Avastin and Rituxan on the orange columns represent the ex-factory sales and the blue ones the demand, prescription sales if you want. And if you to look at the last quarter, even though we only reported 3% growth rate ex-factory for Avastin in the U.S., we experienced 11% demand growth in the marketplace. And with Rituxan a volume in-market sales growth of 1%, despite reporting ex-factory sales decline of 3%, so in-market demand sales are still on track.</p>
          <p>If you look at Avastin we are expecting a very busy 2010, a very rich news flow with very important data supporting critical indications. And those are gastric cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer. We should also realize AVANT which is our second adjuvant colorectal cancer study in the course of this year.</p>
          <p>Just like to attract your attention to the so called GOG-0218 study in ovarian cancer. This one is especially intriguing because it will compare, it is comparing two different a treatment duration with Avastin. We actually believe that the longer treatment duration will deliver better patient care. And those results hopefully should bring support to this belief that we have.</p>
          <p>Rituxan, the growth as I've said before will actually be coming from first line maintenance in the EU. We only have a penetration rate of about 10%, even though in the U.S. we already are at close to 70%. So it gives you a sense for what growth we can achieve in the EU and the same outside the European community. And we also will generate growth out of CLL indication including in the U.S. And finally, the rheumatoid arthritis indication, especially outside the U.S. and Europe and elsewhere should grow by further penetration over the line. Today we have about 30% of the so-called bio IR or TNF-IR segment and we want to drive usage in the earlier lines and grow our shares for that progression.</p>
          <p>The growth opportunity is moving forward for oncology. They are listed here. First of all if you look at Avastin in its existing indications, we've communicated a peak sales potential of about eight to nine billion francs on the basis of the existing indications. Remember, we did 6.2 billion last year, growing by 21%. So going from six to eight, nine on the basis of this. And then essentially it's going to be driven by breast cancer in the United States where the patient share, the penetration is today 55%. We can go beyond that and certainly in Europe we have less than that and we will grow our share very substantially</p>
          <p>In colorectal cancer I think the penetration in the U.S. is already high. So clearly, we'll be looking for growth outside the U.S. in colorectal cancer. And finally lung cancer there's some way to go as well.</p>
          <p>And we have three key indications that I was mentioning before that could potentially deliver an extra one billion franc in peak sales each in the years to come. MabThera, it's actually Rituxan, I have mentioned the sources of growth, and you can see they are more than half a billion each. And finally Herceptin I've also talked about it, emerging markets will drive adjuvant breast cancer, and gastric cancer we have a global relevance.</p>
          <p>If I move on to the auto immune transplantation franchise, despite doing a great job CellCept defining it, with still lost sales of course, we've managed to stabilize the prescription share to about 30%. It is still slowly declining but aggressively stabilized. But of course it had a big impact on U.S. sales of CellCept and we declined substantially last year.</p>
          <p>On the positive side MabThera/Rituxan in RA still making some good progress. I was mentioning this 30% bio IR share a bit earlier, but we're still progressing nicely in that setting. And finally the great news was the approval of Actemra in the U.S. of course and the launch in Europe early 2009.</p>
          <p>Now if you look at the launch in Europe I would like to focus on Germany because this is really the only market for which we have about 12 months experience. We got our investment immediately as soon as we got approval Germany, that's the way the market works. And so we were able to launch early 2009 with almost full reimbursement from the beginning of the year. And we have progressed extremely well in Germany. We have &#x2013; we already have 14, 1-4% of the total biologic IR segment. And interestingly, we've achieved this without losing share with MabThera/Rituxan. So we've got 30% with MabThera/Rituxan plus the extra 14%, we're getting close to 50% of a total biologic segment in Germany, so very, very good progress. And of course we got approval in the United States. The label, as you know doesn't include DMAB-IR, but we believe it is a very strong label because we have a relatively "life friends", it's standard friends like every other new product has been experiencing. And we are very happy with this because of course, we would have &#x2013; we could have had a more restrictive REMS.</p>
          <p>We also have a strong label form the point of view of &#x2013; we have a strong statement about a reduction of CRP and so we are very happy with the label we got. We're going to focus on TNF-IR, which is where the product is used in any case in the early years. That's exactly what the European experienced is showing us. So there's not much lost at this point in time with Actemra not having a  DMAB-IR indication. And the feedback we are getting three weeks after launch in the United States is so far extremely encouraging.</p>
          <p>Virology was very much influenced by Tamiflu, of course. We reached 3.2 billion francs of sales in total. The &#x2013; there is good news, of course is that we are going to actually experience a decline in 2010. We're forecasting 1.2 billion, which is a two billion decline. The 1.2 billion forecasted is about 55% pandemic and the rest is the so-called seasonal flu that we experience year after year. But absolutely outstanding results with Tamiflu, which was really only achieved thanks to mobilizing all effort for the company because as you can imagine at the beginning of the year, we certainly didn't expect to sell 3.2 billion. We didn't expect the pandemic to take such a proportion.</p>
          <p>We didn't expect all these governments to call for help and ask for product and it's not as simple as saying, okay well now we deliver. We had to mobilize the entire supply chain to be able to supply government and customers around the world.</p>
          <p>Finally this is a busy slide. But I just wanted to leave you with a message about taspoglutide. It's fully on track. We have I guess a full program, very broad program supporting this product is what the slide tells you and every study that has read out so far hit its primarily end point and we've seen very good efficacy with this stage and very good profile, we'll actually present those data, DADA, maybe some although I mentioned here but customization to these studies because I know it has been of interest to many people. What we've seen so far with those data tells us that we can move forward in development and we've decided with our partner to definitely forge ahead with the late stage clinical development of Taspo, we've initiated T-emerge 8 to the CV safety study required by the FDA with the new guidelines that you all aware of and that study is now fully enrolling.</p>
          <p>We will have 10 numerical entities in our pipeline. Now I think what this graph tells you is that there are lots of products, but I think the one thing I also want to leave you with, one message I'd like to leave you with is the fact that if you look at this product, they are all first in class and if they are not first in class, the few that are not first in class, we would argue they're best in class. But most of them are actually first in class, trastuzumab, T-DM1, the BRaf compound, et cetera. The <mark type="inaudible" /> compound, they're all first in class and the data we have seen and in some of the data we've published, some others we will publish in the course of 2010, those data have been very encouraging. We've had tremendous results with T-DM1 with the BRaf compound. We're very happy with taspoglutide so as you can see here a very rich pipeline which explains why we've been investing a lot in research and development. We just are happy that so far so good, we also very much on track.</p>
          <p>Another study that I'd like to mention here that is not listed for <mark type="inaudible" /> a study in atherosclerosis that we are running in parallel to the existing study listed here, that we all open another patient segment, which are the patients who have signs of atherosclerosis and this agent has an enormous potential and if it makes to market of course.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to close by sharing with you some of our key objectives in 2010. It's one of these things, you finish one year and you spend five minutes, celebrating your great results and then you back all up and you prepare for the next race. And 2010 is going to be another very busy year on the great race for us to deliver all these results. We have a &#x2013; we are eagerly awaiting the clinical results for this three  Avastin study in ovarian, gastric and prostate. Those will come out in the course of 2010.</p>
          <p>The AVANT study also will be a very critical study for us. We have a very busy year, as you can see here. A lot of products reading out, lots of studies and we are filing Avastin metastatic breast cancer on second line. Avastin ovarian and gastric. We will be filing the PRIMA data from our MabThera/Rituxan in first line maintenance iNHL. We will be filing rheumatoid arthritis with ocrelizumab and adjuvant breast cancer xeloda. All in all, we expect mid single digit growth for the pharmaceutical division, if you exclude Tamiflu. But of course we have to recon with the decline in Tamiflu sales which is in the order of two billion francs as I mentioned earlier. I would like to thank you very much and will hand over to Dan. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Well, good afternoon, everyone. It's a great pleasure to be up here in front of you today to present the Diagnostics results for 2009. The first thing I'd like to say is I know I have a bit of challenge here particularly also following Pascal. And then most of you are focused on the Pharma sector, and I have a challenge to of course gain and obtain your attention on Diagnostics. I also have the challenge that most of you just had lunch on a Friday afternoon. So I also have to get your energy focused here.</p>
          <p>But I feel the challenge I take that on actually very seriously because I really have a message to tell you today and that is that Roche Diagnostics, I believe, is uniquely positioned to continue to perform as it did in 2009 in terms of a competitive advantage of being part of the Roche Group and amortizing the value that we have within the Roche Group on science and bringing new medical value to the market place.</p>
          <p>I equally think that Roche Diagnostics has a very key role to play in Pharma's objective of bringing personalized healthcare to the marketplace in a very real way. And to do that is probably the best way to look is to look at the past and say well how have we done in 2009 and why do I have that confidence moving forward? Well in 2009, we had a market growth rate of three to 4% in in-vitro diagnostics marketplace. And Roche grew by 9%, so and we are, by far today, the world market leader in the in-vitro diagnostics with a market share approaching 20%. Now you can see that growth was driven across all of our business areas in diagnostics, perhaps the largest magnitude of the growth was driven by our Professional Diagnostics business, which is our core lab business in clinical chemistry and immunoassay, and you can see that growing by 9%. But each one of our business area is contributing to that growth, and I'll talk a little bit about the reasons behind that growth.</p>
          <p>On the profitability side, we were successful in growing the profit margin by 12% and that was driven by of course the top line sales growth line. It was also driven by very active programs we have underway in 2009 and we'll continue in 2010 on our cost efficiency side, on streamlining our product portfolio and you can see that represented in the M&amp;D line, the G&amp;A line and the R&amp;D line in terms of the management of those lines.</p>
          <p>What you also see is that some of our success in 2009, in terms of placement of instruments, also affected our cost of sales line growing faster than sales. That's something that is on the one hand a cost to us in the business, but it is also a benefit in terms of increasing our installed base and I have an example of that as we move forward.</p>
          <p>I would say here today that as I look at the profitability for the future of diagnostics vision, I see us continuing to grow this profitability, manage our cost successfully and importantly grow above the market place to increase this margin into the future.</p>
          <p>Now if you look at what makes up this business and what makes up the growth rate, you can see here that the Professional Diagnostics business was driven largely by our immunoassay business and that grew more than three times the market rate. And that was driven by the launch of our HCV assay and the nature of our portfolio in Professional Diagnostics, which is scale having a very broad menu and also having an innovative menu.</p>
          <p>You can see in diabetes care, with a very challenging economic environment, this is a business that is obviously focused on the consumer segment. Here we had almost in this segment a flat or slightly declining growth in the United States, that we were successful at growing by 6%. With the placements of our meter systems and also our pump systems out there in the marketplace. Molecular Diagnostics, we grew off the success in blood screening, the blood screening nucleic acid business outside the United States and very importantly, and I'll get into this example, the launch of the cobas 4800 system in Europe, which is our system which will support the use of HPVs, CT/NG and also be the system for our companion diagnostics, molecular assays in the future as well as microbiology.</p>
          <p>In Applied Science, this is also another segment that was affected by the economic environment in terms of the buying patterns of our academic and research-based customers. And yet we still grew it 15% driven by instrument placements and also driven by being able to be fast with our research assays. We came out with a research assay for H1N1 for the swine flu, and that assay was used around the world to be able to identify the outbreak of this virus.</p>
          <p>Then importantly a couple of years ago, as you know, we acquired and integrated the Ventana business the Tissue Diagnostics business into our in vitro diagnostics organization. And that had two major benefits for us that we're seeing today. The one is, it complemented our range of technologies and it's also particularly important in light of the Roche Group strategy of oncology because Ventana is, and Tissue Diagnostics, is all about how do you assess the tissue as a sample, which is obviously the predominant sample base in oncology.</p>
          <p>And the second thing that we were successful at doing is taking that business, which was predominantly a U.S. business with a very high market share, and yet still growing the market share's around 55%. In the U.S. last year, it grew at about 20 to 25% and outside the United States, we grew more than 30% in terms of the penetration of taking a U.S. business and putting it into our commercial operations around the world.</p>
          <p>So you can see each one of our businesses is very competitive relative to its market base and the objectives we have in each one. Now our strategy hasn't changed in Diagnostics and it's founded on two key principles. The first one is we have lab customers and that's all about testing efficiencies. Lab customers as you know are consolidating out there in the marketplace and they're demanding higher automation, they're demanding higher throughputs and they're demanding systems and integrate well in with their IT systems.</p>
          <p>And those are all things we have to be good at and are good at at Roche. But what I think we have a tremendous competitive advantage in terms of other diagnostics company is actually the medical value side of the equation. And by that I mean we are able to leverage the science within the Roche Group.</p>
          <p>We're able to leverage the significant investment of R&amp;D across the Roche Group by allowing, number one, our scientists at a very early stage of research to collaborate and look into new bio-markers, new tests, new ways of predicting disease or predicting disease therapies. And this is not something that's easy when you work with third-party companies because you have all the constraints that go along with sharing IP, sharing ability and freedom to operate so within the Roche Group we can leverage that investment at the early stage. And likewise at the later stages, we can also encourage and expand the investment by utilizing, for instance, the huge investment we have in clinical trials at Roche, the sample banks that we have to also use our new Diagnostics and allow them to use the clinical data within our Roche Pharma organization in an ever-increasing difficult regulatory environment to get those products to market fast with clinical and with pharmacoeconomic value. So playing that out in terms of our businesses in 2009, you can see that in each of our businesses we were successful at launching testing efficiency with the new instruments we have here on the left-hand side and significant new menu on the right-hand side.</p>
          <p>I'll just make a point on the slide, on the menu side. And that is, we often talk about personalized healthcare is something that we only have a couple of examples on the market and it's in the future. And although it is a journey, you can see already up here in 2009, we launched several new assays that are very significant to personalized healthcare. There's the anti-CCP inhibitor up there that is going to be an important play in terms of rheumatoid factor and the ability to determine patients that may or may not respond to rheumatoid therapies. You have the KRAS, which today is clinically validated as a biomarker, as you know for EGFR therapies and oncology.</p>
          <p>And then we have advancements in our HER2 strategy with our tissue diagnostics with HER2 SISH and HER2 Gastric that allow us to even better discriminate those patients that will respond to a HER2 therapy. And in addition to this, we have more than 40 programs within Roche alone where we're looking at either companion diagnostics hypotheses or actually have programs in development such as BRAF for a melanoma products with the Plexxikon compound, which is specific compound that works specifically to those patients with the BRAF mutation or EGFR with Tarceva or the HER2 programs that I spoke about. So tremendous potential here in terms of fulfilling on the promise of targeting medicines out there in an increasingly competitive economic environment.</p>
          <p>Now just to break this down in terms of how does this work for our business model?  I want to first talk about installed base and the importance of installed base and the competitive barrier that creates to other competitors in Diagnostics. And I'll just take one example, although it's true to all of our businesses. If you look in Professional Diagnostics, our largest business, you can see here the number of instrument placements we have around the world and how we progressed that in 2009. So we have different throughput systems from the 4,000 to the 8,000, and in 2009 we were successful at placing 6,000 cobas 6000 systems, which really is a surrogate for suggesting that we have an extremely large installed and reliable base out there. And we also rolled , and this was also impacting our cost of sales line in 2009, the new cobas 8000 module, which is our high volume system for our highest end lab customers and we're in the beginning of that rollout as we go into different countries and different modules. But the important of this is twofold.</p>
          <p>But the important of this is twofold. Number one, once you get an instrument into the lab, as you know, it's a razor-razor blade model. It becomes very difficult to displace that instrument, and it allows you to put menu on that &#x2013; innovative menu with quick update. The second thing it does in terms of being a good partner to Pharma, is what Pharma wants when they launch a product that needs a companion diagnostics, is a large installed base because they want this test to be available to patients readily, highly reproducible, so it doesn't have to be sent into a central lab somewhere in a particular country, but they want it close to the patients. And this type of installed base gives us that advantage and is one of the reasons why that we're quite successful in our Pharma partnerships in and out of Roche.</p>
          <p>The second key unique value I think in Diagnostics as we move forward for a industry that accounts for about two to 3% of the overall healthcare budget, but is used in more than 60 to 70% of patient decisions, is to say how do you become more and more effective at determining either which patients will progress on disease or benefit from therapy. And I just take one example from our Molecular Diagnostics business. This is HPV, which today is one of the largest assays in molecular diagnostics and growing at a very fast rate and still at the beginning of its penetration stage. We launched in 2009, a system in Europe and we'll be filing that system in the United States this year for introduction next year on HPV. And in combination with that system, we just completed enrolling one of the largest clinical trials that's ever been done in Diagnostics. In fact, we enrolled 47,000 women into this trial to demonstrate the value and significance of our HPV assay. And in particular what we're looking to do here is improve obviously the ability to intervene and reduce the cases of cervical cancer in woman. And the uniqueness of our assay, in relation to those that are already on the marketplace, is that we're able to discriminate HPV 16 and 18, which as you know the vaccines are also going after. And the reason they're going after those specific genotypes is because they account for more than 70% of the cervical cancer that is progressed in women today.</p>
          <p>So the ability to both identify that, but also have the clinical data that links that to disease allows for intervention. And the ability to have a test that can be more specific than cytology and more specific than the tests out there in the marketplace because of its genotyping capabilities allows us to introduce to the marketplace a product that has good clinical value, but also with the utility of this test also has a Pharmacoeconomic value because you can take an annual pap smear test and turn that into with the specificity of this test possibly a cycle where you go to every three years of testing in women the ability to determine their progression in cervical cancer. So this just tells you a bit about the uniqueness of what we're doing in terms of investing in medical value for the future and why we also feel confident in the future about our ability to grow faster than the marketplace.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, this is what we intend to and are committed to doing in 2010, which is to continue to roll out both platforms and assays on our instrument base out there. And you can see that we stand firmly behind the commitment to grow the Diagnostics division faster than the marketplace in 2010.</p>
          <p>So thank you for your attention today. I hope you're walking away from here with an increased understanding for Diagnostics and how it's uniquely positioned within Roche to contribute to personalized healthcare and also to advances in Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>With that I will turn it over to Erich Hunziker to cover the financial.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, it's great to be back here. And looking into this room it also tells me how 12 months can make a big, big difference. Many familiar faces still here, but if you remember 12 months, just 12 months ago, this room was absolutely crowded with people. Of course, we were also presenting the 2008 results, but on the top of all minds were two things, will the tender offer we just had launched for Genentech be finally successful and can these guys finance this huge transaction? And I can tell you, it was different waking up this morning than 12 months ago. I first had to do 12 months ago, about six meetings with potential bond investors trying to convince them, that yet we will come to the market with bond emissions.</p>
          <p>And the nice thing is 12 months later this is all almost anecdotal and it's almost history. The good news is that the facts and figures as a result have all followed more or less best case of our plans and not only base case of our plans. Yes, we were forced to raise 48 billion of debt for this transaction, but the good news which you have seen shows the first seven billion were gone after six months and another seven billion will just be gone in the next two months. So 25% of this whole debt raising will just be eliminated more or less 12 months after we did this historic transaction. And this was of course, possible also due to an extremely strong free cash production of this company.</p>
          <p>The other element, of course, is that once we had the cash in our hands, I wouldn't say on a bank account, we could see a total shift in the brains of the former Genentech shareholders. They wanted this cash as quickly as possible. So the deal was closed, we've got 99.7%. And what you can see as a result, this deal was accretive from the first day on to the Roche shareholders.</p>
          <p>So if we look at the figures, and at this point in time I know you have studied these figures upside down, I won't go here into the details, but I want to go to the underlying situation. This Genentech transaction was not only meant to actually bring the excellent profits, which formally flew to the Genentech minority shareholders to the Roche shareholders. This has a much more strategic aim also to allow us to bring the global company into one area, and if you look at it from a cost perspective finally also to streamline the cost base as we had done it all over the world outside the United States.</p>
          <p>If you go through the various cost elements in an underlying picture we can now proudly say and if I say we are industry leading in certain fields, this will never mean that we stop improving but  it's an encouragement I think if you go into our costs of sales and our production cost, and if you see that we have now reached a level of 13% for our production cost and that we have reduced the number of production sites to just around 25, all of which are just strategic and some last ones marked for divestiture or closure you see how we think about cost structure. It needs many, many, many steps over many years to have clear goals and targets and then you can achieve it.</p>
          <p>And very similar efforts are being done in the M&amp;D field, and I think you can also benchmark the D&amp;A cost and will find out that step by step we are moving into the top quartile leading position, not only of the healthcare industry. I still think we have to benchmark ourself to much tougher industries like consumer electronics, car companies because these companies reflect the reality of the 21st Century. Their cost pressures are just everywhere and constantly increasing, and I think that's the only mental model which is allowed also for a healthcare company to operate.</p>
          <p>If you look at the margins, the good news is that even in a volatile environment, pharmaceutical has been again for the eighth consecutive year able to increase the margins and is now in the top quartile, but still we are committed to step by step improve our positions, and I think you have seen a new face, new energy and new ambition in Diagnostics and I have no fear that our ambitions to bring this Diagnostics division margin up are totally in line between Dan and myself.</p>
          <p>So back to the Genentech transaction, which to a large part is history and has helped us to gain new energy on a global basis. This is the one-time effect of this transaction. The good news is also almost no differences between what we have communicated to you at the half year results. We knew Genentech very well and, therefore, we could do very good integration planning and also planning of the related synergies.</p>
          <p>It's actually amazing that at such results conference we do not talk too much about the world economy. Healthcare is one of the very, very few sectors which is not so brutally affected by the global economy like most other industries or services. The field where we feel this high &#x2013; okay &#x2013; that's a clever way I assume this is a mobile phone tone, if it's not okay.</p>
          <p>So the only place where we feel the volatility of the environment is the currencies. If you look at the currency development, I don't have to tell you some of you are very close to this. This is not &#x2013; we are back to the time where the fortune hunters are surfing volatilities, and wherever any uncertainties emerging, the volatilities are enforced by trading around it.</p>
          <p>And that's of course what then also hits most of the currencies we are exposed to and things as our CEO has mentioned the Swiss franc seems still to be quite solid rock in all this environment. Most of the currencies have actually become weaker during the year and therefore affected our results.</p>
          <p>If we go to the financial income, you see of course at the core the huge part of the Genentech financing cost and for those who are interested about our bond raisings, you find all the details for every single bond in the financial report. I think our assessment last year, when we raised this bond, that the first three years we kept the interest rate floating but we have fixed all the longer-term bonds, and by the way, we have also swapped and fixed everything, which was not U.S. dollar at the beginning into U.S. dollars for the life of the bonds.</p>
          <p>And the fact that we in the end resulted with 4.6% of interest expenses pre-taxes for all these bonds shows you I think that we have gotten a time window of opportunity where we raised this money, and as I said, you will see we're paying this debt down.</p>
          <p>But this huge block in the center does not mean that we are not focusing on all the other elements of our Treasury or pension funds, but as most of you know also if you keep the same risk profile in today's low interest environment, it's difficult to get returns, but all together I think my Treasury team has worked also quite well.</p>
          <p>If we come to that tax rate, I've given you the guidance sometimes ago that for a group of our size at 22 to 24% tax rate should guide you in your modeling to be on the safe side.</p>
          <p>Good news this year that we slightly were at the lowest end of this corridor with 21.5% and of course with many of these exceptional items having a positive tax effect, the effective tax rate was even with 16.8% at a very lower rate, but please don't just extrapolate this one into the future. And that's the overall P&amp;L and where you have all the details and where you can see that the deal was already accretive to Genentech transaction with plus 940 Roche shareholders contributing a lot.</p>
          <p>If we go to the cash flow, and those who know me a little bit closer, they know that my thinking is totally around cash accounting is a necessary evil, but cash tells you the reality of a company. So if you see that we generated 15.7 billion of operating free cash flow, ladies and gentlemen, in an environment of 2009, I think this shows you that this management team together with all the employees worldwide are really focused on cash and cash generation. And the free cash flow generated of 8.9, I think this also is a clear commitment here that nobody is playing around with working capital, that we really work on our accounts receivable and I have to say one of our biggest weaknesses was accounts payable. We are still trying to educate our people not to pay too early as it is a basic, maybe attitude in Europe.</p>
          <p>So the good news is that we ended the year where we actually spent 52.8 billion with a net debt of 23.9 billion, and we remain fully committed that the latest in 2015 we will be net cash positive. Liquidity, and here of course you will understand the whole planning of our liquidity for the Genentech transaction had various criteria. We didn't want to bet the ranch. We knew that the company would have to go on even if we would have stock &#x2013; get stock into the nowhere man's land between having 75 and 90% of Genentech, and when we planned for the liquidity of the Genentech transaction, no Tamiflu, swine flu was on the horizon.</p>
          <p>So the good news is that our liquidity position, together with this very strong operating free cash flow, is much better than planned. You see we have liquids fund of 18.5 billion and yet, within the next two months we have to repay 6.2 billion of the one-year bonds. We have to finance the dividend, the interest, the one-year interest on the bond. But what you can see is that we're absolutely under no liquidity constraints. On the contrary, we just grabbed around 300 million of longer-term bonds which were available on the market and have taken them back. This also means that if strategic opportunities come up either in Pharma or Diagnostics, this group is absolutely not blocked to go and to strengthen our position, may this be geographically or may this be with products or with any kind of interesting high-tech technology.</p>
          <p>If we go to the equity and here just in the matter of transparency this was one aspect also again back to accounting, if you already control the majority of a company, if you then take it private, since you already owned all the goodwill, since you already consolidated 100% of the intangibles, all the impact goes to equity so this transaction has consumed, to a certain extent, the equity of the Roche Group but we are rebuilding it very quickly. You have seen between July last year and end of December already we have added five billion to our equity line. So we are also not worried. This is a situation which is totally transparent for our partners at the rating agencies, and this development is much better than in the base case we had for the transaction.</p>
          <p>So this leads me to the dividend, and as I said in London, at least here the solidity of the Swiss francs should be positive for you because if you get six Swiss francs I think it's a nice amount in U.S. dollars. And to come back to the outlook, here we confirm our commitment into the future as it has been laid out by our CEO and in the interest of time and to allow for your questions, I'm not going to read it again. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Erich. Before we go into the Q&amp;A, let me apologize here and it's actually not the first time this year, I completely forgot to introduce the new faces on the podium, Dan O'Day and Pascal Soriot. We have been working together so closely already for months, that sometimes I will forget when we appear somewhere like here today in New York for the first time.</p>
          <p>Dan O'Day has been the head of our Molecular Diagnostics business before he took over as head for the Diagnostics business at the beginning of this year, succeeding J&#xFC;rgen Schwiezer. And Pascal Soriot actually has been responsible worldwide for our commercial operations, sales and marketing for the Pharma division before he took over as CEO of Genentech. Last year he was responsible for the Genentech integration, which he completed successfully together with Art Levinson in 2009. And he took over from Bill Burns as you know beginning of this year. So I'm very pleased to be here with the new team and get the first questions.</p>
          <p>Do we have a question. Yes, please.</p>

          <p>Thank you, probably for Daniel. Can you speak a little about what's happening in the 454 business, the stimulus in the U.S. has allowed some groups to purchase gene sequencers. Where does Roche stand in terms of developing next generation sequencers and what have you seen in terms of organizations looking to buy 454 versus competitor products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Thanks for the question. My microphone's on? Okay, our sequencing technology is the 454 technology, as you know, and just to comment first a little bit on the 2009 performance of 454. I think we did well. The economic environment, as you say, was a little bit flat for the purchase of sequencing instruments. However going into 2010, we expect also some stimulus to be able to increase the spending on sequencers and that's also why we're encouraged. We'll be launching, in addition to our core system, next year we'll be launching the GS Junior FLX which is basically a smaller version of our sequencer, allows us to penetrate further into the marketplace the smaller -- the smaller research labs, more flexible labs and allows us to take advantage of that in the future. So we feel confident that the sequencing business that we have in 454 will continue to evolve, and it will continue to play a key role in that field moving forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Charlie Gushee from Auerbach Grayson. One for maybe Pascal Soriot. On your synergies guidance at something like 2.5% of sales, would you give us an indication on what the driver is behind that? Is that Pharma manufacturing or is that something else and could you characterize anything strategically that might be a focus to try and increase that number? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe I would ask Erich also to comment, if you want, Erich? But the driver is actually multifactorial. There is indeed a big part that comes out of manufacturing costs in three ways. One is optimizing of our capacity. As you probably know, we closed Vacaville 2, one of the Genentech biologic plants, which is a non-cash item but it's a big part of the one-time cost and moving forward really helps us reduce the cost of goods because this capacity that was planned in days when the yield for Herceptin and Avastin were much lower. We didn't need the capacity. So part is capacity management, closing this and also other plants around the world.</p>
          <p>Two is, I guess, leveraging our purchasing capacity worldwide. And three is our ongoing efforts productivity improvements throughout the whole network. So a big piece is manufacturing indeed; and another big piece is administration. That includes relocating the U.S. headquarters from Nutley, New Jersey, to San Francisco. That includes merging our administration infrastructure, our system our staff and everything in the United States and also achieving savings on a global basis. So administration cost reduction is a big part, and you see it already in the 2009 P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And then there is a series of other items. We have commercial synergies that are more limited, of course, because in the U.S. the Roche U.S. was a smaller organization and so the synergies there are a little bit more limited, but they exist. And then we have synergies in development, global et cetera. So it's coming from all the functions but very much a big piece out of manufacturing and another big one out of admin overall. In terms of whether we want to revise these numbers, I think we stick to these numbers for the time being. Erich, if you want to add anything, I don't think we have an intent to give any other indication.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's an excellent list. What I would add is the closing of a R&amp;D site in Palo Alto, which of course if you close a full-fledged R&amp;D site and move and we didn't actually close the related R&amp;D projects. They were actually transferred to Nutley. But this of course also gives a very nice fixed cost reduction if you have the elimination of the whole site.</p>
          <p>And what you really can be assured, prior to the transaction we had a target list of these synergies, which were specific. For instance, in my area we knew exactly that we would integrate Roche Treasury and we knew exactly how many head count the target organization would have, and this was the fine print of the synergy planning. And I can tell you Severin himself, as the CEO, was very after it that whatever had been handed in as an argument for this transaction in the part of synergies was also delivered.</p>
          <p>And the good news is really -- and this has of course also to do that we had worked with this company together for 20 years, that our planning was so solid that we can confirm that all these synergies are realized and the advantage against the base case is that the timing of the synergies was much quicker than planned. I mean the base case planning of this transaction was that it would have lasted 12 months, let's say the fight of taking it private and then more than two years to realize the synergies and then we did the transaction in nine months and you have seen the planning just in three months. So, I think cost-wise or value wise for this group the net present values of these synergies is definitely better than planned, but in absolute terms this end number of one billion is definitely the right number.</p>
          <p>Why can't we speed up the last part of this billion like we had already the first 300 million last year? They are related to really production site closing and you know if you do this around the world you have negotiations with unions and this was all done, everybody is informed and so the last part of the synergies will be delivered to when the production sites are closed as planned 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And maybe one point also to add is that moving forward really our intent is not to kind of go back and look at synergies and revisit them. It doesn't mean we are not going to look at cost reductions. Of course we will look at cost reductions and we do it on a constant, on a kind of continuous basis. What we decided to do though is that we are now one company and we are no longer talking about merger, we are not talking about two companies merging, synergies. And talking about synergies reminds people of a merger constantly and it's in a way a little bit divisive.</p>
          <p>So we thought, okay, we are now one company and we have productivity programs across whole functions. Every function, from development, commercial, manufacturing has metrics, in term of productivity improvement, they have their own programs. But this is like part of the new company. So we don't really track synergies anymore.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I have a question about ocrelizumab, specifically what do you need to see in the full Phase II data for -- sorry, it's Joel Sendek from Lazard. What do you need to see in the full Phase II data to make your decision to go into Multiple Sclerosis? And what, can you give us any clue as to what kind of trial design that would be? And then I quickly on Tarceva, since they pushed back the PDUFA date, I'm wondering, given the way the panel meeting went, what might you be able to show the FDA to change their mind? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ocrelizumab, the one thing I can tell you is the data we have seen and that we'll be presenting in the not-too-distant future are very, very strong and very supportive of us moving forward with this agent in Phase III. So this is a decision that we still have to make. Are we going to prorate it in Phase III and course we have to decide this to get outside the United States, decide it with our partner. But very strong data and very likely to move it forward in Phase III.</p>
          <p>So in terms of Tarceva, of course and we are in discussions with the FDA. Together with OSI we submitted additional data to the FDA as you probably know. In the end, our contention is, our point is that the end point was met. And if you agree on an end point with the FDA and you meet it, then of course, we're discussing the strength of the clinical signal after the event and having reached the endpoint is a bit of a difficult situation. So our position is, of course, the end point was met and therefore the product should be approved. The committee had different views as to the strength of the clinical signal. We are hopeful that FDA will conclude that indeed we hit the end point and we should get approval. Dan, do you want to add anything else to that.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Okay, and we have a question here please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where were pharmacy -Pharma inventory levels before you decided to take them down to 30 days?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, actually I should look at the &#x2013; we should look at the U.S. and then the non-U.S. part and in fact the non-U.S. part is actually more the emerging market. So if you look at the United States, both Roche and Genentech had different policies, inventory policies in the trade. And Roche had slightly higher inventory than Genentech had actually. And so as we analyzed the supply chain and the distribution of our products, we concluded we could reduce inventory. And in fact what we have reached is an inventory in the trade that is lower for both the Roche and the Genentech products. For the Genentech products, I would say we had a slight reduction of about a couple of days on average. It varied by product but on average a couple of days. For the Roche products, it probably was more around a week to 10 days depending on the product.</p>
          <p>So overall now what we have is, we have ranges &#x2013; target ranges if you want of course, we don't have a specific number of these, but we have target ranges. And those ranges are for many of our products between 12 and 15 days of inventory in the distribution channel and for some other products we have 17 to 20 days. But for most of our products for the biggest part of our turnover in the U.S,. we have target ranges from 12 to 15, which actually is the reason why we're telling you a bit earlier, we're probably one of the companies in the industry with the lowest inventory level in the trade.</p>
          <p>Now if I look at outside the U.S., as we didn't do -we didn't change anything in Europe. We looked at essentially markets that a few years ago, essentially didn't have distribution systems that were too efficient. So you tended to have like 40 days, 45 days of inventory in a distributor because China is a big country and was not so sophisticated. And I guess we never really completely reassessed that and the merger was an opportunity for us to reassess that.</p>
          <p>And so in a number of countries, we've reduced to 30 days because we've concluded we don't need more than 30 days or these countries are not sophisticated enough. So that concerns China, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, Turkey, Russia. And in Venezuela, for instance, we reduced the inventory that the government is holding. And Venezuela is not a big country, but it is relatively big in terms of exposure for us. And as you know, the risk in Venezuela is suddenly you are end up being paid in devalued currency. So reducing inventory at the level of the government warehouses is really helping reducing our exposure devalued payables.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt Vetto from Douglas Lane &amp; Associates. I had a question about your HPV test. You indicate you launched in the EU at the end of last year, I guess. I just wonder if you could give us any kind of early read on how that market's developing &#x2013; what's &#x2013; has there been any competitive response and I think you show that the penetration around 10%, what's your outlook for where that can go over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, so we launched literally in November and December last year, with HPV and CT/NG in Europe, Australia, New Zealand were some of the forward countries. The HPV market today is predominantly a U.S. market. It's at the early stages of penetration outside the U.S. Outside the U.S. is predominantly a cytology market today. So in fact the assay that's growing more rapidly in the system we just launched in Europe is CT/NG, and HPV is still coming up to speed.</p>
          <p>The differentiating factor on the HPV side, in terms of the United States launch, again we'll file that product in the middle of this year expect a P&amp;A  that would put us into 2011 for a launch. Again, we are the only system today that allows in one run, with one sample, to both identify the 13 high risk subtypes, but to discriminate 16 and 18. Today what you have to do is run first the sample on the system. If it's positive for one of the high risks, you have to reflex it to a linear array test. So first of all there's a work flow advantage, we feel good about entering market into. And secondly, it's just the clinical data. The ability to &#x2013; this would &#x2013; really the results of the ATHENA trial will be &#x2013; well, they'll start to be released at Eurogen this month in February, at the HPV meeting in the middle of this year. We'll work with our thought leaders on that. But stay tuned because I think we'll have some interesting data around the ability for genotyping to be able to be very competitive in an adjunct screening population, but also potentially a primary screening possibility.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Do we have another question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just like to ask a question about Tamiflu because if I look at your company, it seems one that has a very clear plan in terms of its main drugs, but you seem to get waylaid every so often by what happens with Tamiflu? I'm just kind of curious how you plan for that and what you're looking at for the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is indeed very difficult to predict Tamiflu and the 1.2 billion, which we have given to you, is really an estimate. It's a best estimate at the time. I remind you in Q3, we gave you an estimate of 2.7 billion for Tamiflu and it was really our best estimate, and it came out 500 million higher just in the timeframe of one quarter. So it is a best estimate. It very much depends on how the virus will develop, whether we'll see another pandemic. It could be higher, it could be lower.</p>
          <p>Now the underlying assumptions behind this estimate with all the caveats is about half of it -- 55% of it related to pandemic sales and actually a big portion of the pandemic orders is already in house. So I'm pretty confident on that part. The rest is seasonal sales, and that will entirely depend on whether we have the season, whether it is all this year or whether it goes partly into the next year and how strong it will be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just add also that the best &#x2013; the way we plan is that we know you can't plan actually, and we try to be as flexible as we can, because the reality is that the person who can actually predict the way the virus is going to travel, how bad it's going to be, how quickly it will spread. The person who can predict this doesn't exist. As you probably know, there is a big controversy in Europe now that has developed, people claiming that maybe this pandemic was kind of a fake pandemic and the governments overreacted, et cetera, et cetera, buying vaccines in excess what they needed.</p>
          <p>And of course with hindsight, everybody is always very smart. But I can tell you that talking to expert epidemiologists, virologists and others before -- in the midst of the pandemic, people were extremely concerned. And a lot of people died. Fewer people died than the epidemiologists had forecasted, but telling you a lot of people died and it's very, very difficult predicting these things. So we are very flexible, we have a network of manufacturers that we partner with and we can vary the volume of production very quickly and very flexibly. And quite frankly, we were able to react to the rapidly escalating demand very, very quickly. But it is very difficult to predict what a flu season will look like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean from value generation position I think this is a very underestimated drug. Everybody always said, without Tamiflu calculated out, but ladies and gentlemen altogether Roche has now sold over 10 billion in Tamiflu. This will go into the history as one of the most successful drugs ever in absolute terms of peaks achieved, and I mean what is fascinating is that the team &#x2013; the fixed cost of the team Pascal actually had to manage this around the world is single, single numbers, as he rightly so not even 10 people who have done this. And as he rightly pointed out. you have never seen any fixed cost or any impairments for production capacities we closed. There we have also learned to really be virtual and that we don't have to have everything in-house, 64 contract manufacturers, because this is an over capacity and now the core competence in the global markets; and I think out of this we have learned a lot. And the good news is if you now have followed the whole discussions around the swine flu, there's a huge difference between Tamiflu and any vaccine. Tamiflu has a shelf life of seven years and if we are lucky it works in many, many varieties of flu's and vaccine by definition is something specific with a relatively short shelf life. And therefore we are committed to always, should society need it, to produce it in a quantity of society needs it on a very short term.</p>
