          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Nordea First Quarter Report 2011 Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Alfv&#xE9;n. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Thank you and welcome to this telephone conference where we will present the first quarter report. With me I have Fredrik Rystedt, CFO, and also Ari Kaperi, CRO, and then also at the later stage, we'll be joined by our CEO and Group President Mr. Christian Clausen. Yes, Fredrik, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rodney. I will start by presenting, of course, the first quarter results and we are happy to present another solid quarter. And as you can see from slide four, we maintained a very high income level close to that or slightly higher than that of Q4. The profits before loan losses increased and risk adjusted profit grew by significant numbers both in terms of Q4 and compared to also Q1 of 2010. As you can see from slide five, we maintain a high business activity in all segments of the bank.</p>
          <p>We have a specific &#x2013; a good contribution from the core relationship segment on the household side on the Private Banking and Gold customers and on the corporate side of the very large and the large customers. That is, of course, a positive thing from the first quarter and it has not necessarily being a good or easy environment, but we have maintained that high activity level.</p>
          <p>So turning to the different individual income lines. Let me talk about our net interest income. As you can see, we declined somewhat by 3% in the absolute numbers. But the underlying customer areas produced very good results. Particularly, we had good improvements of the margins and the deposits volumes, margin from deposits have continued to increase. And we also had a flat or slightly positive margin development in our lending activity. Lending development in general was quite flat, slightly up.</p>
          <p>Little bit lower growth than we have seen in previous quarters on the household side with an annualized growth rate of approximately 4%. We have been more or less flat in the corporate side and what is notable there is very large and cash rich CMB customers are basically not growing, whilst the small and medium and some of the large are actually having or showing reasonably good activity.</p>
          <p>The underlying, as I said, is positive and clearly growing, but there are two factors that have caused the decline. Consumer banking is a considerable factor and we've also adapted our risk position in treasury and we are now funding our liquidity buffer in a -- with a longer maturity, so we've increased that in line with our liquidity within the framework. And we also have a net utilization of the Board mandates in treasury, so we've prolonged our short funding positions, bit more in anticipation of higher interest rates on the short terms that increased value going forward.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page 7, the bridge didn't change in net income. These trends are very clearly noticeable, You can see that we have a slightly negative volume contribution from lending. And the reason is very simple, it's basically that we have a slight decline on the corporate side, and the corporate side is typically high margin business and, of course, slightly bigger increase in the household side with lower margin. That's why we have a marginally negative contribution from volume, while you can clearly see the improvement in margin from the profit side and also from the household lending side. And the biggest, of course, negative factor there is the group treasury line and, of course, the banking debt.</p>
          <p>The change of position and neutralization of the interest rate, the exposure and treasury on the liquidity buffer and the short funding has also caused the underlying interest rate exposure to increase, so 100 basis points increase in market rate is now equal to &#x20AC;540 million of increased net interest income that should occur and, of course, the only change versus the previous approximately 500 is basically the risk in treasury that will now increase.</p>
          <p>Turning to net fees and commissions, it remains on a high level in historic terms and, of course, as you're aware of in the fourth quarter is typically a strong quarter with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (6:41), which is not the case in the first quarter. But these are seasonal effects, though. So the overall activity is quite strong and we have actually had, in previous quarters, very strong performance also in our different sums, but you can see a 9% more composite index out form in the last 36 months. And we also have good and continued strong momentum in our Life &amp; Pension business, so we had a year-on-year increase in premiums on the Life business, which is 17% higher than we had in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Net fees and commission, that's partly contributed to strong development basic commissions. We had good development in fair value. The underlying customer areas continue to perform well although the graph on slide 10 would suggest slightly differently. But the reason why the underlying customer area result is down is because of the very strong performance we had relating to specific items in Q4 and mainly <mark type="ph" /> Pandora (7:55) transaction was the biggest part and, of course, that's not present in Q1. So the underlying performance is strong and we have a good, generally good performance in the market, unallocated profits. We also had very strong results and with corporate center in Europe.</p>
          <p>Turning to expenses, down adjusted for the pension cost we had in Q4 and the FX, which is also shifted between Q1 and Q4. Expenses are down with 6%. And year-on-year, the expense growth is approximately 9% but a very significant portion of that is relating to currency 4%, as you can see on slide 11, and, of course, another big portion of it is the number of staff, which has increased by 2%. Also one thing maybe to bear in mind if you compare first quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2011 is that we have throughout the year of 2010 increased our investment in the group initiative's investment program and, of course, there is full effect in Q1 2011 and very little of that in Q1 2010.</p>
          <p>Also, there is Risk Weighted Assets in the Core Tier 1 ratio developed in a favorable way, as you can see on slide 12. Risk Weighted Assets excluding transition rules decreased by close to 2%. It has to do with several different things. First of all, we had an improved credit quality and cost migration and we also were engaged in Risk Weighted optimization as we were also in 2010, but we had a good quarter in first quarter of 2011. And one particular issue, which was notable in Q4, was that we had a lot of credit commitments and lending out of the international branches, mainly for Nordea customers, but the international network that we run is still un-standardized while the rest, majority of the rest of the bank is on internal rating model. So that was a specific thing having a negative effect on Risk Weighted Assets in Q4 whilst we don't have that in Q1.</p>
          <p>So in summary, core tier one ratio grew by 36 basis points and you can see the contribution &#x2013; the biggest contribution is, of course, from the net result that we also have gains from Risk Weighted Assets, efficiently, and credit quality, standardized approach being that. It is a lot of, of course, focus on capital in more general terms and we have strength and we are one of the stronger capitalized banks.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 gives a good illustration also of another characteristic of Nordea. We do generate a lot of equity. So that equity generation allows us quite a considerable flexibility in adjusting to whatever capital requirement that may be out there as we go forward. The growth rate in core equity has been 9%, that's the dividend that issue of the period from 2006, so a very strong equity generation.</p>
          <p>Just turn a little bit to also the underlying business. Of course, most of the income growth generated for the mid-quarter, but also historically has been from very strong customer acquisition trends in the deeper penetration on the customer base that we have been viewing. We have been &#x2013; we have an award winning value proposition and we have continued with that value proposition to gain additional customers. So, 47,000 new customers in the first quarter and actually an increase of 6% per annum as in 2007. So that trend clearly continues also in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On the corporate side, it's a good example of where we have been able to with ancillary business strengthen the income or the revenue trends for the CMB business. So you can clearly see what the strategy has delivered from 2008 to 2010. You can see the number of lead relationships to large customers, for instance, in this example on slide 15. In Sweden that's gone from 31% to 43%. So 43% of major customers are actually naming Nordea as their primary bank. And as you can see that has had a very positive revenue development or impact for us in 2011, and that has been done without actually doing more lending so that income growth period comes from ancillary business, which is a very, very positive thing from a return perspective and from capital efficiency perspective. And with those words, I leave over to Ari.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fredrik. Now moving to credit quality, excellent team in our net loan loss saved 20 basis points, which is at the low level that's below our average expected losses to a cycle, which is 25 basis points. What was the extra ordinary item in Q1 loan losses was our share or contribution <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:01). That was a default of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:09) with cost paid assets at &#x20AC;67 million. In both things we already know score bigger net loan losses of the reverse of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:21) with the new loan losses.</p>
          <p>Page 18, you see that the continuing trend of improved rate quality measures by corporate credit rating. So continue those in Q1, contributing a positive credit migration contributed 0.6 &#x2013; 0.3% as a reduction of the assets. And now all in all more than 70% of our customers <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:53). You see on page 19 that in Q1 we rewrite this roughly 10% of our corporate customers. So Q1 is some rewriting activity in the first quarter usually is quite low. The activity is picking up in Q2, in fact still in Q1, we show that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:21) 10% were rewriting customers were up. But we see some customers falling in the poor situation so that our down rate representing 4%.</p>
          <p>Page 20, there you see our costs at loan loss phase reverse of and net loan loss of 242. Different than the net loan loss, which you see in P&amp;L that going on. Back of that group you can see that now actually it was a reduction of a new loan loss fees in Q1, it was three to five if you exclude the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:57) factor, which is lower than in the previous quarters. Also reverse of other earlier maybe collected information was a little bit lower but still &#x20AC;150 million. You can see the split of loan loss business, loan loss fees at various areas, geographies and then you see that the pattern, this pattern has continued now for two, three quarters so you will see quite the flow of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:35) customers, or customers we make loan loss provision in Denmark, coming from it's a mini segment mainly that continue to level out at this point, nevertheless coming down from the previous levels.</p>
          <p>In European market, which covers both Poland and Russia, we had even positive loan loss in Sweden, practically nothing in Finland, very small ones happening this quarter in Norway, actually we had two individual bigger corporate customer cases, which almost made the loan loss provision amount in Norway. Without those two cases, Norwegian cases would have been close to zero.</p>
          <p>Page 21, here is now what is happening in our total allowance season and loans that is very typical for this business margin cycle, so that been into lower profit, you can see that the actually now we move collective provisions to individual provisions. The total amount is unchanged more or less. It was, of course, early in the cycle we could identify those customers. There is a need to reach loan loss provision before we make collective provisions and now we can see those customers and we move into individual provisions.</p>
          <p>And that is the factor, which is influencing our interest loans, interest loans are up, because then when we enter individual customer loans to the whole loan amount it's getting <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:20). When we make collective provisions there is no loan volume attached.</p>
          <p>That was more or less the figures and risks. Then if we move a little bit to our current position and how we are preparing for the future challenges. Turning to page 23, it is familiar to you, there is no need to go through it in details. But we have conducted our relationship strategy, and then we are continuing to do that, it's delivering. What we are doing on top of this is very difficult. It's on page 24. We have upgraded and invested a lot on a new platform. That means we have invested our infrastructures in IT, also in administrative processes, also in our trading IT platforms and so forth. That goes also for product platforms, we have integrated our savings offerings. We have done to coordinate these multi-channel offering comprising branches, Net bank and call centers. And then we had also scaled up our big product solutions <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:47). Also we have done mostly in our distribution capabilities, new customer acquisition, branch network moved more and more towards separating the buys and daily service at our branches and so forth.</p>
          <p>It is important that upgrading the platform, and moving to page 25, actually, our customers have acknowledged this and rewarded us strongly that we have improved market positions, but first of all we have also improved our productivity and efficiency. Our risk profile has maintained low and has delivered very strong financials.</p>
          <p>A few words on each of these points on the following pages. Starting from the customer acknowledgement, you see a lot of information on this page showing that customers are rewarding us. We can see the increased customer satisfaction index in absolute terms. Also related to our peers. We have improved our rankings in the equity offerings. We have increased our market shares in household lending, private banking. The management, they have grown substantially and so forth and so on.</p>
          <p>And then what is &#x2013; what is very important item for us to improve on for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:29) fee is an achievement with this improved productivity. And you can see from figures on page 27 that we have been able to increase business volumes income for customer for <mark type="ph" /> FDE (19:53). And also very importantly our amount of manual transactions in the branch network has brought down, a very important driver for cost efficiency.</p>
          <p>Page 28 is important to realize that our loan credit risk profile, what we have outlined in terms of our risk <mark type="ph" /> appetite (20:20) in terms of losses, 25 basis points, has worked well. So that two of these economic cycles we have been able to perform within our expected and wanted risk appetites in terms of losses. So even in the adverse times in 2009, yes, naturally, we were above this 25 basis points, but not so much and then even in those years our profit generation was more than enough to cover these increasing losses so that there was not even a quarter where we were even close to that provide right figures.</p>
          <p>The strong financials a factor, you know our own <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:06) target is risk-adjusted profit, both our shareholder return, it's a return on equity, and then you see the stages on the following pages, risk-adjusted profit. We are moving closer and closer to target line, of course, when we hit the target market business, business cycle was different and now that the main reason that we are behind the target line is, of course, is low interest rates, which we are living now in with effect in as well as the increased funding costs recent events that have happened.</p>
          <p>As we are one of the few banks which has been able to provide positive shareholder return in a great deal of time, as you can see in the next quarter. Moving to ROE on page 30, as you can see that in every year our ROE has been better than average of our peers and within our target. And throughout this period, actually, we are number one in terms of ROE, among our peers. Why this ROE is coming down from the high levels we started in 2007 or why is it in the low level? Actually we now hold much more equity. Yes, we still have more loan loss than in 2007. We have higher taxes. As you can see, we have been able to compensate quite much of these additional factors by improved profit, with a strong signal of our profit generation.</p>
          <p>And with these words, I have to over pass to you, Fred.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ari. As Ari has described, we have spent several years in building a very strong platform that has delivered and inline with our targets and expectations, but it is also clear that the environment going forward will change as it already has in the last year or so, and, of course, bringing additional costs and capital requirement to the banking sector at large and, of course, Nordea is no exception. So, looking at slide 32, you can see that already we have increased the capital from 7.5% or so in 2007 to the 10.7% you see in this slide. Liquidity offers considerably close to 20, is the &#x20AC;60 billion that we have at this point in time. And, of course, also extended our maturity profile with considerable cost as a consequence.</p>
          <p>Now, of course, looking at this going forward our estimate is that the best performing banks in Europe will be able to perform somewhere around 15% and we are committed to remain in that top league of European banks and also, of course, committed to take the necessary actions required to maintain that position. As already explained we have been performing in the top league of return equity and we are committed to stay in that end. If you look at the graph on slide 33 you can see that we are largely unchanged in the return on equity side. During that period of time we had a lot of additional funding cost. Just to illustrate, of course, what Ari already mentioned, we have been able to compensate through more activities and, of course, also a lot of more efficiency and productivity.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we will focus more on both capital and cost efficiency and if I stay on the capital efficiency for a second, there are a lot of activities and things we are able to do to offset the negative implications that new regulation will entail.</p>
          <p>First of all, we are &#x2013; we have applied for advanced IRB in our corporate portfolio, which we expect to get to &#x2013; receive approval of in the first part of next year. We believe we have significant efficiency gains, as we've also had in the past, to be able to optimize the uses of Risk Weighted Assets in the group.</p>
          <p>There are mitigation &#x2013; mitigating actions that we can do, less capital intensive solutions for our customers and, of course, other terms of risk weighted assets, efficiency initiatives, including data collection, sourcing, collateral registration, et cetera, and all sorts of other activities that we are &#x2013; have already embarked upon with more emphasizing as we go forward. And, of course, not least important, there will also be opportunities in more capitalized products.</p>
          <p>So these are just some examples of the initiatives that we are working on and we will be working on more. We look at cost as the same thing there. We have been generating a lot of our ability gains as we talked about before. We will increase the focus even further on cost efficiency and, of course, adjust the group's initiatives to mainly support also efficiency and, of course, not least, profitability and as a consequence the level of cost increase will be reduced during the second half and, of course, we continue to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:55) 2011.</p>
          <p>These are &#x2013; this is the focus as we go forward and one part of the this exercise was also a new organization that we can see on slide 36, and the purpose of this organization is to create an accountability and a possibility to further improve the efficiency, increase the return on equity and, of course, not least important, the customer relationship. And what it actually would entail is three main banks, one for retail banking, second one wholesale banking and as well as management. All these three parts will encompass or incorporate all parts of the value chain, making accountability and ability to focus on those issues much easier.</p>
          <p>And as a consequence also <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:58) that we shift, after more than 40 years with Nordea, Peter Schutze has decided to retire. We have chosen more members on the management that we see on page 37. Torsten Hagen J&#xF8;rgensen will be Head of Group Operations and Other Business Lines. Peter Nyegaard, Chief Operating Officer of Wholesale Banking, will join with the executive management from now on. This should help, of course. Schutze was instrumental to developing Nordea into what it is today and worked for more than 40 years for the bank, he's off to do other things.</p>
          <p>To summarize the presentation's key messages, the strong risk momentum continues as you have seen in all segments of the group. We have developed a strong platform and relationship strategy clearly delivered. We are now focusing to take Nordea into the new normal, meeting the challenges of the regulatory environment, and that we are committed to be in the top league of performers. And of course to do that, we are focusing very much on capital efficiency and cost efficiency leading to an excellent return on equity. And with those words, Rodney?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Alfv&#xE9;n. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question today from Nick Davey of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, good afternoon, I'm Nick Davey from UBS. Four very quick questions if I may. First, back to this RWA mitigation and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:39) you put out. Can I just clarify, is the constant here around offsetting around 100 basis points of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:46) sensitivity that you've guided to previously. Could you give us any more flavor around the key drivers here? Do we need to wait for AIRB to kick in so there is more of an early 2012 thing?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on household lending margins that you've mentioned are on the rise and it looks me predominantly happening in Norway. Could you just talk us through exactly what you're seeing in the segment there?</p>
          <p>The third question is on the liquidity portfolio, &#x20AC;56 billion or so. Can you give us any more granularity please as to how that is constituted between the various forms of liquidity and whether or not you will disclose that going forward?</p>
          <p>And finally just a bit more broadly this the topic of ROE delivery and new normal. Should we expect any more guidance from you in the second half of the year exactly how you intend to go about achieving or maintaining your position in the best league of banks? A little bit more color around intangible cost measures or I guess more tangible implications from the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:54)? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can start, Nick, with the Risk-Weighted Asset question. Of course we have guided you in terms 100 basis points on the pure mathematical impact about three and of course part of the story is to mitigate those but generally speaking we believe our capital efficiencies is key to generate return on equity. So AIRB is part of that equation and exactly what kind of impact that and other internal rate <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:26) or counter party risks there for instance how much that will bring is of course not 100% certain with that discussion with FSAs et cetera.</p>
          <p>But we have many, many different ways of working with Risk-Weighted Assets. Of course one is as I talked about capital Life products, another one is to secure that we have the  -- an adequate product mix for instance that we focus on those products that actually generate high return and that we price products that have the high capital consumption.</p>
          <p>So there are many, many different actual business things we can do. There are model things that we can do such as AIRB or internal risk-weighted models and there are fewer efficiency gains, such as distributing Risk-Weighted Assets where we are using internal base models in several standardized or registering of collaterals or others, and several type of things. So, our activities in here is not primarily or not only, if I can put it that way, designed to mitigate the bottom three impact but generally to support the ROE. But of course we will be back on the planning exercise later this year. I talked about households margins and the rise. You're right about Norway. The total margin is that I have mentioned in my dictation before it's slightly up and of course where it was up quite a lot was related to Norway and that was also some technical impact but typically household margins if anything are rather flat or slightly cost a bit. I think it's fair to say that we neither households or corporate lending is really fantastic in terms of generating high <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:32) of margins. It is basically so that we look at possibility on customer level but in individual products. So of course household and corporate should be maybe higher margins but for the time being at least the trend is more flattish if anything</p>
          <p>Liquidity portfolio, your third question there, we are not disclosing of course the individual holdings there but generally pretty much all of it is eligible for central banking. There is a lot of counter bonds, to some degree there is also government bonds so it's very, very highly liquid and penetrable papers in it. That we have also before stated we have no face exposure in there so it is &#x2013; it's basically no, nothing more specific to say about the liquidity portfolio.</p>
          <p>And the final question maybe the you'd like to take Christian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah we're looking on the new normal initiatives I do not want to see it as one plan. The large number of initiatives aren't over and we will of course compare it later in the year with more information. We're always initiating a number of things we're working within some of them in Q1, but in general we will shift the products and focus towards initiatives and activities, but increase capital efficiency and cost efficiency rather than adding more growth resources. And that also is growth initiatives, we really would keep most of them running and some of them are just getting a bit down or <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:27). But we will continue to build our platform as well and so it is a relative number of initiatives and a number of things. So I would compare it to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:40) later in the year but I think already now the picture is fairly clear. I mean you're saying clearly how &#x2013; what area as we're going to address and how, so the details may come up later in the year, but it certainly we will be more clear because I think towards the end of the year, we will have more clarity on setting up of capital rates <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:10). And when that is clear, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:13).</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now move to <mark type="ph" /> Matthew Hokus of Handelsbanken (39:25). Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Matthew Hokus from Handelsbanken here. Two questions if I may. Firstly on the 15% ROE you've been talk about which you as one of the leading banks in Europe want to achieve, is this based on normalized loan loss and is this also kind of assuming that interest rates would come to the normal or to the same levels of that we have historical seen them?</p>
          <p>The second question is basically regarding the shipping losses and they were up quite a lot. Will there be some kind of structural change or is this kind of one-off quarter or is something happening within the credit quality regarding shipping?</p>
          <p>And thirdly regarding the liquidity portfolio, you seem to be a bit more conservative regarding your liquidity. Is there reason in the funding markets where you are doing so or what is the reason at least you seem to be a bit more conservative regarding this? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with the first question on the ROE. First of all, it is of course &#x2013; it's an estimate of 50%, that's what we believe and of course things may change going forward depending on regulation et cetera. But that's basically our estimates of where the top league will be, and of course we are assuming that's from a more normalized loan losses level typically, so that's, but of course there's no exact &#x2013; there's no exact science in the number of 50% loan losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shipping loss questions, actually, our level of shipping obviously is not very high, so that was actually low but there was an increase compared to Q4. But then if you have a longer transaction, actually this level is not extremely high. So that it is more or less probably we are talking about a little bit higher than average on March. The absolute amounts, they are very small as you can see, we talk about &#x20AC;14 million loan losses. So that actually can come from one individual customer, typical for shipping. All in all of course the reality is that shipping market is not very strong for the time being, and in the first quarter we saw especially for tankers, they have come down and there is still be several structural dropping of over capacity and with still coming in to the marketplace so that still of course we are very cautious when it comes to shipping and we're concentrating on the very business on but it's not any kind of indication that we're now be change to lower loan loss level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may continue on that, are you more cautious on the shipping market now than at the end of Q4?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:53) segment. For example the tankers segment, which is probably now its biggest problem's -- we don't mean that we are changing for example our policies towards customers, we have all the best customers from each segment in our portfolio. But we are not actually now aiming <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:22)</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take our next question from <mark type="ph" /> Ian Walter of Deutsche Bank (46:42). Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Ian Walter, Deutsche Bank. Just a couple of follow up questions from the presentation this morning. On the <mark type="ph" /> NII (46:54) sensitivity question to Fredrik Rystedt, should we expect these &#x20AC;540 million in sensitivity from 100 bps higher short rates in the <mark type="ph" /> DS (47:05) area of operation, if that the way we should look at it? And the second question is on the long term debt, you issued around &#x20AC;12 billion in the first quarter, should we expect the same pace for the rest of 2011, or do you feel that you have reformed the balance sheet now, so we can see a slower pace going forward? And then the final one on average deterioration on wholesale debt, if you could give that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, not sure I fully understood your first question, but the interest rate sensitivity is basically 100 basis points up for the current as a whole, that's by definition the way it appears. But if you go a little deeper into that the sensitivity is very much largely due on the transaction account and of course that is a short-term interest rate. So we are more sensitive in the shorter end of the curve, put it that way. And lastly, NII sensitivity is the 100 basis points for the entire curve moving up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that the number in absolute terms is the &#x20AC;540 million? Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But your second question is long-term funding. We have &#x2013; as you rightly point out, we've down 12 and of course the total redemption is approximately 15 per year so needless to say we have done a lot of refunding and you can also see that we have increased the proportion of long-term debt for the short-term because of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:58) versus the lower number before. So we have done that, and it's also maybe worth pointing out that we have done a considerable amount of senior unsecured so the rest of the year will be at a lower pace and will also be much more in covered bonds, predominantly in covered bonds going forward. And the average maturity of the long-term funding is now basically changed in 2000 &#x2013; since the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jan Erik Gjerland from DnB. I have four questions if I may. The first one is on corporate lending activities, if you could elaborate even further in today's split between SMEs and the large corporate customers? Also maybe per country, the Nordics, whether they're in the new markets? And how your shipping book looks in terms of outlook for lending growth?</p>
          <p>Secondly, where and how have you booked the lack of the positive level fees in Norway for 2011? Thirdly, if you could just give us info how much do your FX change was for this coming year quarter-over-quarter? And finally, the day effect, where you have hidden it? It in the other income group treasury or in allocated capital effect <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:40)? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might have to take the last question first. It's in other, so -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you pressure it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Easily could pressure it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly. That's very simple. So <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:58)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're right, that the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:02) basically, and it's a mean segment and has been watched. Most segments have been different. And we have a continued <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:14) towards small and medium sized customers and the development is lacking in terms of portfolio and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:24). In a way there are two reasons for that, that development in large corporate customers. First of all there is not yet the big demand for those corporate bank lending to has reached and investing so much and they are they have access to capital markets. We can provide service to get the money from capital markets. And the other reason is that our ambition and target is mostly increased lending, that segment for this ROE and for that reason. So as you saw from one of the slides what is now happening is that the mid-volume is flat over merger bank that we have been able nevertheless to grow our income in that segment by percent per year. And it's exactly what we want to do, so that the more fee based service fees to that segment.</p>
          <p>But then that's the quite evenly spit the curve between countries, so there has been underlying good demand for the small growth in that segment probably don't make only <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:51) for time being in Denmark. And then one of our targets, fund also relation customers from that segment. So that is what is driving that part.</p>
          <p>Then you mentioned shipping and what is our ambition related to shipping book. I shortly touched on in my previous answer by our intention is not to grow the shipping lending to countries. Circumstances strongly, of course. It will be always volatile especially because U.S. dollars dominate and so it's always affecting the numbers we see in our cash, but underlying volume is very likely to be more like what we see now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jan, your second question was related to the stability fund in Norway, and that book in NII in Norway but the amount was approximately &#x20AC;7 million in Q4 and zero in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that helps much. Finally, the FX effect on your income here. Has it been large Q on Q or has it been normal? Talk about it on the cost side but you don't mention it too much on it on the income side. I think it is partly in some positive effect there. Could you elaborate a bit on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, if you take the Q4 and Q1, if you take the total operating income was minus 1% different, so it is about flat or slightly up in absolute -- we reported it just below zero in terms of currency adjusted. If you take the full year it's 9% roughly in reported currency and 7% in unchanged currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Just on Denmark, as you say, it could be interesting to increase your stake through SMEs in Denmark, you talked about early today, all about the troubles for smaller Danish banks to finance themselves. When and how do you see that potentially could come through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's an ongoing thing, we are getting mortgages in Denmark and we continue to do that, but of course we are selective on which customers to take <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:07) careful consideration. That there is no doubt that the smaller banks are not the ideal place, and the corporate banks <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:23). We are building up a number of good relationships and we want to continue to do that, but we are pretty critical on the risk level so <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:33).</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. It's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:52). And I only have one question for you really and that's on risk migrations. In Q1, you had reclassification of 10% of your corporate exposures with 5.8 percentage points upgraded. Can you give us a figure of how large the share of corporate exposure that will be reclassified in Q2 and whether one can expect the same kind of distribution between up and downgrades given an unchanged macro environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's of course impossible to do forecast, but there is Q2 from all quarters is &#x2013; we're having a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:36) and of course so far we have clearly seen an improved pricing migration in previous quarters. We don't have any reason to believe that would now change. There will be also down rating time, I'm sure about, but it needs more up ratings, but to be more specific than this, it's impossible to comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Jacob from Autonomous. I guess I just had one question, could you just talk a bit about the timelines and the milestones for the AIRB transition? I suppose you have applied for the transition. Do you know when we could expect a decision from the FSA and also when at what point would we have an idea of the impact or magnitude? And lastly on this, is just sort of the entirety of the corporate book or is this just a fraction or portion of the book? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect, as I mentioned initially, we expect approval some time next early part of next year. So of course it's not possible to give a more precise timeline as this is something that of course is given by the FSA and not by us. Our belief is some time during the early part of next year and I think that's also relevant to have a more and better indication. We will of course know, gradually, what kind of impact this will have. We already have a good belief but of course it's so uncertain at this point in time. But we don't wish to give any sort of estimate. As the time progresses we will know more, but I don't expect for us to communicate in any sort of detailed way the level until we actually have the approval, which is the early part of next year.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chintan Joshi from Nomura. I've got two follow-up questions. The first question is on Norway loan losses that you have identified a couple of corporate exposure that led to the increase in loan losses in Norway. Could you tell us if these are syndicated loans and therefore, perhaps some other banks may take a hit from these exposures as well? The second question is, as you slide that the interest rate sensitivity comes from the transaction account deposits. Could you quantify the deposit accounts where you have a full benefit of the rate hike and those deposit accounts where you have only partial benefit? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, thank you, Chintan, but we can't comment on your question for obvious reasons because we can only comment on our loan loss season and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:52).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the interest rate sensitivity, I gave one figure which is transaction accounts and of course in the fact book you can see the split of our entire deposit side, but if I give maybe some general answers. If you take -- if you look at the transaction accounts then of course the impact is very significant, it's approximately 80% or in that order magnitude of the interest rate hike that actually is impacting the profit line. We also have at least for the first 100 basis points or so a fairly positive impact from the savings accounts but much less than the 80% on the household side.</p>
          <p>On the corporate side, interest rate sensitivity is actually quite low and the reason is that we typically follow in terms of both savings and transaction accounts on the corporate side.</p>
          <p>And then finally, the components relates to the <mark type="ph" /> C risk (1:04:06) or the generation we have in the liquidity buffer and of course our capital that goes to finance that. So that's the remaining portion. So of course the biggest parts where we're most sensitive is transaction accounts &#x2013; accounting to approximately &#x20AC;25 billion or so and the predominant portion, about 40% of that in Finland, another about 20% in Denmark or so, and the rest is typically between Sweden and Norway. So a lot of Euro exposure at that end and of course the rest is less sensitive.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, and just one question regarding risk rates on mortgages. Looking at your Q3 reports it's a quite a substantial difference between Norway and Sweden where the Norway and the recent risk weighted 16.9% and the Swedish is 6.2% -- 16.9% is above average in Norway. You can say looking at savings bank and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:41) while 6.2% is more on par on Swedish like banks <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:48) like a little above them. One indication could be that one sees the Norwegian housing market at a risk of 2.5 times the Swedish and if so would you see that this is portfolio specific or is it related to the underlying risk in the housing market or is there another good explanation for this, which I might miss here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Our risk base, of course, our own history portfolios in various countries and then it is not the outcome it reflects and of course what effecting that base is of course the underlying risk, but also collaterals of the other LTVs in various countries and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:06:44). So this is, of course, in a way reflecting our current situation that is more or less what is the reason for all these changes. What our internal models are giving us from our that the long-term history in various markets, we are not too concerned about the housing market and the credit risk related to our mortgage repair, where we have talked Sweden or Norway. We all know that there are high LTVs sometimes in Norway and also in Finland for example. But LTV is only one part of the equation. Customer's cash flow, which is dominating and if we have high LTVs, we usually are talking about a big cash reach, which fly into credit risk, which their perspective is more than issue.</p>
          <p>And as we have seen that the housing prices they have started to stabilize so as our growth in the mortgage lending group <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:08:14) healthy. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:08:17) are coming up, I know there are also some other actions taken so that we avoid these financial bubbles.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. It's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:08:41). I have two questions, the first one related to your net interest income in your group <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:08:46). Can you give us a bit of flavor on how much of this is taking down interest rate, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:08:54) and how much of this is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:08:59) they hasn't been chart to the business segment. The second question is related to the margins that you taking more details than previously on business segment. How comparative are these margins between segments? I noticed that the mortgage market in Sweden is in the region of 90 basis point versus 50 to 55 basis points in Finland and in Denmark. Is that giving a fair picture of where you see the margin in your business and that comment also that the overall margin clearly a high-end Sweden in any of the automatic markets at the moment, which you <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:09:41).</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I can maybe give the &#x2013; in terms of the funding costs total that has nothing transferred to business I would say that actually zero, because -- we're actually marginal, that's approximately &#x20AC;3 million we are talking about or between the quarter we can increase funding costs and the remaining part is change of two things. The first one of course in interest rate we are now due to our liquidity risk here framework we are now funding the liquidity buffer in the longer perspective. The pressure we apply with a short term funding of the measure in 14 day. Now we make the apply the LTR framework, which is the 30 day. So we basically have a prolong the short term funding by some, that's about a third of that of the impact. And the second part is as you point out that playing the yield card, or rather utilizing the bond mandates in our funding, group treasury operations, we have reduce opposition to much more neutral in our profile funding <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:11:01). So it actually not funding costs they are the same old margin impact.</p>
          <p>And then if you take into account the margins and the comparability between them, I think it is actually very good question re-rating because it is not only comparison mortgage margins in Denmark. The Danish system is basically a complete match funding system, so if you do a long term lending you would also fund it long term. So basically the full liquidity premium is included in that number in Denmark, whilst that's not the case for the other countries, that's one of the differences. You would also see for instance for consumer lending where you have big difference and there are set ups or differences in product as such depending on for instances collateral and other types of things. So it is actually difficult to compare on a broad state of list margins between country. There are different circumstances. I think rather each country is important to look at.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will take our final question today, a follow-up from Jan Erik Gjerland of DnB. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jan Erik from DnB again. And just out of curiosity, the extended maturity on your funding side and increased liquidity in needs. What do you think either &#x2013; what how that the fact you let that this income going forward increased needs versus what you have added to first quarter and last year so to speak? How much more do you really need to do in terms of running a business properly and to be up and running with the LCR and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:20)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can maybe start with the liquidity side, because we have in 2010 23 days in liquidity buffer and now we have close to $60 billion and sometimes we are even above 60 so that is a very huge share and significant increase. I think from where I'm sitting, at least, in these that's that saying that we have enough in terms of liquidity buffers and I also alluded to before that we have adapted to LTR to your framework in terms of hiring et cetera. We've given up truly compliant as relates to the level 1 and level 2 asset competition in the LTR framework as it's now described. So we have more for instance have bond, government bonds in the LTR framework with what's require. Having said that I think there is a good chance that we'll change that as we go forward and if it's that not the case of course we can easily adapt some cost, not major.</p>
          <p>As we look at the funding side, we have exposed &#x2013; we have disclosed before that the average behavior or maturity of our group is approximately to 2.7 years and on the funding side about 2.3, so we are very close to match funded and operation as such. But of course again this comes down to the regulatory environment, so depending on the final competition of NSFR, we may or may not have to do more long-term funding as we go forward. It's actually impossible to answer that question from our own view and where we're sitting at this point in time we think we think we have a very, very stable and good funding framework and we think we have a good position, but again the regulatory framework is now uncertain to us.</p>
          <p>Then if you look at the present situation, will we take more funding costs? Yes there will be coming on stream as old maturity is coming on stream so to speak. We have made cheaper funding than the current level in the past when the seniors run short and of course, it's also fair to say we made more expensive funding during 2008 and '09. So but that would be something like go forward, but quantifying that is difficult. We've taken the absolute large part of that funding cost increase subject to of course first <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:16:16) we'll go actually go forward in time.</p>

          <p>Just a follow up, did you guys have taken this huge bonding from the Central Bank of Norway, in the recent business unit?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very marginal, actually it was never very beneficial thing for us to. One of the benefits for Nordea during the entire crisis is that we been able to short fund in very attractive way. I think you're referring to the two specifics loans and the program issued by the Central Bank and we did a very, very small part there, we think we had better alternatives than &#x2013; on the wholesale funding market rather than utilizing those marginal.</p>
