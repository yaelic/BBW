          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be hosted by Bruce van Saun, CFO of RBS. Please go ahead, Bruce.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I guess in the U.S. good morning. With me today is John Cummins, the Group Treasurer for RBS. We've put up some materials for you to review on our website. I don't intend to page turn those for you, but certainly look at those at your leisure. I believe our full investor presentation that we made this morning U.K. time is also available on the IR website for you to take a look at that.</p>
          <p>Let me just start off and I'll offer a few introductory remarks, summary remarks. And then I think we'll go straight to Q&amp;A. So, we've continued to make good progress on our journey to rebuild and strengthen RBS's balance sheet and to reduce risks. We've achieved this in the phase of difficult economic and financial market conditions.</p>
          <p>Analyzing our balance sheet and risk reduction efforts in more detail, we are delivering significant improvements across all of our metrics. First off, the group funded balance sheet fell by &#xA3;49 billion to &#xA3;977 billion driven by reductions in both GBM and Non-Core. Non-Core reduced funded assets by &#xA3;44 billion during 2011, to &#xA3;94 billion at the year-end. Further reductions will include the sale of RBS Aviation Finance, which will reduce funded assets by &#xA3;4.5 billion. Now, this asset reduction has allowed us to scale back our short-term wholesale funding usage, which is now &#xA3;102 billion down &#xA3;27 billion over the year. Our liquidity portfolio was &#xA3;155 billion at year-end providing over 1.5 times coverage.</p>
          <p>Core Retail &amp; Commercial franchise continues to attract a strong inflow of deposits, up by &#xA3;9 billion versus 2010. Deposits now represent 63% of our funding base. The group loan-to-deposit ratio improved to 108% and our Core loan-to-deposit ratio to 94%. Our capital position remained strong with a Core Tier 1 ratio of 10.6%, despite a &#xA3;21 billion CRD III RWA headwind and reduced benefit from APS cover of about 30 basis points. Our tangible book value per share remained steady relative to last year of just over 50 pence.</p>
          <p>Turning to the P&amp;L, the 2011 group operating profit, ex-GMS was &#xA3;1.9 billion, which is up 11% on last year. This reflects the strong Retail &amp; Commercial operating performance and the return to profit of RBS Insurance. Ulster Bank and GBM faced more difficult conditions. The total Core operating profits for 2011 was &#xA3;6.1 billion; that's down 15% year-over-year and the Core ROE was 10.5%. GBM's ROE fell to 8% in challenging market conditions, a level that was in line with peers; second half results were roughly breakeven. As you are aware, we announced the restructuring of this business in January and are moving ahead with a more focused and capital-efficient business model.</p>
          <p>Non-Core operating losses in 2011 were &#xA3;4.2 billion, 24% lower than 2010, reflecting a continued run-down of exposures. Our Non-Core RWAs fell by &#xA3;60 billion, or 39% to &#xA3;94 billion over the year as we aggressively de-risk the Non-Core trading portfolios.</p>
          <p>Group expenses were down 6% year-over-year, ex-GMS, with staff cost down by 9%. Cost savings with an underlying run rate of over &#xA3;3 billion have been achieved to-date. The Core cost to income ratio was 60% in 2011. Impairment losses were down 20% from 2010, and provision coverage of risk elements in lending increased 200 basis points to 49% from 47%.</p>
          <p>The headline loss for the year of roughly &#xA3;2 billion reflects the drag from Non-Core, as well as other legacy costs such as APS fees, PPI, Greek write-down, and restructuring costs. We keep working through these drags from the past, but the good news is, we have protected our Core Tier 1 ratio through this recovery period.</p>
          <p>All-in-all, we feel we've continued to make good progress in 2011 in delivering a safer and better positioned RBS. Of note, when you go through and look on our slides from this morning, you should also focus on some of the changes that we've made to our medium term targets, so we run quite a bit ahead on several of our balance sheet targets, and so we've adjusted those taking recognition of the changed funding markets for all banks.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to the operator, so we can take a few questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from <mark type="ph" /> James Hyatt (5:50). Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yeah, I've got a few questions, I'll keep it brief. First of all, on your milestone slide, there is &#x2013; the big thing, the elephant in the room that seems to be missing is the ICB publication and clarification. I know this morning Stephen Hester said that, it could take two years till we know. But I noticed that you've got end of Q1, MIB structure confirmed. So, I'm just wondering is, are we going to get any kind of flavor of how the ring-fence will work out, and this is obviously of importance to &#x2013; as bond holders to find out where our bonds will end up, so yeah, if you can just address a bit, how your plans could be shaped by the ICB final outcome?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I was wondering in terms of the 10% Core capital target plus whatever the ICB is going to require, where do you stand on either CoCos or other form of loss-absorbing capital and related subjects, once the April coupon thing is listed, what can you say about Cores on lower Tier 2 and other sub-debt securities? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's a pretty full set of questions. Thank you for that. First off, on the ICB, I think the answer really is, it's too early to tell and to give significant details on where the &#x2013; how the ring-fence will be drawn, and what the impacts will be. And so I think there's a lot that remains to be clarified, and we'll see how that plays out. And then, it has to move into legislation and then there's quite a bit of lead time towards implementation to actually make that happen. I can just tell you from doing the carve-out and separation of the branch system that we're selling to Santander, these things are measured in the years. And so the overall implementation date after 2018, 2019 is probably going to take every bit of that time.</p>
          <p>So stay tuned on that. I do think though that the steps that we're taking now partly driven by the market, partly with an eye towards where ICB impacts lie in terms of shrinking the wholesale business, using less balance sheet, using less wholesale funding, certainly will position us I think better in the end, when those details ultimately emerge. So, I don't think there's anything that we're doing that we would regret doing once we see the final output around the ring-fencing proposals.</p>
          <p>So that'll be your first question. Your second question on the 10% Core Tier 1 capital target, I do think it's interesting to consider how the contingent capital instruments could potentially provide additional loss-absorbing capital. At this point, we're waiting to see a little more how that market develops. As you are aware, we do have a contingent capital arrangement with the U.K. government that extends out through 2014. And so we're not in a particular rush to go replace that and to do anything else, but certainly watching the developments in the market with interest.</p>
          <p>Your last question on the EU ban is I think we noted that on the milestones. And I'm sure all of the fixed income investors are anxious to consider what are our actions, and what we're going to do. And I think we've consistently said that when we get closer to the time that we'll make decision, and we'll now close in due course, I do think that some of the things that you would expect us to do in terms of turning on coupons and becoming more a normal bank, again, are certainly on our path to returning to full standalone strengthened and accessing the markets again for capital and for equity. So, it's certainly something that we look positively towards, but we'll have to just wait and see and the board will deliberate closer to the time and then we'll announce what we're going to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Corinne Cunningham [Autonomous Research LLP] Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. And couple of questions. First of all, are there any constraints to doing liability management exercise? And once you get beyond the end of April, so when you're outside of the EU constraints, are there any things that could then prevent you from coming back to the market with liability management exercises?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer to that is that any exercises are subject to FSA approval, so that would be the principal factor that would have to be considered. But there is a staging of <mark type="inaudible" /> (11:40) between RBS plc and N.V. And so the N.V. instruments are effectively have a stop until one year later for the most parts. So, it's really April of 13. But the majority of our instruments are in the plc and those would all be subject to liability management if we wanted to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can I just ask a follow-up question on the vanilla level tier 2, so not necessarily CoCo style at UBS, but just boring, old vanilla level tier 2. Do you have a view as to the proposition of that that you feel you would like to have in your capital structure going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess some of that remains to be clarified as we see some of the Basel work coming through. We have benchmarked our self relative to our peer group in terms of the different buffers that we have above core tier 1. So, we published today the tier 1 ratio then the total capital ratio and those maths are there for you to look at, but it's kind of roughly a little over 2% and then another 1%. But that I think benches well relative to our peer group, and so we have to consider that any actions that we take &#x2013; we want to basically I think for now stay relatively in the pack. So, that's how we've done things in the past and I think that's how we would look at it until there's more clarification coming from Basel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>You next question comes from Robert Smalley. Please ask you question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Couple of questions, first on the funding side, you said that you're going to skew your funding more toward secured and private placements in your slide that. But we've seen a number of other banks come with unsecured issues three years, five years, 10 years. Is there a reason, why you're going to continue with that plan on the secured and private side, and what can we expect that if you're in the unsecured market this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. May be I'll start and John can add in to -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I've got a follow-up, if that's okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's fine. I guess, our view as you can see, the amount that we need to issue is coming down very rapidly. So, two years ago, the total issuance was in the mid-30s. This past year, the net issuance was around &#xA3;20 billion. The coming year we anticipate &#xA3;10 billion, could actually be less, depending on the speed at which we de-lever. And so, I think part of that is just a question of where is the market, and what's the cost of funds? And unsecured financing has become more expensive. So, we have opportunities, I think with a fairly big collateral pool and a low encumbrance ratio to keep doing secured transactions. But, if we see the unsecured market in a good spot, we have the flexibility to do that. John, do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So obviously we continue to look at the unsecured market through the holding company issuance plans we have. But it really is given we've achieved a great deal of our balance sheet objectives for 2013, it's about the cost of funds and diversification of fund, unsecured and private placement give us the best optimal funding mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you getting feedback that the uncertainty over ring-fencing is costing you a certain number of basis points in the unsecured market? And have you also thought about issuing through some of the other local subsidiaries like doing a dollar deal through Citizens for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. We've not had great deal of feedback on what you've been discussing and the other point is on some of that local subsidiaries, some of that subsidiaries have got very strong liquidity and funding positions in their own right. And obviously, it lot of the liquidity is not fungible. Liquidity we issue in Citizens, the money would have to stay in Citizens, for example. We're actually benefiting from the major assets we've made to improve the balance sheet and to make it safer and more stable, and that's why we have less to do in the unsecured insurance market. So, although the market's opened, not just U.K. banks, but some of the European banks, the spreads are still quite egregious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>and again, if you look at this in context of some of the slides in the pack from today, the amount of reductions coming from de-levering in both non-core and GBM is quite dramatic, both what we accomplished in 2011 and then what we're projecting into 2012. So, for example, the short-term wholesale funding is now at &#xA3;102 billion. We're projecting that that decline to &#xA3;65 billion by the end of the year. And the term funding book also is running down. We've planned to pay-off some of our CGS debt that matures in the first half of this year around &#xA3;20 billion of that. We're holding a lot of cash in anticipation of doing that. Basically this is about creating a very strong balance sheet, <mark type="inaudible" /> (17:27) the balance sheet positioned for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Paul Owens from Avoca Capital. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Gentlemen, thanks for holding the call. I just want to get some clarification. I know you've done very &#x2013; you've been very, very clear on the coupon issue, but will you &#x2013; two questions that if you decide to turn the coupons back on or not will you announce that at the end of April, I guess is my first question? And the second thing is on a conditional basis, have you already asked the FSA for approval to turn those coupons back on or will you wait until the end of April to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think again you may be drawing analogies to Lloyds, but Lloyds ban went into effect three months before us, and so they've made certain pronouncements, and they've had certain dialogue with the FSA. And they're out a little bit ahead of us I would say. So, our intention is just to get the first quarter under our belt, look &#x2013; relook at our forecast for the year, discuss it with the board, discuss it with the FSA and then obviously we would be making an announcement at the appropriate point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that appropriate point would be when you announced that first quarter results or would it been in an interim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it could be that. I mean, that would be a logical time to do it I would think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. That's all I have. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Jeremy Baldwin from AIG. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Couple of things. Number one in relation to structural subordination, I mean, clearly the level of asset incumbency you have is relatively de minimis at the moment. But I just wonder if you can just give some color on how you see the future funding mix of the business changing, based on regulatory development, because clearly that has ramifications for rating and/or likely recovery rates associated with that for senior unsecured holders. I'm wondering if you can give me sort of some idea of whether you see a secular shift in the level of secured funding being structurally higher on a long-term basis or that's going to fluctuate over the course of cycle, depending on where unsecured spread goes? If you can just give some color on that's the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very, very clear that the incumbent issue is a hot topic. I know that the regulators are looking to publish policy issues consultative documents on this topic. We're in the fortunate position. We've been de-leveraging our balance sheet, and if you look for example, our stock of U.K. mortgages, let's say just roughly &#xA3;100 billion, we've got just over &#xA3;20 billion of public secured and covered bonds backing in the public market. So, we've been late to that particular <mark type="inaudible" /> (20:32) securitization so our incumbency ratio is very modest. And we think that gives us a good position. This debate about structural subordination, and where does it fit within the spreads of unsecured funding is something, which you're not going to get a comprehensive final answer from me or from anyone else for quite some time. That we want to use our mix of funding in the most stable, safe way possibly and obviously, the biggest driver we've done that is to reduce our short term funding and increase our customer deposits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as we de-lever the bank we've reduced our requirement for wholesale funding in the senior markets -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Has been reduced dramatically in the short period. As we see what comes out of the public policy announcements, what the ratings will potentially will say about this then obviously that will drive <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:23) from unsecured funding. But while our incumbency ratio is very modest, we've given further details about the incumbency in our IMS, and we feel that we're in a good place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also I think the U.K. with the ICB proposals and moving through, working out the details and then move into legislation. I get a sense that the U.K. may not want to be out in front of some of the EU proposals around comprehensive bailing and the like. So, I think that will end up going up, and so there's still a lot to play out both in the U.K and in the EU on this topic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And the second question relates to the credit issue of Cole's. Just in terms of your perception about how or whether, in your view, the attitude of the FSA has changed in the light of the ongoing Eurozone crisis? Because clearly, within the context of U.K., they already effectively have an SRR that can work, and obviously, you would imagine that under such circumstances, given the uncertainty in relation to Europe, then you would think or interpret they may be less keen on seeing instruments being called at the first call date or subject or instruments can be called after a moratorium has expired. Can you just give me some color on that, whether you think that's got worse or better or just in terms of, you must in a constant ongoing dialogue with them around this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you've seen the official comments in the financial policy committee at the end of last year from Sir Mervyn King and other people and obviously, they've made very clear statements in terms of they think banks should retain capital. Obviously, I'm not trying to jump the gun as to what the FSA may say to us at the appropriate time. But obviously our capital ratios are very stable. I think with the headwinds we faced, we've still managed to come out with the numbers we've done show we're great taking a great deal of positive management action to manage our capital ratios. But all I can suggest is you know, you read some of the FPC and the bank getting comments about, the fact that all banks and Stephen said this in the results meeting. The regulatory authorities take the view that all banks should have more capital.</p>

We're committed to the NV regulators <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:39) to make it a very smooth transition from the majority of assets from RBS NV to RBS plc.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, folks. Just a couple of quick ones. One on intra-group funding and then I also want to go back to this NV versus plc issue. But just on the intra-group funding, seeing there's been a little increase particularly relative to Ulster Bank. Just want to see across the group, how much &#x2013; how the subsidiaries funding on a similar basis, and what cost is the increase to the group level, and how long would you intend to sort of continue or do you anticipate continuing and supporting those at, say, what cost that is, and if there are any regulatory issues around that?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the &#x2013; you mentioned earlier when we talked about, I think, it was Corinne's question about the liability management, so that NV can't liability manage, because it's a year later; all plc stuff is in the mix. I just wanted to sort of ask a question, relative to the some of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:25) securities, the $25 par securities, which my understanding was that there would be at least a year of coupon payments required before parity ranking securities could be liability management in that situation, then we actually see that all group level Tier 1 are actually out of a liability management phase, at least until 2013. So, those are just two points there, if you could maybe shed a little bit of light on them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In each group funding, it's very &#x2013; it's important to understand some of the subsidiaries are actually self-funding, for example, like Citizens and &#x2013; that is one example. With Ulster Bank, we continue to support our subsidiary there, and we continue to work hard to manage our balance sheet, so that that our intra-group funding requirement is managed down over time. Again, on other subsidiaries, there are times there are peaks and troughs for each group funding, for example, for NV, on occasion when we're still managing the transit, the migration of assets from NV to plc.</p>
          <p>The regulators are very focused on this issue into group funding into group limit, and we continue to manage down these requirements over time. The actual de-leveraging of the balance sheet will also continue to assist reducing such limits, for example, to certain subsidiaries of the markets business, for example. So, over time, the stuff will come down, subsidiaries are not a drain on capital or liquidity and are looking to manage our self in a appropriate manner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, in general, just with the regulatory focus being directed towards what's onshore and regulators taking a view of each legal entity in its own right. This has become just an issue that we have to manage much more tightly. And so, we're all over this trying to manage down those exposures and trying to put those subsidiaries more on a self-funding basis, and that's an ongoing effort.</p>
          <p>Second question was on the liability management. I think that's right, I did mentioned that FSA approval is required, but I omitted to say that there is stoppers that affectively push out those plc instruments into &#x2013; I think, it's March or April of 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys, and first of all, thanks, again for holding this call. It is extremely helpful. The question I just had was on the Moody's recent placement of ratings under review for GCMIs and the European crisis. We've got a lot of questions on the U.K. banks relative to European. Can you just comment a little bit on specifically your short-term rating, and also, how you think it may impact both short and long-term ratings in the longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think Moody's took a very broad action both around sovereigns and then around financial institutions, particularly universal banks. And so, we're actively working to respond to their request for information, as they go through their review. Part of that is today's results to, I think, make sure that Moody's is looking at things through kind of the current lenses that where we are and all the progress that we've made, and where we're going in terms of kind of the much more conservative view that we're taking towards the balance sheet and the size of the wholesale bank. And so, I think we have a very good story to tell here. And you can rest assured we'll be out telling it in the next couple of weeks.</p>
          <p>We have amongst some of the progress that we've made on the short-term issuance that is tied to the short-term rating, we've been bringing that down quite a bit. So, as we brought down short-term wholesale funding, the amount that was kind of commercial paper and CDs and other short-term instruments that had covered by the rating that was &#xA3;50 billion a year ago, and it's closer to &#xA3;20 billion today. And so, our exposure in terms of needing to access the markets is reduced, but clearly would be a negative to lose the short-term rating, and we'll be working hard to try and avoid that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And retail conduits also, we reduced our exposure there as well, so on all the sensitive areas you would imagine, but where actually the direction of travel is very clear in terms of reduction, would be at &#xA3;65 billion by the end of this year, and obviously, reduces the risk that you're referring to, if Moody's is going to go that route, which we don't believe they will.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> (31:42) made on the balance sheet, and also, on other &#x2013; if you read the GCMI research, you'll obviously see that on many of those points, we're actually very strong on transparency, and we think we've got a very good story on the GCMI, in particular given we've got a smaller footprint going forward.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks for that. We appreciate your interest, and thanks for dialing in today. Again, this is a multi-year journey to fix RBS. It's certainly was a failed institution that had a lot of risk left on the balance sheet. But if you look at us now, three years into the recovery plan, we've made very significant progress to both take a lot of risk off the left side of our balance sheet, and as we de-lever, use the cash to pay down debt and clean up our funding structure, our liquidity structure and maintain a strong capital base. So, that's still the focus over the next two years of the plan. We've put some new targets in place. We're going to hold ourselves to a very conservative standard. Meanwhile, we're also focused on delivering continued good strong core profitably, which has allowed us to pay for a lot of the cost of the legacy clean up.</p>
          <p>So, anyway, that's our story. Thanks for dialing in. Take care.</p>
