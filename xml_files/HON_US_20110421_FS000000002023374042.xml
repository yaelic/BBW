          <p>Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's first quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Here with me are Chairman and CEO David Cote and Senior Vice President and CFO Dave Anderson. This call and the webcast including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor. Note that elements of this presentation containing forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we would ask that you interpret them in that light. This morning we will review our financial results for the first quarter as well as share with you our expectations for the second quarter and our revised guidance for 2011. And, of course, allow time for your questions.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Elena. As you saw from our press release last night, lots of cabbage this quarter. We had a tremendous start to 2011. We had better than expected performance across the portfolio, yielding EPS above the guidance we provided you early last month. Sales of $8.9 billion were up 15% and above the high end of our guidance, reflecting continued improvement in our end markets, growth from new products and geographic expansion. We generated EPS of $0.88 reflecting an impressive 40% increase over 2010, which was also good as you'll recall.</p>
          <p>Segment margins expanded 120 basis points to 14.5% in the quarter, reflecting margin expansion in every business. This really reinforces the quality of our earnings performance, volume leverage and continued cost controls while maintaining our growth investments &#x2013; our seed planting for the future.</p>
          <p>We generated $433 million of free cash flow in the quarter, excluding the $1 billion pension contribution made in January. In the quarter we had higher segment profit partially offset by higher working capital to support the sales increases we're seeing in the businesses and the higher CapEx as planned.</p>
          <p>Given the strength of our first quarter financial performance and improving end market conditions, we're raising our full year guidance. We now expect earnings in the range of $3.80 to $3.95 a share reflecting a 27% to 32% increase in earnings over the prior year.</p>
          <p>The strong momentum we've seen across our end markets is being supplemented by the results of our seed planting initiatives throughout the portfolio. While our early cycle businesses including Advanced Materials, ACS products and Turbo continued to show record growth, our longer cycle businesses including Process Solutions and UOP are really kicking in with double-digit growth in the quarter. Aerospace's commercial aftermarket saw spares orders increase 28%, significantly outpacing flight hours.</p>
          <p>Further, our investments and focus in emerging regions are really paying off. Sales in Asia Pacific were up strongly, reflecting good growth in China and minimal disruption from the situation in Japan in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, all our employees and sites are okay. And while we have virtually no direct impact on our businesses from Tier I supply chain issues affecting our production, we continue to monitor potential future risks from electronic components that could impact global automotive OE and aircraft production rates. Our strong quarterly performance and improved outlook for 2011 reinforce that our strategy is working. Having great positions in good industries, the power of One Honeywell, our consistent focus on improving every year in each of our five initiatives, the seed planting &#x2013; it really does make a difference.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it to Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to slide number 4, entitled financial summary. Just start at the top. Again, reported sales up 15% to $8.9 billion; 11% organic growth in the quarter, so another strong organic growth quarter for Honeywell.</p>
          <p>We saw greater than expected growth in every region, the Americas and Europe were both up 10%. China and India were up 23% and 43% respectively. Acquisitions in the quarter contributed 3% growth. Currency was a slight tailwind; it rounded to just 1%. Segment profit up 25%. Segment margins just terrific, 14.5%, reflecting good conversion in the quarter. And as I take you through the business highlights you'll see the businesses are doing a terrific job managing in this higher inflationary environment while also continuing to invest for growth.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share at $0.88 were up 40% over the same period last year, considerably higher than the estimate that we gave you back in March. And just a couple comments on that, the better than expected earnings performance was driven by higher sales, better conversion in the quarter, primarily in specialty materials. Also commercial aerospace and our short cycle ACS products businesses.</p>
          <p>Repositioning spend in the quarter was $44 million net. That was 100% funded by below the line gains, namely the sale of the automotive sensors business. In addition, we absorbed a $29 million charge in the quarter related to the early redemption of debt that otherwise would have matured in 2012, a smart move lowering our overall interest expense carry. And you saw the evidence of that in the very successful bond offering in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow came in as expected. Dave mentioned that $433 million in the quarter reflecting higher working capital to support top line growth and also higher CapEx investment.</p>
          <p>And, Dave, I think it's probably fair to say the only thing that we would say was disappointing to us at all in the quarter was just inventory, and that we've got opportunities as we go through the year. And we know that's going to work itself out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Convert that to sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Let's now go to the businesses. Let's start with slide number 5 with aerospace.</p>
          <p>Aerospace sales were up 8% in the quarter to $2.7 billion, driven by strong commercial growth primarily offset by lower defense and space sales. Sales in the quarter were approximately $100 million higher for aero than our latest forecasts, with much of the overdrive driven by higher airline spares and all &#x2013; also OE selectables in the quarter. And I'll talk a little bit about that in just a moment. Segment profit for aero up 13% with margins up 80 basis points to 17.3%.</p>
          <p>Now, commercial OE sales increased an impressive 25% driven by robust ATR build rates and also the higher win rates that we've had with airlines on buyer finished equipment or BFE selectables. We also benefited from a rebound in BGA from near trough levels last year. So BGA was up over 50% in the quarter from the very depressed first quarter 2010 levels, driven by strong positions in our mid to large cabin class airlines.</p>
          <p>The commercial aftermarket sales were up 14% for aero in the quarter. That reflected higher aircraft utilization rates and also continued strong spares orders.</p>
          <p>Just a couple sub points on that. First, air transport regional flight hours were up approximately 5.8% in the quarter, 1 point higher than our original forecast. Now we don't expect that pace of growth to continue through the rest of the year, given the lingering effects of higher oil prices and also the Japan disruptions. But we still expect flight hours to grow about 5% for the year, partly a function of robust delivery schedules. Again, also the increase in utilization of the existing fleets.</p>
          <p>Regarding spares, the commercial aftermarket spares up 28% in the quarter, following a fourth quarter increase of 25%. Spares orders continue to outpace flight hours given the deep declines we saw during the recession timeframe. However, we expect the year-over-year growth rate to start to moderate over the course of the year due to comps.</p>
          <p>R&amp;O for the quarter was up 6%, in line with utilization rates. Importantly we're starting to see engine events increase year over year and expect to see more repairs over the next couple of quarters. Defense and space sales were down 3% in the quarter, due to lower T-55 helicopter engine sales internationally and also various program ramp-downs, as expected, partially offset by higher engineering sales in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now given the recent headlines, we continue to plan &#x2013; and this is just a reiteration of what we have talked about before &#x2013; for further U.S. defense budgetary pressures in reprogramming and we reiterate our forecast for low single digit defense and space revenue decline in 2011.</p>
          <p>So with that summary of aero, let's go to slide six, automation and control solutions. As you can see, ACS sales up 17% in the quarter, slightly better than expected. 7% organic, reflecting four consecutive quarters now of consistently strong organic growth for ACS of 7% plus. Acquisitions, mainly Sperian, and foreign exchange contributed to sales, adding 10% growth versus the first quarter of '10.</p>
          <p>And ACS had good geographic growth, up 7% organically in the Americas and 30% plus in China and India. Now, as guided, ACS sales conversion in the quarter was 14%, growing segment margins 20 basis points to 12.6%, reflecting strong volume increases in productivity partially offset by inflation and the investment for growth across the portfolio and the diluted impact of M&amp;A, including ongoing factory transitions affecting manufacturing yields.</p>
          <p>In the second half of '10, when the recovery in their end markets really started to take shape, ACS increased their investments in line with the increased orders in the second half of 2010 and ahead of the subsequent sales curve on longer cycle projects in building solutions as well as further seed planting investments to pursue an array new global energy-efficiency projects All of these are expecting to yield incremental top and bottom line benefits over the remainder of 2011.</p>
          <p>So as we lap these investments in the second half of the year, we expect to see sales conversion for ACS of approximately 30% or in the range of 20% to 25% for the full year. And again, consistent with prior guidance. Just a couple of points on the mix of business within ACS in the quarter. The product sales were ahead of expectations. They were up 21% on a reported basis, 9% organic, reflecting strong performance across the products portfolio.</p>
          <p>Businesses linked to industrial production saw continued strong orders in sales growth, supported by increases in manufacturing and also the favorable impact of increased safety regulations. China sales were up 30% organic led by HVAC and lighting controls. India saw 47% growth and the biggest gains in security and fire systems with increased reach to tier 2 and 3 cities. And despite continued weakness in the residential and commercial construction markets of ACS, we're encouraged by the rebound in the North American fire assistance business, the HVAC controls business and also the security business with good uptake of new products, particularly on the retrofit side of the business.</p>
          <p>Now the solutions businesses were up 10% reported, 4% organic in the quarter. They had double-digit reported growth in process solutions as we execute on large global project backlog. The building solutions business continues to go backlog with retrofit activity across both commercial and institutional verticals.</p>
          <p>HBS building solutions business continues to leverage ACS's premier energy-efficiency and smart grid portfolio to expand in new markets, having won two smart grid projects now in China. In total, the solutions business backlog, the entirety of the process and building solutions backlog in the quarter, was up over 20% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>So given that review of ACS, let's go to slide 7 Transportation Systems. In the quarter, TS was up 19% driven by volume increases, primarily at Turbo <mark type="ph" /> and friction, (13:45) partially offset by slightly lower sales in CPG. Now Turbo continues to outperform the quarterly industry macros of approximately 5% growth in European light vehicle production and a 7 point increase in western European diesel penetration.</p>
          <p>Honeywell Turbo's performance reflects their high win rate on attractive new turbo gas and turbo diesel platforms and the flawless executions of these new launches globally. To put it in perspective, in 2011 we expect about one-third of Turbo's growth to come from favorable industry macros and about two-thirds to come from new launches.</p>
          <p>We expect trends in Turbo to continue strong although moderating over the course of the year despite supply chain issues, minor supply chain issues, affecting the second quarter and affecting global automotive OE production. And we have accounted for these minor disruptions in our guidance for the second quarter that I'm going to take you through in just a moment as well as for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>CPG sales were down slightly driven by lower Prestone sales due to more inclement weather conditions during the first quarter. Overall segment profit was up 50% for Transportation Systems. Margins up 240 basis points to 12%, again driven by volume increases at Turbo, partially offset by higher commodity costs.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to SM, specially materials, who just had a phenomenal quarter. Tremendous start to 2011 for SM due to continued strong demand in the advanced materials business and also double-digit growth in the quarter in UOP. The first quarter revenues were up 19%. Segment margin was at an all-time record of 21%. Now, the substantial increase in segment margin was driven by higher sales, reflecting favorable price over raw material spreads, strong commercial excellence as well as continued productivity across the business.</p>
          <p>Now, given the volatile commodity markets, SM is benefiting from price increases commensurate with rising raw material input prices that began significantly in the second half of 2010. Now as we lap these increases in later quarters, we're going to see lower sales conversions. So given these dynamics plus the normal seasonality of the refrigerants business and the lumpy mix of business at UOP, we're planning SM margins in the range of 17% to 19% for the year. And I think, Elena, that compares to previous guidance of 16.4% and 16.7% for SM. We're also planning for SM to continue to invest for growth in strong reliability which will also affect their second half sales conversion.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, sales at UOP were up 13% with higher licensing revenue, recovery and refining catalysts and also growth in services related to the start-up of the front end engineering and design work, or feed work, for Petrobras. UOP is expected to be one of the company's key contributors as we proceed in 2011 &#x2013; will be one of the key contributors to organic growth for the company, with growth in the upper teens driven by strong order book and also its growing pipeline of global energy projects.</p>
          <p>Now the advanced materials business of SM, revenues in the quarter up 22%. Revenues across the group are up strong double digits. Just to give you some color on that, resins and chemicals up 25% on strong global demand for caprolactam and resins. Fluorine products up 25%, driven by strong demand for refrigerants, tight industry supply conditions and also strong plant performance. And specialty products was up an impressive 15%, with above market growth led by penetration of new product introductions in advanced fibers, specialty additives as well as in industrial products. So a great start to the year for Specialty Materials. It's a credit to the team. They're deploying commercial excellence, they're investing in innovation, their globalized sales force and also reliable plant performance.</p>
          <p>Now given the significance of SM for the quarter and our assumptions for the business for the remainder of the year, I'm going to come back and spend a little more time on that when we review the updated guidance for Honeywell overall in a moment for the full year 2011.</p>
          <p>First though, let's go to slide 9 and talk about our outlook for the second quarter. We're planning for total sales in the second quarter to be in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.4 billion, up 12% to 16% from last year, reflecting continued good organic growth. Earnings per share we expect to be in the range of $0.94 to $0.98, up approximately 29% to 34% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>We expect aero sales in the quarter &#x2013; in the second quarter to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion, reflecting continued commercial aftermarket strength and also the ongoing rebound in BGA OE. Now these, of course, are going to be partially offset by lower sales in defense. For ACS we expect sales in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion, extending the positive momentum in the first quarter with continued organic growth across the portfolio., the execution of solutions' strong backlog, and the continued benefit of the Sperian and Matrikon acquisitions that we made in 2010.</p>
          <p>For Transportation Systems in the second quarter, sales are estimated to be $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. It reflects the continued momentum of new launches from the first quarter as well as our estimate of global automotive supply chain disruptions emanating from the Japan crisis. Now, we've conducted &#x2013; just a little bit of color on that &#x2013; we've conducted a thorough review of our potential exposures by OEM and we're confident that the impact in the quarter &#x2013; the second quarter for Turbo will be very minimal and the risk is reflected in our volume forecast in the quarter. So we think very manageable and incorporated in our outlook.</p>
          <p>With that in mind, we're expecting TS sales growth in the range of 12% to 16% and we'll continue to monitor, of course, the business as we go forward. At Specialty Materials, we anticipate sales in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, driven by growth projects, services and catalyst sales at UOP. We also expect &#x2013; anticipate continued healthy end markets in advanced materials with continued growth out of Asia both in fluorines and resins and chemicals. So another strong quarter anticipated with sales and earnings delivering a similar growth profile as we just delivered in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's go now to slide 10, the financial guidance summary for the full year. Here we've got summarized our updated guidance, reflecting the strength that we've experienced in the first quarter and, again, our best view of the balanced set of risks and opportunities that are ahead of us for the remainder of the year. Let's go through a couple of highlights. As Dave said, we've increased our sales outlook to $36 billion to $36.6 billion. This excludes the impact of a potential discontinued operations accounting treatment for CPG that we anticipate later in the year. Now regarding the CPG divestiture, we're anticipating a third quarter close. So for planning purposes and to kind of keep it simple for tracking purposes, we're assuming CPG is in our revenue and our earnings numbers for the first six months of 2011 and out of our numbers for the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Our revised earnings guidance also reflects a higher euro assumption. We're now looking at a euro to dollar in the $1.35 to $1.40 range. This has added approximately $350 million to our full year sales estimates at this time. So with that, what that translates to is an organic increase of approximately $500 million. That's the spread &#x2013; the net spread across all our business segments.</p>
          <p>Now with respect to Specialty Materials, we expect to see normalization and more normal supply/demand conditions in the advanced materials business as we progress through the year. And therefore, pricing and spreads in the second half to come down lowering both SM's organic growth as well as the very high sales conversion that we experienced in first quarter. So given the dynamics we have highlighted in SM in the first half as well as the absence of CPG in the second half, this &#x2013; these two clearly cloud the normal linearity that we would have for HON in 2011.</p>
          <p>So with the organic growth profile we've laid out for the remainder of the year and the majority of our businesses having recovered to pre-recession levels, we're confident in our revised outlook for the year. And it's important to point out again that we'll continue to assess the uncertainty surrounding the global macroenvironment, the situation in Japan, the volatility in the commodity and foreign exchange markets but, as we sit here today, we feel we're appropriately balanced in our planning assumptions, assuming minimal impact from supply chain disruptions as well as higher material input prices as we progress through 2011.</p>
          <p>Now as we've discussed before, we're targeting a weighted average fully diluted share count of 795 million shares for the year. This reflects our latest share repurchase estimate for 2011 which is in the range of about a $1 billion. And it, of course, also reflects a higher share price of assumption for those share buybacks. So basically we're aiming to keep share count flat with where we ended the year 2010. And as always, we'll continue to evaluate our capital deployment preferences in light of the highest and best value alternatives.</p>
          <p>Now given the first quarter's momentum in sales, orders and operating leverage, this allowed us to confidently take our guidance for 2011 up $0.20 on the low end and up $0.15 on the high end to the new range of $3.80 to $3.95 per share for the year. In addition, we're confirming our free cash flow outlook for the year in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion prior to any planned U.S. pension contributions.</p>
          <p>So let's now just summarize on the last slide. Obviously, a lot of good news for Honeywell today and a terrific start to 2011. We saw, as Dave said, positive upward trends in the orders for all of our business segments. We're encouraged by the rate of improvement in uptick in commercial aerospace, both OE and aftermarket orders with spares orders sustaining well above flight hours. General industrial recovery in the emerging markets continue to be bright spots, fuelling strong double-digit growth. Turbo is continuing to benefit from their strong industry position, from new platform launches; however, growth, as we've said, will slow in Turbo over the course of the year given the projected decline in OE production schedules for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>And our long cycle businesses are continuing to accelerate, with both process solutions and UOP in double-digit growth territory. We're making further progress, obviously, on the execution of our strategies in sustaining our growth investments. We're expecting continued good organic growth, strong sales conversion, continued traction on commercial and R&amp;D effectiveness, all the while still controlling our fixed costs effectively through OEF and other disciplines. So to put this in perspective and capsulize, we're now looking at about a 30% earnings growth in 2011, the mid point of our guidance, underscoring the organization's ability to be a top tier performer with a balanced performance from both our short and long cycle businesses, all of that delivering above average growth and continued margin expansion.</p>
          <p>We think the revised outlook for the year reflects a balanced view of the global economic environment, including where we see strengths and where we see opportunities, continued opportunities, across the portfolio. So our operating strategies are working, our capital deployment plans, including the share buyback that we talked about, further strengthens the company's outlook for 2011 and obviously continues to build a very solid foundation for terrific future growth for Honeywell.</p>
          <p>So in closing, a terrific quarter. A very positive update to the full year with earnings expected in the range of up 27% to 32% over last year. Clearly the second half won't have quite the same profile for a variety of reasons, however, we feel our sales, margin and EPS guidance that we've communicated today is very strong and represents again a terrific performance and terrific outlook for the company for the year.</p>
          <p>So with that, Elena, let's turn it back over to you for Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Not too much to pick on for sure. Solid quarter overall. I just wanted to focus a little bit on the working capital and inventory issue and I think the heart of my question is, relates more to HOS. An that's &#x2013; when you put up an 11% core number which is probably the highest you guys have had in 20 years, does it put a lot of projects on hold and make it really difficult to manage working capital and push HOS forward or is this more of a strategic decision just to build inventory ahead of price increases and obvious demand that's going to pull through the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say it's more a case, Scott, where we might have just got a little ahead of where we see the sales going. And I fully expect all this to convert and then we'd get &#x2013; as they do a better job there, than we did in this first quarter. So that's all it is. HOS is still going along swimmingly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So HOS isn't harder to do in a higher volume environment? Is that fair to say?</p>

          <p>Yes, that's not going to &#x2013; I suppose you could say it puts some pressure on having to do two things at the same time. But it's not the first time our guys have been confronted with something like that. Just like you could say is the recession a tougher time to be getting HOS done because you have all kinds of cost pressures. We did it then. It is just a different kind of problem you have to manage, that's all.</p>

          <p>Sure. Guys, the Specialty Materials business was the biggest delta versus our model and that business has just been &#x2013; it wasn't that many years ago I was telling people it would never be a 10% margin business, and now you're over 20%. So, you know...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that mean I need to re-visit some statements you're making today, Scott?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just, you know... You know how it is. Right sometimes, wrong more often. I wanted to get into UOP a bit. My question is, both &#x2013; I need to be educated and also just also just understand what's going on here. I mean, it is up 13%. You made a comment later in the presentation that the project business part will pick up. I assume that's a little bit of lower margin than the reload? I mean, is there a full-fledged catalyst reload cycle that's beginning here? Is that what you're seeing? Or is there something &#x2013; or something else? I'm trying to get a better feel for visibility on UOP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say we are seeing &#x2013; if you take a look at refining catalysts in particular, it's been pretty robust. And we said once before that &#x2013; well, I guess when we were in the recession that a lot of those reloads were being extended. We're starting to see some of the benefit of that. Dave, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we saw good contribution from reloads. It was a &#x2013; the majority of the catalyst sales in the quarter, it was about two-thirds of the catalyst sales in the quarter. And I think that trend's going to continue. And I think standing back from the reloads and just kind of reinforcing one of the themes for today is we had good growth in UOP in the quarter but we're going to have even better growth.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave Anderson, just want to square up some of these non-operating items. So I think &#x2013; firstly, how much was the Sensata gain and I think you said repositioning was $44 million? What are sort of the other moving parts? Because the repositioning line is obviously $133 million. Is that where the $29 million of charge was absorbed for early debt retirement? Maybe you could square off some of these moving parts for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, what we had was, we had about a $40 million gain, pre-tax gain on automotive sensors business. We also had another minor gain during the quarter. Essentially think of it this way, John. Those gains on sale of non-strategic business essentially funded the repositioning. That's sort of a one for one. So just think of it that way. And then, obviously, in addition, the other thing that we had during the quarter was the debt retirement that we spoke about which is a net positive &#x2013; will be a net positive for us when we look forward in terms of the interest expense guidance for the full year will benefit from that. So that was also in the non-operating piece of the quarter. Really, Elena, I don't think there was much movement beyond that on the other pieces.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, John, in the repositioning in other line items in addition to the $44 million of repositioning that Dave talked about, we also had our normal run rate expenses for asbestos and environmental which composed the $133 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Elena Doom: And then the gains on sale of businesses were partially offset by the debt redemption costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our strategy hasn't changed here, John. One-time gains we always redeploy and use as a way to make the business better in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think a good way, John, to think about that, below the line it was just very clean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So was the $29 million of debt refinancing, was that &#x2013; I mean basically was that naked? In other words, if you hadn't done that would you have earned $0.91 ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's accurate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is the reason Turbo not affected by Japan even though Japan's creating some global automotive disruption because basically Japanese vehicles aren't really designed with turbochargers? Is that really the issue or is there some other factor going on here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a key contributor, John. I mean, it's a very good point. I think the other thing in this to this degree that we can't really quantify but it just makes sense &#x2013; that the degree that Japan built automobiles were in shorter supply. Obviously, that has created an opportunity for some of our customers, more significant in terms of Turbo customers, to sell their products. So we're going to see some of that actually as we progress through the second quarter which will mitigate some of the supply disruption that you saw.</p>
          <p>The other thing is, again, it's against a backdrop of improved macros. Overall automotive production up nice. A higher diesel penetration &#x2013; favorable diesel penetration particularly in Europe and very successful consumer pull, very positive consumer pull, for Honeywell products. So automobiles with Honeywell turbochargers. So we had a number of factors working in our favor and we think will continue to work in our favor. As I mentioned, we're looking at minimal disruption we think in the second quarter. Probably, Elena, something like 100,000 units would be our best estimate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so, John, to build on that point a little bit, Turbo penetration in Japan is really less than about 10%. So reduced production rates at the major Japanese OEMs which is primarily where you're seeing the disruption in the OEM build schedules, isn't going to affect us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, the thing we don't know yet that we did talk about in the earlier comments, just to reinforce, is you don't know to the extent that somebody is a Tier 3 or Tier 4 supplier in Japan, the western auto manufacturers. And we don't know that yet. We don't think there's an issue there, but we don't know yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's reasonable. Can I switch gears to Specialty Materials. Is there an issue that the business kind of is able to price, as you suggested, because of rising raw costs but it's a near-term or it's a current market pricing but then higher feed stock prices roll through to pressure margins? Like you really see the reversals kind of especially as oil prices stop going up or at least seem to have paused, but you get the lagging impact of the raws drive through? Is that what's going on or is that not the way to think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think about it just a little differently. The way that I think about it is that we had a fairly significant surge in input costs in the second half of 2010. This is particularly in our fluorines products businesses. Now we've smartly procured in advance of &#x2013; or concurrent with &#x2013; those increasing costs. So we were in a good position coming into first quarter. We had an imbalance in terms of supply/demand conditions overall for finished product and that was really on a global basis.</p>
          <p>And so we were very well-positioned. We were well-positioned in terms of ability to supply into that market. Gave us particular strength. And the imbalance, if you will ,created, we think, a non-sustaining level of conversion, revenue conversion. So that's going to normalize as we progress through the course of 2011. And what it's going to translate to as we said, John, is margin guidance for Specialty Materials in the range of 17% to 18%. Very attractive. I mean, very still, very good run rates. But much more, where we would have expected. So it is really that phenomena that really characterized the very positive performance in the first quarter and we don't see that sustaining.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just my last question, I guess. Going back to Japan. I mean you guys are very large between your two businesses, Norcross and Sperian, and you're very large suppliers of personal protection gear and so forth. As horrible as the tragedies have been, is there an incremental opportunity that's potentially meaningful that you can sell some of these products into the Japanese market or make some penetration gains or something like that? I'm just curious if there's any sort of &#x2013; you talk about the Turbo somewhat benefit indirectly. What about on those businesses specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say if there's something there, John, it's not enough to move the needle. I would say it's given us some very nice publicity for our T-Hawk, that remote control helicopter which, as you know, has been used extensively there now to be able to take pictures and do it in high radiation areas and I think we're going to see more attention there. But even there I wouldn't say it's going to move the needle.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if we could just drill a little further into aero? The first part of my question is just thinking now as we're on the eve of a pretty significant ramp now in large commercial OE volumes, how to think about how margins play? Obviously, you've got underlying structural cost improvements, but that aftermarket OE mix starts to work against you in the not too distant future, should margins still be able to drift up in that environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think so. We're holding, you know we're holding guidance, obviously, for the full year in terms of aero overall. What we're going to see I think, John, is the aerospace is actually in the near-term we're going to see the continued benefit of a continued recovery in the aerospace commercial aftermarket. That's going to be a tailwind for us.</p>
          <p>As we progress through the year, we're going to also spending a little bit more in terms of RAD as a result of the major program wins and the success that we've had. So the balance of those two is really what translates into the consistency in terms of the margin rate expansion that we think will be there or the consistency in terms of margin guidance that we have given you for the full year.</p>
          <p>The other thing that we'll have, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, you'll recall we had fairly sizeable launch contributions in business aviation in the second half of last year. We'll be &#x2013; in the second half of this year, we'll be lapping that period. We won't have those. So first quarter there was essentially no change. First quarter '10, first quarter '11, no change in launch contributions for BGA. We'll have that as a positive, as a tailwind, as we progress through the year in aerospace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd also add, Jeff, that like all our businesses, there's opportunity to get operationally better here and each business continues to just get better and better quarter by quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, just thinking about the aftermarket specifically, obviously, there's a lot of analysis done by you guys during the downdraft, kind of nail down the disconnect between flight hours and inventories at the airlines. You said R&amp;O has kind of equalized. Do you think actual physical spare parts have now equalized to inventory levels that sense relative to where flight hours are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what we're seeing is, let me give you maybe a little bit of a complicated answer to that question. Number one, as we've said, commercial spares were up 28% in the first quarter and we're expecting commercial spares to be up about 20% for the full year. And that's against a backdrop of an estimated 5% growth in flight hours. So I would say we're still seeing the recovery and the rebound on the spares side, Jeff.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, when you look at inventory levels compared to overall revenues of the airlines or compared to profitability of the airlines and use that index against historic levels, it's not rising. So what we're seeing is, there clearly is a need, a catch-up need, relative to utilization that we're going to see through the course of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Then, Dave Cote, could you speak a little bit more about just the appetite for M&amp;A here? And, also, you do have share repurchase, obviously, on the boards for this year? You didn't do any in Q1, I guess, because of the working capital dynamics in the quarter. But just how should we think about that balance and how you might toggle between the two over the course of &#x2013; not even just the year but the next 12 to 18 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the way to think about it is the way we always say, is it's going to depend upon where the opportunities are. And if M&amp;A is too rich, we're not going to do it. We' haven't lost our discipline there. And to the extent that we have the reserves and we don't see opportunities, then share repurchases come into play. But at the end of the day, we're always going to be opportunistic about what makes the most sense for the company and shareowners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You always have a pretty big funnel. Is the funnel looking rich or is there still things that can get done in this environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The funnel always looks good. We work pretty hard at keeping a good-sized funnel. As we pointed out at the investor conference, one of the things that makes us, I'd say, more adept when it comes to not overpaying is making sure you have lots of other opportunities.</p>
          <p>That being said, we're going to be very &#x2013; we're going to continue to be very cautious because it is an area where we like being 10 for 10.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. It was a big help. So you, I think the inference from the release was that March was much stronger than you expected. And I'm actually wondering, obviously, there's a lot of chatter about supply chain shortages. And I'm wondering if there's any companies building safety buffers in their inventories that might have helped contribute towards that strength? I mean, are you seeing things like companies and customers are starting to build inventory or were building inventory?</p>

          <p>In other words, I think, Nigel, make just rephrasing your question, making sure we're capturing it.

          <p>Our view, I'd said &#x2013; probably, Dave, it's fair to say our strong view is we just had underlying very good demand across the portfolio and you've heard some of the numbers, Nigel. I mean, it's across all of the regions.</p>

          <p>And then second, just coming back to SM, just looking at, obviously, 1Q you just had &#x2013; you had to start line up. That was great. But as you go into Q2, would you expect margins to still be above that 18% range or do you think you'll be more &#x2013; a little bit closer to that higher range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, we don't provide specific quarterly guidance in terms of individual business units. We provide, obviously &#x2013; provide you with full year guidance.</p>
          <p>But I think we're going to continue to see pretty good numbers out of SM in the second quarter. And I would suspect that what we're going to be seeing for SM for the remainder of the year is close to that full year range. That 17% to 18% range guidance that I provided to you, Nigel.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally you've got a big gain coming up on CPG probably in 3Q. You mentioned earlier in the call that you probably would offset gains with repositioning. Do you have enough opportunities and programs to offset that kind of gain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer is yes. And it won't be, as we have done in the past, and as Dave has really &#x2013; another discipline that he's built into the organization is really ensuring that we're doing <mark type="ph" /> tie payback (49:00) funding.</p>
          <p>We really look at the things smartly in terms of those &#x2013; that redeployment. And obviously, in this case we've had some time to think about it, to review different options. We're still going through that. But you should expect a smart redeployment overall of those gains. And looking forward then, how that will translate to continued growth, continued earnings momentum and a stronger business for '12 '13, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What kind of payback would you are expect from that investment? I mean, obviously, as you do more short-term objectives during the cycle, the payback period expands. I mean, are we looking at two-year paybacks or maybe a bit longer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will vary. It will vary by project. It will vary by specific item. But we'll provide you with clarity so that you will be able to translate that into your '12 and '13 thinking.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Steve.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q &#x2013; [0771R5-E]Steven Winoker &#x2013; Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.&gt;:Nice quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let's see, the one question I'm going to have time for is around maybe if you could quantify the material inflation, Dave Anderson, including components. Not just raws. If you actually think about excluding &#x2013; I don't know if you can do it &#x2013; the SM benefit from the contract escalators?</p>
          <p>What I'm trying to get at is what was the real inflation headwind that you faced that you offset with pricing and productivity and other bits? And how to think about that going through the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it was it was fairly significant in the quarter. So in total, if you take SM included &#x2013; and I know, Steve, you'd like to exclude it &#x2013; if you took SM in total plus TS for the quarter, you're talking about over $200 million in terms of inflationary headwind.</p>
          <p>So it was an important element to the quarter to be able to manage that and to be able to offset that in terms of our productivity actions as well as our pricing actions in the quarter to deliver the uptick that we did in terms of segment profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that you said that, I heard you say specialty and transport for the $200 million. I assume that's also aero and ACS or is that separate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes -</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all-in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. And was it &#x2013; are you seeing things get harder as you move through the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think we'll see even more challenges. As we talked about earlier, we've got a steepening curve, if you will, in terms of inflationary pressures.</p>
          <p>And in some cases, you go back to SM, and that's sort of the prominent one, we won't have the same supply/demand, if you will, imbalance that characterized the first quarter. It's still going to be very attractive, but it won't be at that same level that we experienced in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would add, though, Steve, across the board, we're not seeing anything we didn't anticipate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Very good point, Dave.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Bob Cornell from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. How about that. So you guys referenced the developing strength in the long cycle businesses, new process building. You mentioned North American fire. You gave some color there, but everything's gone by so quickly.</p>
          <p>Maybe you could go back over the prospects there for process building and North American fire? And are you suggesting the North American non-res businesses are starting to show signs of life? So maybe just a little more color there on those businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Elena, you want to give us a little bit of detail on ACS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So, Bob, I think what we're seeing is an improvement in residential retrofits, primarily in ACCs driven by some pent-up demand, given that we're in the crux of the home renovation season, which really stalled in 2009 and even in the beginning of 2010.</p>
          <p>And in addition, we're benefiting from some of our share gains on the <mark type="ph" /> compression (53:22) valves business, and also in the security products business, which is contributing to growth in the quarter. And we see that, obviously, sustaining itself.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, I think you are seeing, obviously, the benefit on the commercial retrofit side from favorable macro trends and energy efficiency with good pull through of new products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It all looks good, Bob, across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you know, we'll get back into that in more detail after the call. But actually I was look wondering, if you look at the 21% margin in Specialty Materials, is it fair to say that the advanced materials, given, Dave, your comments &#x2013; Anderson &#x2013; about the purchases and the prices, that advanced materials had the higher margins and UOP had the lower margins in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Advanced materials really led the quarter in terms of sales conversion and was a major contributor to that outperformance, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But as you look forward, I mean, UOP is going to start to have a ramp up in, I guess, the big Brazilian project. In the margin guidance for the second half, are you capturing the big ramp of what is probably a breakthrough profit project for UOP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've got that built in. We had, I may have mentioned this, we had $40 million approximately from the Petrobras project in the first quarter. That's going to &#x2013; it's relatively linear over the course of the year. Relatively even in terms of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to think about it being $150-ish million a year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So not quite the run rate of what we had in the first quarter but close to it.</p>
          <p>And then, UOP is going to, as I mentioned, Bob, earlier, it's going to benefit as we convert its strong backlog to revenue over the course of 2011. We're actually going to see an increase in the top line growth. We had 13%, 14% growth in UOP in the first quarter. It is going to be well above that as we progress through 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that will be a catalyst cycle that I think Jeff alluded to earlier, as well as the Brazilian job and what else will be a contributor to that acceleration of revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's across the board. It's projects business as well. As we mentioned, we had a significant strengthening in the backlog of UOP in the second half of 2010. That backlog continued to grow in the first quarter of 2011. So it's across the full product portfolio, projects business as well as the product or catalyst business of UOP, that we'll see the growth in the remainder of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you good morning. Just on emerging markets, you called out very spectacular growth in China, India &#x2013; I think 30%, 47% were numbers you mentioned. So what's driving that? Any specific products or is it across the board in ACS? And then, maybe an update on how should we be thinking about the growth rates there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the biggest growth that we had in those two markets really were ECC, within the ACS business and also HPS, the process solutions business within ACS. Those were the really big contributors. So &#x2013; but each of the businesses actually, Ajay, had strong performance &#x2013; emerging region performance in the quarter which led to the stellar numbers that we talked about. And our emerging regions were up, in total I think it's around 20% in the quarter. So, obviously, a key contributor &#x2013; an increasingly important contributor to Honeywell's overall organic growth.</p>
          <p>Two businesses stood out in terms of, to your specific question, those stood out in terms of the size and the growth. Those are on average about 50% growers during the quarter.</p>

          <p>Good. One more on Specialty Materials, if I can. So the supply/demand imbalance in the first quarter, what was that related to? Was that any of the supply disruptions out of Japan? Did that influence it or...?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and by the way, resins and chemicals, not to ignore that. R&amp;C had a very strong quarter, continued growth in caprolactam and also ammonium sulfate was very strong in the quarter. Now we expect some of that to, again, to modulate over the remainder of the year. But still very, very nice numbers for that business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason I ask is that we have heard of supply disruptions and chemicals, BT epoxy, electronic materials. And you obviously have a very strong global manufacturing footprint. So any opportunity for you there in &#x2013; as the market share shifts?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Been plenty of PDA this call, so I'll get right to the questions. On the second quarter, the &#x2013; usually your margin's up sequentially. I understand Specialty Materials is stepping down probably headwind of 30 to 40 basis points. But is your reported margin still going to be up in the second quarter despite that?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Gotcha. And then for both you guys. It's clear that this cycle &#x2013; you guys have come a long way over the last, I don't know, 9, 10 years. And last cycle even though you kind of beat a few quarters here and there, several quarters, it seemed there was a little more of penchant to invest away upside, kind of load the next year for growth, whereas this cycle it would appear that you are letting it rip a little bit more, which speaks to the positioning you guys are in and how far you've come with this portfolio investment, et cetera.</p>
          <p>I'm just curious as it to how you guys look at succession, kind of the legacy there. And over the next couple of years, what do you think you need to do to kind of position Honeywell for the next five to 10 years? And is that a job that's in inning four or five or is it in inning seven or eight? I'm just curious, I guess, as to your guys &#x2013; both of your tenures at Honeywell going forward? And of course, Dave your name has been in the news as far as potentially working with the government in some stage &#x2013; I'm just curious as it to how long you guys are going to be around for?</p>

          <p>Well as far as I'm concerned Honeywell's still in the top of the first. We've still got a lot of opportunity left to go. Also I like my job. And I'd say the difference you're seeing in terms of let it rip is not so much that as it is, if you went back to six seven years ago, there really was no pipe line. We didn't have a pipeline of products. We hadn't really finalized our great positions in good industries. We didn't have a great geographic presence then.</p>
          <p>All those things have changed and the thing I can promise you is the results you're seeing now are not a result of trying to shortchange anything for the future. If anything, we're accelerating that because we have more resources to do it with.</p>

          <p>All right. I'd like to just hand it over to Dave Cote for any final comments he may have before we end the call.</p>

          <p>Well, it was a wonderful start to the year and I think a real validation of our consistent focus. Our strategy, our focus, our seed planting &#x2013; none of this has changed. And I say this a lot, but relentlessly executing day by day, quarter by quarter gets you to amazing places over time. And I think our first quarter performance and our total year commitment are really just terrific evidence of that point. Thanks for listening.</p>
