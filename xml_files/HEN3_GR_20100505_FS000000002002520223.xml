          <p>Good day and welcome to the Henkel Conference Call. With us today are Kasper Rorsted, CEO; Lothar Steinebach, CFO and the Investor Relations team. For the duration of the call you will be on listen-only. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Today's conference call is being recorded and the webcast is available at www.henkel.com/ir.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Kasper Rorsted. Please go ahead sir.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our Q1 conference call. First I would like to focus on the market environment and the highlights of the first quarter 2010. Then Lothar Steinebach, our CFO will provide to you with the Q1 financial in greater details and after that I will comment on the outlook for 2010 and finally we will take your questions.</p>
          <p>I would like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation, which contains the usual formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation can be accessed via our website at henkel.com/ir. The presentation, discussion and conducted subject to this disclaimer. We will not read the disclaimer, but propose we take it as read into the record for the purpose of this conference call.</p>
          <p>Now let me get started with market environment and highlights of the first quarter. We saw a market that was slightly picking up most economic indicators show a upward trend. We are seeing a slight recovery in the industrial sector and here I would like to remind you of just basic mathematics that, when you have a sharp decline in relative turn, you need to have an even stronger recovery in relative term to get back to the same.  So when we are seeing strong relative growth rate in the industrial sector I would like remind everybody else that we saw very strong relative decline in the similar sector a year ago.  We are seeing private consumption on a moderate level, particularly in Europe.</p>
          <p>On the negative side, we are seeing raw material prices increasing again. The crude oil went from 75 in fourth quarter to 76 in the first quarter and forecasted to go to 78 in the second quarter and palm oil as another example went from $769 in the fourth quarter to 922 in the first quarter and going to forecasted 947 in second quarter. And lastly, <mark type="inaudible" /> went from 747 in fourth, 858 in first and 988 in the second. What I am trying to explain here or give you or exemplify is that we are seeing a raw material price increase.  It is a real thing and it's a phenomenon that we will see to a higher extent as we go through the year.</p>
          <p>What were the highlights of our first quarter?   We had a successful start or continuation of our Laundry &amp; Home Care business and our Personal Care business. We had a strong rebound of Adhesives business versus previous year. Overall it was the very strong quarter of our Adhesives business but in volume terms we are still below the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>We again saw double-digit growth rates in emerging markets for the first time for a year. We were capable of reducing our net debt further by 100 million compares to the closure of our last fiscal year, so December 31. And we continued our focus on implementing our strategic priorities where we are on track.</p>
          <p>However, there also setbacks.  As I said, sales is recovering but still not a pre-crisis level for our industrial business.  We are seeing almost across the board intensifying competition particularly in the fast moving consumer goods side and as I said at the previous slide, we are seeing raw material price increases taking place and materializing.  However, all in all we had a very promising start into 2010 with very solid numbers in all the different items.</p>
          <p>For Laundry &amp; Home Care we had good organic sales growth above market rates and also despite increased competition. Middle East and Africa continue its very strong performance from last year in to this year with double digit growth rates and we saw continued high EBIT and EBIT margin at the same time with an increase in our marketing spend.</p>
          <p>So I would like to highlight here that the EBIT and the EBIT margin did not come on the expenses and marketing spend.  We did significantly increase our marketing spend also in the first quarter. We continued our focus on innovation and driving innovation into the market, particularly with products that has a higher gross margin than the product they replace and with Persil Gold Plus Cold Active and Persil Hygiene Rinser we had two new very successful introductions into the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Also as highlighted within our strategic priorities is our focus on strength in our strong brands and now 83% of our sales within our Laundry &amp; Home Care business are being derived from our top ten brand cluster. So the profitable growth path that we have seen in the past year has been confirmed into the first quarter.</p>
          <p>For Cosmetics and Toiletries, we have strong organic sales growth against high comparables.  That means that we were running a very, very strong growth rate throughout the entire year last year and every quarter and this year are growing significantly above market rates. We saw our emerging markets with double-digit growth rates so our emerging markets have not been impacted by the recession. And we have seen record high market shares across Europe. We continue to see high EBIT and EBIT margin, again with a increased marketing spend similar as we've seen our <mark type="inaudible" /> business.</p>
          <p>Our innovation continued to be successful with the extension of our product line within the Syoss brand and Syoss is now within the first 12 months of existence has significantly the three similar numbers in revenue. With Dial NutriSkin we implemented a new successful product in the U.S.   And our top 10 brands globally for Cosmetics and Toiletries now account for 91% of our total sales. What we are seeing is a confirmation of our profitable long-term growth trend, very strong performance on higher, consistent level.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Adhesive Technologies we are seeing record organic sales growth albeit against a low basis in the first quarter of 2009. We are seeing all regions improving across the board, mature and emerging. But we are also seeing the emerging markets being the main growth driver. We are seeing sectors, particular electronics, transportation metal with a highest growth rates.  Again I would like to highlight this were also the sectors that were the most impacted in the first quarter of last year, but substantially very, very high growth rates in these sectors.</p>
          <p>As our EBIT and EBIT margin further improved not only against the first quarter or against the average of last year and we continue to see successful innovation in the marketplace. Approximately half of our sales in our Adhesives business is generated by top ten brands and what we are seeing is a clear and stable upward trend in our Adhesive technologies business.</p>
          <p>Coming to the numbers. Our sales grew to 3.512 billion versus 3.258 a year ago up organically 8.8% reporting at 7.8. We saw a significant increase in our gross profit margin by 380 basis points going up to 48.4 up from 44.6 a year ago. We saw adjusted EBIT going up almost 80% again albeit it was a weak quarter, so 421 versus 235 and that means our adjusted EBIT margin went from 7.2 a year ago to 12 points in the first quarter.  That is again &#x2013; is now the second quarter in a row where we are above our previous target of 2008 will pass the 12 points margin.  Free cash flow dramatically improved also and we were capable on keeping our net working capital at 8.5% so at one digit.</p>
          <p>So have a strong performance in all dimensions in the new year which also give us hope for and also realistically expectations for solid performance in 2010.  Now I would like to hand over to Lothar Steinebach, who will take through the financials in more detail. Lothar?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kasper. We'll jump right into the sales growth numbers Q1 2010 versus Q1 2009. Laundry and Home Care 3.5 in total, FX adjusted 3.3, 3.6 on an organic basis.  Personal Care 5.8, 5.2 and 5.5 respectively.  And Adhesive Technologies 12.4, 12.2 and 14.5 respectively again organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>Let's get into Laundry and Home Care first, organic sales growth of 3.6%, driven by a strong volume growth of 7.2 versus a negative 3.6 in terms of pricing. Now organic sales growth in Laundry and Home Care composed of a strong performance in Western Europe and North America, both mature regions which have been slow same period of last year and where we have been able to generate quite good organic sales growth in the course of the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>We've seen over proportional growth in the Home Care division.  Both Laundry and Home Care have been positive on an organic sales growth with Home Care delivering the strongest part of it. But we've seen already in Q1 increasing pricing pressure particularly from our customers but also pricing pressure from actions and activities of our competitors.</p>
          <p>Personal Care with strong organic sales growth of 5.5%, that again confirms the strong trend that we have seen throughout most of 2009 composed of almost 1% pricing and significant volume growth, 4.6 compared to same period of last year. And that in addition, is against strong prior year comps as I have mentioned already. So that therefore the strong volume growth signaling market share gains that we have experienced in the course of the first quarter and significant contribution from pricing.</p>
          <p>In terms of components of our growth, we have again strongly outperformed our markets.  As we had provided in our forecast for the full year 2010, we expect to continue to be able to outperform our respective markets. There again, we've seen a difference between the professional sector and retail section, retail business driving our growth because of the significant part of organic sales growth over proportional contribution from the retail business.  However the good news is that our professional business is back to grow.  It's been negative most of last year and we are back to at least positive growth in our professional business as well. You've seen excellent performance in the emerging market and we've seen organic sales growth positive in the mature countries.</p>
          <p>Strongest deviation progress compared to last year is obviously from our Adhesive Technologies division.  As Kasper mentioned already, we're seeing significantly weaker Q1 2009, so therefore, strong growth is not a surprise.  It's been mainly driven by volumes, almost 16% and slightly negative minus 1.4 from pricing. So that needs to be seen in perspective in terms of the performance that we have seen in the first quarter and second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Major contribution as we have experienced already in Q4 2009 is from electronics and transportation and the metal industry but also the general industry with strong organic sales growth.   And we have seen contribution from both mature markets and emerging markets with significant growth.  That continuous the evolution that we have seen in Q4 2009 in a significant way. We've seen not a particular decrease in industrial demand in those markets that have been starting to improve in Q4 2009 already.</p>
          <p>For the total company that translates into 8.8% organic sales growth, net organic sales growth, composed of strong volume, more than 10% and the negative of minus 1.6. In all our divisions particular emphasis on volume growth and maintaining or increasing our market share which is reflected in the strong volume contribution, the strong volume component in our total sales growth.</p>
          <p>In terms of the regional growth, we've seen positive organic sales growth in all regions. So all our regions have been growing organically on a positive basis.  Obviously, highlighting North America with almost 8% organic sales growth against the weak comparables, nevertheless, we've obviously profited from the markets that have been recovering but also from the positive contribution from fast moving consumer goods. Latin America continues on a very good strong organic sales growth path, and Asia Pacific with the strong recovery major growth boost from Asia Pacific in our businesses.</p>
          <p>Translating into the summary that we do for the emerging markets businesses that we operate, which have reached sales channel in 2010 Q1 of 38% compared to 35 for the same period of last year.  We see in our Cosmetics division continuing with double digit growth in the emerging markets and the Adhesive division returning to double digit growth, so therefore total company on a significant double digit growth path for the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Look at our operating earnings evolution, Laundry &amp; Home Care now on a adjusted EBIT basis, we look at margin progression that we experienced in Q1, Laundry &amp; Home Care 230 basis point, Personal Care 50, Adhesive Technologies is 850 compared to the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>Starting with Laundry &amp; Home Care, we've seen strong volume growth as you have seen in our sales growth component.  Strong volume growth, we've been driving market share and volume growth over the full period of time resulting in better capacity utilization, translating in the margin improvement that we have seen.  Now we have also contributed &#x2013; we've also benefited from the efficiency improvement part of the programs that we have established over the course of the past 18 months, particularly global excellence which has resulted in efficiency improvement and the benefits of it are visible in our margin in the Laundry &amp; Home Care division. We've seen still a slight support tailwind from the favorable raw material prices compared to the same period of last year and we've seen already a slightly negative compare to Q4 2009.</p>
          <p>Our Cosmetic and Personal Care division has continued its positive growth path which presently has been able to achieve during the course of 2009 on a very consistent basis.  Our continued focus on cost is paying off in terms of gradually improving our margin, reaching a level on an adjusted basis of almost 13%. Now there again, the watch out is aggressive, competitive activities and pricing actions from our competitors, which are focusing on volume and promotions and which had required us and committed us also to invest in addition or additionally into our media spend.  So consistent with our targets to maintain and increase our market share, we spend additional investment in our media spend and therefore despite this we've been able to increase our margin.</p>
          <p>Now the strongest improvement was, surprise, in our Adhesive Technologies with 850 basis points obviously compared to significantly weak Q1 2009.  Nevertheless the absolute margin achievement 12.2% is outstanding even compared to years where we've seen a much better industrial environment. Improvement in our cost structure that we have implemented in the course of 2009 in order to adjust our structures to the lower demand in our market has paid off significantly, plus we're seen strong growth in terms of sales growth in some of the high margin segment in our business.  As I've mentioned earlier, the electronics market is a high margin component in our portfolio and the strong growth that we have experienced there, has resulted in an over proportional margin contribution compared to the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>Translating again into gross margin, looking at the gross margin for the total company, progress of 380 basis points compared to the same period of last year. Again we're benefiting from the production streamlining that we have undertaken, not just last year, but started already 2008, continuing through 2009.  And we've seen obviously still contribution from lower raw material prices as I mentioned earlier.  There are still positive impact from lower raw material prices compared to the same period of last year. So therefore the margin improvement 380 basis points is composed of two different better structural set up in our production and still tailwind from the lower raw material prices.</p>
          <p>Income statement,  just a quick look at some of the components in our income statement. I would like to highlight marketing, selling and distribution expenses which have grown &#x2013; we have invested more in both our fast moving consumer good divisions.  Marketing investments have increased as a percentage of sales while distribution costs as part of our restructuring efforts have been down so therefore, we used the occasion to invest more in to our markets and our brands.  And at the same time taking some of the savings from restructuring efforts that we had undertaken to invest into our brands and into our promotions.  Now there has been decrease in some of the media spend.  In other words the unit cost per spend has been somewhat lower although not as significant as last year but there are still more from investment that we have gained into the media than we were able to realize last year.</p>
          <p>Reported to adjusted EBIT, just an explanation with respect to the one time gains which have been higher and therefore I deducted from our EBIT as reported.  And then there were no one time charges but there were restructuring charges of 31 million both almost evening out to adjusted EBIT almost the same as EBIT reported.  One time gains with realized gain from the termination of a license agreement in the Laundry and Home Care division and we have released post retirement healthcare provisions as a result of some of the restructuring that we have undertaken particularly in North America.  And the amount has been to the benefit of all three divisions in terms of restructuring charges.  There is a remainder the National Starch integration charge of 1 million, major part of it's normal restructuring with a major emphasis on our Adhesive division.</p>
          <p>Quick look at income adjusted EBIT to net earning highlighting financial result, which is slightly below last year, slightly less than last year.  We have basically two effects which have compensated each other.  We have a significantly lower volume of net debt compared to the same period of last year but higher interest expenses which result from the action that we have undertaken in the middle of last year converting short-term interest rates or flexible interest rates for fixed interest rates as part of our securing our long term financing and certainly our long term expenses in the financial result. And it's also due impart to the fact that we have a net cash position which obviously has a lower yield than what we pay for that.</p>
          <p>Operating profit, look at the cash flow statement. There is a big deviation; significantly lower amount of income taxes paid in Q1.  Major difference there is that we have had a one-off impact in the same period of last year. The tax paid on the Ecolab gain which obviously has not recurred because the gain unfortunately has not recurred and therefore we have only the normal income taxes on a normal level.</p>
          <p>Look at the cash flow statement which again shows that the improvement in our cash flow generation that we have experienced and been able to achieve in the course of last year have been kind of repeated in the first quarter of this year.  Significantly better cash flow from operating activities as a result of the significantly better operating earnings. That's obviously another surprise. The other is that we, despite the higher level of sales that we have experienced, have been able to maintain our low ratio of net working capital thereby consuming less cash than otherwise would have been necessary.</p>
          <p>Now this is exemplified by the numbers in terms of our net working capital, cash net working capital improving compared to same period of last year, significantly.  An improvement that we have seen already in Q4 2009 to a level of our around 8%. And we've been able to basically maintain the level around 8% for the total company with a significant improvement in our operating inventory piece of it and the trade payable part of it.</p>
          <p>Improving our situation in operating earnings, maintaining strict control on our cash net working capital has permitted us to reduce the level of net debt compared to the end of last year again by more than 100 million. We have consistently communicated that our target for this year remains to return to the A rating or A+ rating. And I believe that with respect to the cash generation and our ability to retire that, we're on a very good path to achieve that target.</p>
          <p>Quick look at Global Excellence and National Starch integration savings and the other actions that we have established. As far as we are concerned Global Excellence is finalized. We have communicated that we will achieve savings level of 160 million for total 2010. We're at 40 for Q1, so therefore the 110 is basically in our pockets. And therefore, from our perspective 100 &#x2013; the Global Excellence program is finished. There's no further intention to report about Global Excellence. All the actions have been implemented already and the savings basically are in our pockets.</p>
          <p>With respect to National Starch integration, the picture is slightly different, but only slightly. Most of the actions that we had targeted for this particular area have been implemented. Already there are few decisions left that need to be taken. But compared to the total level of savings that we want to achieve of 250 in 2011, we'll be achieving the 225, 2010 clearly with 55 already in Q1 achieved. So in total our plan &#x2013; we're far ahead of our plan in terms of speed. We're ahead of our plan in terms of realizing the synergies because the synergies that we have realized have basically only cost synergies while our original intention was that we would realize a combination of cost and offensive or revenue synergies.  We're going to get to our targets only with cost synergies but revenue synergies just a chance out in the marketplace, in particular in the electronics sector in the future.</p>
          <p>With that I will hand over for Kasper to provide the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lothar. We are seeing a general demand that is slightly improved but we're not seeing it much improved. So we are looking among the pieces of the forecast, forecast recovery by the outlook for 2010 on a monthly basis <mark type="inaudible" /> In many of our areas we will not see it back to old level in 2010 compared to 2008 that would probably happen a little more slowly.  We're seeing a more solid foundation. We're seeing a recovery but we are not seeing a fast recovery.</p>
          <p>Which brings me to our outlook. When it comes to top line, it is our ambition and our expectation that we will outperform markets, meaning that we will grow market share in the sectors where we are competing and we <mark type="inaudible" />. As it relates to adjusted EBIT, we continue to expect a slight improvement over previous years in the fast moving consumer goods businesses.  And in our Adhesives business we expect substantial improvement. That means that we're raising our overall outlook for Henkel's <mark type="inaudible" /> 10% plus <mark type="inaudible" /> an improvement of 10-15% plus for the full year. So we are raising the expectation and also the outlook based on a very strong first quarter.</p>
          <p> In summary, we had a promising and good start into 2010.  We have had strong performance across business sectors and regions. But I want to be very clear, what I say right now, we are by no means near end of the road. We still have plenty of work to do and that's why we will have continuous adaptation of structures to changing market environments.</p>
          <p>If anybody of you were to believe because global expense is over, we are at the end of the road, we are not at the end of the road.  That's why we will also guide you at the analyst conference in February to restructuring charges of 100 to 120 million of annualized run rate going forward. So what we are saying is, is we have still significant work to do within our structure. That work we have committed to do in order to reach our financial <mark type="inaudible" />. we have the good start in the year, but we are far from being where we want be.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd now like to close the formal part of the presentation and start the Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Rorsted. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line Mark Christensen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Can I just ask two questions on pricing, one on the consumer business, one on the Adhesives business. I'm just wondering with that the pricing environment you described in Laundry and Home Care whether that's come as surprise to you or whether it was somehow anticipated given the strong comparison. If you're able to give any sort of color as to what region in particular you might be seeing the most pricing pressure evolving and perhaps how your market shares are actually also evolving.  So that's the &#x2013; if you could just sort of help me out with little bit more information on Laundry there?</p>
          <p>The second one is last night one of your main industrial competitors in the U.S. announced intentions to raise pricing quite significantly in North America, back-end of the year to recover pending pricing pressure. Just wondering if that something you expect the industry to replicate or in fact if it is your own intention or do you believe you'll be able to put through some of the own pricing increases in Adhesives later in the year to recover pricing, your input cost pressure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with the question on the consumer goods side and Lothar will take the industrial side. Following a year of price increases in 2009 really driven by the raw price increases in 2008, it was not surprising that we saw increased competition in the pricing level following a rapid decline of raw materials in 2009.   And what we did see is the following scenario. In Western Europe we have seen fairly stable list pricing for detergent business, so, most of the price competition has been around promotional activities.  In Eastern Europe we have seen significant price decreases on list, primarily driven by P&amp;G.</p>
          <p>In India, where we only have a marginal presence, I am certainly aware there is a "price war" going on between P&amp;G and Unilever with significant price decreases across the board and I mean significant price decreases. And in North America we are seeing a rollback on our Purex product on list.  So it's been a mix of many, but as I said, slight decrease in list in North America, hardly any list change in Europe, list change in Eastern Europe that is macro part of the picture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the industrial part, the Adhesives sector just first question that we will not comment on actions of our competitors. So therefore our comments are entirely related to our own situation. We have seen obviously following us closely that we have in the past increased our prices in Adhesives sector consistently, sometimes continually almost monthly. So, therefore, that something which have been able to achieve and that we expect to be able to achieve in the future.</p>
          <p>However, the question is that there is a delicate balance to be kept right now in a recovering market that we maintain our position with our customers also in markets where customers have a choice. So therefore market share and benefiting from the stronger volume that we have experienced in Q1 and that we expect to continue throughout the next quarters will require high degree of careful balancing of profitable growth. So therefore we will not try to make indications per quarter, more on an annual level.  And on an annual level, we expect to be able to increase our prices compensating for raw material price increases, but that then may require different actions and behavior in the quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you very much for that. If I could just clarify, too, could you just give me a comment perhaps on that Laundry business on the market shares in those regions that you saw at the various pricing dynamics, just directionally, if you are able to do that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes what I can say is in all the markets where we are in, lets talk about North America, Europe and Eastern Europe also, we've maintained or grown market share positions.  We have not lost market position in other key markets.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Two questions, first on raw materials as far as I know earlier times you mentioned to see raw material cost increase by a mid-single digit rate in 2010.  Did that change? The second question is on the Cosmetics part.  Was also the Cosmetics part in some regions affected from some price pressure, I mean here especially Eastern Europe?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the raw materials, our outlook that we have provided mid-single digits remains valid. So therefore, the bigger impact of that will be visible in the next three quarters and that's part of the reason for the outlook that we have provided.  The more negative impact will be occurring during the rest of this year. With respect to the impacts, that will not change.  In other words, there will be a bigger impact on Laundry &amp; Home Care and the Adhesives division and less so on the Cosmetics division.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the price development in Eastern Europe, we are seeing across the board also in Eastern Europe significant pressure on price across the board.  What we have done is that we have not reduced our pricing, but we are seeing more activity on the promotional side.  From that extent it has hit our pricing line, but it is to expect it that it will be a more intense competitive environment and that is also why that we have systematically over the last set of quarters increased our promotional &#x2013; our advertising spend.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. Just following up on the input cost issue. I was wondering if you could possibly quantify the cost benefit in Q1 so we can get a feel for the magnitude of inflation through the rest of the year. And just around the moving parts there, am I right, if you are still looking for mid single digit inflation, what you're seeing is underlying costs might be up, but you're getting some offset from FX I guess emerging market appreciation coming into play there.</p>
          <p>And then the second question I had was on trends in end market demand in Adhesives. I was just wondering if you saw an acceleration through the course of the quarter, from Jan, February to March, if you could possibly comment on what you've seen in April.  And also within that did bad weather at all hold that growth in the first quarter. I think some of your competitors spoke about that a little bit. And given the strong start to the year you've seen in volumes is there any risk of destocking later in the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the input cost question. The impact, the positive impact was below 1% in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period of last year, so it was positive but very, very small basically.</p>
          <p>With respect to FX, we have obviously experienced and seen a recovery in some of the emerging markets, particularly Eastern Europe.  Currencies question will be how that is going to unfold over the rest of the year with the big variations that we're right now seeing between the U.S. dollar and the euro, the U.S. dollar influencing some of these Eastern European currencies, the euro influencing some of the others.  So that remains something where we're obviously watching out very carefully. Right now, we would not be able to quantify whether that's going to be significant support or distraction.  But the mid single digit outlook that we have provided remains valid as I said earlier and we have basically no other perspective on that particular item. There is a high degree of volatility and insecurity in the FX markets and therefore, that's not an area where we venture to speculate on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Adhesive side, volume wise we saw a slight pick up in the month of March after a fairly good start in January and February.  So slight pick up in March so that means it was not quite a third, a third, a third, but it was a fairly balanced quarter. On April, I'll be able to comment on beginning of August. At this stage I don't see any risk at this stage on a destocking &#x2013; stocking or destocking.  I think there what we're seeing is, we're seeing a fairly transparent flow through.  Most of our customers are very concerned about their stocking position and on their cash position, so we're not at this stage seeing any significant build-up of inventory that in the short term or medium term could lead to a destocking later on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, your next question comes from the line of Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. It's Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst. Question is first on automotive, one of your major clients in adhesive, obviously you describe in your quarter report that you're looking forward for a full year growth.  Do you see a risk, that let's say we could have in second half a sequential decline versus the first half?  How is your planning and how is your budgeting looking at that?</p>
          <p>Second question on the follow-up of the currency impact on your guidance, can you guys give us just the assumption, the underlying exchange rate assumption you made.  Was it quarter end or was it more higher than obviously in the middle of the quarter?  Can you a little bit elaborate on that?</p>
          <p>And on Syoss you are obviously very, very successful, 100 million plus product on 12 months basis.  I'm just a little bit curious in terms of when should you reach a kind of normal profitability with such a product?  Is it in such a launch phase possible as phase was so strongly or is something which would pick up now over the next quarters in terms of profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just start with the risk of the automotive market in the second half year.  Frankly speaking we don't have visibility for the second half.  For the time being we assume that we'll see some further improvement but there is no guarantee that this will occur.  As you might imagine, our customers are pretty reluctant to give us more definitive outlook on the second half of this year.  Assumption will be that, it's not going to be a significant decline.</p>
          <p>With respect to the foreign exchange assumptions, if I may assume for the time being that you'll refer to the U.S. dollar, because otherwise it would be long list of currencies.  The assumption for the U.S. dollar is basically in the range of 1.38, which we've seen in the Q1 as the average rate already. So for that period of time we were pretty good.  However as you've seen I guess today or yesterday, U.S. dollar has significantly strengthened again.  Now, that in itself is a positive for Henkel.  Overall the stronger U.S. dollar is a benefit to Henkel. So that in itself is not a concern to us. What is a concern is the volatility and the difficulty to predict. Other than that we've seen some of the strengthening in the Eastern European currencies and also Latin America, significant devaluation in Venezuela, which obviously was not predictable or predicted although Venezuela has been fixed in terms of currency for quite a period of time.</p>
          <p>With respect to finally the Syoss question--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Syoss, we have now introduced Syoss in 18 countries within a 12 month period. So we are still implementation phase. But as you're going to hear from the members we are building substantial positions in each of the countries. So over time, and I'll not give you the time at horizon, it's clear that with the presence and with the size Syoss we have &#x2013; we will be getting a significant contribution also on the bottom line from Syoss. So at this stage we are still introduction mode, but we have reached a level right now from a size standpoint where there is enough mass to have a very solid business.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add to the automotive market question. There are statistics available and forecast available for the number of cars produced. We've seen a very weak performance in 2009, far below 60 million. Our current forecast remains about 60 million.  It's even been improved compared to the forecast that we have received three months ago. So right now we're still on the positive track.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One question, perhaps on electronics if I may. Electronics, there is actually a market participate argues that if you're restocking, significant restocking of value chain then that is obviously a risk for the second half year, and anything from your observation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We firmly believe that the recovery in electronics is basically driven by market demand rather than strong restocking. And the bigger part of what we are supplying to our customers is not material that goes into inventories, very much it's going into production, which is called the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Finished products.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Into the finished products. So therefore that's not a material that you would expect to stock for longer periods of time or in bigger amounts. Even though it's small material but very specialized and it's applied in a high-speed production process. And therefore basically, we do not from our perspective what we have seen in terms of recovery is not at sustainable level for the course of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I just wanted to go back on your comments on the National Starch synergies, I think you said you got to your total target just through the cost synergies.  Whereas the initial guidance was 70% of that would come through cost synergies. Can I just confirm that and should we therefore be adding some revenue synergies on top of that original guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First part of your question, the answer is yes. Second part; not this year, but generally speaking, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as the environment continues to improve you'd hope those revenue synergies would start coming through to the bottom line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I may just one other question on the Laundry business with input cost inflation coming back through the course of the year and pricing seemingly quite difficult. What else is there you can do in terms of helping to offset those cost pressures outside of the savings still to come from Global Excellence and purchasing. I guess, I'm talking about things here like reformulation opportunities.  Are there other efficiencies you can try and get through in packaging something like that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The answer is consistent with our communication about Laundry division. We have every year a program of in the range of 100 million so called gain savings. This is a program that is established every year, because there's a significant pressure even under easier circumstances from our retailers to be more efficient, to reduce our prices rather than increase our prices; and we obviously have the cost inflation or price inflation in our structure. So therefore there's a program every year in place generating in the range of 80 to 100 million savings in all lines of P&amp;L.  That includes packaging and includes structure and includes everything that we are capable of addressing. It includes complexity reduction. It's a lot of different smaller actions which all in all come up to a level 80 to 100 million offsetting either price increases on the input side and/or pressure from our retailers. That's been a practice in that division for the past five years at the very least and we expect to be able to continue that through the course of this year and next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that 80 to 100 is across all divisions, all three divisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. no; that's just Laundry and Home Care.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So presumably you're getting more savings in other divisions as well on similar basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I was just giving that as an example. The other divisions in Adhesives in particular where we have the other piece, the other strong impact from the input cost inflation. There is a bigger question, there is not too much of an opportunity to reformulate, change the packaging, because that's just not possible in that division. So the stronger impact there is on developing innovations and also implementing price increases. So therefore, price increases are more important and more doable in the Adhesives division.</p>
          <p>In the consumer Cosmetics division a bit of a different story because the impact from the raw material prices is less and therefore there again the bigger impact is from impacting our cost structure.  Again complexity reduction programs, introducing new product at the same time getting rid of old product in order to not to increase our complexity and the strong impact is additional volume from innovation.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, hi. Just a quick question on the Adhesives margins. I think at the full year results you mentioned that you were thinking of a run rate of margin closer to the second half of 2009. I was wondering if that guidance is still what you are thinking for 2010 as you look out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Short answer would be basically, yes. Obviously you have seen adjusted EBIT margin slightly higher than the average of 2000 &#x2013; the second half of 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our expectation is that we will see continuation of the gradual recovery that has helped us in Q1 and that then would help us also in the next quarter. Again however, there will be a negative impact from raw materials, which we have not seen to the extent that we expected for the full year. So there will be again a balance of increasing our volume, generating additional sales from the recovery that we expect, and at the same time not overdoing it in terms of pricing actions so that we don't lose market share and the volume that we have factored in.  But it's a delicate balance as I mentioned earlier. Our expectation is that we will be able to maintain the level, I am not suggesting the exact number or the traction, but the level that we have achieved far exceeding the level of the margin that we have achieved in the Adhesives division.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me proactively address the question that many of you have written about and none of you have asked us about and that is our guidance.  And I will like just to remind you where we are, a year ago we were sitting virtually together following an earnings warning that we'd issued after a disastrous first quarter.  And we have in the past 12 months increased our EBIT by five points, so if we're to follow that run rate, we would be at 17 points of margin in the first quarter of 2011.  I can assure you that is not the case.</p>
          <p>What we are very committed to do is to fulfill the targets we have set ourselves for 2012. We have consistently said and stressed at every call we've had that we will continue to make decisions to our structure to enable us to be more competitive as we move forward. We have done substantial change to the company over the last 12 months and substantially also increased the level of profitability.  And we have right now put a very solid first quarter in the bank, but I also want to stress is, as I did in my presentation, we still have a lot of work to do.</p>
          <p>We are committed to getting there, but patience is also a virtue and getting there the right way is very important for us because that's the only sustainable &#x2013; the only right way of doing it in a sustainable way. So we are very committed to our targets. We are very committed to make the right decisions. At the same time we also are very committed to make the appropriate investments into the marketplace to make us sustainable, high performance company.  I.e. this is what we need to do and that's why we've raised our guidance for the year from 10 plus to 15 plus.  If we believe that we'll continue to perform as we do, I'm certain there is more in it when we get there. So let's make certain we take it step by step and that is our intent. Lothar, do you want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to highlight that we've started of with 10 plus, and the plus may have been overlooked and the 15 plus may be overlooked again. I think that we're trying to say that the 15 is something which are committed to and very confident that we're going to reach it and we see the upside.  And that's the plus that we have communicated. But there are also risk involved, and therefore, as the risks are very difficult to quantify in terms of what they might amount to in the next nine months. But cautiously saying that there is an upside that we signaled with the plus, but that there are also risks involved that we need to take into account. And as Kasper has said, the most important aspect is that we operate the company on a sustainable level, that we invest in our markets &#x2013; in our brands and in our R&amp;D and that remains our priority target for this year which will pay off during the course of this year, but certainly next year and 2012.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Lothar. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for participating in our first quarter conference call. After a good and successful start to 2010, we now look forward to significant improvement in our results for the full fiscal year versus 2009.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we will remain our rigorous approach to cost management and our continuous adaptation of our structures to changing in market environment.  I'm therefore optimistic as we move forward. I wish you all the best and I look forward to seeing soon certainly by the time of our Adhesive Technologies Investor and Analyst Day on December 16, 2010 in D&#xFC;sseldorf.
