          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the 2011 Woodside Full-Year Results. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Mr. Peter Coleman. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, and good morning all and welcome to our 2011 full-year results briefing. Once again, we appreciate everyone calling in today, and of course we very much appreciate your continued interest in Woodside. Sharing the conference call today is Lawrie Tremaine, our Executive Vice President for Finance and CFO, and Rob Cole, our new Executive Director for Commercial.</p>
          <p>If I can point briefly to the very important disclaimer notice, of course, draw your attention; it's our normal disclaimer, and just a reminder for everybody again; I know you're aware, but all the dollar figures presented today will be in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted on the charts.</p>
          <p>If I can move to Slide 3, today's business results highlight the ongoing strength of the company's base business. Our full-year 2011 revenues rose 14.5% compared to the previous corresponding period, and of course reported NPAT is down 4.3% due to higher exploration expense and Pluto cargo mitigation, which Lawrie will explain in more detail later. The underlying profit increased 16.7% and was underpinned by the strong performance of the North West Shelf driving higher revenues. And with our operating cash flow covering the majority of our investment spend, coupled with around $2.2 billion of cash in undrawn facilities, we're very well positioned for growth.</p>
          <p>Our 2011 operational performance; of course our focus on operational excellence continues to deliver outstanding results, and while our safety numbers improved in 2011, we still need to strive for further improvement to achieve the world-class performance that we all are striving for. Our focus on reliability at the North West Shelf Project continues to reap benefits, which is translating to the bottom line. In addition, we're continuing to develop the North West Shelf, as evidenced by the recent final investment decision for Phase 1 of the Greater Western Flank development.</p>
          <p>Production from our base business of 64.6 million oil equivalent barrels exceeded our midyear guidance, although as we all recognize, it was disappointing that Pluto did not contribute to our production volumes in 2011. Our reserve replacement ratio remains above 100% on a three-year rolling average, and contingent resources were boosted by positive revisions in the Browse fields.</p>
          <p>Here's a snapshot of our 2002 (sic) [2012] (02:48) outlook. Our production forecast is 73 million to 81 million oil equivalent barrels, which we advised the market in November last year is unchanged. This comprises 56 million to 60 million barrels from the underlying business and 17 million to 21 million barrels from Pluto. On the slide, we have provided expected capital and exploration expenditure for 2012. We plan to invest approximately $430 million in exploration expenditure in 2012, and this includes drilling eight exploration wells across Australia, Korea, and the Gulf of Mexico. We will continue to progress our developments, but Rob will go into that in more detail later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Our strategic direction is outlined on this slide, and as you know, we've been undertaking a thorough review of organizational effectiveness and capability to sharpen our decision-making, conduct a health check of our strategy, and confirm our strategic direction. Underpinning this direction is a commitment to continue delivering top-quartile performance, and the slide sets out how we will achieve this: through maximizing value from our existing producing assets, commercializing our discovered resources, and broadening our portfolio by leveraging our capabilities, and assessing new opportunities that generate value.</p>
          <p>In doing this, we must focus on performance delivery to effective decision-making, execution, and learning. This is all about making sure we're in the right shape to identify and deliver on opportunities that add value.</p>
          <p>I'll talk more about this in detail later in the presentation, and now I'll hand over to Lawrie to take us through the financial results.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter, and good morning to everyone. I'm going to review our 2011 full-year financial results, beginning with production on Slide 8. Production for full-year 2011 was 64.6 million barrels of oil equivalent, down 11.1% from 2010. More than one-third of the year-on-year change was due to one-off occurrences, including divestments, the Ohanet contract expiry, and the impact of worse than normal cyclone activity early in 2011.</p>
          <p>We also experienced increased planned maintenances and outages associated with our development projects, particularly the North West Shelf oil redevelopment and the NR2 project. Infill wells at Stybarrow and Vincent went a long way towards offsetting field decline. Additional reliability improvement in North West Shelf gas facilities was gratifying, but did not fully offset reliability losses at our oil assets. The purchase of the Vincent FPSO and achieving steady-state production on the North West Shelf oil FPSO at the Okha will allow us to address the most significant of the reliability issues.</p>
          <p>Now to sales revenue on Slide 9; sales revenue for the full year was $4.8 billion. This represents a 14.5% increase over 2010. Not surprisingly, stronger oil prices were the primary reason for this very positive result, more than offsetting the impact of lower volumes. Average daily Brent prices were 38% higher year-on-year, and this has translated into a 30% increase in Woodside's average realized prices. We have continued to achieve strong premiums over dated Brent for our heavy Greater Enfield area crudes. These premiums are a consequence of strong Asia-Pacific demand for gasoil. In 2011, we have achieved average premiums from the Greater Enfield area of around $6 per barrel over dated Brent.</p>
          <p>Next, lifting costs on Slide 10; in the table at the top of this slide, you can see our total lifting costs in Australian dollars have increased AUD19 million, or 5%, compared to 2010. Oil lifting costs increased by AUD1 million, to AUD231 million. Lower production rather than higher spending has resulted in an increase in oil lifting costs to AUD13.76 per barrel. As we foreshadowed in the half-year briefing, gas lifting costs increased in 2011 due to higher offshore maintenance activities as well as higher onshore operating costs. Unit gas lifting costs were also higher, but to put this into perspective, the 2011 unit costs are just 2% higher than it was back in 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving on to unit margins on Slide 11; the height of the columns in this chart represents our average realized price per barrel across all products, and the red section of the column represents the unit margin per barrel. Our unit margin for 2011 was $51 per barrel, compared to $36 per barrel in 2010. The percentage increase in the unit margin is consistent with the increase in the Brent price.</p>
          <p>Now turning to reported profit on Slide 12; you can see from the waterfall, higher selling prices were the major driver of our profit result year-on-year. Higher prices more than offset the impact of lower sales volume. The variance in other expenses is due to the higher exploration expense in 2011, together with the Pluto delay mitigation costs. These two items require further explanation.</p>
          <p>Our exploration expense in 2011 was $90 million higher than the previous year. In addition, in 2011, we have written off prior-year expenditure of $176 million, which was previously capitalized. These costs mostly relate to the Alaric and Larsen wells, which were not fully evaluated at the end of the 2010. Our Pluto development cost estimate of AUD14.9 billion includes an amount for mitigation costs associated with the delayed startup. $282 million of mitigation costs and $22 million of pre-Pluto startup costs have now been expensed in 2011.</p>
          <p>Now on to underlying profit on Slide 13; our 2011 underlying profit reflects the strength of our base business and of course the good oil price environment we've enjoyed throughout the year. The underlying profit was just over $1.6 billion, a 16.7% increase on the $1.4 billion recorded in 2010. In 2011, we have adjusted for nonrecurring items of $148 million after tax. This includes the after-tax impact of the Pluto delay mitigation costs. It's also worth noting that in 2011, we reversed part of the Neptune impairment recognized in 2010 due to further evaluation of project economics.</p>
          <p>Turning to dividends next on Slide 14; the directors have declared a fully-franked final dividend of $0.55 per share. This lifts our 2011 full-year dividend to $1.10 per share, $0.05 per share higher than 2010. The dividend reinvestment plan will again be offered and will be fully underwritten.</p>
          <p>Now to investment expenditure on Slide 15; this chart shows our current estimate of 2012 capital and exploration expenditure. Investment expenditure is easing back in 2012 with the startup of the Pluto project. We will continue to maintain a level of exploration expenditure broadly consistent with prior years. Investment continues at Browse, as we complete front-end engineering and design work and develop a project business case.</p>
          <p>To operating cash flow on Slide 16; the operating cash flow result of $2.2 billion represents our second-highest annual result and was 6.6% higher than 2010. This result is largely due to higher prices and also of course our continuing strong operating performance.</p>
          <p>Next to capital management on Slide 17; 2011 was another successful year from a funding perspective. In May, $700 million of ten-year corporate bonds, with a coupon of 4.6% per annum, where issued into the United States 144a bond market. Pleasingly, this was achieved at a lower margin and accessed a broader debt investor base than previous transactions.</p>
          <p>In December, we secured additional short-term funding totaling $400 million at highly competitive margins. In addition, a number of 364-day and bilateral debt facilities were renewed at more favorable returns during 2011. We entered 2012 with $2.2 billion in cash and undrawn debt facilities. This is adequate funding to meet our existing commitments, given the current oil price and exchange rates.</p>
          <p>The chart shows that we have $1.3 billion of debt facilities that fall due in 2012, of which only $570 million is currently drawn down. We expect that only $550 million of the $1.3 billion of debt maturing in 2012 will need to be refinanced. $150 million of this refinancing has already been completed in the first few weeks of this year. Our investment-grade credit ratings, combined with our established presence in global capital markets, give us every confidence of being able to fund our continuing growth through capital markets, as required.</p>
          <p>Finally, to reserves on Slide 18; we continue to grow our reserve base. Since the final investment decision in 2007, we have increase the Greater Pluto 2P reserves by 45%. We recently booked an additional 251 million barrels of oil equivalent of contingent resources for our Browse project. On a gross basis, this increases the total resource from 13.3 to 15.5 Tcf of dry gas, together with an increase from 360 million to 417 million barrels of condensate. This booking is unrelated to the recently completed Tridacna Survey. The data from that seismic survey will be processed later this year.</p>
          <p>Thanks for listening. I'll now pass you on to Rob Cole, our new Executive Director, Commercial, to discuss our projects and operational performance. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lawrie. Good to be with your and Peter this morning. Let me take you through some of our activity, starting with Slide 20. The North West Shelf Project continues to be a strong and proven performer for Woodside, with excellence in production and reliability. In 2011, the project achieved record revenue, contributing 62% of Woodside's total revenue for the year. Safety remained a priority, with the Karratha Gas Plant recording its best safety performance on record, with more than 120 days without a recordable case. Overall, LNG production reliability continued to improve, reaching 98% from 94.3% in 2010 and ahead of our 2013 target of 97.5%.</p>
          <p>Next slide. A significant refurbishment program commenced at the Karratha Gas Plant in 2011, which is designed to ensure safe and reliable production into the future. Now, while this impacts short-term availability, it pays dividends with long-term LNG reliability and integrity. The table on the right-hand side of the slide shows routine and refurbishment shutdown activity for 2011 to 2014. Last year, the refurbishment of Stabiliser 1 was completed, and online corrosion inspection and repair works commenced on LNG Train 2.</p>
          <p>Where possible, we have scheduled concurrent activities to minimize the impact on production, but you can observe that 2012 will be a very busy year. In 2012, work will continue with the refurbishment activities on LNG Train 2 and the trunkline onshore terminal. We have an ongoing maintenance and refurbishment program, as shown in the chart on the slide. Naturally, this will affect 2012's availability in some production. This availability, of course, has been taken into account in the 2012 production target that we've supplied to you previously.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide, the North Rankin Development is a $5 billion project that will extend production and meet increasing demands for North West Shelf gas. At year-end, the project was 87% complete. In Indonesia, the platform bridges were completed. In Korea, the fabrication of the 23,000-ton topsides were completed for sail-down to the North West Shelf early this year. The topsides installation is due to occur in first-half 2012. The project remains on budget and on schedule for completion in 2013.</p>
          <p>The North West Shelf Oil Redevelopment project included the conversion of the Okha to an FPSO and replacement of the associated subsea infrastructure. Production commenced in September last year, with three off-takes completed by year-end. Commissioning of the Okha gas systems continues, with ramp-up towards steady-state production in first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 23, the Greater Western Flank Phase I Project was approved in December, ahead of the previously-advised 2012 schedule. Phase I startup is expected in early 2016. The project includes a subsea tie-back of the Tidepole and Goodwyn GH fields to the existing Goodwyn platform. A phased development of the GWF area is necessary to efficiently use the existing infrastructure and unlock an estimated volume of up to 3 Tcf of recoverable gas and up to 100 million barrels of recoverable condensate.</p>
          <p>This project, together with other undeveloped gas reserves, will maintain offshore supply to Karratha Gas Plant and support the North West Shelf Project's ongoing marketing efforts for domestic gas and LNG. In addition, we expect exploration to provide discoveries and maintain production at capacity as shown in the chart on this slide.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the oil business on the next slide; our Australian oil assets continue to provide a solid revenue stream for the business. We're really proud of these assets and the contribution they've made. In 2011, Woodside, along with our joint venture participant, Mitsui, purchased the Ngujima-Yin FPSO from Maersk. This important acquisition will facilitate plans to extend the field life at Vincent and allow continued reliability and availability improvements. We plan to assume full operatorship this year.</p>
          <p>Two infill wells at Vincent came online in September, boosting production rates to the highest level ever for the FPSO. The technology used to drill these wells is industry-leading, and I'll explain this in more detail shortly. Enfield production exceeded expectations during the year, with excellent facility reliability, well optimization, and reservoir performance.</p>
          <p>Next slide. Stybarrow production increased in 2011 as the result of high production rates from the Stybarrow North production well. Laminaria-Corallina has seen natural field decline over the past year, but the Northern Endeavour FPSO continues to deliver solid volumes.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, the outstanding production rates achieved at Vincent were a result of the leading multi-lateral technology we've used to drill the infill wells. This slide shows a map of the Vincent oil field, showing the 13 multilateral wells and a diagram of the well design for a typical trilateral well. The wells can reach horizontal lengths of up to 2,100 meters in the reservoir, which is quite an achievement, requiring precise drilling techniques. As I mentioned earlier, the two infill wells that came online in September, boosting Vincent's quarterly production to its highest level since startup.</p>
          <p>Next slide. The next phase of development of our Australian oil assets includes commercialization of our Laverda and Cimatti fields. In 2011, we continued our appraisal program for Laverda, resulting in an increased resource estimate. Drilling of the Norton appraisal well is underway. This work will inform the assessment of development options, which could include a standalone FPSO or a tie-back to an existing facility.</p>
          <p>We've selected a development concept for Cimatti based on a tie-back to the Enfield FPSO, extending the life of this asset. This year we expect to complete a basis of design for the development and commence front-end engineering and design, to be in a position to make a final investment decision next year.</p>
          <p>Now, to Pluto on Slide 28; final commissioning activities are progressing well, with the offshore platform and major pieces of equipment, including the compressors, power generation units, jetty, storage, and loading facilities all now operational. I'm very pleased to advise that offshore gas was introduced to the front end of the LNG train on the weekend, transitioning the plant from projects to operations. Achieving this significant milestone required completion of all the necessary controls, communications, and safety systems for the plant.</p>
          <p>Now on to Slide 29; once operational, Pluto, as mentioned earlier, is expected to contribute 17 million to 21 million barrels to our production volumes in 2012. In calculating the 2012 production forecast, both the startup date and the ramp-up scenarios were used. As we move through 2012, the ramp-up profile of the plant will become clearer. It goes without saying that Pluto will result in a step-change to Woodside's production volumes. As shown in this slide, once Pluto reaches steady-state, we expect it to contribute about 37 million barrels a year.</p>
          <p>To ensure we're in the best position to realize these production levels, we are already identifying opportunities to optimize production to enhance value from this premium asset. We continue to look at options for Pluto expansion, building on the value created by the foundation project. We plan to drill three further exploration wells in support of expansion, and we continue discussions with other resource owners.</p>
          <p>Next, to Browse on Slide 30; beyond Pluto, we made significant progress towards commercializing our Browse LNG Development in 2011. Ongoing reservoir analysis and evaluation resulted in positive revisions in the Calliance and Torosa fields. The Tridacna 3D survey has yet to be interpreted. The upward revision of the resource reinforces the value of this resource to Woodside. Front-end-engineering and design for the Browse LNG Development is substantially complete. Invitations to tender were issued in 2011 for major upstream and downstream components of the development. We're using a competitive contract strategy for the offshore drilling and production facilities and onshore plant to drive innovation and cost efficiency. We expect to receive bids in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>The Browse Joint Venture is seeking amendments to the Browse Basin retention leases. This includes amending the condition relating to FID readiness from mid-2012 to the first half of 2013 to allow time for thorough evaluation of the outcomes of FEED, tender submissions, and necessary assurance activities. As we advised the market last month, we are conducting a limited process for the potential sale of a minority portion of our interest in the development, and this process is ongoing.</p>
          <p>Next slide. In 2011, we commenced our reengagement with the Timor-Leste government to progress the Sunrise development. In addition to meetings with senior government representatives on two visits to Dili last year, Peter met with Prime Minister Gusmao just last week on his visit to Australia. All parties involved with Greater Sunrise, including both governments and the Sunrise Joint Venture, are aligned in their desire to see this high-quality resource developed.</p>
          <p>We recognize that the Joint Venture's preferred development concept differs from that of the Timor-Leste government's, and we're willing to work with all parties to collaboratively study all development concepts in order to further understand them. Now, Woodside is not underestimating the difficulty of working through this process, but we do believe, with the involvement and support of both the Australian and Timor-Leste governments and a genuine intention by all parties to engage in dialogue, it is possible to arrive at an aligned outcome.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide, on to our international portfolio; we intended to drill our first-ever exploration well in the Republic of Korea in 2011, but this has been postponed to Q2 this year due to a delay in the availability of a suitable rig. A production optimization campaign of existing wells at Neptune enhanced production volumes by 26%. The near-term development plan for Neptune is to appraise the North Flank and recomplete one existing well at the field.</p>
          <p>Following the lifting of the drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico, we plan to drill the Innsbruck exploration well in the second half of 2012. We also continue to mature an inventory of several prospects in the region.</p>
          <p>Next slide. In Australia, we drilled nine wells in 2011, but we'll slow the pace of exploration drilling this year to allow time to refresh the portfolio. This slide shows that a significant proportion of our exploration spend in 2012 will be on international activities, reflecting a more balanced approach.</p>
          <p>Our first well in the Ragnar Hub has successfully intersected gas, and there are three more wells to drill in 2012 to support Pluto equity expansion. The rig will next move to Laverda and will then return to drill the nearby Vucko Prospect. Additional gas exploration wells will follow at a later date closer to the Pluto Hub. One or two wells will also be drilled in the Greater Enfield area in support of our existing oil business; one probably as a tie-back to the Stybarrow field and another to Enfield.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide; Woodside acquired seven new exploration permits in 2011, bringing our total permits in Australia to 33 at year-end, all but one of which is operated by Woodside. We are particularly excited by the three large frontier permits that were acquired in the Rowley Basin, which lies between the Browse and Carnarvon Basins. These blocks contain very large structures with multi-Tcf potential, but at this stage they're also very high risk.</p>
          <p>Over 11,000 square kilometers of new 3D seismic is planned in the three new Rowley Basin blocks, and the first wells in this area are expected for 2013. Two permits were also acquired on the Lennard Shelf, to the east of the North West Shelf assets, for their oil potential, with a commitment of over 1,500 square kilometers of 3D seismic. Two permits were also acquired at low cost as protection acreage to the Laverda oil play.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for listening. I'd now like to hand back to Peter.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Rob. Let me take you through some slides now on our strategic direction, starting with Slide 36. Of course, fundamental to the delivery of sustained shareholder value are the steps we take to strengthen our core, and we'll do this by maximizing the value of our producing assets through operational efficiency and project enhancements. This positions us to commercialize our premium LNG growth options, including Pluto expansion, Browse, and Sunrise. However, this alone will not be enough to sustain top-quartile performance, and we must broaden our upstream portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now on to the how on Slide 37; we will do this by building from our core, leveraging our world-class capabilities in areas such as LNG, FPSOs, and subsea operations. We will take a wider view in generating value by assessing opportunities across exploration, development, production, and marketing. We expect to materially increase our exploration budget over the next two to three years, and those opportunities for growth may include selected expansion outside of Australia and is likely to result in new partnerships for the company.</p>
          <p>So let me put some discipline to this approach, as outlined on Slide 38. Assessing any changes to our portfolio will be conducted through a very disciplined approach. We will focus on high-value opportunities and build from our core, taking our existing strengths and applying them to new growth opportunities and partnerships. We've given you a taste of where we are heading strategically, and we plan to give you more detail during an investor briefing day and site tour at the end of May this year.</p>
          <p>And now on to our final slide; to summarize, it's all about value. We have a clear strategy and a clear focus on delivering long-term shareholder value. We have a strong underlying business, with real cash flows and capacity for growth. Despite the recent fluctuations in global markets, we will continue to focus on the things we can control. We will maintain a disciplined approach to investment to maximize, deliver, and capture value from our existing business, our LNG growth options, and select opportunities. Thank you very much for your time today.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Adrian Wood from Macquarie. Please ask your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Peter; just a couple of questions. Obviously, Woodside is about to go through a step-change in cash flow production with the Pluto startup. That seems to be more than enough to service your medium-term debt repayment. I'm wondering if you could just tell us a little bit about how you think of using those cash flows. Obviously, you perhaps could take on a high level of gearing as well, with the sustainability of that cash flow, and you may also be receiving some cash in from the sell-down in Browse, which would further limit the amount of CapEx going out. So are you thinking about things like increasing the dividend? Would you fund acquisitions from Pluto cash flow or perhaps even approach Shell about perhaps removing some of that overhang?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Adrian, thanks for the question. Lawrie and I may tag-team on this one. The answer to your question is what I would tell you is we went through the presentation; we are looking to broaden our portfolio. Clearly, the cash flow coming in from Pluto, any potential sell-down gives us some headroom with respect to our funding capacity as we move forward. But we know, with that headroom, it then provides us opportunities to create additional value for our shareholders. And what we want to make sure is we're very clear on the things that will create value for us and how we'll pursue those things.</p>
          <p>Some of the items that you mentioned in your question are certainly items that &#x2013; are things that we are considering, but I'd tell you today that we don't have a firm plan that pushes us down one path or another. They're just very high on our agenda to ensure that we know exactly what we want to do. In that vein, you may recall, on previous calls, I've mentioned we were increasing the capabilities within Woodside around our corporate planning and strategy, and we now have stood up an organization of almost 20 people inside the company now who are focused on this particular activity.</p>
          <p>Now, that's something that we didn't have a core strength in previously. We stood something that we thought was very important as we deal with these particular issues moving forward. So they're real value opportunities for us, and it's something that the leadership of Woodside is spending a lot of time really thinking about.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Adrian, I'll &#x2013; sorry, this is Lawrie. I was just going to interrupt. From a capital management point of view, we've sought to be quite conservative through the Pluto construction phase. So as you know, we're nearing the end of that phase, and we've got quite a strong balance sheet, with gearing below 30%, so we're quite happy with that outcome. Now, as we look forward, what we want to ensure is that our balance sheet is positioned so that we can continue to grow, and so we need to be able to support Peter with capacity in the balance sheet for the growth and for the plans that he has. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just a second question on acquisitions, and you talk of a rigorous and disciplined approach. That sort of implies also perhaps a slow approach. I was just wondering, with Pluto starting up and as it stands today, nothing in the development pipeline, you're going to be effectively trying to fend off declines at a time when many of your peers are going through transformational growth. Does that put added pressure on you to go out and do a deal?</p>
          <p>Will that cash pile from Pluto burn a hole in your pocket and go out and force you to do a deal when the spot price is $120 a barrel, or is it something that you could be sitting on for several years? And then also, as a follow-up, when you're looking at acquisitions, what will be your primary way of screening those? Will it be return on invested capital, NAV accretion, earnings uplift; what are you looking for in these assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a good question. One thing I do want to assure everybody is we will be very, very disciplined, and cash won't burn a hole in our pocket. That's the key, and as Lawrie said, he'll make sure we have the funding capacity to pursue the things that we need to. But, equally, we've got to maintain the discipline on that. To maintain discipline, you need to understand what your options are, and you really need to understand where value is, and we'll do that from the very grassroots level. So there's no burning desire or need here to go and do a deal for the sake of doing a deal. The focus here is on creating long-term value. But I can equally tell you we are working very, very hard in this area to ensure that we do look at the right things. The focus will be on value, though. It's not going to be on anything else.</p>
          <p>The types of opportunities will be opportunities that we believe are complementary to our current portfolio and the strengths that we have. So you can look around and say, well, what sort of strengths do we have? We outlined them in the presentation. It's going to be around how do we step out and leverage our LNG strength, how do we step out and leverage our FPSO and deepwater and subsea strength, and of course you saw an example of our multilateral drilling. And we've already found a number of opportunities around the globe that we think fit into those strengths, and we'll continue to evaluate them over time.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Peter, Pluto Train 1, you've now gone live; you've got gas entering the plant. What are the risks that we need to look at now going forward, or is this project essentially de-risked in terms of the startup in late March/early April?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Gordon. The project, the risking, I would put it now, has moved more from a capital risk now into an operational phase. So the important thing that occurred this past weekend was &#x2013; is control of the plant has moved from a project phase now into an operations phase, and we have gas live in most of the plant, but not all of it, at this point in time, and we're working through that. We expect we'll have gas through the entire plant here in a couple of weeks time, and then we'll be in that very final commissioning phase. The risk, as I see, going forward is just the unknowns that may occur as we go through the startup process.</p>
          <p>We have, in every way possible, tested every piece of equipment. Every piece of equipment has been commissioned and is running, but of course the risk there is putting all of that together and through that startup phase. That also provides &#x2013; but we think we've covered that appropriately in our production guidance, and our production guidance really does account for what we think is a reasonable range of risks through the reliability and startup phase. Obviously, there's opportunity there for us, and the team understands that we need to chase that hard because there is some upside, but equally, the important thing for us is to maintain our focus on safety and integrity, and that's number-one for us.</p>

          <p>Okay. Just one other question; the Ragnar discovery is quite encouraging; 190 meters gross.

          <p>Gordon, we've got one more well that we'll drill in the Ragnar Hub this year. That's in the current plan. Obviously, if we are successful on that, we may drill some more. We think, really, in the order of 0.5 to 1 Tcf is the sort of resource size that we need in that area, so while it's some distance away from existing infrastructure, it's quite developable in the context of the things that we do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I've got a couple of questions about Browse. First of all, you recently acknowledged you're looking to farm down a minority stake. I think Bloomberg today has reported that PetroChina's made a bid for 15%, so I'm just wondering, what is your desired ultimate equity position in Browse, and also, when would you anticipate to complete the farm-down process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark, that's the $69 million question everybody would like to know on the equity position. We have a pretty firm view on it ourselves. We know what that number is. I don't think it's appropriate for me to share at this point in time because we're still evaluating our options at Browse, but there's clearly a minimum equity that we would feel comfortable with to put the resources at Woodside in to operate Browse. And I can assure you we do know what that number is. With respect to understanding the value of a minority interest sale in Browse, we are maturing in that discussion. The interest has been strong, I can say, and that we'll know over the next few months exactly what we're doing in that space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And just to follow up on Browse; you're quite advanced on the FEED study now, as you point out, so I'm just wondering how your capital cost estimates are shaping up and whether you still see the James Price Point option as meeting your required economic threshold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've got some costs coming in through the year. So, yes, while we do carry our own estimates, they are estimates. The invitation to tenders are out for both the upstream and the downstream. We expect the upstream tenders to come in late first quarter and the downstream tenders to come in late second quarter, and so at that point, we'll have a better understanding of where we think the costs are going. As you know, it's a competitive tender process, so I really don't want to give any indication one way or the other because we want the contractors to sharpen their pencil and give us their very, very best price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. And just one quick one to follow up, on Sunrise, have I interpreted correctly that you're looking to essentially redo the concept select phase, but in closer consultation with the Timor? Is that the approach?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first step of the approach to Sunrise is to establish a robust relationship with the Timor-Leste government and of course the Australian government, so there's multiple stakeholders here. What we have said, as a joint venture &#x2013; and it is as a joint venture; we're very aligned on this &#x2013; is that we recognize that the joint venture's preferred development concept differs from that of the Timor-Leste government's, and you may have heard Prime Mister Gusmao on public television yesterday talking about some of the desires from a social point of view that Timor-Leste have. And so what we've said to them is, look, we really are willing to sit down and work with all parties &#x2013; and that does need to include the Australian government as well &#x2013; in a collaborative way to look at all of the development options as well.</p>
          <p>And I think the key here is, as we talk about this, Mark, is that we all need to understand what works and what doesn't work. There's obviously some technical concerns that the joint venture has expressed previously with regarding pipeline and so forth. We will need to sit down in an open-book approach and work through that. We have not had that opportunity to date, and so the messaging there is we're willing to sit down in a very open and transparent way and go through that, without any preconceived concept of where this will head.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions, if I may; first of all, on Browse, you announced a 22% resource upgrades, just &#x2013; you also mentioned that there's another 3D survey that was completed late last year but results won't be available till late this year. Just wondering whether you anticipate that could lead to a further resource upgrade and whether you think further appraisal activity might be required on the three gas fields.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Nik, the survey that we &#x2013; we call it the Tridacna Survey. We name our surveys so we can keep track of them over time. We call it the Tridacna. It was a survey that was actually over the center part of the Torosa field. It was quite an extensive 3D survey. We'd not run 3D over this part of the field previously. And one of the objectives of the survey is to de-risk some of the compartmentalization that's currently built into our reservoir model for Torosa, and so the real focus there is on recovery factor and the number of wells that we would need to drill in the field. So we're very hopeful that that survey will help us de-risk some of the compartmentalization that we've currently built into the Torosa recoverable reserves, and as I said, we'll know something later this year on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think you'll ever try to drill any appraisal wells to validate whether there is, in fact, compartmentalization there?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have any plans at this point, Nik, to do that, so we believe the early quality of the survey data is quite good, and so we're very hopeful that that's going to tell us enough.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. The second question is, look, on slide 29, you'd mentioned that you're expecting a higher than average level of planned maintenance for Pluto LNG for the 2013 to 2015 period. Just wondering if you could give any guidance as to what level of output we should be expecting from the facility over that period.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, Peter and Lawrie. I have a question on what you outlined in terms of how you see your core strengths. And looking at potential future development options, you mentioned <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:12) obviously. Does that preclude Woodside from any direct involvement in onshore oil and gas development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ben, the comment is really around what are our core strengths today and what opportunities would be very complementary to those core strengths. That doesn't preclude us moving into other areas of the business. At the end of the day, we're in the business of exploring, developing, and producing &#x2013; and marketing hydrocarbons. So we'll look at all of those things, but we're also very mindful that onshore is not a core for us at this point in time, and so we would have to have a particular strategy if we chose to go into onshore.</p>
          <p>So it's kind of trying to learn from the past and some of the things that Woodside has done historically in trying to expand that portfolio. We've spent a lot of time looking back and learning from that, and also learning from others, to ensure that as we move forward and do expand our portfolio, that we nail it. We're really looking for being successful. So it doesn't say we would not get there; it's just, today, we don't have that core strength, and we would have to develop a particular strategy around that. But I would also tell you that's clearly an area of the business that we and just about everybody else in our business is looking at, and we'll continue to develop our knowledge and understanding on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. On a related question, your discussions with other resource owners to underpin Pluto expansion; does that include or likely to include onshore developments in WA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, we're clearly watching the onshore developments in the Carnarvon basin in WA. At this point, we don't have any discussions with anybody in that particular space. We are continuing our discussions with the offshore other resource owners, and as I've mentioned previously, we think those discussions will reach a point around the middle of this year, maybe early third quarter, along with our equity expansion plans on Pluto, for us to be able to make a call as which way we think that will go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just two very quick questions; are you able to possibly remind us of what the preemptives are within the Browse strategy? Is there any sell-down. And secondly, is it your preference that any sell-down of your equity be accompanied by a gas off-take arrangement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, firstly, unfortunately, I can't share with you what the preemptions are because that's commercially confidential. As you can imagine, there's an arrangement in place, but it's a fairly complex one. But we're confident that any actions that we would take on Browse, in and of itself, we understand those preemption arrangements. So any strategy we employ on Browse would take into account those preemption arrangements. With respect to off-take for us, we've continuously communicated that off-take arrangements had value to us, and so any potential equity sell-down that came with an off-take arrangement would be seen favorably.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Okay. Now, I'm not sure if this question's already been canvassed, but the opportunities that you're going to be looking at; will they include assets other than oil and LNG gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a good question. At this point, we're staying to our core of LNG and oil assets. Of course, as opportunities may arise, we'll look at opportunities that may be able to value-add to that core, but at this stage, we don't have any plans to expand outside of our core business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're &#x2013; are you considering perhaps CSG offshore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, as I mentioned previously, we continue to watch the developments both in CSG and in shale, not only in Australia, but elsewhere in the world. We're building our knowledge in that space. We don't have expertise at this point that we think we could go alone at all, so we would have to develop a specific strategy once we find an opportunity that we think would make sense to us. But at this point, we're not in any discussions with anybody regarding a CSG opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But that's quite a departure from your predecessor's position. Don was very much of the view that Woodside would never be interested in what he used to call girlie gas. So you're suggesting that perhaps Woodside is moving away from that perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Woodside's interested in hydrocarbons. That's what we do, and we do that very well. The expansion of shale gas and CSG around the world is &#x2013; it's a very large resource, and we can't ignore that resource. So we need to understand it, not just from an upstream opportunity point of view, but the potential impacts that that resource may have in markets, and particularly in our traditional markets. So we're watching that quite closely and building our understanding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can you expand a little bit on any potential or existing political or regulatory risks, environmental risks that are challenging some of Woodside's future projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Look, I'm not aware of any emerging issues.  Obviously, at Browse, we're going through the normal regulatory approval process, but there's nothing there that is unusual. We will obviously comply with all the laws and permit conditions that are in place. But there's nothing at this stage that we see in existing or proposed regulations that we think would have a material impact on us at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. A couple questions; firstly, Peter, I wanted to understand your strategic direction, where you're clearly saying that you're going to broaden your horizons outside of Australia. Have you chosen any particular areas of focus, or is that still in development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're building up a fundamental knowledge, both from a basin point of view as we look at expanding our exploration program. That's an area that, with our focus on Australia over the last two to three years, that we know we need to brush up on, and so we've actually had that underway for some period of time now, so that's the basis for exploration. On other opportunities, we obviously risk those opportunities around country entry and our understanding of that, together with who the potential partners might be.</p>
          <p>So we're very clear on the types &#x2013; not only the types of opportunities, but also any potential sovereign risk, and just as importantly, who's there already. If there's an opportunity there, are they a Tier 1 sort of company that are complementary to Woodside? Do they share our culture and values? And most importantly, where do we add value to the relationship? We don't simply want to be an investor. We don't think that's our role. We're an oil and gas company. We think we bring a whole lot more than that, and so any opportunity, we for sure will be looking at adding value through Woodside's unique capabilities.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Given your background, would you include PNG in that area of focus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I've worked in many different countries in the world, including, as you know, PNG. I would say we're casting a very broad net, so at this point I wouldn't point to any specific country. That's probably not appropriate for me. But, equally, I'd say we're casting a very broad net.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one question, I guess, best directed to Lawrie; I just wanted to reconcile some CapEx numbers because at the annual Investor Day, you had some CapEx forecasts for 2012 which seemed to be a bit lower than what you've declared today, and indeed also for 2011, where your CapEx is lower than what you initially guided to &#x2013; I think $4.2 billion initially guided and $3.8 billion actual spend. So I just wanted to try and reconcile those capital numbers, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can tell you the difference in 2011 is just &#x2013; is mainly our Pluto project spend just shifting across in timing, but it's not a major issue of any sort. In relation to 2012, there has been a very minor change. So I think it's &#x2013; from a charts point of view, you can probably see it reducing by $100 million, I think, and that's really just taking out some of the Pluto mitigation costs out of 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because you've carried them in 2011, is that what you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we pulled some into 2011, but we also recognize that some amount of the mitigation costs that will be incurred in 2012 probably might be treated as capital.</p>

          <p>We will take a couple more questions. Your next question comes from the line of Peter Klinger. Please ask your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Peter, just wondering if you can give us a bit of an update on your work with Bain &amp; Co. and what's happening to the organizational structure, whether you think you've now got the structure that you want in place with the appointment of Rob to the board, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Pete. Good question. The Bain work is maturing quite well. The first part of that, as we talked about, was stress-testing our strategy and doing a health check on that, and that work is almost complete. So, really, what it says is we understand what we need to do, and we understand how we need to do it, and we understand the types of opportunities we need to pursue. So we're coming to the finalization of that. The second part, then, was looking at, specifically, our organizational effectiveness and how we do our work and execute it, and the particular focus on that is making sure we're more efficient in our decision-making, and equally, that we're as cost-effective as we possibly can be.</p>
          <p>And we know we must reduce our cost structure as we go forward, but that's focused on the cost structure of our development. That's not necessarily organization. We think we've got the right organization at this stage. I don't expect any fundamental changes at all in the organization. What I do expect is a fundamental change in the way that we go about our work, the effectiveness of our decision-making, and that will result in the long-term in a reduction of our capital spend and be more efficient in our capital structure.</p>
          <p>So that's what we're really looking at. And we spend a lot of capital, as you know, for the size of company we are, so we believe there's quite a large prize there, and that's a prize we're going after, and one we particularly need to go after as we look at these smaller field developments around the North West Shelf and we keep the back end of those trains for &#x2013; into the future. Of course, as we announced this morning, Rob Cole will join the board effective tomorrow as our new Executive Director for Commercial, and that's really an indication to our focus in that area and a recognition of Rob's skills and capabilities. So, hopefully, that answers your question. It was interesting reading on Saturday.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the Browse, Peter, any guidance on when you would expect to get news from the federal government on whether your request for an extension is being granted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Peter, the request has been in with both the state and federal governments. They both need to approve the extension. It's been in now for about a month. We understand it's working through the process that they have. They've not given us an indication of when it will come out, but I don't expect that to be a long process, so I would hope in the not too distant future we'll get something back.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, I'd just like to carry on a little with the Browse retention license issue. You've made clear that you've requested an extension of the period to be FID ready. Can you tell us, have you requested any other changes? For example, the concept selection very early on in the retention license was forced upon the venture to James Price Point. Have you attempted to loosen that and maybe to broaden the possibilities on the retention license to develop through other means?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, no, we haven't done anything in that space. There are clearly some deliverables that we have under the retention lease conditions, so you'll find in the details that some of the deliverables, and that's around things like commerciality tests, field development plans, and so forth. We just changed that timing of those to match in with the retention lease, the extension request, so nothing untoward in that at all. It's just simply &#x2013; we're on the same path, same development concept; we've just matched up the delivery of those particular requirements to match in when we'll get the tenders in and so forth and then some of our environmental approvals.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Gentlemen, just a question again on the process of investing in part of Browse here. You indicated that there was a limited sale process underway, and I was curious as to why you wouldn't open it up more broadly to perhaps maximize the price given that there's probably going to be a lot of interest in it. I'm also kind of curious as to how a potential buyer would enter at this point and pay a full price; given uncertainties on costs, LNG markets, and indeed the likely future timing of such a project. Wouldn't it be better to wait for that information and/or &#x2013; and then take it to market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Stuart, we see there's a couple of times in the life of a project as to when it's best to consider what we do in the marketplace with respect to equity. Clearly, we had some news at the moment about the contingent resource increase at Browse, and of course we're starting to get certainty around costs in the development process as well. So there's a window here, and so we believe this is the right time to at least test the market. As we said and as we've talked about, with the cash flows we have, it's not a necessary point in time for us to sell, but we thought it was an important time for us to understand the value and to assess the optionality we have.</p>
          <p>So, clearly, we have strong interest. The reason we didn't go out to a broad marketing approach was, as we talked about looking at our strategic partnerships and options, we conducted a very thorough review of the types of companies that we thought would see premium value in Browse, and then with some other elements in there around long-term relationships and understanding we're not simply trading an asset here, we're looking for a partnership, we thought a selective process and one that was fully informed was the best way to go. I think that's going to deliver results for us. As I said, the interest has been strong, and I think the process for us is going to get the best value for Woodside.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, Peter. just a quick question on the reserves upgrade on Browse. I was just wondering if it states that it's a combination of both Torosa and Calliance, I was wondering if you could please give a split, general split, between which one is adding what amount of BOEs. And also just wanted to know, is that a Woodside view on volumes or is that a joint venture-accepted view on Browse volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Philipp, I don't have the exact split in front of me at this point, so unfortunately I can't answer that at this point. What I can tell you, though, is that that contingent resource has been reviewed both by the joint venture and also externally verified for us as well. So before we booked that contingent resource increase, we had Miller and Lents come in, and they had provided a review on that. So we've got a third-party review on that number.</p>

          <p>All right. Well, look, everybody, thank you very much for your questions and your interest today and in listening to Woodside's story. As we've talked previously, we really are focusing on delivering on our commitments and making sure we stay value-focused. Today, you see we're &#x2013; this is really a report on where we are in our journey, and we've made good progress on the things that we said we would focus on. Our commitment is to ensure that the market remains fully informed and to ensure that Woodside really does deliver on the things that we say we will do.</p>
          <p>And to that end, as I mentioned previously, we're planning for an investor briefing day and tour in late May of this year, so we can show you all of our facilities, but also you can meet our leadership team and understand more about where Woodside's heading. So, again, thank you for your questions and your attention, and we look forward to talking with you in the near future.</p>
