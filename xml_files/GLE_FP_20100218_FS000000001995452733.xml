          <p>Great. Good evening, everyone. Welcome to this presentation of our annual results. I will leave the floor in a minute to Didier who will comment the main highlights of our results. Let me just say a few words as an introduction.</p>
          <p>First of all, on slide three, clearly, 2009 is a year of transition for the group with &#x20AC;678 million net income, which clearly reflects the cost of the crisis on one hand and the cost of the legacy assets on the other which explain these results.</p>
          <p>I think, however, this figure should not conceal the very satisfactory commercial and operational performances of our businesses in France and abroad. And I think that's something which is very, very important for the future.</p>
          <p>Let me also say that we have adjusted the group and transformed &#x2013; started to transform the group to a new environment. We've reduced the risk profile. We will come back to that more in detail, if you wish, and have started to adjust the portfolio of businesses.</p>
          <p>We have also increased the financial strength of the group. As you can see, we have entering 2010 a Core Tier 1 of 8.4% and a Tier 1 of 10.7%.</p>
          <p>Let me go to page four. I will not comment the achievements of 2009. Let me just highlight &#x2013; and again, we can answer your questions. In particular, we will comment on the announcement this morning &#x2013; we made this morning regarding our Russian operations, the reorganization of these operations, which I think is the step forward in Russia and which will enable us to take advantage of our different operations and leverage on synergies.</p>
          <p>Let me go to directly page six regarding our strategy. And I would like to highlight that really this year, in my view, confirms the strength of our universal banking model. We have tried to highlight what we mean by that. I've met with a lot of clients in France, outside France, SMEs in particular, large corporates. My conviction is that we have enhanced our relationship with our clients and that going forward we can even do better on that, and you will see we have development there.</p>
          <p>We have different clients, as you can see on top, and we intend to focus the developments of the group in the three businesses, which are in red &#x2013; International Retail Banking, the French Networks, and Corporate and Investment Banking &#x2013; because at the end of the day, these are really the business in my view which have the relationship with the client &#x2013; the in-depth relationship with the client, which conquer the clients and maintain the long-term relationship with the client. They are really the pillars on which we want to build our businesses.</p>
          <p>The two other businesses, Specialized Financing and Insurance as well as Global Investment Management and Services are going to work more &#x2013; even more closely alongside the two businesses with synergies, and their development will be fully consistent with the client base we have in these three periods.</p>
          <p>We have started to also adjust the portfolio of businesses, as you know, with the creation of Amundi on the asset management business. Regarding the new developments, they will be focused on the French network &#x2013; sorry, the retail networks outside France, in Central and Eastern Europe and potentially also in the private banking business. And there might be going forward some further choices, adjustment. As you know already, we will find the best opportunity, but we could discover the business model. I remind, for example, the security business which could participate through a consolidation which will take place in our view in the next two to three years.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Didier.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. On slide seven, you have the full detailed P&amp;L for the group for 2009. Just to comment a couple of figure, first of all, net bank income is the more stable compared to last year at &#x20AC;20.7 billion. Costs were under control, and so as a result the group was able to deliver a &#x20AC;6 billion of gross operating income. The cost of risk, on which I will comment later, has more than doubled reflecting the impact of the economic crisis as well as the legacy assets. And so the bottom line, as you've seen, stand &#x20AC;678 million and 221 for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, just to refer on the operating efficiency plan that we already discussed since beginning of 2008, you can see that we are on track with our target to achieve &#x20AC;1 billion of improvements of the operating income pre-provisioning by <mark type="inaudible" /> through <mark type="inaudible" />. First, the pooling of IT infrastructure which are up and running since this July 2009; second, optimization of business processes; and third, further reduction in certain expenses.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, and I will focus more into depth on the cost of risk for the full year, with some flavor on the fourth quarter. In French Networks, you can see that the cost of risk reached 72 basis points due to the effect of the economical environment. The increase is essentially due to the middle market. And as I said this morning and obviously mentioned that in Jan, we had two files in the fourth quarter which have pushed up the cost of risk to 92 bps. Excluding these two files, which account for 40% of the allowance for the quarter, we would be roughly in line with what we have achieved in the first nine months. We do expect that excluding these two file, the trend should be roughly the same in 2010 with an improvement in the second half.</p>
          <p>In the International Retail Banking business, Russia has contributed significantly to the improvements &#x2013; to the increase in net allocation to provision. With that, you can see 490 basis points for the full year, but since mid-year we've seen an improvement with a cost of risk which has come down from 559 in Q2 to 523 and 441 in the fourth quarter. This is one of the leverage that will help us to bring Russia framework to a breakeven by end of 2010 as I will comment later on.</p>
          <p>In Specialised Financing and Insurance, you can see that the cost of risk has reached 250 bps, especially driven by the sharp increase that we've seen in consumer finance, which rose to 493 in the fourth quarter. There also, we are expecting some stabilization in H1 and decrease in H2 2010.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, on the CIB side, you can see that overall, excluding legacy assets, the cost of risks was almost stable at 90 bps. It was extremely low in the fourth quarter at below 40 bps for the fourth quarter. This, in our view, highlights the good shape and resilience of our large corporate portfolio. The legacy assets, you have the figure on the slide. We have registered &#x20AC;1.4 billion of provisions for the full year, of which 0.8 in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>If I move to solvency, just to mention that we have strengthened the Tier 1 capital and Core Tier 1 due to capital increase, but also due to a contraction on the risk-weighted assets, which went down by 6.2% compared to last year, to 2008. This was essentially concentrated on the CIB where the market risk went down by 43% versus last year. And as you know, we have continued to accompany our French customer base with an increase of 3.1% of the loan outstanding to the French economy for the group as a whole. The dividend that we proposed &#x2013; that we will propose to the AGM is &#x20AC;0.25 with a scrip dividend option.</p>
          <p>A word on liquidity. So you can see that long-term funding program has been completed in good condition. We have raised 37 billion of funding in 2009, three more, let's say, than what we need. So we are 3 billion ahead at the end of 2009 compared to our needs. And year-to-date, we have also already raised &#x20AC;4 billion, so we think that the 25 to 30 billion needs that we have for 2010 already cover with 7 billion, so more than 20%, almost a fourth, if we take the low end of the range.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, a few words on the trend that we've seen for '09 in term of revenues, and I will essentially comment on that for the 2009 and then focus more on the outlook for 2010, as you already heard the presentation this morning. Our French Networks are bang in line with our expectation, with a revenue that grew by 2% compared to last year. And you've seen that the commercial activity was robust in H2 in term of new net opening of current account as well as in term of deposit and loans.</p>
          <p>International Retail Banking business went up by 1.9% despite the sharp contraction that we've seen in certain economies where we operate. Russia GDP went down by 9%, 7% in Romania, more than 4% in Czech Republic, and despite that we were able, let's say, to deliver this growth on a like-for-like basis on the top line.</p>
          <p>Specialised Financing and Insurance also went up despite the fact that we have a slowdown in the outstanding due to a new lending business that went down in '09, as well as also losses on the residual value which tend to slow down compared to our previous quarter. Private Banking also and Investment Management and Services performed well. And on CIB, as you can see, excluding legacy assets, we've seen a doubling of the revenues compared to last year.</p>
          <p>So if I now focus more on the 2010 outlook and of course I will be &#x2013; we will able to answer your question on the '09 results. So going to slide 14, you can see that in French Networks, now that we have regrouped under the leadership of Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Sammarcelli, the three brands, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord and Boursorama, we have a setup which has 30 commercial franchisees in every market.</p>
          <p>The three brands that we have in France are complementary and so allowing us to cover, let's say, the needs of the customers from transaction banking to relationship banking, from national standpoint to regional standpoint. And also in direct banking, Boursorama is a clear leader on this market in France.</p>
          <p>Also thanks to this, let's say, coordination, we will be able to pool and to share best practices and to extract operating expenses synergies in the medium term.</p>
          <p>We have a target and outlook in term of net banking income increase of 3% in 2010, and we do expect to see an improvement of the cost/income ratio of 1 percentage point compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>International Retail Banking, before going to the outlook, I would like to make a focus on what we announced this morning in Russia. It's on slide 18. In Russia, so we are taking an initiative this morning to create a leading player in Russia by combining all the fallout entities that we have in Russia.</p>
          <p>This means that also our partner, Interros, will remain at the top end of the group, but with a slightly lower stake compared to where it stands today in Rosbank. In Rosbank, we have 65% at this point. And so you can see that in the new group, we will have 81.5% by bringing, let's say, fully-owned subsidiaries, BSGV, Rusfinance and Delta Credit.</p>
          <p>This is a new stage for the transformation of our Russian framework that will allow us to combine our two networks, Rosbank, BSGV, into a new company with two brands that will continue to be positioned on different markets, mass market for Rosbank and <mark type="inaudible" /> for BSGV. And also we'll be able to extract more benefit with the retail banking networks through our leadership position in consumer finance through Rusfinance and in mortgage loans through Delta Credit.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, for the 2010 outlook, you can see so in the four regions where we operate, we will have different fixed strategies to benefit from the recovery that we expect from the emerging markets. First, in Central and Eastern Europe, the strategy is then first and foremost at consolidating the position acquired and optimizing the franchise through more effective mining of the customer base. We will also conduct an active policy of cross-selling and that the development of synergies will also benefit from the broad geographic coverage that we have in the region.</p>
          <p>In Russia, so the idea is we need to create a leading player in Russia and we would like to get back to breakeven by end of 2010 the retail banking activities, which, as you've seen in the slide, was loss making by 200 million in 2009.</p>
          <p>In the Mediterranean Basin, we will continue to expand by acquiring new customers and opening new branches as we've done in 2009.</p>
          <p>And lastly, in Sub-Saharan Africa and French territories, we intend also to consolidate our historical positions.</p>
          <p>If I move now to slide 21, on the outlook for the Specialised Financing and Insurance, we do expect a rebound in profitability in 2010. We were breakeven in 2009. This will be achieved through, first of all, in financing activities, the upturn in origination and strong resilience of the margin. We are also expecting, as I said, the stabilization and then a reduction in the cost of risk. That is mainly expected to take place in H2.</p>
          <p>In the fleet management business, there will be a reduction of the losses on the residual value of the vehicle. We've lost &#x20AC;230 million in 2009, it was 80 million in 2008 and we should be below 100 million in 2010.</p>
          <p>And insurance, we should continue to see a dynamic growth of the business with synergies with our retail networks.</p>
          <p>So the combination of all these elements, and the fact also that, as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned, we have realigned certain activities by closing certain small operation in emerging markets, should allow us to achieve a return on equity close to 10% in 2010.</p>
          <p>So in Private Banking, and Global Investment Management and Services on page 24 for the outlook. In Private Banking, the idea is to consolidate our positions, with 75 billion of assets under management, to rebalance the source of revenues which was more driven by an interest income and then commission in 2009 and we have seen already a reversal of that trend. And we would also continue to conduct targeted development measures, with the reinforcement of our operation in Middle East. And we will pursue to expand our networking synergies with the French domestic Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale network.</p>
          <p>In asset management, Amundi is up and running since 1st of Jan 2010 and we do expect that this transaction will be accretive for Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale as from 2010. And we will also implement the merger between TCW and MetWest, which was announced last December.</p>
          <p>In custody business, we will focus on the acquisition of new customer, as well as organic growth of the outstanding and continue to lower the breakeven point as we already done in 2009.</p>
          <p>Lastly, for Newedge which has consolidated its position of leadership on the <mark type="inaudible" /> markets. We will benefit from the upturn in volumes and also certain realignment measures that we have implemented in H2 will have the full effect on the bottom line of Newedge in 2010.</p>
          <p>So the outlook for all these divisions, all these activities, all these businesses is to increase their contribution to the group net profit in 2010.</p>
          <p>Lastly, on slide 25, with the CIB, you know that since the beginning of 2009, there was some reorganization that was made in CIB with evolution. CIB was &#x2013; our strategic objective is to &#x2013; which was reinforce our client-driven approach, to increase our operational efficiency, and also to have a more dynamic management of our risk profile. This has been done through the strengthening of our Key Client strategic coverage through appointment of more senior banker and investment banker. We are also benefiting already from the unified management of our capital market activities <mark type="inaudible" />. And we have also standardized the completion of the centralization of the legacy assets as I will &#x2013; as I already commented last January.</p>
          <p>And we are launching now the second phase of this reorganization, which aims to improve further the operation model of SG CIB and we just started beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> has already achieved some nice achievements with gain in market share which we have recorded in most of our business line, a strict control of our cost and of our risk, and we have also reduced our exposure to legacy assets by realizing 8 billion of sales in 2009.</p>
          <p>So the objective of the business model of CIB is to achieve a cost income ratio of less than 60% and a return on equity between 17 to 20% after-tax, and this is based on a 7% capital allocation that will be the new standard for the group division as from 1st of January, 2010, and this also includes the impact of the treatment of the capital allocated to market activity.</p>
          <p>If I now go to slide 29 to comment on the results of CIB, first of all, I should mention that we have changed our disclosure &#x2013; you've seen that since this morning &#x2013; by first of all, transferring, let's say, the volatility coming from the continued noise leading to CDS, mark-to-market and our own spreads into the corporate center. And now the CIB, let's say, is presented no longer in recurring and non-recurring but in core activities and legacy assets for which we have the full detailed P&amp;L in appendixes. In our view, this is the way to make it easier, the read of our accounts, having in mind that most of this impact that polluted 2008 and 2009 results will be of much less magnitude in 2010.</p>
          <p>Within the businesses, as we also mentioned, that we have transferred certain activities from the fixed income to the financing and advisory business, which on average represents 100 million that reference quarter from fixed to financing and advisory.</p>
          <p>Having said that, if we look toward the performance from CIB in 2009, you can see that the entering business did perform strongly with the development of their revenues to &#x20AC;9.7 billion. Global markets was even stronger, 2.5 times increase compared to '08 with &#x20AC;7.2 billion of revenues. And equity and fixed income contributed to that performance.</p>
          <p>On slide 30, and this is really the last time we comment on the corporate center. As I said, you can see the of which which are the element that got transfer from the CIB to the corporate center in term of volatility. You can see that in Q4, the amount is much more limited and we do expect that to be the same going forward because on the CDS that are hedging our own portfolio, the current nominal value of the hedge are &#x20AC;11 billion of nominal, which is more than it should &#x2013; or less than it should as in what it was at the beginning of the year and the sensitivity has been reduced by almost the same magnitude.</p>
          <p>And looking at the current level of corporate credit spread, we didn't expect the same volatility than the one we see in late '08 in pluses and in beginning of '09 in minuses. For our own spreads, also you can see that the volatility has come to much lower levels as compared to what we've seen especially in Q2 and in Q3.</p>
          <p>We booked in the corporate center the capital gain on Amundi for &#x20AC;730 million, with almost no tax impact in fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>That it's for the businesses and I give the floor back to Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric for the conclusion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Didier. Just lets go to page 31 and again come back to the 2010 priorities and outlook. And Didier mentioned what we expect in each business.</p>
          <p>In the French Networks, the priority will be to share the good practices between the three networks and start the project of mutualization of our different systems and, of course, take advantage of the multi-channel commercial development of our three networks.</p>
          <p>In line with the activity at the end of 2009, the start of the year is good. And I'm convinced &#x2013; we're convinced of the performance of the business while decreasing the cost income ratios.</p>
          <p>Regarding International Retail, we'll come back to that, but we have a balanced model between the different regions. And clearly, the transformation of our Russian operations would be the major project. I think we will have a lot of benefits of that.</p>
          <p>Specialised Financing and Insurance, it is the, again, benefit of refocusing and development of corporation. You've seen that we expect a positive contribution from the group &#x2013; from the businesses to the group.</p>
          <p>Private Banking is going to further develop. We are developing our synergies with the French Networks and we will have eight regional branches developing the business in France and, of course, also leveraging outside France with SG CIB.</p>
          <p>In asset management, we have, I think, a good visibility of the contribution of the business with a reorganized business. And on the securities businesses, priority will be to commercial development.</p>
          <p>And on the CIB side, we will carry on developing the client-driven approach. Increasing the operational efficiency, we have projects going forward to further develop automation in our systems and, of course, continue reducing the risk profile.</p>
          <p>But when I look &#x2013; and Didier has explained the fact that we have tried to make the accounts even clearer to separate the bad bank and, I would say, the current operations. When I look at this year, I see on the good bank side, a return on equity of 57%, a cost income ratio of 39.6%, and so it means that even if you factor a lower level of revenues on certain businesses &#x2013; because the environment is going to normalize. Even if you factor that and, of course, more equity allocated to the business with the regulatory changes, my conviction is that there's a capacity of this business to develop and provide the group with a good profitability.</p>
          <p>Currently, as I said, also you've read this morning, in mid February we are absolutely in line with our objectives. The things are developing well. And I really believe that the model we've put in place is efficient, in particular with this global market division.</p>
          <p>If I turn to page 32, as we said, for 2010, we'll see the benefit of the different initiatives. We expect a significant &#x2013; a very significant increase of our net profit, and so a year clearly of rebound. Going forward, I think we need to look a bit beyond one year, having &#x2013; and as you know, uncertainties remain on the economic recovery and also, of course, with the changes in the banking regulations.</p>
          <p>I really believe we need to take a long-term view. And that's why we have started to launch the five-year project in the group to, again, further consolidate our universal banking strategy and enhance the product and service range in our different businesses, and I would say, in particular, in France where generally speaking, I think that the clients are expecting more from the bank and the capacity to &#x2013; just with simple things. And that &#x2013; for example, to speed up the credit process or to have advisors staying longer in front of the same clients or in the same position are things which are being requested by the clients and we are going to address these issues.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the employee commitment and talent development, that's very important, of course. And thirdly, as you know, the implementation of a new group operational model, priority in the mutualization of system, industrialization of process and beyond the end of our first operating efficiency plan, go much beyond and have savings by avoiding developing too many similar systems across the group. This project means something like 50 different projects actually which are being launched. And of course, we will give you more detail of that in 8 &#x2013; on the 8th of June this year &#x2013; during our Investor Day.</p>
          <p>That's what we wanted to say in a nutshell. And now of course, we are happy with the team &#x2013; management team, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Sammarcelli, S&#xE9;verin Cabannes, Bernardo Sanchez and Didier Valet to answer your questions both here in the room and on the line.</p>

I'm just thinking here, the averaging effect of all of that already seems to suggest that mechanically your guidance is conservative in a way, and I would just like you to talk about that in more detail, how you come up with that, please.</p>
          <p>The second question on CIB on the sort of worst part. We seem to see most structured credit indices that are starting to rebound having much healthier trends and we still see some write-downs. I was just trying to get a sense of how we can look at least the revenue write-downs going forward on the legacy assets and how much comfort we can get there for 2010.</p>
          <p>And the last question please, on Basel III, can you please comment on what your first reaction was to the paper that was published in December, and in particular with regard to minorities and your room for maneuver there? Thanks.</p>

          <p>To speak from here, it will be very easy guidance to conservative, but I just want to remember that in 2009, we had a guidance of 1% at the beginning of the year. And it was quite brave to have this guidance at the beginning of the year when we remind that in the first quarter we have a negative growth. And in fact, if you think on the profile of our revenues in 2009, you can understand that probably with the profile which was very negative in the first quarter &#x2013; around zero on the second one. On that more and more on to finish at an NBI growth of 3.8 in the last quarter. You can imagine that it will be quite easy to be above 3% of gross NBI in the first quarter, but it will be more difficult in the end of the year. So we say that in average, on the full year, where we had a guidance of 3%, I will be happy to do better, but that we'll be also happy to do exactly 3%.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. What we say today on the legacy asset is our main sensitivity is regarding the CDO of our MBS portfolio. And as you can see, we have a shadow P&amp;L at the end of this year which stood at &#x20AC;700 million. We cannot consider that this will converge through the P&amp;L over the next two years, in fact. But the impact will be higher at the starting part of these two years and then decline, as you saw over the last quarters, is our view. And the two other asset classes, mainly in CLOs and CMBS, we are much more controllable in term of marks we have today and we don't anticipate in 2010 any significant impact on the P&amp;L of those two parts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you mentioned, on certain assets like CLOs, CMBS, there is some liquidity that's coming back. So point for us is that when we make our analysis in term of credit, we believe that there is a huge probability looking at the asset that we converge to par. So as you say, there is a liquidity which is coming back for certain investment bank that would like buy these assets, which to a degree yield sometimes 10% because you have the par plus <mark type="inaudible" /> that they're carrying. In our view, for certain of these assets, it is better for us to carry and to get the par convergence at certain horizon and then to sell them at current price, which in our view are not reflecting the total value of the asset. So that's why, again, in this legacy asset there is two parts which are totally different in our view. The CDO <mark type="inaudible" /> where, as S&#xE9;verin said, we do continue to believe that there will be some impairments at cost of risk due to the shadow P&amp;L and the rest on which, let's say, there is to be some value opportunity for us to keep them in our book until they're not converged back to the par.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Top line perspective, in fact, you've seen that we have pushed a lot of our cum. losses and they are figured in the appendixes for '05, '06, '07. And more importantly, we have also increased, let's say, the extrapolation prime compared to subprime, because subprime I would not say that it's already something which is done and part of the past. But what we've seen in term of underlying is more the deterioration of the prime and midprime over the recent quarter. And that's where, incidentally, we said in January that we have pushed upwards our assumption in term <mark type="inaudible" /> extrapolated from the subprime levels. And there, let's say, we're looking at what we hear in the market and what we see from rating agencies. I think we are clearly well above the average with a top of finance 74% on average, midprime is separate from subprime with 74% prime cum. losses from subprime for the midprime and almost 35% for the prime extrapolated from the subprime.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and coming to your question on Basel III, I think we had the feeling in two ways that it was the exhaustive list of everything the regulators in their world might have dreamt and put together, if you wish. And now, if you look at more technically the different elements and to start with your question of minorities, we don't think that what is being proposed, which is take the full risk, if you wish, in the calculation of the Core Tier 1, without taking into account the minorities makes sense from an economy point of view, and I'm just looking at what affects <mark type="inaudible" />, the way it works in practice. And I think there will be a more balanced decision. What it will be will be to take the risk-weighted assets in proportion with the amount of equity. I don't know, but something like that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, for example, on the deferred tax assets, as you will have time before implementation, so it's not really a big worry. We will have profit to use the current tax deferred assets. Going forward, again, we can imagine something which might be more limited in time, for example, as a proportion of the Core Tier 1. I would say here it's more something of a technicality. And for example, reducing &#x2013; you can imagine a further reduction of a proportion of hybrid instruments in the Core Tier 1, things like that.</p>
          <p>I think from my perspective, the minorities would be, if it was implemented strictly, more structural to a certain extent in terms of looking at the operations. And it might lead perhaps to some strategic decisions effectively. I expect for many reasons something much more balanced.</p>
          <p>More fundamentally, at the end of the day, if we look at both capital and liquidity, the key question is, especially in Europe where banking sector is financing to further the economy versus the US where it's just the market sector, there are two questions. Are we going to have at the end of the process a level playing field between the US and Europe, the real commitments of the G20 effectively being complied with? Question mark.</p>
          <p>Secondly, if we look particularly at Europe, are we going &#x2013; is the banking sector going to be able to finance effectively the economy in 2011 and 2012? It will depend on the calibration of the package, both in terms of capital and liquidity, and of course the time array. We are going to work on these topics.</p>
          <p>But my own view is that there will be at the end of the day something balanced as an outcome because there will be different views, presentations, regulators, the industry. And at the end of the day, there will be something to ensure the system is more secure. And for example, on the 1st of January 2011, this is not part of the package, there will more capital on the trading assets, but down here, if I may say, the system would be probably also more secure in terms of the funding of the businesses to avoid too much transformation in the financing of the loans. But I think overall there should be an outcome which will enable banks to carry on doing their business.</p>
          <p>Next. Yeah, Jean Pierre.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jean Pierre Lambert from KBW. The first question I would have is just to follow-up on the question on Basel III, do you think you need to increase the duration of your wholesale funding? And if so, what would be the impact you guess on your cost of funding or perhaps on your profitability?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to the fixed income revenue in the fourth quarter. How much of that is related to trading? And in the past, you had very successful fixed income revenues. In the first, second, third quarter seemed to have been dominated by trading. Is it something you feel is repeatable or do you switch more to client revenues? Give us a feel how stable this revenue line is.</p>
          <p>And the third question is a simple one is. How do you view the consensus? Still comment as a few weeks ago, or different comment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will not answer the last comment. We've given I think relatively precise guidelines on how we look at every of our businesses. I'm sure that you could put figures in your modeling.</p>
          <p>Perhaps I will <mark type="inaudible" /> the fixed income. I think the way we managed the funding in 2008 and 2009, I am really happy about that. What I mean by that, we did not finance our loans with short-term money. We did not short term our funding. And that was very obvious to me that it was key going forward. And I always said that liquidity is even more important than capital. And as you know, in 2008 as well as 2009, we raised long-term funding even more than needed, for example, in 2009, with &#x20AC;37 million to refinance the maturing debt and, of course, the loans. And from that perspective, I think we are willing because of the traditional funding management, which is to say the loans are financed with long-term money deposits and long-term money. I feel pretty good on that.</p>
          <p>And then on the capital market side, with the reduction, you know that today we have reduced dramatically the funding part of the balance sheet. On the trading side, we are purely doing very short-term trading on the equity. The fundamental shift has been to avoid keeping long positions more on potentially illiquid assets. I feel pretty confident on that. And we will carry on. We have a very stable profile in terms of long-term debt. We are going to execute this funding program. And I feel, again, comfortable on that compared &#x2013; I would think on certain other markets or banking practices. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on the planning, and especially on the stable ratio, which is, let's say, discussed under Basel III, the point is that for all banks I think it will definitely require additional long-term funding. But in our view, the assumption which we are taking, especially on the renewal rate of the deposits, are extremely fair, especially looking at the way we've seen our businesses working, especially during the crisis. And so in our view, while there is still the discussion that will be coming from the QI's answer, that will show that these assumption are too strict.</p>
          <p>Regarding also the position of the French regulator, and you know that he is more looking at internal models rather than this, let's say, same ratio for everybody which is currently the approach from the budget committee. So we will discuss that. But again, the structure of the balance sheet of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale and French banks that they are showing that they are well, let's say, managed in term of asset/liability and that, let's say, our models in terms of short deposit mobilization has been in some during the crisis.</p>
          <p>And regarding your point on the consensus, I will not change what I said at the beginning of the <mark type="inaudible" /> regarding the consensus which, in my view, has not moved that much either. Let me say we are confident with 2010. We feel that we are in terms of future performance confident to achieve this consensus, but I don't comment on the consensus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have lengthened the funding and, I think, again, by anticipation of the future regulation, despite the fact that it is a portfolio which is not growing. And also I think we've been very conservative on that, and despite the cost stress on the fixed income side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In fixed income, our fourth quarter revenue has been impacted, you were right to say, first by this normalization of the market, and I will come back on that later on. Secondly, we had a low demand in term of full product from our customers and the market has been lower, specifically in Europe. And we are more exposed in euro than in US. That's one of the reasons why probably compared to the market and to the competition, you will see lower &#x2013; a bigger impact, if I may say so, on the fourth quarter because we are more exposed on euro.</p>
          <p>And in structured products, the demand has been a bit lower, but has been still significant in the fourth quarter. And compared to the third quarter, our revenue has been minus 10% on structured products. So the main effect is on trading for customers and for products in the Q4.</p>
          <p>This revenue does not change our guidance we made earlier and we still are confident to deliver around &#x20AC;650 million per quarter in fixed income, commodities and currency in the future, and it is not the fourth quarter will change that thing.</p>
          <p>But in the full year, we would have, roughly speaking, 1 billion a quarter in fixed income in 2009. We have had that. Our guidance today is 650, around 650, and we take in account that impact of the normalization of the market and the lower level of credit there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have really, I think, changed the model and we have started to develop fewer products, flow products for the last five years, in particular in the fixed income business, and there's still room for that. 2009 for me is a further step forward. By putting together the Global Market division under the leadership of Christophe Mianne with the ability to have put together very smoothly the fixed income team, the foreign exchange teams, credit, equity teams, we have a very integrated operation which is going to cross-sell the products to the clients. They have created, which is again new, a global coverage management unit team. The ambition is really to speed up the sale of flow product, for example, to asset managers and I think I'm really confident with the group of talents we have to achieve that.</p>
          <p>We are also still doing structured products with corporates, with financial institutions. There is also opportunity there and again leveraging on the different categories that I said. And of course, we carry on trying to leverage on certain transactions, typically when there is a financing for a corporate, leveraging on the hedging, on the interest rate or on the currency. We are now well aware that more and more, if you wish, the way &#x2013; and I think it's not going to change going forward if you think about scaled results like capital liquidity. Credit is going to be a precious resource for corporates. On the back of credit, we can leverage and ask and if we do that for side business, M&amp;A, equity, capital markets, bond business typically, and of course, hedging. And that's why we want to ensure to have good capacity on all these products to leverage on the credit.</p>
          <p>I am confident when I look at the progress we've made in the last few years, in particular in 2009, the good development of that model with less risk. You look at the <mark type="inaudible" /> stress test. We are very cautious. We can take risk, but we are cautious that this model is going to deliver a good performance. And I'm meeting with a lot of clients and I think they speak about Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale as the provider of solutions. In this world, I think it has a price.</p>
          <p>So the commitment is very clear, with new developments on the commodity side, on the foreign exchange side. In the US, we want &#x2013; we still have &#x2013; we have something like 35% of our business in US dollar. We want to leverage on that. And of course, also in Asia, we have the resources, we have the team, it's up to us to <mark type="inaudible" />. I'm really as comfortable about the strategy and the implementation of that.</p>
          <p>I think we have a question on the line. Perhaps &#x2013; sorry, sorry, sorry, please.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. I had unfortunately some questions on the legacy assets. Firstly, I'm just very surprised that <mark type="inaudible" /> that the unrealized losses on the reclassified assets that they are not really coming down. Can you maybe explain this a bit? Is it because of change of assumptions, different from what happened at PS?</p>
          <p>And then also, you mentioned the attraction of those assets maturing, can you maybe elaborate on the average maturity of the legacy assets?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, at the conference call of the preliminary results, you told us that the change on the loss given default on the assets increased from 50 to 60% and I was just wondering if does this lead to the 600 million charge or is it only half of it?</p>
          <p>And then just lastly, will there be a moment when weighting downgrades on the assets and also the change of assumptions will lead to a negative impact on your capital base, because it doesn't seem as if risk-weighted assets are impacted or the deduction to capital? Thank you very much. Sorry for this.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the fact that we do expect the impairments on the reclassified assets to decrease is coming from the fact that again this whole bucket of the assets reclassified on which we believe that there is a risk of impairment is the CDO for MBS. Regarded technically, your shadow P&amp;L has widened as a result in Q4 of the fact that we have <mark type="inaudible" /> on our assumptions in terms of cum. losses which devalued trading. But I would say we have <mark type="inaudible" /> in term of impairment, so that's why the shadow P&amp;L in this part of the legacy asset does not mean that much and so it's still the same at &#x20AC;700 million, as we said, and we do expect that to flow into the P&amp;L in course of the next two years. The rest of the shadow P&amp;L has not been that much compared to end of Q3, clearly, yes. Well, I think the rest have strongly reduced compared to its peak at the end of March.</p>
          <p>Let's say, the other bucket on which there is a shadow P&amp;L of roughly &#x20AC;800 million is on the CMBS. This CMBS portfolio is AAA, so the tranches which are at 30%, 100%. So let's say, if you look at the market consensus and even in a serious scenario in term of commercial real estate crisis, let's say, the consensus that these tranches which are 30% to 100, so high attachment point will not be hurt by the crisis. So that's why I was mentioning to Jean Francois that we do expect at some point these assets which are priced at &#x20AC;0.93 a dollar even to go further and to go back to par in the coming year. So that's for the legacy assets which were reclassified.</p>
          <p>Regarding the LGD, yes, I said so. We used to have a 50% uniform LGD across the board by <mark type="inaudible" /> and by typology of loans, whether they were prime, mid-prime or subprime. And the 50% plus because, in fact, it's a matrix, so we have different <mark type="inaudible" /> default which are ranging from 50% for the recent prime to 70% for the recent subprime. So we have, let's say &#x2013; and this is going down, let's say when we go to the oldest entities. These are explained as we did in 633 million of provisioning that we booked in Q4. Approximately half is coming is from this tightening of the assumption and half would have been, let's say, <mark type="inaudible" /> as you can see the impairment that would have flown into the P&amp;L in the fourth quarter.

          <p>Yes, the negative impact on the capital, sorry. The negative impact on the capital, let's say, the risk part which are risk weighted assets, but in fact it's not that huge for most of it because the <mark type="inaudible" /> are breaking, as you see in the appendixes, which are, let's say, singularly for a big part of the ABS. Nevertheless, for the worst asset class, where we gained the CDO for MBS which usually are below BB rating. So in that case, the full, let's say, size of the non-impaired remaining assets is deducted from the equity. And if you look at the calculation we have in the appendixes, we see that we have already deduction due to these tranche which are fully rated from the equity of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, let's say, on the &#x2013; I think on &#x2013; could have that visible on the slide 43, where you can see that we have &#x2013; it's not only that, but these deduction are big part of that. We have 2.3 billion of Basel II deduction from the Tier 1 which is coming through &#x2013; I think top of my mind, two-thirds or 75% from this fully weighted assets, so which are deducted from the Tier 1 directly.

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to go back to the shadow P&amp;L. If I look at slide 38 and I add up all of the <mark type="inaudible" /> banking income figures, I come to a difference between a fair value and a carrying value on your IAS 39 assets of about 3 billion. And I think you have told us that 700 million of that is CDOs which you expect to be realized, 800 million is CMBS which you think is money good because it's AAA. Could you just give us a breakout for what the other 1,500 or so is and why you are confident those assets are not going to lead to material losses? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jon, just to come back, so exactly you are right on the slide 38, if you make the sum, so we're minus 3.1 billion of shadow, but you can see also that we're past 1.1 billion of provisions. So that's why on a net basis, we are minus 2.0 billion of net shadow P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>For the CDO for MBS, in fact, in this 3.1, it is not minus 0.7, but it is minus 0.7 &#x2013; close to 1.1 because when I am looking at the shadow P&amp;L in the CDO for MBS, I'm already also deducting the provision I will need to take in my P&amp;L year-to-date. So in fact, in this 3.1, you have minus 1.8 due to CDO for MBS, you have minus 0.8 of CMBS and the rest, so 2.6, you have 0.5 which is a mixture, let's say, of CLOs 3.1 and 4.1 and you have some RMBS which are also explaining the gap. And so the 0.7 which are on the CDO for MBS, it's minus 1.8 which is the difference of the value when they were reclassified to where there would be the price today. But in due course we have also enabled the gap by setting aside 1.1 billion. It's another line. So that's why you should look at it on a net basis and you come back &#x2013; you come down to the 0.7 billion on the CDO for MBS and a total net shadow of 2.0 net of the provisioning. Is that clear?</p>

          <p>Yes, it is. So the 0.5 is mostly CLO and RMBS, and are you saying you expect that to be money good, similarly <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. In fact, our CLO, for example, we sold for &#x20AC;800 million in Q4 of CLOs which were paid pay at par and cumulative net sales of CLO market is not that bad at all. And compared to what Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois was mentioning at the beginning, definitely it's where we're seeing some spread narrowing and so this is <mark type="inaudible" /> shadow P&amp;L of the CLO that we are in our banking books.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And did I also catch this morning on your French conference call that you thought of the 700 million of CDOs, you might see 2 to 300 million in Q1 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As I was saying earlier, let's say, we have easier method at provisioning that we would have had in the fourth quarter would have been half, let's say, <mark type="inaudible" /> approximately, and so this is accelerating over the last three quarters. And so that said to us something between 200 to 300 million in Q1 is something which seems to be logical here.</p>

          <p>Okay. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the room and then on the line, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> from ICAP. One additional question on legacy assets. You were pretty clear about the CDO ABS, particularly about CLO, CMBS, and what is the situation for the exotic portfolio? I cannot understand that we have an additional 217 million loss in the fourth quarter and I had the sentiment that we are having some disappointment quarter-to-quarter on this one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on what is left in this portfolio, you have the detail on the appendixes. Let's say that the size, I would say, of the portfolio has been reduced in term of nominal. You have that on slide 52, sorry. So there, we have in term of nominal, 1.1 billion of RMBS and 1.10 billion CMBS. And as you said, the negative impact that we've seen in the fourth quarter is coming essentially from the loan production position that we have and we do carry it here. Why is that? Because in term of accounting this is, let's say, a loan protection, but if we assume that in term of sensitivity a certain part of this portfolio which is hedged by monoline, looking at monoline shape, is not that efficient. From an economic point of view, we are breakeven, so we have always, let's say, some minus on one-time and some pluses on the monoline.</p>
          <p>On the monoline, you can't see that immediately because there was a big impact from the CDO for MBS mark &#x2013; tracking mark that we have taken in fourth quarter. But let's say, the negative is a combination of the fact that on one side you don't take the benefit from the monoline hedge, which has increased, and on the other side, let's say, we are nevertheless a loan production which is negative from an accounting standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> I would prefer to be a bit long on the protection of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even the monolines &#x2013; the scenario on the monolines is not specifically in line with <mark type="inaudible" /> assumption, the average provision at least on that front will be effectively protected, so it's a definite position. I prefer to accept the noise on the protection rather than adjusting a very, very <mark type="inaudible" /> protection.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also because CMBS on that trading side, I might have said that AAA high-end tranche. It's more, let's say, <mark type="inaudible" /> , so it's more <mark type="inaudible" /> for our 20, 30. And in that case, <mark type="inaudible" /> more on the loan side, so the loan protection is a good hedge in our view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And what can we expect for the next quarter in this respect, what would you expect?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would expect something that could be between 0 and minus 50 something, looking at the evolution of the spread that we see on CMBS, such as tightened and stabilized <mark type="inaudible" />. It's something already more than it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And second question, if I may, talking about the transformation in Russia, I understand this is quite an important move, what can we expect in terms of restructuring charges, cost synergies? Can you elaborate on this? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Well, as you know, we have four banks today <mark type="inaudible" /> in Russia and we announced today the merger of the two biggest banks, which are Rosbank and BSGV on the domain of Rosbank. The retail activities in Russia were negative this year in 2009. We had a minus &#x20AC;200 million of net result and the idea we have &#x2013; the objective we have is to come back to profitability by the end of the year, not on the full year basis, but by the end of the year. And the &#x2013; so that we would have one bank with two different brands that should be run under Rosbank. And then the consumer credit activities and the mortgage activities, which are subsidiaries of the two banks &#x2013; of Rosbank. So all in all, including the cost of restructuring, we are looking for profitable operation by the end of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Guillaume Tiberghien from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I have got two questions. One relates to Amundi &amp; Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord. Would you be able to tell me how much the goodwill have impacted the equity Tier 1 capital? And the second question is more with regard to the Investor Day. You talk about 2015 ambitions, would you mind telling us whether you're going to give us also nearer term target like 2011, '12 or '13 as opposed to just 2015? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Guillaume. Of course, I think &#x2013; I will let Didier find the figure on the goodwill. As I said, short term transformation needs some time, but of course we will give shorter-term objective for 2012 and the project. <mark type="inaudible" /> I see, again, in this new world also to take this till 2012, economic recovery, progressive implementation of our different projects, from 2012, you can imagine to be more or less in mid-cycle. But then you can also imagine to have the full implementation of the new regulatory framework. And for example, if there is a peculiar pro-<mark type="inaudible" /> cyclical provisioning, for example, to take place from the 1st of January, 2013 or something like that. I don't know yet. But that's why we will have a milestone at 2012 and then try to say what we expect beyond that, at least, of course, the prudence around that. But there the additional benefit we could get from other projects and also try to highlight if in June we have some visibility on the regulatory framework, what it might mean going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guillaume, regarding the goodwill also on Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord, we said that the impact would be minus 20 bps during the rights issue, so it's minus 18 &#x2013; 19 bps, sorry, as we have left 11 bps for the minority interest and we have 8 bps deduction in income of goodwill. And for Amundi, the goodwill reduction that you have in the 55 on slide 10, so it now is 31. But have in mind that this is the creation &#x2013; the goodwill leveraging from the creation of Amundi. And on top of that, we have 732 million capital gains that we booked in Q4. So on a net basis, the impact of Amundi is something like 8 to 10 bps approximately in the Tier 1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I just can't see in the financial statements where the goodwill has increased because I would have expected something like maybe 900 million increase in goodwill, which I'd then see there's been a bit of goodwill impairment I think in Q3, but I didn't add up the goodwill number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the reason, just because on Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord also, we're coming to the technicality of the continue Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord as we own 80%. When you have the control of an entity, the goodwill that you have, let's say, when you increase your stake is directly written against the equity, but it means that the goodwill from Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord has been written off against the shareholder equity. And secondly for Amundi, the goodwill is in the equity accounted part of the balance sheet because, let's say, if we have only 25%, it is not fully accounted. So in the equity accounted part of subsidiary of the balance sheet, you have the value of Amundi including the goodwill.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Rob Down from HSBC. I really want to ask you about the dreaded subject of Basel III again. Before I do that, I just picked up from your presentation that you're going to increase the capital allocation to the operating division to 7%. And I was just wondering if that number we're going to see is actually a revenue sort of switch from group center out to the operating divisions, so it's more capital is allocated out to the operating side, so is that something we should look for in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in a very moderate way, if we allocate 7% obviously to that sector, the way we remunerate capital will increase, but marginally, the revenue <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Usually, the way we do &#x2013; the way we do deduct fidelity (1:05.50) equity for the businesses is that businesses standalone have their own equity, so they pay down the equity and the revenues along it to the corporate center. And then we do allocate, let's say, the standardized 6% which we did accept to more 7%. And have in mind that the revenue that we consider the factor in term of top line to the businesses, currently, the mixture of average of long-term rates and short-term rates from which we deduct the cost of the subordination <mark type="inaudible" /> with something like 3% pre-tax. So it's not a huge gain to have wanted at this point on top of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the subject of Basel III, I've really got some three questions really. I am coming back to the dreaded subject of net stable funding ratios. I think probably everyone in this room has tried to guesstimate net stable funding ratios and that frankly has been impossible. And it's terrible to obviously do it. My best guess for you guys is around 70%. But I was just wondering if you had &#x2013; for the benefit of your own internal models whether you had a number that you'd care to share with us <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
          <p>On the subject of capital situation with...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say, I think the view we have to a certain extent &#x2013; first of all, generally speaking on liquidity, I am not sure that one figure as well as capital to be frank <mark type="inaudible" />. We think generally speaking that liquidity is going to be managed like capital, which means that at some point, yes, you have mainly one figure. But what is important is what happened in the case of prices effectively and how you model that. Secondly, I would say crisis in terms of liquidity, one year I think it's personally a long horizon if you wish, and especially if you expect a distressed scenario like your deposits are leaving, you are not going to stick for one year like that, in my view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't disagree. It's just the Basel Committee seem to be taking a very Draconian approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was in Basel in beginning of January. There are going to be a year of discussion and impact study. It's just the beginning of the process.</p>
          <p>And let me &#x2013; maybe I think, again, on the liquidity side probably regulators might be a bit like used to this stock pick actually than capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the subject &#x2013; on the capital side of Basel III, obviously one of the perceptions that you potentially have here would be to control risk-weighted assets going forward and you've done that very successfully in 2009. I was just wondering if you have sort of a general feel for what you could do on risk-weighted assets over the next couple of years? Obviously you've got incremental risk charges coming in 2011 or whether you thought there's anything more that you could take out of the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have obviously the cost of the bad bank, the charge of the capital which is in the bad bank, which I may see in the legacy asset and which is going to go down progressively. So I would say it's a margin of maneuver.</p>
          <p>After that, fundamentally, we think we are businesses which should grow in France on the credit side more directly, but nevertheless it should grow. Outside France, in retail, outside France, 2010, again, will be a year of transition. The economies are recovering progressively in Central and Eastern Europe. But if I look at the next five years, you can expect growth there. We have to address the growth of course.</p>
          <p>In financial services, I would imagine here more of a recomposition. I think we have margin of maneuver there. As I said, the idea is to adjust and develop the business very consistently, fundamentally, in our view today, in countries where we have currently &#x2013; we have a retail banking operations or might have a relative in the near future, some retail banking operations.</p>
          <p>In Global Investment Management and Services, I think it's relatively limited. And after that is the CIB ambition, a significant factor is kind of growth we have in mind. I must say, I think we have a great opportunity. My view is that in a world where growth will be there, where how many providers do you have at the end of the day in the world. There is some clear opportunities today. But we will come back on that in June to present what we have in mind. I would say opportunity is, if for any reason the environment is such that we have to constrain the business, we might make some choices. But currently, I have in mind more development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And final question. I promise it's the final question. Obviously, one of the big deductions to come through on the Basel III potentially is for the insurance business. Published in your new business model, which seems to have sort of insurance down on a slightly lower pegging than perhaps things like the core co-operations of the French retail. I was just wondering, if we do get a full deduction from Tier 1 for insurance, whether that actually leaves it viable for a bank to continue owning an insurance operation in future, whether that actually makes economic sense to do that? What your thoughts are on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps one word by Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois on what we are doing on the insurance to make you understand the French model, which is probably <mark type="inaudible" /> a bit different from other models, and we'll come back to the capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just to say that, for example, in the casualty insurance, we decided and we closed the deal just yesterday to buy the minority part of <mark type="inaudible" /> in our casualty insurance company, SOGESSUR. And so we have 100% of our two insurance companies, SOGECAP for the life insurance and SOGESSUR for the casualty insurance.</p>
          <p>We see that in France, at least, it's the best way to develop the business as well in life and in casualty because we need to have a lot of cross-sell products, cost selling products between, for example, mortgage loan on the insurance for ourselves for the borrower. For example, we have also cross-sell products and cross-sell effect between a consumer on &#x2013; for example, to finance a car on the casualty insurance for the car. And so it's better to have, in fact, the same shareholder to have compensation between the two objectives. It can lead to double in less than three years the number of contracts that we have in casualty insurance. And we think that the only way to do that in three years is to have 100% of our casualty insurance company. In other countries, <mark type="inaudible" /> it could be different and it's separate. It is probably more efficient to have a partnership with a specialized company. So it can depend. In France, we think it's a good way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Knowing that in certain countries, it's even I think forbidden for a bank to own its own <mark type="inaudible" /> insurance subsidiary. So each situation is different. Well, I think fundamentally there is a lot of value in selling insurance products through banking distribution channel. We can also embed, if you wish, insurance product in a lot of our activities, fleet management, consumer credit all that. Priority is to do that as much as possible. Then we'll see in three years' time where we spend that capital. I think there is fundamentally flexibility. There are different models. We have with Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord a platform with Aviva, who is a long-term partner, <mark type="inaudible" /> priority to develop the business and we'll see that. It will depend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But then just to mention as well as what the impact on Basel III, which was the original question. Currently, there is a discussion, let's say, in France whether, let's say, you deduct either the full capital of the life insurance subsidiary, which is a decision Basel III. The second option is not what we are using, but what some of our competitors are using, another financial conglomerate, which is to detect only what we call the equity accounting differences. And depending on what you use, let's say, as a range between 700 million deduction from the Tier 1 to 2 billion, so I think let's wait for the regulation to stabilize. But nevertheless, let's say, <mark type="inaudible" /> to the low end of the range, it's something totaling <mark type="inaudible" /> for the group looking at what the life insurance business is bringing in the financial services where we're the producer and in the networks where we are the distributor.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I just have a question on the international retail banking division. I was just wondering whether you could give us some more detailed guidance on the different countries in terms of the cost of risk and where you think it could in 2010 and maybe also if we could have &#x2013; you gave that in the past the NPL levels in coverages by country? These are the main ones, if that's possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. If we start with Czech Republic, so Czech Republic, the cost of risk, if we look at the last three quarter was between, let's say, 130 to 140 and we are at 127 in Q4. Doubtful loans to gross loans was stable at Q4, Q3 at 6.1% and it was 5.7% in second quarter. And the coverage ratio is, let's say, relatively stable to slightly down at around 50% and this is excluding general provisions, so this just specific condition. We do believe that the trend that we should expect in terms of cost of risk in Czech Republic should be at the same level to maybe a slight increase, but let's say the portfolio did behave actually well in 2009.</p>
          <p>On BRD, so the NPL, so doubtful to gross loans, Q2 was 4.4, Q3 5.5, Q4 6.4 and the coverage ratios &#x2013; have in mind that we have, let's say, a tough definition of migration to doubtful loans after, let's say, almost two incidents of payments. And we are seeing some improvements of the &#x2013; let's say, back to performing loans on BRD over the last three months. The covered ratio is around 40% of BRD.</p>
          <p>And in Rosbank, and the cost of, let's say, the trend <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; I forget to start with that. The trend on the cost of risk was 97 Q2, 128 Q3, 122 Q4 and there we should still be, like for Czech Republic, in the same dynamic, so stable to maybe a slight increase.</p>
          <p>And lastly, in Russia, in fact already most commented, the decline from 559 in the peak of Q2 to 441 for older division <mark type="inaudible" />. I don't have the aggregate figure, but if I just look at Rosbank, I would see that, of course, a big part of the total NPL at Rosbank, Q2 8.6, Q3 11.7, Q4 13.4 and the coverage ratio has improved from 86 down to 82 and back to 88 in the three quarter. And then, let's say, as we said, if we want to achieve the back-to-profit by H2 in Russia, one of the leverage will actually be a decline in cost of risk that is likely to materialize in the mid-year 2010.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Brice Vandamme from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just short <mark type="inaudible" /> question, I would say. First regarding the amount of government bonds on your balance sheet, could you give us some indication on &#x2013; so what is the total book, what are the main exposure and do you have some exposure to the famous PIG? The second question actually, it's my last question because most of my questions have already been answered, is actually related to the cost of risk in CIB. We saw quite a nice evolution in Q4 compared to Q3 for the core activities. It tends to be quite volatile over time for CIB. Is this nevertheless a good, I would say, benchmark for the evolution of cost of risk in 2010 in this division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Under government norms, we are primarily dealers, so have some exposure, but it's limited on the government bonds generally speaking, and really I think manageable. The cost of CIB, clearly the &#x2013; as we've said, the portfolio in CIB and the <mark type="inaudible" /> corporates has been remarkably resilient. And we have no sign of fundamental deterioration. So it can vary &#x2013; when you talk about so low levels. I think it was 80 million in the fourth quarter. So it's very low, but I must say the very positive thing is that it is &#x2013; the portfolio seems to be very, very resilient.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So which means that 2010 could be more in line with what we saw in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, we want to hear that. There is some volatility we can expect. And the guidance, we would anticipate, is between 50 and 70 basis points for next year for CIB, counter-party risk cost.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good evening, everyone. All my questions on the CIB division has been already answered. Two quick questions. The first one is on the asset quality and the financial services division. The division has recorded a loss and that's due mainly to a high provisioning level. When do you expect this division to be back in profit?</p>
          <p>The second question is more general. You're giving a very upbeat message and that's my perception on the basis of the conference call of this morning and the conference call of now. The stock is down 7% today. So I'm just wondering what in your view the market is understanding or what is the strong message you want to give to the market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, again, briefly on the financial services, we've given a guidance of net profit &#x2013; total profitability of around 10%. So it means that this year, 2010, we expect effectively a positive contribution of the businesses. And will I leave Didier giving you more flavor on that.</p>
          <p>Again, I not know, you're probably in a better position for me to answer. As I said, my conviction is that 2010 will be a year with a funneling down of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. 2009 was a year of transition. When I see the way the bank &#x2013; currently, we're separate &#x2013; the way everybody is aligned on our objectives and whole perspective we just described, that's my conviction. And of course, we have to demonstrate that quarter-after-quarter. So surely there's still &#x2013; the question this afternoon &#x2013; this evening shows that there are question marks still on the legacy assets <mark type="inaudible" />. But to us demonstrates each year that we are delivering and I am very confident about that. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just to give you a flavor on the financial strategies, why we do plan <mark type="inaudible" /> equity of 10% because there is some exceptional item in 2009 that will disappear in 2010. Why that way? When you look at the bottom line of this division, there was impacted from the cleaning of certain, let's say, small operation which are now restructure. All, let's say, are in run-off. I would say just to make that short, this is roughly more than &#x20AC;100 million prospect that weren't actually cost of debt in 2009. So that is still not expected to be repeated in 2010 because we are cleaning that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, as I said, in term of evolution of the residual value in the fleet management, we booked &#x20AC;230 million negative revenues in 2009 and the market is stabilizing, and so definitely when you look at the way we accomplish, is to amortize over the lifetime of the fleet the GAAP income evaluation, <mark type="inaudible" />, let's say, we should have less than &#x20AC;100 million in 2010 and so we will offset positive revenue contribution of something like 130 to 150. So combination of these two items that are, I would say, mechanical plus the fact that the business of course will continue to grow and to improve their cost base. And as I said already that we expect an improvement in the cost of risk in H2, explaining why, let's say, we expect to move from breakeven and, let's say, into aligned something like 10% return on equity in 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Sorry to come back on your legacy exposure. Just to wrap it up, simplistically, if the quarter ended today, you're saying you'd have something like 200 to 300 million of marks on the reclassified assets to the cost of risk and then something like less than 50 million on the exotic credit derivatives where you have long protection. Are there any elements we should be made aware now, be it on the macro hedging or do you see PCs? That's a first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, if you could just touch on the near-term outlook you are seeing in equity derivatives right now please. Your peers are stating an ongoing pickup in terms of structured products and I guess you should continue to benefit from dividend expectations on your inventories. So that would be interesting.</p>
          <p>And then finally, if you could just update us on your acquisition strategy, I listened into the call this morning, but I didn't really catch the answer. Is a significant deal in the near term in Poland or wealth management, is that really appropriate in the context of maybe not yet passing the hump on marks? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But your line was not that good. Can you just, sorry, repeat the last question? It was about acquisition that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first 25....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I well understood is regarding the &#x2013; what we could say on the quarter on the legacy assets. And let's say, what I said is that, yes, we should have some provisioning. Yeah, it was meant to be between 200 to 300. This is the natural, let's say, evolution or convergence between the shadow sort of banking and trading. And the 50 was another <mark type="inaudible" /> between 0 to minus 50 and this is, let's say, something that I have nothing else to mention on this portfolio. The second question I didn't capture at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the equity derivative, if I understood well, the <mark type="inaudible" /> development of structured product, the impact of the dividend here blah, blah, blah. Again, we are not going to enter in mid-February in the detail. Let me say there are some <mark type="inaudible" /> meant for structured transaction risk and there was no bad surprise from the dividend here and probably you can see that. So &#x2013; but again, I prefer to answer globally, at this stage, we are in mid-February. We are in line with our objectives for this year in CIB and there is no bad news in the quarter in mid-February. That's what I can <mark type="inaudible" /> on the dividend. That is true say that, let's say, the campaign was better than the market was pricing.</p>
          <p>And the third question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The third question was on acquisition. Sorry, I mean...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sorry. So just on the &#x2013; coming back to the first question, it was actually whether there were any elements we should be made aware of outside the reclassified asset marks and outside the exotic credit derivatives portfolio, so it be that the macro hedging or the CDPCs please. Thank you, nothing else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is nothing outside. Again, as we said, on this CDS...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> as of today, let's say, revenues is almost flat and I know that I would add the impairment to take as provisioning in Q1, as I said, on the CDO to MBS shadow P&amp;L, that's the point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So the last question was if you could give us an update on the acquisition strategy. I didn't catch it this morning, whether the deal is still appropriate in the context or not yet passing the hump on markdowns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I must say, as we've said on the markdowns, we have a clear view, a limited impact. So I don't think why, given the revenue generation we have and the profit we expect from CIB, it should change our strategy in terms of acquisition. And with an 8.441 ratio entering into 2010, with that such a level, I think we can make acquisitions. And now I have not changed my mind. We will be very selective. We are still in a period of time, if you wish, we are evaluating assets, it's complex. You don't even know necessarily exactly what kind of capital, what kind of liquidity you have to factor and so it means that we need to have enough visibility on that for the business you're looking for to make a bit. So we stick with the same priority. We play outside France very selectively, as I previously said in Central and Eastern Europe, Italy and Poland could be of interest, and then potentially in the private banking arena, but be very selective as the certain business model might not necessarily be able to develop going forward. So why I am taking this example is because on one side there is in the market liquidity, so I know it's not an issue and capital requirements on retail should not fundamentally change. And private banking, I would say, again from capital and liquidity perspective, I don't see also a major issue. So it's easier to assess the value on these businesses than on other businesses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's the first time &#x2013; maybe not ever, but at least in the last ten years that I hear you giving so specific short-term earnings guidance. Almost targets are &#x2013; I would call it even commitments. And my question is why are you doing that, do you feel under pressure or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think I feel under pressure. Now, it's <mark type="inaudible" /> right. Following these results, following the questions you are asking, we will tell it was important to say how we see 2010. It means that we have a level of concept on that, and that's what we wanted to express with this ticket.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when I use the word commitment, it's not a massive exaggeration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From my perspective it's a managerial commitment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just about the IS 9 which is being negotiated and found, does it have any material impact on the legacy assets, in your view, or the way you match legacy assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking at, it's quite tense. I think we will &#x2013; we could discuss that next quarter <mark type="inaudible" />, I don't know. I think the discussion are currently stopped. I would say the first phase has not been voted and endorsed by the EU. We <mark type="inaudible" /> it was required, let's say, to the Board and to have the three legs of IFRS 9 up and running, so not only the classification of assets, but also the hedges and the impairments. So let's say, we're working on it. We know also that just before the endorsement by EU, they said that classification could be changed or could be modified slightly depending on what the FAB will publish, let's say, and we are expecting that to take place in the coming months. So let's say, let's wait.</p>
          <p>I would say compared to the initial reduction, there was some improvement in what was proposed in November. And then the rest, let's say, we continue to convinced that IFRS 9 not making &#x2013; or not taking <mark type="inaudible" /> on the business <mark type="inaudible" /> in the classification of the instrument, is not that fit &#x2013; properly fitted to banking business as it is. And so we will continue potentially to &#x2013; and to push for further improvement in value.</p>
