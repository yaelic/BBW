          <p>Good day everyone, and welcome to the Merrill Lynch Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mauricio Fernandes. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon. I am Mauricio Fernandes, Merrill Lynch's Latin America Telecom Analyst. We're honored to, once again, host the Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil conference call to discuss its Fourth Quarter 2008 Results, which came out last night. With me today, dialing from Mexico City, we have Daniel Hajj, CEO, Carlos Garc&#xED;a-Moreno, CFO, and Daniela Lecuona, Investor Relations Officer.</p>
          <p>I'd like now, to turn the call over to Daniel Hajj for his initial remarks. Daniel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Mauricio. Good morning everybody. Thank you for being in the call. As always, Carlos Garc&#xED;a-Moreno is going to make a summary of the fourth quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel. Good morning everyone. Thank you, Mauricio for hosting the call. The fourth quarter was our best ever, in terms of net subscriber addition. We added 10.1 million subscribers, 3 million of them in Brazil, 2 million in both Mexico and Colombia, and approximately half a million each in Argentina, Peru, Ecuador and the Caribbean. Although we had a very good momentum, in terms of subscriber growth, late in the year, the effect of the economic downturn became more visible in various countries.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2008, we had 182.7 million wireless subscribers, 19.1% more than a year before. During the year, we obtained 29.3 million new subscribers which were net gains, net additions for the year, which works out 2.3% more than in 2007. Of those net additions, 6.4 million came from Mexico, 8.45 million came from Brazil, 5.1 million from Colombia, and 1.9 million from Argentina. Our operations in Peru and the Caribbean, were the ones that exhibited the fastest subscriber growth in 2008, followed by Brazil and Argentina.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter revenues totaled 94.4 billion pesos or an 11.6% annual increase, driven by service revenues which expanded 14.7% on the back of strong subscriber and data revenue growth. Data revenues increased more than 2.5 times as fast as service revenues, rising 37% in the period. Data revenues represent 15% of consolidated service revenues. The share of service revenues increased rapidly over the last year, as we rolled out 3G services in our various operations.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, the first countries where we rolled out 3G services in the fourth quarter of 2007, data revenues expanded by 70%, 41%, and 26% respectively. Fourth quarter revenues also reflected the impact of the appreciation of the various currencies, the Brazilian real being the only exception with respect to the Mexican peso.</p>
          <p>We generated 34.9 billion pesos in EBITDA in the quarter. The EBITDA margin, 37%, was slightly lower than the year earlier quarter, for us because of the fast pace of subscriber growth.</p>
          <p>Gross ads were 14% higher year-on-year. In 2008, our revenues totaled 346 billion pesos, and our EBITDA 138 billion pesos. They were up 13.6% and 11.8% respectively. The operating profit came in at 97 billion pesos, and it was 15.2% higher than the year before.</p>
          <p>Financing costs rose to 7.2 billion pesos on account of increasing our net debt position, which rose almost 40% year-on-year. The jump in short term <mark type="inaudible" /> in Mexico, and the foreign exchange losses mostly associated with the devaluation of the Mexican peso vis-&#xE0;-vis the U.S. dollar, on our un-hedged dollar debt.</p>
          <p>In September, our un-hedged dollar debt stood at $1.9 billion, an amount that is half that of our dollar-based revenues, that is the revenues that we obtained in the U.S., Puerto Rico, El Salvador and Ecuador, which totaled $3.7 billion last year. Our dollar based obligations can therefore be easily serviced out of the net payments received from our dollar-based operations. Their EBITDA amounts to $1.3 billion. That is to say, we have 1.5 times debt to EBITDA ratio, in terms of dollar flows and dollar obligation.</p>
          <p>Therefore, irrespective of the accounting treatment, there is no economic loss for the companies holding such liabilities &#x2013; there would have been if the debt was to be serviced out of revenues denominating in currency that was devalued.</p>
          <p>In the current and deferred tax line we have included 2.5 billion pesos of tax paid in Mexico resulting from distributions made to shareholders in the fourth quarter. These taxes may be credited against future income taxes in Mexico.  On the other hand, in accordance to accounting standards we've booked a deferred tax credit in the amount of 4.4 billion pesos in recognition of benefits associated with carry-forward tax losses in Brazil.  The latter one is a non-cash credit lower result.</p>
          <p>We obtained a net profit of 16.3 billion pesos in the quarter and 60.1 billion pesos in the year.  The quarter's profit was equivalent to 49 peso cents per share and it was up 19.8% year-on-year or $0.74 per ADR.  Capital expenditures totaled 68.2 billion pesos in 2008, including 13.9 billion pesos invested in the acquisition of spectrum, licenses and concessions.  The investment in infrastructure was higher than we had budgeted initially since we decided to bring forth to 2008 some of the capital expenditures initially considered for 2009.</p>
          <p>We have thus finished the year very well positioned in terms of voice and data capacity in all our markets, which we believe will give us a competitive edge.  The investments made in 2008 allowed us to develop an integrated 3G platform all over Latin America.  The benefits of this move are already evident in the growth of our data revenues and in our greater capacity to compete in voice.</p>
          <p>Our distributions to shareholders reached 51.9 billion pesos; taken together with our capital expenditures, they represented an aggregate outlay in the amount of 120 billion pesos, most of which was funded from our cash flow from operations, and our net borrowings totaled only 21 billion pesos.  Our net debt increased to 122 billion pesos in 2008 from 93 billion a year before and represented 0.88 times our 12-month EBITDA.  Much of the increase is explained by depreciation of the peso and only partially reflect the benefits of the foreign exchange hedges in place.  The increase in the net debt that was pivotal to our operations in the year was of 11.4 billion pesos only.</p>
          <p>Our liquidity position is strong.  Today, our short-term debt may be fully paid with the cash at hand.  But we also secured recently new credit lines in the amount of $1.8 billion.  It will help us cover the purchases of important network equipment, thereby freeing out cash flow from operations for other uses. Only 5% of our debt matures in 2010 and matches our expected cash flow that year, where fully one-third of our debt matures at year end 2015.  As can be seen, we do not need to access the financial markets or call on our cash flow to ensure the punctual payment of our debt obligation.</p>
          <p>We are entering this period of widespread economic downturn from a position of strength.  No financial concerns on the one hand and on the other a brand new technological platform already in place in our various operations that we believe should prove strategically advantageous. We likely will emerge stronger from this downturn than we were when we entered it.</p>
          <p>Over the next several months we shall secure growth that proves profitable and show strength in our efforts at improving our cost efficiency.  We shall look after our EBITDA.  And our efforts will be helped by the fact that for the majority of the population in Latin America, their wireless service has become a virtual necessity.  I believe we will find that wireless is indeed a very inexpensive sector to be in, in times of recession and most attractive one to be in, in times of economic growth.</p>
          <p>Thank you, Mauricio, and I will turn it back to you for the question and answer session.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  We will now turn it over to the operator for the line up of further questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  We will take our first question from Vera Rosi with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  My first question is about accounts receivables, have you seen any change in your accounts receivables, so customers are paying later or after the due date, after we see that there's a slowdown in the macroeconomic environment. And the second question is on the 3G network coverage, that you had anticipated the CapEx from '09 to the second half of '08. What is it &#x2013; how do you compare today in terms of covered parts your 3G network coverage with the 2G that you had previously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in that &#x2013; Good Morning, Vera. On the account receivables, remember that we have, a lot of our subscribers are in prepaid stock. So the post paid subscribers we haven't seen any change &#x2013; still we haven't seen any change, any delay on that. And on the prepaid subscribers we are &#x2013; it's a prepaid, so we receive the money at &#x2013; there's no credit there. So what we have been very careful is with our distributors and all of the people who are buying also the cards and everything, everybody &#x2013; all the distribution and still we are not seeing any change on that.</p>
          <p>On the 3G network as you said we have been, as Carlos said also &#x2013; we have been advancing in spite of our 2009 CapEx and what we do is we put, around 60% of all the cities in Latin America have already 3G, and I think that you have been &#x2013; you have seen that all the data revenues have been growing and mostly it's because all the coverage and all the new services that we have been giving in 3G.</p>
          <p>So that's mainly what we have. I think in 2009 what we're going to do is our CapEx is going to be mainly putting in capacity, depending a lot on what are going to be growth on the MOUs [Minutes of Use per subscriber] and the growth on the traffic, and also we are going to do a little bit more on quality, as all the cities grow in Latin America. So we need to have better coverage and better quality in all the growth and all the new cities, all the new &#x2013; all the growth of the cities that we have and that's mainly what we are going to do. Stay a lot on prepaids, but that's mainly what we are going to do.</p>
          <p>Our budget for 2009 on CapEx is around $3 billion, and we are going to review it every quarter, so if we need &#x2013; if we don't need that quantity then we are going to reduce, if we need and the traffic is growing then we are going to do that. So, that's mainly what we have for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much Daniel for the very detailed explanation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question comes from Andrew Campbell with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. My question is about handset cost and with the depreciation in the local currencies that you saw in the fourth quarter I was wondering if some of the margin declines that we saw sequentially were caused by this increase in handset prices? Or do you believe that most of the margin weakness was more related to just the very strong subscriber growth in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it depends a lot in each country. I think that &#x2013; you could see that not all the countries depreciate the same; in some of them we have 30, 35 percentage depreciations, in other ones 10, so it's very different in all the countries. And I think the reduce on the margin is mainly because of the strong subscriber growth that we have but in some countries we can have a little hit on that because at the end of the day we purchase the handsets in dollars and then we sell it in local currency and then we can have a little bit of delay on moving the prices and that's not only the delay, the problem is that one day the currency is at 13 and the other day it is at 13.50 and the other one is at 13.20.  So it's not that you have that depreciation and then stays there, so it's very volatile, that, and maybe we can have a little bit of hit from the margins on that but the reduce on the margin is mainly because of the strong subscriber growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I understand, Daniel.  In terms of the prices that you're getting from the equipment suppliers, have they been absorbing some of the currency depreciation for the most part or is it more or less a direct pass-through of the depreciation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that in the fourth quarter, the suppliers, we already launched some promotions and they help us with some of that promotions but they cannot take all the depreciation, sometimes it's 30% depreciation.  So, they are selling us in dollars, maybe they are giving better prices in dollars but they are not taking that exchange rate. So, we have to pass that to the end user.  But, as I told you, in each country, it's different.  In some countries, the depreciation is not so weak.  So in each country, it's going to affect different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Rafe Alberta with Amorta Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I have just one question.  Regarding your policy that you've had about paying excess cash on dividends, do you think this changes for this year with the credit markets being tighter or do you still intend to keep in a less conservative net debt to EBITDA ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that what we have said repeatedly is that we want to remain not too far away from the one-time net debt to EBITDA ratio.  We have already plenty of cash flow to give back to shareholders this year as I was mentioning.  Remember that the CapEx in dollar terms is probably going to be approximately half of what it was last year.  So that alone means an additional $3 billion of money that will be available to being distributed.</p>
          <p>Well, this is sort of like our best case.  We always are responsive to what we think are good opportunities in the marketplace.  So we do not have an absolute indication in terms of how much we can &#x2013; we cannot here expanses on more our levels overall.  But I think it is prudent at this time to remain conservative financially.  That's what we have done always and that has helped us a lot.  And I think that in this environment the financial strength that Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil has, is definitely pulling, giving us at least, we're at least better and I think that we are stronger than several of our competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Walter Piecyk with Pali capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Hey, Carlos, just wanted to follow-up on that, so if you are remaining conservative, I assume that means 0.8 is less than the kind of 1.0 you had been talking about before, so you wouldn't really take it over 1.0.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I never said that we would not take it over 1.0.  I think that we have said that this has been our policy generally.  But the policy can be revised depending on what kind of market conditions you are facing.  It's not like we have an absolute constraint that would impede us from taking advantage of certain opportunities if we think that that is sensible. So I think that we basically do have the dry powder, if you will. I think that we have access to market, we have access to funding. And we will put it to good use if and when we have an opportunity arising that warrants it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree, but it's just your answer is a little confusing, because you can definitely take leverage up to 2, but if you're being more conservative, that's not really being more conservative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know you can do, I'm more interested in what the plans are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what I'm saying is that it depends on what kind of circumstances we are facing.  We have been very conservative up until now.  And at some point, if the opportunity warrants it, we will always be able to revise our policy, that's what I have said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what is a situation that warrants it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, possibly very low stock prices, for instance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So at 28 on the ADR that &#x2013; that doesn't necessarily warrant it right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at 28 we have been consistent with the policy that we have been having so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but it looks like the share repurchase has declined from the third quarter.  So it looks like your repurchase activity has slowed since then and the stock price is a lot lower. Wouldn't it make more sense for the share repurchase to actually increase, not decrease as far as the dollar amount that's being spent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we spent something like 8 or $900 million in the last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which was down from $1.8 billion in Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you spent only about 200 million in January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Well, I don't know, I mean it's not that we have a set amount that we have to spend...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Per month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...month in or month out. It is something that we do depending on how we see the overall circumstances in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
          <p>s</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were developments in the last quarter that were different from the ones than we had in the third quarter, and that generally made most people become a bit more cautious until they had a bit more visibility.  That's what we've done and I think that we now have a better understanding of what's the tone of the financial markets.  I think that we are comfortable with our financial position.  And I think that we will be playing things as we see them going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, and just two operational questions.  Can you just give us an update on what the minutes of use trends are like in Mexico, I mean I saw obviously, the MOUs slowed down again in the fourth quarter &#x2013; what's the trend so far in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that it's early in the first quarter and we're talking about the last quarter of last year that this conference is supposed to be about. I think that you have to keep in mind that MOUs in Mexico at 172, are now the highest in the region.  They are higher than in Spain, they are higher than in Germany, they are higher than in Italy, and I think that they have grown a lot and with the exchange rate, the revenue per minute has been going down a lot.</p>
          <p>So the trend in Mexico is that we have been declining and declining and declining prices for the last four &#x2013; three years a lot.  And that's why the MOU is growing today with the exchange rates that we have to date. The prices have become really, really aggressive and that's why the MOU is only growing 4%.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have the numbers in Q1 still, but we have going to still be aggressive and all &#x2013; not in Q1, all the year we're going to be aggressive.  But it has to &#x2013; you have to review what are the prices in Mexico and what was the growth on the MOU, today 172, I don't think in Latin America no country has 172 minutes of use.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing that's been slowing down is your EBITDA growth, I'm curious if you think you can grow EBITDA by more than 10% this year, because I think you got pretty close to &#x2013; in terms of the Mexican peso you only have a  &#x2013; I think at the end of the year only 10 or 11%.  So can you maintain double-digit EBITDA growth in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You refer, the other question that you told me is in Dominican Republic we got 88 minutes of use and not 172, okay.  And the EBITDA is going to depend a lot on the growth that we're going to have on the subscribers, depending what's one of the other subscribers.  We're being very aggressive on the control of the cost and depending a lot on what's going to be the subscribers is what we are going to have on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you added the same number of customers or let's say your net additions were down 30% in 2009.  Do you think you can grow EBITDA over 10%?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I just got a couple of questions if that's possible.  The first is, how long can we expect this sort of strategy of growth over margins to continue?  How much growth do you think is left within these markets before you get down to the unprofitable customers?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on Mexican ARPU and I know we've discussed this a little bit already, but do we ever see a day where we're back at the above a 180 Mexican peso level, and if so when? Or are we just having to live now with the fact that you are going to see low ARPUs going forward?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the first question was what?  You know James the profitability of the marginal clients is very much driven by what is the acquisition cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have that as the customer &#x2013; depending on how much you spend per customer if it's going profitable or not profitable, the customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So even if you have lower ARPU clients, they can be as profitable as higher ARPU clients, if the investments you make in them by way of acquisition cost is less.  So I think that there is still good potential for us to keep on growing our subscriber base in a profitable way and that's something that we have a long track record of doing.  So we do intend, as I mentioned in my report, we do intend to keep on going after profitable growth.  Now on the second...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, first in Argentina we already have around a 110% penetration and we have been growing our EBITDA and I think in Mexico, in Brazil and in all the other countries we can reach that penetration being at a &#x2013; having profitable subscribers, no?  The other question was...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other question has to do with ARPU.  And in several presentations that I've been to, and at one of them you attended, I have mentioned that ARPUs are going to be sensitive to the change in economic growth, because the ARPUs basically are a reflection of the overall consumption pattern of the population. So we think that and I'm not going to be talking about specific countries, but in different countries, depending on what kind of economic slowdown they have that we haven't performed on ARPUs.  So that's as much as I can say. I think it's probably going to be more marked in ARPUs than in subscriber growth overall, but the ARPUs I think are fairly income elastic. So if income is coming down, ARPUs will suffer, if income, any kind of growth resumes that will also be shown very quickly in ARPUs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect.  If I can persuade you to have one follow up if it's possible.  In terms of your anecdotal guidance for the 2009 but, when do you think about the long-term guidance that you set in May 2008 and especially around the EBITDA growth.  Do you still feel comfortable with those numbers, or do you think that now that maybe it's looking a little bit aggressive given the economic backdrop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we had in May were full year numbers.  And we have only seen that change of state in our rate market, I think that we have to look at our &#x2013; at the focus.  I do not know, maybe you know of some economic projections that are already quite confident about the full year outlook.  But if you know about them maybe, maybe help us, it will help us fine tune &#x2013; help what we need to review.  <mark type="inaudible" /> I think things have changed a lot since May to today so I think it's important to review it again.</p>

          <p>I'll take our next question from Rizwan Ali with Deustche Bank</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Rizwan Ali.  Good morning.  My question is regarding Brazil and especially the margins.  We are getting directions from the other your competitors especially Vivo and TIM Brasil that they expect to have margins in high 20s in Brazil in the fourth quarter.  And obviously you are bit more aggressive than your competitors in the market, but don't you think, I'm just trying to figure out why there is such a big discrepancy between your margins and some of your margins of your competitors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's that we have something we call core EBIDTA, Rizwan, and the core EBITDA is what would be your margins without taking all of your acquisition cost off your growth.  And when you saw that in Brazil we are in fact, we are higher than what we have and mainly the reduction of our EBITDAs in Brazil is due to the strong growth that we are having.  So we are comfortable on that.  We are still reviewing all our costs and control everything and that's one thing.  In the other hand remember that a postpaid subscriber cost you a little bit more than the prepaid subscriber and we have been growing a lot on the postpaid subscribers.</p>
          <p>Our postpaid subscriber basically has been increasing a lot.  And I think that's mainly why we have that reduction on the margins.  But depending as to what's going &#x2013; what we are going to have on in 2009 is going to &#x2013; is what we are going to have on the margins.  We are uncomfortable because my core EBITDA is growing just quarter-by-quarter in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, second question, if I may 19 million new subs this year is still a quite a bit of reduction from last year sub growth. That should really mean that you can improve your consolidated EBTIDA margin by at least 200/ 300 basis points and given the lower growth, is that fair to assume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know the things are really difficult to forecast today.  But 19 million customers &#x2013; it's gone, your question I can say, yes, but its going to depend a lot on what's going to be the reductions on the ARPUs also because the people is going to reduce their consumption.  So, that's what it's &#x2013; that's what it's all about.  Now the growth cost and revenues and well if we can maintain the ARPUs, so I think your questions will be yes, if the ARPUs are going to be a little bit down then well that's going to hit us on the revenues.  And that's mainly what we're going to see month-by-month and in country by country.  Other thing that it's very difficult to forecast is that each country is going to hit different the economic slowdown.  So, I cannot say that Brazil by an example is going to be exactly like Mexico or that Mexico is going to be like Dominican Republic.  So, it's very difficult to forecast everything, Mr. Rizwan.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>We'll take our next question from James Ratzer with New Street Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  If I could ask two questions, please.  The first question is regarding your competitive strategy in Mexico, it looks as if the rate of which you are cutting prices in Mexico is being reduced and that seems to have then also had a knock on impact on your minutes of use, presumably because of elasticity and partly to the economy.  I mean can you think to kind of re-trigger minutes growth, you are going to need to start cutting prices again in Mexico, maybe that can re-accelerate revenue growth?</p>
          <p>And then the second question I had, please was just regarding your overall rate of service revenue growth in Mexico, which was 6% in Q4 based on your comments about the economy impacting ARPU and would it be fair to say that Mexican revenue growth next year could be somewhere between 0 and 3%?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, what we say this in Mexico, we have been aggressive and we are going to maintain aggressive, its &#x2013; we have been reducing a lot of prices in Mexico, and with the exchange rate, the reduction in prices are 30 or 35% less than what we had last two or three months, okay.  The peso used to be at 11, today it is at 14, so when you do that ,the reduction on price that is 30%. We have to write a lot of our supply side in dollars, so well its reasonable to see what are the prices in dollars, not in pesos.</p>
          <p>And I think this year, the reduction in dollar terms of the revenue services are a lot.  Today, we are at 5.7 cents of dollar, the price in Mexico.  So, I think it's really aggressive the prices that we have here in Mexico.  So I can tell you that it's the other side, we are not increasing prices, we are still decreasing prices, but with these types of prices well Mexico has been really competitive in terms of price per minute, okay.</p>
          <p>And the second question &#x2013; and we are going to maintain our aggressiveness in Mexico, its &#x2013; we are going to &#x2013; we are growing, you can see that we are growing postpaid a lot more than what we grow third quarter and that's the trend, we are not making any big changes in Mexico and in other countries, and what was your second question, sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question was how the economic growth for <mark type="inaudible" />, let's say 2009 in Mexico might effect revenue growth.  You mentioned you thought ARPUs were fairly income elastic and that we're going to see revenue growth in Mexico slowdown towards say below 3% next year or do you think that's too negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You said what that up would be...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if the revenue growth base the next year in Mexico could drop down towards 3% or below, I mean, you've just done 6% service revenue growth in Q4 and presuming the economic outlook in 2009 is going to be worse than we've seen in the fourth quarter of 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; we do not provide guidance on revenue as well.  What we have said basically is we will continue to see subscriber growth, but on the other hand we see lower ARPUs and that's about as much as we can say, I think the ARPU for the year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thanks very much.  Just a couple of questions on COA in Brazil. You mentioned that it's down just slightly, despite the increased focused on post paid.  I wonder if you could comment about COA in other markets just directionally.  Is it moving higher because of 3G handset costs or increased subsidies or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at 3G markets, we actually have, the cost of acquisition, per gross ads, has remained roughly flat, what has changed particularly in Brazil was that we've have not many more gross ads because we ended up adding 3 million net, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So 3 million net means more than 3 million gross ads. So, basically it's &#x2013; on the one hand, we have been growing more in postpaid, which does entail a higher subsidy. On the other hand, we have reduced subsidies on the prepaid side. So, in the aggregate, in Brazil, the subscriber acquisition cost per gross add remains flat year-on-year and all of the increase in total acquisition costs were due to the fact that we had more gross add. We've had 3 million net adds. And the share of the growth in Brazil is more on postpaid than in prepaid against our other countries. It's also important to tell you the share of net adds in Brazil in postpaid is a very good share. So, that's also why Brazil is that with a big growth that we have lost the share that we have in postpaid.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on equipment revenue that has dropped off, tailed off quite a bit and wondering is that, I guess this is not because subsidies are higher. Is it because costs are lower or SIM-only sales or what's driving that?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not changing the allotted percentage about SIM and handset sales.  There has been more or less at the same percent that we used to have in all the countries. We are not more focusing in things as they &#x2013; and I think people is also buying cheaper things. One of the things that we saw last quarter with the crisis, with the losses, slowdown, is that people instead of buying $200 handset, they are buying now a $100 handset or $120 handset.</p>
          <p>So it's more or less what you are going to see that people is going to reduce the purchase price of the handset now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair enough. And finally, it's sort of a philosophical question. In Mexico, I wonder to what extent you are due towards sort of price reductions, aggressive pricing is influenced by COFECO and to what degree I mean you can either decide to take a less aggressive stance and allow a lower market share position, but higher ARPU and maybe higher profitability or you can be aggressive on prices, you have been and show that prices are as competitive as mostly the most competitive prices in Latin America for instance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. What I can tell you that there is a huge competition in Mexico, there is competition with Iusacell, Telef&#xF3;nica, Nextel and us, there's big competition. And I don't know exactly what does COFECO want, they are trying to look for the customer and that everybody will reduce price or they are trying to look for the other companies, okay. So I think COFECO and my understanding is COFECO wants to also look for the end customers that they have &#x2013; that we don't do like &#x2013; but practices let's say, the dominant practices and we are not doing anything on that and that the other one that's the prices and that all the things that are in wireless are &#x2013; prices are good, ARPUs are good MOUs are high. So I think that's also what COFECO is looking, okay.</p>
          <p>It's not only looking to help my competition, it's looking to help the consumers and reducing prices is what you do and it's what benefits the consumer.  So, what we're going to see is we're going to look to benefit our customers and our customers are going to be benefited. We'll reduce the prices and that's what we're doing now.</p>
          <p>And what I told you, prices today are really, really competitive.  Its $5.07 of dollar per minute is really competitive.  You can check what are the prices of the OCD countries or the European countries or other countries in Asia.  Well, you are going to see that prices in Mexico and all Latin America really competitive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, I have done the study. It's very competitive and I just wonder how long that aggressive stance? How long do you think that will last or how many years &#x2013; how many more years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we're not going to increase prices now, I don't think that we're looking to increase price. So these competitive prices are going to maintain for a long time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll take our next question from Stanley Martinez with Legal and General Investment .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good morning Daniel, Carlos and Daniela.  All my operating questions have been asked and answered so far.  So, let me just ask a couple of brief ones on cash taxes and the credit facility. The 4.4 billion pesos of Brazilian tax credit in the quarter, how is that going to impact cash taxes and the effective tax rate on the income statement going forward?  Should we expect those to converge in the balance of 2009? Maybe some thoughts on what you think your cash taxes will be in '09, would be helpful.  And second on the &#x2013; in...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't you do one-by-one so we don't forget the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, I think the recognition of this tax credit in Brazil costs overall with the fact that there will be some tax losses that we expect we'll be able &#x2013; that we will be able to cancel them against taxes in the future.  So, yes, there will be some cash savings on taxes to be paid. But only when we are looking to be paid in taxes and that's what is being recognized with the deferred tax rate.  And as regards the overall cash taxes paid, well, you really have two parts <mark type="inaudible" /> one is the rate of operations will be close to the average of the statutory rate, there will be some quarter less.</p>
          <p>So I would say that cash taxes will be probably in the neighborhood of something like 26% or so of taxable income in the company where at Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil.  That's more or less &#x2013; it's a little bit less than the quoted average of the statutory rate.  But then there's another component, which is the taxes that would be paid in Mexico to the extent that the distributions to shareholders go beyond the retained earnings that the company has, as was the case last year.  And if that happens then we have to pay the taxes on those distributions, but those taxes may be paid or may be credited against taxes to be paid the following year.  So net-net that would not be a cost to us, although it would appear in the books as an additional tax cost.  And I know that that I was basically listening, so, we think that this year the distribution to shareholders will still go beyond the retained earnings of the company and that's why I'm making this comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful.  And that kind of leads into my next question on the credit facility, you mentioned in the release the 1.8 billion U.S. facility from the EDC or some such like supranational credit agency.  Would you expect to use it in 2009 to fund the CapEx even though your CapEx is coming down year-over-year?  And importantly and to that point about the share buybacks being greater than retained earnings, does it free up some more resources either for that or maybe for a higher level of recurring dividend, especially in the absence of the one-time dividend in the fourth quarter this past year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you're absolutely right.  Not only is the CapEx coming down, but that these financing facilities that are put in place are basically going to be drawn this year, because they will be helping us pay for the import of network equipment from the countries who say great agencies gave us free lines.  So yeah, there will be an additional amount to be distributed in excess of the &#x2013; what we think as the regular free cash flow of the company.  Now, that &#x2013; what about the last question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if I just, two brief follow-ups: is the pricing of the EDC facility significantly cheaper than your normal marginal financing grade, either in Mexican peso or in the term market, and I presume it's an unsecured facility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's, I don't want to go into the details, but I can just say that it's much, much lower than what you could get market funding for these days in any currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's outstanding. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniela, we'll have time for probably a couple of more questions only.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will go ahead, and take our next question from <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Thanks very much for the call. Just on the Brazilian tax loss carry forwards, are there anymore of those to come through, or is this an NPV type number that you've booked just this one time. And secondly, on CapEx, how much of that is denominated in dollars, would you argue, you are saying it's mostly capacity, so I presume this is all just network equipment? And lastly, are there any licenses coming up this year that you will be looking to buy. And very lastly, how do you view the potential roll out of WCDMA by Nextel in Mexico as threatening your postpaid market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm going to start with a last one, because I forget the first one. So in the last ones, it's the license, I think there is going to be options in Mexico, and I don't think there is going to be any more options in the rest of Latin America. So that's more or less. In Mexico, the way to go at this is you have to pay per year. So I don't think it's going to be a big amount of money in front. And then there is going to be like a fee in the next year. So, I think the license in Mexico are including on the CapEx numbers that I told you. The next one what you say about WCDMA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nextel maybe getting one of these new licenses that come out from Mexico, which will enable them to rollout WCDMA and I'm just wondering how much of a threat do you see that to your postpaid business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is &#x2013; any competition is threat to &#x2013; always not what I'm feeling comfortable, I think my subscribers. One thing that I have to tell you, in Mexico, like an example, number portability of the things that we read was that we're going to lose customers, and in the first six months, from July to December, we have &#x2013; we gained customers in prepaid and in postpaid.</p>
          <p>So, that means that we have a very good network, very good quality, our customers are happy with us. Even that we have the biggest base of subscribers, we gained. So, I'm feeling comfortable the way &#x2013; the way my customers feels about Telcel. So, of course if Nextel do that, well there is going to be threaten for the market, but I hope that Telcel will compete against that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the tax credit in Brazil, no we are not going to be having another one this year. But it is conceivable that later in the future some more tax credits will could arise opportunistically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what was the question on CapEx?</p>

          <p>We will take our next question from Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, thank you guys.  I want to switch, you talked several times on cost controls; the cost of service line items spiked up a little bit in the fourth quarter from what had been 16 to 17 billion pesos up to about 20 billion pesos.  First, just what caused the spike, was it 3G network roll-out and as we look into '09 is that the kind of run rate we should expect from cost of service?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have an extra cost when you roll out the 3G network and then you don't use it as you &#x2013; the capacity is there and you don't use it.  And I think in 2009 capacity in 3G, we are going to start to use, you are seeing that we are having a lot more revenue from data and I think that that's going to help us a lot.  In 2009, we are going to use a lot more our 3G network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then you mentioned no other auctions in Latin America, except for Mexico I thought there was one coming up in Brazil as well, but it might be just expecting that you wouldn't be eligible for it possibly, is that your thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one more question, in the Central American markets you saw what looks like some pretty stiffening competition there, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the competition compared to the environment in the Central American market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in Central America we are &#x2013; we have big competition in Central America.  We are fixing a lot of things there.  I think you're going to see a much better company in Central America.  We need to invest a little bit more on distribution.  We need to maintain our cost.  So, there is things that we have been doing for the last five, four months, six months and I think there's going to &#x2013; we're going to have a good return on that in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And one more quick one, since you answered those all so quick.  In the Caribbean, the ARPU dropped pretty significantly down to $14.  Was that just a rounding issue or is the price competition accelerating in the Caribbean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have that, but if you call Daniela we can tell you, because I don't have that number here.  So, I am sorry I cannot answer you that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect.  I'll get back with Daniela.  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right before we wrap-up Daniel and Carlos, just wanted to ask you one question, the blended ARPU fell by only 3% in Mexico despite the weak economy.  Can you give us a sense about the Q-on-Q growth pattern for prepaid and postpaid, how it was versus blended?  And also I think you've referred to that during the call.  But just as a wrap-up message, what's your expectation for 2009 given what you have seen happen so far in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter we have, this is MOUs, let me see &#x2013; ARPUs.  Year-on-year we have a reduction in both, around 6% in both, in prepaid and in postpaid, that it's going to give us around 6%.  And in quarter &#x2013; third quarter against fourth quarter, it's a little bit more on prepaid, but it's not too much, it's more or less the same and it's working exactly the same.  So, it's the economic slowdown is what is happening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  So again on behalf of Merrill Lynch I would like to thank Daniel, Carlos, and Daniela for the call and thank everyone for joining us today.</p>
