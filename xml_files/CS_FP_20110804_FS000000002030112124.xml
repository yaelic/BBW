          <p>So, good morning to all of you. Thank you for coming to AXA's Presentation on Half Year 2011 Earnings. Presenting today will be Henri de Castries, Chairman and CEO, Denis Duverne, Deputy CEO, and Gerald Harlin, Group Chief Financial Officer. A Q&amp;A session will then follow the presentation.</p>
          <p>Henri, I leave you the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I am happy to present today a very solid set of numbers, reflecting the fact that the first half year has been good for AXA overall. As you have been seeing in the press release, underlying earnings are up 10%, which means that the underlying earnings growth is resuming, after a couple of years where it was not the case.</p>
          <p>Second point, adjusted earnings are up 7%. We have with that, a sustainable ability to generate capital gains. These earnings are up despite the adjustments which have been taken on the Greek bonds.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, net income has quadrupled, reflecting two things: the fact that last year we had exceptional negatives related to the partial disposal of some of our U.K. operations, and this year in the first half, some positives related in particular to our Asian minorities buyout.</p>
          <p>So, solid set of numbers throughout most of the business lines of the Group. If you look at the Life and Savings business, we had said that we wanted to be selective, grow our margins, grow especially in health and protection and unit-linked. We think that the first half is very much reflecting these choices.</p>
          <p>The NBV margin is up from 21% to 26%, getting closer to our long-term objectives. And this is due to a combination of factors. A significant growth of the APEs and high margins in Protection and Health, so that, the reflection of the selectivity.</p>
          <p>Unit-linked are stable with good margins, and General Account savings are down in terms of APEs. And it's the area of the Group where in the Life business, the margins are low, if not slightly negative. So change in the mix which has been obtained through the significant growth in Health and Protection is helping us grow our Life margins.</p>
          <p>The second point was the fact that we wanted to accelerate in the emerging markets. This is very much reflected by the NBV numbers. The NBV portion coming from emerging countries is growing by 16%, so more than the Group average.</p>
          <p>Growth is higher in emerging and margins are better. So on the Life side, the numbers are very much reflecting the selectivity, the change of mix and the other lines with what we are trying to achieve in the long-term.</p>
          <p>Property Casualty has been a good semester. The all-year combined ratio is improving. It's now at 97.2. I remind you that over long-term ambition is to reach 96, we are getting much closer to it. More importantly, if you look at what the current year combined ratio is, because the current year combined ratio was higher than the all year's combined ratio and by a significant amount.</p>
          <p>This current year combined ratio has been declining by nearly four points from 103.1 to 99.2. It's a good number. I remind you that our target for the year was to be at, around or below 100. We are comfortable seeing the numbers of the first half that this is really reachable. It's clear that we've had less natural catastrophes than usual, but we also had less bonus. So overall, we think that the P&amp;C numbers are good numbers.</p>
          <p>If you look also there at the development in terms of growth, one of the things which we want to highlight is the fact that on the direct side and on the high gross markets, the revenue growth is significant, close to double-digit or slightly above 10%. We think this is also very much reflecting the choices we've made in terms of priorities. So, a good semester in Life, a good semester in Property Casualty.</p>
          <p>Asset management is more a contrasted picture. We clearly with AllianceBernstein have an issue with the flows. We have significant, still significant negative outflows coming from the equities, where we have outflows on the institutional side and we'll come back to that later.</p>
          <p>On AXA Investments Managers, it's a good semester last year, was affected by the Rosenberg issue. We are progressively coming over that. We are pleased to see a very strong investment performance and pretty much across the board, and second, the start again from positive inflows.</p>
          <p>So a compacted picture and you will see that at AllianceBernstein, there are some specialties which are growing, but not enough to offset the outflows on institutional equities. So asset management, contrasted picture, but a good and solid picture for AXA Investment Managers.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet, very robust one. Solvency I and Solvency II ratios are improving further, and they are close to or at their highest historical levels. This is reflecting the financial strength of the Group.</p>
          <p>The debt gearing, which is also one of the indicators we were willing to see evolving, is starting to evolve. It has started to decline when compared to the first half last year. And I will remind you that with the disposal of the Canadian operations, which is not reflected in the balance sheet numbers for the first half, this gearing ratio would have been at 26%, which is pretty close to the long-term target of 25%.</p>
          <p>So, a solid set of numbers. Also, a very active capital allocation, reflecting there to the strategic choices we have been making. We have been acquiring in high-growth markets, where we have invested through the buyout of the Asian minorities, of the Australian minorities. We have invested &#x20AC;3.2 billion there and we have divested in selected major operations and in the dormant participation in Taikang in China. And this has been more than financing the acquisitions we've been making.</p>
          <p>All-in-all, if I sum it up, and before leaving the floor to Denis, if you compare where we are now with what our view of the future is, we are aligned with what we have told you. Underlying earnings are growing, as I said, at approximately 10%, 11%. The return on equity has been improving. It's not yet where we want it to be in the long run, but we are progressing. It's 13.5% for the semester, compared to 11.8% last year.</p>
          <p>The Group operating cash flows are aligned with our expectations, and as I said just before, the debt gearing is progressively, but solidly improving. So this is what I wanted to say as an introduction and now as usual, Denis and Gerald are going to comment into more details. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Henri. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to comment to you the various numbers that we have been able to produce this first half. First at the level of the group, as Henri mentioned we had underlying earnings growing by 10%. But I'd like to point you to the next slide, which is slide 15, to comment that in further detail.</p>
          <p>So, basically, our earnings have to take into account the fact that we put the Canadian operation in discontinued, in line with the IFRS principles. As you know, we have announced the sale of Canada on the 31 of May. We expect this transaction to complete in the third quarter. It's a substantial operation. So, we put it in discontinued operation, which means that for comparison purposes, the figures of last year are restated to &#x20AC;1,997 million.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; on the life and savings side, we have a positive change of &#x20AC;112 million, which is fully offset by change in scope, because as you know, we sold a large part of our Life operations in the U.K., as well as Australia and New Zealand, which is &#x2013; and partly offset by the integration of the Asia-Pacific, of the Asian operation &#x2013; Life Asian operations of AXA APH in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>On the P&amp;C side, we had a growth of 15% of our earnings, &#x20AC;120 million. Asset management grew by 6%. We have a growth in the holding segment, because we do not repeat the provision that we took in the first half of last year for the Rosenberg accident. We had put that in the first half in the holding segment and allocated it back in the second half through the asset management segment. So that's all-in-all, a growth of 10%.</p>
          <p>Canada had earnings, which are underlying earnings of &#x20AC;90 million in the first half. If we had put Canada in as a ongoing operation, we would have registered a growth of 11% from &#x20AC;2.082 billion to a little more than &#x20AC;2.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings were up 7% to &#x20AC;2.4 billion, thanks to higher underlying earnings as well as higher realized capital gains, partly offset by higher impairments, including the impairment on our Greek debt.</p>
          <p>Net income quadrupled to close to &#x20AC;4 billion, thanks to a little more than &#x20AC;1.4 billion of capital gains on the disposal of our 15% share in Taikang Life, our Chinese life insurer, as well as the disposal of our Australia and New Zealand operations.</p>
          <p>Moving now to more details on the Life and Savings side, on slide 18, I will not comment other than to say that we have fairly diversified presence. We remain the number one global insurer on the Life side. We have a balanced distribution between proprietary and proprietary networks. And, over time, the share of Protection &amp; Health and Unit-linked has increased at the expense of the General Account savings business, which is currently a difficult business as we will see shortly.</p>
          <p>On the new business side, our total new business went down 1%. It went down 3% in mature market as a reflection of our selectivity, which is one of the key themes of our new strategy and high growth market continue to have a nice progression at 11%.</p>
          <p>New business margin overall went up by five points to 26.1% and you see that the new business margin progression is effective both in mature markets at 22.9% and in high growth markets at close to 43%.</p>
          <p>When you look on the next slide at the breakdown of our Life business, Life new business between the different parts, General Accounts Protection &amp; Health remains the most profitable part of our business at 47% new business margin. We grew that part of the business by 14%. This is the emphasis that we put in the first half and we've grown across the board.</p>
          <p>But I'd like to point out Switzerland as a major growth area for that, because in Switzerland, we are gaining market share from the independent foundations, as &#x2013; with markets improving the plans at the foundations were fully funded and companies were capable of transferring their pension fund to an insurance company. We benefited a lot from that.</p>
          <p>In Germany, there was a favorable change in regulation which supported our Protection &amp; Health sales. And in the U.S., we launched a new Indexed Universal Life, which fared quite well, not to mention France where our Protection sales were also quite good, both on the group front and on the individual front.</p>
          <p>General Account savings was the category that we de-emphasized, with the new business sales down 26%. We continue to have a slightly negative new business margin. The business was particularly hit in Belgium, Italy and France for one common reason, which is that the banks are quite aggressive on deposit rates in light of the new Basel III regulations. But there are specific factors to each country. Italy, last year was the last year of the tax amnesty and France had a significant political debate about potential tax reform of life insurance, which froze the market during two months.</p>
          <p>On the unit-linked side, our sales were down 1%. There was a good performance in France, Italy and the U.S. and high growth markets, offset by the U.K., where we had significant one-off pension transfer last year, and Germany, where we repriced our variable annuity products this year.</p>
          <p>Mutual funds were up by 15%, with new business margin up three points. This reflects in particular the growth and the success of our Elevate wrap platform in the U.K. as well as our Architas Multi-Manager platform.</p>
          <p>If we break down the earnings on the Life side, as I told you, all-in-all we had negative 1% evolution which was a function of the change in scope that I mentioned earlier. Without that, we would have registered a growth of 9% and when we look at the different components, our investment margin was up, thanks to a higher asset base with 75 basis points margin on our General Account.</p>
          <p>Our fees and revenues were up also nicely, thanks to an increase in the asset base as well. On the technical margins side, we have an important growth, thanks to better GMxB margin in the U.S. and in spite of the impact of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, for &#x20AC;70 million on a pre-tax basis.</p>
          <p>You see an increase in the DAC amortization of &#x20AC;314 million in the U.S., which reflects the better profitability. All-in-all, our admin expenses were up &#x20AC;22 million, which is a function of our increasing efficiency. We have higher asset basis and our expenses don't go up that much.</p>
          <p>Focusing more on the U.S. variable annuities, the earnings for this first half are &#x20AC;98 million against &#x20AC;4 million in the first half of 2010. Thanks to the fact that our GMxB hedging margin was slightly positive against the significant loss last year, we had lower volatility. Our hedge program has been more efficient. In spite of that, you should assume that in the second half, we will review our last experience and you should expect an impact of the same order of magnitude as last year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the different segments of the Life business, our General Account Protection &amp; Health, which represents the vast majority of our earnings on the Life side, were up 1%. Again, it would have been up 8% without the impact of the Japanese Earthquake.</p>
          <p>General Account savings business had profitability up 11%, thanks to an increase in the asset base. And on the unit-linked, we had a growth of 52%, which is driven mostly by the improvement in profitability on the U.S. VAs.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Property and Casualty. In Property and Casualty we have again a very large portfolio. We have moved now to number three on a global basis. We have, again, a very balanced and diverse mix geographically ends by nature of business, as well as by distributions. Our P&amp;C revenues were up 2.7%. Again, the increase is better on the personal lines side at 3.7%, thanks to an average price increase of 4%, partly offset by lower guarantees.</p>
          <p>On the commercial line side, we are restoring growth. We had negative evolution in the last semesters. We are having growth now of 1.1%, average price increase of 2.1%, offset by more selectivity in the underwriting.</p>
          <p>This selectivity you can find again between mature high growth and direct. Our revenues went up only 1.2% in mature markets. They were up 11% in the high growth markets and 9% in direct and direct was slightly below our long-term guidance of 12%. This is because of the difficult market situation that we are still facing in Korea. It's currently improving, but the first half was difficult. We have increased prices more than the competition to restore our profitably. But in the other direct markets like Italy, Poland, Japan or France, we had a very solid growth, reaching in total 9.3%.</p>
          <p>Our current year combined ratio, as Henri mentioned, improved by 3.8 points to 99.2%. And you can see that this improvement is across the board, with an improvement of 4 points in mature markets and 3.8 points in direct and close to 2 points in high growth markets.</p>
          <p>The underlying earnings in P&amp;C improved by 15%. We benefited from a very low impact of natural catastrophes, at 0.1 against 1.7 points last year. We had also lower <mark type="ph" /> B on E (21:55) on prior years, 2 points against 4.5 points. And our investments yield was stable at 4.1%.</p>
          <p>Looking more at the geographies, you can see that barring Switzerland, where prices have slightly declined, but our combined ratio there is below 90%, we saw price increases in line with our expectations and revenue growth which was quite substantial in most territories.</p>
          <p>On the personal lines, we are continuing to grow our portfolio by around close to 800,000 contracts, of which 357,000 in mature and direct businesses. And on the commercial lines again, we had more selective underwriting.</p>
          <p>But part of our plan is also to improve our productivity, that's the third prong of our plan for 2015. And you can see the first effects of that on our P&amp;C expense ratio, which was down 0.8 points. It was down across all of our geographies, mature and direct. There was a growth in expenses in high growth market. This 0.8 is positively impacted by exceptional movements.</p>
          <p>The recurring expense ratio reduction is 0.6 points, with the administrative expense ratio down 0.2 and the acquisition expense ratio down 0.4, thanks to renegotiated commission rates with our distributors in the U.K. and Spain in particular, as well as a reduced exposure to highly commissioned business in the U.K. I am talking about warranty and travel in particular.</p>
          <p>Moving now to asset management, I will not comment slide 32, other than to say that we have two asset managers, AXA IM and AllianceBernstein, which are positioned quite differently and are quite complementary. AXA IM being more presence in Europe and AllianceBernstein more in the U.S. and in Asia. Looking at their performance during the first half, the average AUM were flat, revenues were up 3%.</p>
          <p>AllianceBernstein had negative flows of &#x20AC;24 billion, mainly institutional, whereas AXA IM had net inflows of &#x20AC;1 billion. With the AXA Rosenberg having &#x20AC;3 billion of outflows, we see a strong decline of the outflows at AXA Rosenberg. We settled the coding error case with SEC and made an offer to our unit holders in January of this year. We had few outflows on the back of that, but we believe that we now have a stable situation AXA Rosenberg.</p>
          <p>In the other expertise, we had &#x20AC;4 billion of net inflows on the back of a very solid investment performance. Focusing on AllianceBernstein, the challenge for AllianceBernstein is both to improve investment performance and to diversify its business mix. It is well on its way on these diversification efforts.</p>
          <p>As you can see in this middle part of the slide, you see continuous strong outflows in the equity, on the equity side. But you see that on fixed income, where the performance has been sterile since 2008. We have positive inflows as well as the new alternative offers, where we have quite strong positive inflows. The equity performance remains mixed and we have strong performance on the fixed income and the new expertise.</p>
          <p>From an earnings standpoint, the earnings of asset management were up 6%. They were up 25% at AXA IM, thanks to higher net revenues and a contained expense base. They were down 15% at AllianceBernstein, thanks &#x2013; mainly due to increasing distribution expenses as a result of the effort to grow in retail and to expand the product range.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. I will now hand over to Gerald Harlin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Okay, let's start with the shareholder's equity. The shareholders' equity decreased by &#x20AC;3.3 billion between the end of 2010 and the end of June 2011 from &#x20AC;49.7 billion to &#x20AC;46.4 billion. This is explained by different elements. The first one is the goodwill deduction relative to AXA APH. As you may know and in line with IFRS rules, we deduct goodwill related to the minority interest in AXA APH Asian operation. That's relative to the buyout. So it explains minus &#x20AC;2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>As well, we had the payment from dividend minus &#x20AC;1.6 billion. I just wanted also to focus on the ForEx movement. The ForEx movement is minus &#x20AC;1.5 million and correspond to the euro appreciation various different currencies. And since then that means at since the end of June, really covered &#x20AC;0.5 billion out of the &#x20AC;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>On the bottom left of this slide, you can see the balance sheet unrealized capital gains, so that means that the unrealized capital gains, which are booked in OCI, and what is in dark blue corresponds to equities. Equities went down from &#x20AC;3.1 billion to &#x20AC;2 billion. Most of the decrease is explained by the disposal of Taikang and our life stake in Taikang, and it's &#x2013; which is booked in net income. Part of the &#x20AC;4 billion is explained previously by Denis and Henri.</p>
          <p>As far as the fixed income in light blue, you can see that it decreased from &#x20AC;3.1 billion to &#x20AC;2.6 billion. As far as off balance sheet is concern, it's corresponding to loans and real estate. It remained stable at &#x20AC;2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Then let's have a look now at the economic solvency position. As you can see, the &#x2013; we remained very strong. So it remains very strong and even improved from 178% to 184%. It's &#x2013; this plus 6% improvement is explained by different factors, with different plus and minuses. I just would like to highlight the market effect with the drop of volatility, which explain plus 6%.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the right part of this chart, our sensitivity remained low. And this is mostly due, as explained during the previous presentations, due to the &#x2013; there is no mismatch between assets and liabilities, which makes that we are almost &#x2013; we have a very low sensitivity to interest rates.</p>
          <p>So let's have a look at the debt gearing. The net financial debts decreased by &#x20AC;0.8 billion, from &#x20AC;15.2 million to &#x20AC;14.4 million. Our debt gearing is at 28% at the end of June. And if we anticipate the disposal of the Canadian operations, and with the closing that should take place in the third quarter, we should be back to 26%, which is close to the 25% gearing target for 2015 as announced in Ambition AXA plan.</p>
          <p>Moving to the asset allocation, here, you have the total insurance and invested assets, which remained quite stable from &#x20AC;441 billion to &#x20AC;435 billion. As you can see, the asset allocation didn't move, with fixed income still remaining at 82%, broken down between Govies and related, 43% and corporate bonds at 33%.</p>
          <p>As far as the future asset allocation for the remaining of the year, no big change. Again, I just wanted to highlight the facts that investment in corporate bonds are quite attractive, even with present condition AA investment, present rate of 4.5%, which is quite attractive, which means that towards the end of the year, we'll privilege investment in corporate bonds.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the Greek government bonds. First, you have the gross book value of &#x20AC;1.5 billion, then the mark-to-market. At the end of June, it was &#x20AC;766 million, which means that the mark-to-market was at 50% of the book value. So gross unrealized losses amounted to &#x20AC;756 million and after the effect of PB and tax, it's minus &#x20AC;247 million. So that's the net unrealized losses.</p>
          <p>As explained by Denis previously, we booked in our P&amp;L account in adjusted earnings the whole difference for the maturity below 2020. That means that we booked an impairment of roughly 40% on all the maturities between 2020, corresponding to a net cost of &#x20AC;92 million. As you can see, the unrealized losses at the end of June after this impairment are &#x20AC;155 million. That means that at the end of June, we have a negative impact of the Greek bonds of &#x20AC;155 million, net in OCI. I wanted to confirm that we welcome the plan and that it's &#x2013; we will participate in the program of debt exchange, rollover or buyback.</p>
          <p>So let's have a look at the exposure in the other European peripheral countries, and here, you have Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. As a whole, just as a reminder, the gross market value, roughly speaking, at the second column amount to &#x20AC;30 billion, which is 7% of assets, that 7% of the global General Account assets of our Group. On the last column you can see that the total unrealized gains, which are booked in OCI, amount to &#x20AC;0.7 billion. That's net of tax and net of PB, of Policyholder Bonus, and I just wanted to say that these unrealized losses are reflected in our Solvency I and economic capital ratios that I presented before.</p>
          <p>And second, we &#x2013; I would say that we are comfortable with the PB and with the Policyholder Bonus absorption of unrealized losses, since there are a large amount of fixed income unrealized gains, as you can see on the next slide. Here on that slide, this slide has been correspond to the net unrealized gains on total fixed income assets calculated at two different dates at the end of June, which is in the &#x2013; correspond to the accounts. And you recognize the &#x20AC;2.6 billion of unrealized gains, which are in the OCI. And second, the estimated net unrealized gains at 1 of August, that means two days ago.</p>
          <p>So what are the main differences? First of all, on the first line at the end of June, you have plus &#x20AC;3.3 billion of unrealized gains on all the other fixed income investments and &#x20AC;0.7 billion unrealized loss on the peripheral countries, on the five peripheral countries and that is &#x20AC;2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>When calculated at the end of the 1 of August, we have an increase of the unrealized gains on the non-peripheral countries, mainly on Germany, France, Switzerland. U.S., U.K. This correspond to a decline in interest rates, which means conflates into an unrealized gain, so higher unrealized gains, and you can see that we move from &#x20AC;3.3 billion to &#x20AC;4.8 billion, plus &#x20AC;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>On the peripheral countries with the spread widening of Spain 80 basis points, Italy, 110 basis points, we have an increase of the unrealized losses from &#x20AC;0.7 billion to &#x20AC;1.3 billion in the end and that's the last column in dark blue.

          <p>Thanks, Gerald. I think the conclusion is clear and simple. The world is uncertain, but the priorities are clear. The macro environment will probably remained uncertain for the while, but AXA's priorities are very clear.</p>
          <p>On Life and Savings, we want to continue to drive our business towards the most profitable segments and towards the high growing geographies. We want to pursue the efforts in terms of efficiency and productivity gains. And we want to deliver the increasing cash flows we have in mind.</p>
          <p>On Property-Casualty, it's similar. We want to continue to grow the revenues in direct and in the high growth markets. And we want to continue to improve the combined ratio, both through a better underwriting and through lower expenses.</p>
          <p>In asset management, it's about improving further in the investment performance to reach better flows. So that's where we are, after a very good first semester in an uncertain world.</p>
          <p>But I think we're now going to move to the questions.</p>

          <p>Thomas Jacquet, Exane BNP Paribas. I have two questions, three questions, actually. First on the Greek impairment you decided to put the bonds to a market value. So my first question is, why did you do that, despite the fact that there was a guidance of 21%? And my second part of this question is, should we expect then a write back when you contribute the bonds to the plan?</p>
          <p>My second question is related to the sale of a very nice building that you announced a couple of weeks ago. There will be a realized gain in H2 numbers. Could you give us the number and maybe explain us why you decided to do that?</p>
          <p>And my last point is on the P&amp;C side, you gained 400,000 contracts in Motor in the Mediterranean region. Is there any country apart from Turkey or is it widespread in the region? Thank you</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as far as the Greek bonds is concerned, we considered that it was more cautious, I would say, to have &#x2013; we have obviously an event and this event translated into the first tranche of the bond which are maturing before 2020 and we considered that it was more cautious to have a full &#x2013; to impair it to the full market value.</p>
          <p>Your question about the write back, yes, that means that we will see. It will depend of the value of the bond at the time of the exchange, but as you know, we will see exactly whether we have different possibilities, either to exchange or to hold it over and we will see at that time. If it is an exchange, no doubt that there will be an adjustment up or down. But we can hope and we are confident that it will be up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jean d' Herbecourt from Cheuvreux. I have a couple of questions, if I may. I will start with the remark and, say, I am a bit confused because I saw that &#x2013; I noticed that you signed a letter for 25 insurers with regard to Solvency proposed recently. So you are speaking the same language? And today, there are six release of major insurers so it -- I am not certain that finally, you are talking together. So this is a remark.</p>
          <p>And behind that, I have some questions. I was questioning the margins in Health and Protection. Obviously you are classifying it as Life, but I was wondering if we could have some information with regard to trends on pricing and margin, especially in Continental Europe, for example, for French health market, but where is it going in terms of pricing? If there would be &#x2013; and there could be another way to look at it through combined ratio, because this is a risk business, where would it put us?</p>
          <p>And my second question is with regard to solvency ratios, obviously as you presented under Solvency I, it is good, I was questioning on &#x2013; I was wondering on the activity that you have, for example, in Spain or Italy, as you have &#x2013; as there is an increase of spread with regard to swap rate or with regard to bond, how looks the solvency level, the ratio of the subsidiaries? Is there a risk that you could face here?</p>
          <p>And my last question is &#x2013; would be more for the CRO. How would you be impacted by a dislocation of the Euro zone or is it something that you are looking at? What is the proportion of your portfolio which are totally matched? How do you look at this issue? Is it something you consider totally stupid or is it something that you take into account, and how would you be prepared for such an issue? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I must tell, I am sorry. I do not understand your statement, your comment. I do not see the relationship between the fact that the insurance industry is aligned in its view on Solvency II, and the fact that six companies are releasing today their earnings. I don't understand what's your point, but you'll probably explain it to us. If I have a comment to make on Solvency II, it's that the industry is well aligned.</p>
          <p>On the dislocation of the euro, I think you probably read Le Monde too much. It's &#x2013; you should read what Mr. <mark type="ph" /> Roland Poy (43:11) has written, which is -- it's a crisis of the debt, it's not a crisis of the euro.</p>
          <p>On the trends in pricing in Health, Gerald, do you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On Protection and Health, maybe you can go to the appendix on page 18. And Jean, you will notice that our Protection and Health combined ratio which is analyzed as usual, like the P&amp;C business, is at 94.8%. So it's plus 0.1%, which means that it's pretty stable. So as far as the claims ratio, it's <mark type="ph" /> 39 (44:00), and we don't have any decrease in the profitability.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the French market, we've got two types of markets, the group business and the individual market. The individual market has been competitive for some time. It's not the bulk of our business and we are below 95% in term of combined ratio. And the remaining part of the business where we are very large is a bundle business between Protection and Health, which sold to corporates as Mutual for the Health insurance and Protection for the remaining part. So we look at it on a bundle basis. And we get the combined ratios that we've got here on the bundle basis, even if the profitability of the Protection is compensating as a profitability of the Health, but that's a way the contracts are built. We look at it on a bundle basis. But as far as it's a market it's competitive, but the combined ratio is improving this year compared to last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your last question, Jean, was related to solvency of Italian and Spanish operations. It is something that we monitor closely and it might come under pressure. We &#x2013; as you've seen, our consolidated solvency margin has increased on the 30 of June to 186%. We are &#x2013; so we are in a very comfortable position, both from a solvency and from a cash standpoint. So, we are, I mean, we are monitoring the situation, but it is not worrying us at all.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Emmanuelle Cales, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Three questions if I may, purely on the Life side. Could you remind us the average technical guaranteed rates on the liability side for euro product? Could you also remind us the surplus &#x2013; the policyholder surplus reserve you have and the comp levels? And the third one is more in France, one of your competitors, not to name it, said that last week that, psychologically, it will be difficult to go below 3% for 2011 on <mark type="ph" /> euro (46:51) contract. Do you share this view or what's your view on this? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The guaranteed rate is &#x2013; the average guaranteed rate is at 2.2%. So, that means it's far below the present level. So &#x2013; and I remind you that as far as new business is concerned, in France, we don't sell anymore guaranteed rate on individual investment and saving. So &#x2013; and we stopped 10 years ago. So that explains that we have some margin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the policyholder surplus at the Group level is roughly &#x20AC;15 billion, of which &#x20AC;5 billion of shadow PB, I would say, corresponding to the OCI and &#x20AC;10 billion of deferred policyholder bonus.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Pierre Flabb&#xE9;e, Kepler Capital Market. Three questions, too. First regarding Germany, I noticed a price increase about 1% and revenue up 5%. Could you guide us about what could be the scope for maybe possible higher price increase, due to the evolution of the market and is the 5% volume sustainable?</p>
          <p>Second question, it's regarding probably a traditional question, when indices go down, at what level could indices trigger some significant change in impairment level at the group side? And my last question is regarding the current turmoil on the U.S. debt and especially municipal bonds, et cetera, et cetera, do you notice change in investors' behavior regarding appetite for variable annuities and could you maybe guide us on what's the state of the competition on VA in the U.S. currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the German situation -- and Fran&#xE7;ois will probably be saying a word also -- the good news is that prices have started to change in the German market. We had been increasing our prices earlier than others last year, where we had suffered a little bit. We suffer less this year, because relatively, we increased our pricing less. I do not think that the increase in the portfolio is necessarily sustainable and as I said, what we are looking for in mature markets is an increase in profitability. So we hope that the pricing cycle in Germany is going to stay what it is and that we will be able to increase prices further going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Henri answered the question and, but in Germany, we &#x2013; the next step for us in Germany is to increase prices, because we think that the market will recover with price increase. We gain significantly net inflow in the first quarter, because in Germany, it's stronger &#x2013; the growth is at the beginning of the year. And the renewal is at the beginning of the year, but for this &#x2013; the next year, we think that there is in Germany, room for increased prices, so we will increase prices more in Germany than in the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, about the impairment on equities, no, we don't have any big risk. I just wanted to make a very short calculation. I told you that our annualized gains on equities were &#x20AC;2 billion net. And this compares with the net exposure of &#x20AC;8 billion. What does it mean? That means that in the end we have roughly speaking, 25% of annualized gains. Since the end of June, let's say that we had, roughly speaking, a drop of the market of 10%. So you can see that we're quite safe and I don't expect large impairment on the equity side.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the U.S. the competitive situation on VA has slightly improved, because even though that it is much later than we did, our peers have, I would say, increased their prices or reduced their guarantees a bit last year and this year. There is still some aggressive competitions from some players and our market share has stabilized at around &#x2013; between 4.5% and 5%.</p>
          <p>It's too early to tell whether the recent, I mean, the month of July has been a bad or a good month, but I would say that the U.S. debt crisis is probably slightly behind us, now that the agreement has been reached and we should see normal market conditions. The point that is negative has been in July, higher volatility. And as you know, the results of our hedging are sensitive to the volatility. But we have &#x2013; we are well ahead of our budget there, and we are not particularly worried on the U.S. front.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I have just a quick question, a clarification on slide 38 on economic capital. I was wondering if you could please give us some color as to what has driven the fall in available capital of about &#x20AC;3.6 billion? If I am correct, the debt decline would explain about &#x20AC;500 million. Should I assume that about &#x20AC;3 billion comes from the fall in your embedded value? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We don't expect any fall in the embedded value. What I can tell you and you can have &#x2013; we can rediscuss it offline -- but we have different elements. First of all, keep in mind that we had some &#x2013; the disposal of the Australian business. I am speaking from the ratio, the disposal of the Australian business explains minus 8%, and we have, among the elements as well, we have the NBV and the NY. Now <mark type="ph" /> there if &#x2013; value of info (55:08) business, we explained plus 10%.</p>
          <p>So as a whole, you have positive elements, negative elements. You have also the dividend, which explain minus 6% and we have different tax elements and so on plus 4%. So the drop on the STEC, on the short-term economic capital, which is a requirement, is mostly explained by the fact that we are managing &#x2013; we are trying, as I explained to you, to limit any kind of mismatch to better diversify. And you know that the diversification is key as far as economic capital is concerned. But we can, we can give you more detail offline.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I have a couple of follow-up question. On the pricing in PC in Europe, what should we expect on H2? Should we expect a continuing increase of tariffs going forward, given the landscape of the competition that you face? This is my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question is that we see an improvement in the expense ratio, which is good, obviously. What is the contribution of the cost cutting plan that you have here and what is the frame of the execution of this cost savings that we have in front of us? Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the second half, we are confident in our capacity to continue to increase our prices. And we think that we will keep the price increase around plus 3% and we also at the beginning of the year, we &#x2013; as it was, written premium was 60% of the portfolio of the group and we increased prices on 60% of our premium. But we are still confident to our capacity to continue to have a price increase of around plus 3% for the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The second question concerned expense ratios, the decrease of expense ratio. We saw with &#x2013; the Danish presentation that we improve our expense ratio of 0.6% with 0.2% of one-off, decrease of expense ratio. And we are confident for the rest of the year to keep this decrease of combined ratio of &#x2013; because we have on our budget, 0.5% of decrease. And we are confident in our capacity to continue to reach our target and to decrease our expense ratio of 0.5% and maybe more, but not very more. 0.5% is our target.</p>
