        <plist>
          <p>And I'm joined by Ren&#xE9; Hooft Graafland, our CFO, and we will together present to you our '08 results and a bit of outlook on '09. Also welcome for those who are following us from the web cast. I'm instructed to say that you have all to switch off your, or put on mute, your cell phone. Thank you. Here we go.</p>
          <p>Results 2008 contrasted. On the one hand, good results on our existing business, strong organic growth 11%, well ahead of our guidance that we gave mid-year. The Fit 2 Fight program delivered on time. And we had a particularly strong performance of Africa this year, which helped quite a bit.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we acquired new businesses. Over the last 18 months, we have been entering 11 new markets. But the bad news is that the EBIT contribution coming out of all these new acquired businesses did not make-up for the additional financing cost that is the second element of our annual result. And finally, we have taken net exceptional charges of &#x20AC;757 million, partly relating to restructuring costs and partly relating to impairments.</p>
          <p>Now when we look at how that translates in number, the first part is the organic growth you see on the right side appearing with a green box, from consolidated beer volumes went up 3.5%, translated into strong revenue growth of 7.4%. Operating profits up 8.7 and translating into a net profit of 11. That is the organic part of the business that is today 75% of the volume of Heineken is in that organic part.</p>
          <p>And on the second part is, we go from 11% growth to minus 9.5% growth and that is due to the higher financing costs you see here in the red box, as opposed to the EBIT contribution coming out of these new businesses, which once more are an aggregated of 11 new businesses, which from Scottish &amp; Newcastle form the biggest part.</p>
          <p>And on the third block of our results and that leads to a further decrease of the reported IFRS result to 74% down towards last year, is the integration of exceptional charges. Part of it are restructuring costs for the newly acquired business, mainly S&amp;N, and also existing business that Ren&#xE9; will dive deeper into it. And part of this are impairments, which pre-tax amounted 526 million or after tax 508 millions.</p>
          <p>Three baskets, the first one is India. We have an 37.5% stake in United Breweries, which we have taken at market value. It's a mark-to-market principal in our books. The value of UBL went down quite dramatically in India and we had to act on it in our books.</p>
          <p>The second one is Russia, taking the view of a weakening economy, a falling ruble, and also higher weighted average cost of capital, we have taken the view of impairing 75% of the goodwill of our operation in Russia.</p>
          <p>And finally an impairment of 52 million, &#x2013; 51 million before tax of our portfolio here in the U.K., mainly our own portfolio where it is valued on a trading multiple and, as the whole trading in the U.K. has been severely affected this year, we have taken the view of taking an impairment.</p>
          <p>Now, this is to explain broadly the numbers and where they come from. I take you now to the operational results, what makes up for these results. We always start with the Heineken brand, major contributor to our results once more, the Heineken brand group 4.7% in the market, which is estimated to grow at about 1.7% in '08 that's according Plato.</p>
          <p>Premium segment is set to grow at 3%, once more according to Plato, and that lead us to again have been able to gain and increase our market share in the international premium segment.</p>
          <p>Across the geographies, we have posting sterling results in Africa, still in Asia Pacific very good growth rates, Central and Eastern Europe have healthy growth rates still, despite of course, for you all known fact of the recession certainly in the second half. In the Americas, we have been having disappointing performance of Heineken U.S.A, I will come to that later on. In all the other geographies except from Heineken U.S.A, we have seen growth across Latin America, South America, and the Caribbean for the Heineken brand.</p>
          <p>And finally in Western Europe, despite market sales for us of our total portfolio going down 1.6% in Western Europe, the Heineken brand performed again much better with 1.9% growth.</p>
          <p>The second element now of our results is the successful completion of the Fit 2 Fight program announced three years ago. We delivered it on time, more, and at the lower cost. The main contributors, as you can see, have been Western Europe for 56%, but also followed then by Central and Eastern Europe as all parts and all regions and parts of our business contributed to that effort.</p>
          <p>It has been still an effort of the supply chain for 61%, and also for big part from our wholesale operations, which deliver 22% of the savings. Now, thanks to all of this, we could decrease our fixed cost to ratio from starting from 35% to 29.5% this year. So I would guess a very good performance.</p>
          <p>Then the next element of our delivery is, over the last three years I've always been saying that our strategy is following two very simple rules, on one hand we put all the emphasis of management on organic growth, out of the 70,000 odd people who work in the group, 69,950 people focused on organic growth, making the business here responsible for growing. And from time-to-time, we enter new markets. And we look at markets where we can acquire a number one or a number two position and we look at markets where there is a significant potential for Heineken to be found for growth as a premium brand.</p>
          <p>Now in the last 18 months, we have been entering 11 new markets, all of them we entered, most we acquired even a little bit more, but 11 markets we entered with the number one or the number two position. And others been reinforcing our position. That is also the part at the moment where out business is suffering and is also the part of the business where we have to give a lot of attention and focus to get the value creation out of all these new acquired businesses. It gives us though a good geographical spread, we had it already, but none of the acquisitions we recently made, made us anymore much exposed to one particular geography and you might notice from this chart that, roughly speaking, not any operation of Heineken is making more than 10% of the profit contribution. So, we have a kind of an imbedded risk spread in our business.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the environment. Obviously, we are definitely operating and landed in a tougher world. Okay, what I'll and I will not teach you what &#x2013; how it happened and the problems we are now all of us in, but it also affects the beer market. The slowdown in the beer market has been really noticed as from quarter four in '08 and certainly going on still at the start '09. This country in particular has been hurt a little bit earlier in the learning curve, if I can call it like that.</p>
          <p>Now, higher interest rates and credit crunch are of course affecting our businesses, our business, but essentially the ones of our suppliers and of our wholesalers and retailers. The economic crisis has also lead to a number of currencies to depreciate quite steeply towards the Europe, not in the least placed British pound, posing challenges for euro quarter business going forward.</p>
          <p>Lowering consumer confidence, of course, leads immediately to a decline of the on-trade particularly in mature markets you see a decline, a steeper decline in the sales of the on-trade. But you see also, and that's more a feature of emerging markets, and you see also phenomenons of down trading, consumers looking for less or cheaper propositions in the market.</p>
          <p>Now excise duty increases are of course on the agenda, governments come with very big support packages to the economy and that's good new of course, but that has all to be financed, and one of the ways to finance it, is of course to increase the excise duty. So our industry, the alcohol beverage industry is of course faced with that phenomenon as a kind of a budget aid. And finally, I mentioned the smoking bans, but that has nothing to do with the economic recession, that is just a staying element which plays a role in the tougher environment.</p>
          <p>Now, in these challenging times that I just depicted, Heineken has a robust position. First &#x2013; in the first place, beer stays a resilient product. We are not a car maker. We are not selling flat screens. So that has to be said. We are less resilient than perhaps other food staples, but we are a resilient category.</p>
          <p>Our financial structure and cash flow remain sound. We have a strong brand portfolio that didn't change. The Heineken brand is leading in the international premium segment, it has 20% market share in the world and it is growing. So it's a great asset for our company and, not only I've shown you the geographical spread, which is also spreading the risk, but we have out of the 66 markets in which we operate, we have leading positions and I define them number one or number two. And in value in 59% out of the 66 markets, and finally we have a proven track record. And we have a proven track record in brand building, cost cutting, cash generation, and fast integration and turnaround of new acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the world as it performed over 2008, and only highlighting because there is information on the sheet and a lot has been said already in the press release. The key message for Western Europe is that we were able to continue to deliver organic profit growth in 2008, despite beer volumes on that organic part of our business who went down 1.6% and remember Heineken went up 1.4% in that context.</p>
          <p>We did that through robust pricing. We could maintain our margins in all our existing businesses. So that explains why we had a good performance. We did it also on the back of strong cost cutting programs, which delivered, as I said, on time and in full. The beer margins deteriorated 210 basis points to 10.1% that is entirely due to the integration of Scottish &amp; Newcastle business in, as from May. That explains the full, that explains also the gap to fill, that explains also the potential to build from those businesses acquired in Europe as our demands on margins are higher than what we have found.</p>
          <p>Now I will zoom in for a moment in the U.K. because, out of the whole, as an end portfolio, the U.K. is certainly the masterpiece and posing or getting to the largest concerns. I've quoted here, U.K. the perfect storm. You got the worst recession in decades. You've two unprecedented debt excise duty increases in a year, plus 9% in March and 8% again in November; you don't see that quite often. We have a situation in the U.K. where pricing did not offset enough the cost increases of the last two, three years on raw and packed input costs and that has to be said.</p>
          <p>The effect of the recession on the on-trade has been fierce, over last year with 9.5% downturn, the smoking ban, but that is not unique to the U.K., and finally and certainly for us as a euro quoted and perhaps the single largest disappointment for us has been the falling pound, 21% against the euro over the year.</p>
          <p>Now I have also to say and to add that we didn't have the best summer in a series of very good British summers over the last decades, that did not help in 2008. But that's a weak market and in all these kind of dramatic picture of the market S&amp;N U.K. is a strong company and that is what we have to focus on.</p>
          <p>So the long term potential to work from there is there. It is the market leader both in volume and value. It has the stronger brand portfolio, and the Heineken brand, despite the total market in the U.K. falling 5% year-on-year, Heineken has grown 24% in one year, which is a very encouraging sign. But also a leader in the cider markets, once more the cider market grew quite healthily 6% this year, the total market in Scottish &amp; Newcastle UK on a 12 month basis, here it's shown on an eight month basis, but it grew its volume to 8.6% and its share was 1.4%, gained share till 48%. So quietly half of the British cider market is operated by Scottish &amp; Newcastle, with Strongbow and Boomers.</p>
          <p>We have been gaining very marginally, but we have been gaining at a difficult on-trade marked channel a little bit of share. We have lost share in the off trade, because we have been lagging behind in our promotional support in the off trade, mainly due to the fact that '08 has been a year of transition for Scottish &amp; Newcastle UK.</p>
          <p>We are delivering the synergies on time. We have in September already explained and given details of all the synergies realized, so I will not come back on all these elements from the headquarters integration of all our operations and the closing of the headquarters &#x2013; the international headquarters of Scottish &amp; Newcastle UK, that's all done.</p>
          <p>The new element since then is the integration, the authorization from the Irish competition authority to integrate Beamish &amp; Crawford within Heineken Island that authorization is &#x2013; has been received and we are integrating currently the businesses and decided to close the brewery of Beamish &amp; Crawford, which is located equally in Cork like ours, so one has been made redundant.</p>
          <p>Going forward and against the backdrop of more difficult trading conditions in the UK, we will have to look, and we are looking, for additional cost measures, restructuring part of our businesses more than we have envisaged in the first &#x2013; in the first business plan and continuing to carry out, the decision would have been taken earlier, think about the closure of the Berkshire brewery, which is taking out a third of the total brewing capacity out of the supply chain in this country and making sure that we are not any more in a situation of overcapacity here in the UK, with a view on the longer-term.</p>
          <p>The priorities are also to invest in brands. We have strong brands. We have the Foster brands, we have Boomer brands. We have Strongbow. We have Heineken. All this brands will continue to be supported. And more importantly even in a time of recession these brands will be supported in order to gain share. That is what we have at hand in a nutshell in the UK.</p>
          <p>On the larger S&amp;N Group, so taking into account all the other countries, the integration program as such is completed. The Heineken brand has been integrated within Finland; within Hartwell, as we speak, it has been done in December in Portugal.</p>
          <p>So all these businesses are integrated and the synergies we have said in the summer that we would realize under the 86 million of synergies. On the deal, we're now running at the rate of half of it about 90 million have been realized on an annual rate. And we will continue to work to deliver these synergies.</p>
          <p>Now, I have, I think, touched broadly enough on the UK and it's now time to move to the second large geography of Heineken, Central and Eastern Europe. Good for big chunk of our volume, there the story is we grew volume again. We grew share. Contrasted performance between countries, because we have a number of operations over there, but particularly strong performances in Greece, Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Serbia and Croatia, they all delivered sterling performances on all account.</p>
          <p>The operating margins went here also down 270 basis points. This is clearly not good news. It explained by two factors. On the one hand we were not &#x2013; and we explained it already at the half year figures. We were not quick enough to raise prices in front of the raising input cost prices in that region. And so where our operating margins stood at 9.8% in the first half, they were already at 11.1% in the second half. So pricing kicked in, in the second half in most of the countries, and are continuing their way forward in order to restore these margins.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, we see in a number of markets, since particularly in the emerging parts of Central Eastern Europe, in some markets you see a skew towards the lower end of the portfolio, now these two &#x2013; they contribute to a lower margin.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we expanded our footprint in countries like Romania. We added Bere Mures. And we integrated that successfully and is as a reinforcement of our leadership and of number one position in Romania. We entered Serbia and Belarus as number two. Those are one of these markets where we have to still deliver value and we have &#x2013; we are in the process of integration, and a number of Czech Republics in making a stronger number three position in the Czech Republic.</p>
          <p>I now turn to one of the big pieces in the region, which is Russia. Russia the market is &#x2013; went slightly down, as opposed to last year. It went slight &#x2013; it went up still in the first half and then it went down in the second half, particularly in the last quarter. Also Russia is still touched by weakening economy. We see that. And it also affected our business.</p>
          <p>In this year, our margins were particularly affected because our lack of pricing power, certainly in the first half of the year, we restore that for a big part in the second half of the year. But we have been facing quite steep increases in raw and pack, particularly raw materials in transportation cost of the year 2008. But we are doing the work of restoring the margins going forward.</p>
          <p>And in that little bit less optimistic outlook that is on the country, we focus essentially on forceful cost reduction in the operation in Russia, and to continue to invest in our key brands in the premium end of our portfolio, Heineken leading that, but we have other premium brands in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>And also regional champions, we have a number of regional champions, which are performing very well. And as national brands, we push essentially two value brands, which are Three Bears and Ochota. And Three Bears, in that segment, has been performing superbly over the last year.</p>
          <p>So far for a little bit more information about Russia, let me then turn to Africa, the Middle East. Africa, the Middle East is an outstanding performance. It's in the row already of five year of good performance. In Africa and the Middle East is essentially backed on, and I repeat it every time, political stability creating stronger economies and helping a middle class to emerge in many, many countries of Africa. We have seen superb sterling results in these days, one could say platinum results, across all metrics: in sales, in growth of the profits, but also in margin growth. So it has been all across and in all countries, a success story, with a particular mention here for Nigeria, which is the lion share of our profits. It accounts for close to half of the total profits of Africa.</p>
          <p>We operate through two companies. The one is Nigerian breweries, which is stock-listed on the Nigerian stock exchange and the other one is Consolidated Breweries, together we have 67% of share and we are still growing that share. We have a couple of the leading brands in Nigeria, Star being the largest one, followed by Gulder. Heineken is growing big time 60% this year, in the premium segment it is doing fantastically and even in the start segment, we have a brand called Legend and which achieved the 150% growth and taking 10% of that segment already. So Nigeria is really one of the big drivers for profits in Africa and we are very proud of this fantastic performance.</p>
          <p>Now, I turn to the next region which is the Americas, we cross the Atlantic. We have in &#x2013; we operate through a variety of different business models, it's export operations, it's own breweries and also various joint ventures with local breweries. So, let me take them regionally. We had good volume growth in the Caribbean and Latin America. It was also particularly a good performance of Heineken in that region.</p>
          <p>We have a somehow disappointing performance of Heineken USA, and I will zoom in into that performance. And then we have a large joint venture CCU with the Qui&#xF1;enco Group and that is operating breweries in Chile and Argentina, but also wine in Chile and spirits in Chile and even confectionary and soft drinks.</p>
          <p>Now the group has doing a very good job in beer, growing 8% organically. Heineken has been growing 22% in their portfolio. It has been posting very good profit developments. However, in euro terms the contribution has remained stable since the peso has devaluating close to 28% over the past year. So that has been a setback on these good results.</p>
          <p>Let me then turn to the U.S. of A. The total market, these are numbers which we got from Neilson. The total market up 0.1%, so close to be flat but it's a large market. The total of the imports went down 1.7%, and Heineken USA's portfolio performance has been in sales minus 2 and in depletion 1.1. In between the stocks that we keep in our demand points the minus 1.1 relate to distributors selling to retailers. So, somewhere we performed market conform, of course with a very compressive picture in our portfolio. The Mexican portfolio performed again superbly well, posting an 8% increase.</p>
          <p>And then come to our own portfolio, where Amstel was still under heavy pressure with minus 11%. Newcastle Brown Ale which is a newcomer to the portfolio was down 3.8%, the minus 15 relates a lot to the fact that we found at acquisition time, the whole pipeline of Scottish &amp; Newcastle very well filled in the US. So you have some stock effects and I would put the slight pressure on performance of Brown &#x2013; Newcastle Brown Ale rather on transition issues than really brand issues.</p>
          <p>Then we end up with Heineken Light and Heineken Lager, Heineken Light did, under circumstances, well; it maintained its share in the market and Heineken Lager was just disappointing, has to be said, it's currently 5% down.</p>
          <p>This has to do, I said it many times, a lack of marketing support or we have to do more and a better job with advertising and marketing support for the brand in the USA. That is absolutely tier we have been launching new campaigns, we did the same for Amstel in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>One has to realize that by launching new marketing initiatives you have to take time and have confidence that ultimately they work out. It is not because you have one new campaign, that your market share is going to jump up through the roof in one day, but definitely there is a point of attention for our business in the USA. It is still of course a very large business and we're working on it to make it work.</p>
          <p>The other part of the initiatives that we're taking in the states this year is a cost cutting initiative, it's called program Odyssey, but we have an in-depth look at the way how we operate business structurally and we have launched and that this now in full swing and it's near completion. We have launched a plan to kind of bring back the work force and the supporting forces and reorganizing back offices in the United State to make it a more efficient and a more lean and mean organization.</p>
          <p>Now that is the update of the USA. I come now to the last region, Asia Pacific. As you know, we operate through three different platforms. The first one is APB, Asia Pacific Breweries. Our joint venture with Fraser &amp; Neave posted a good sales growth with 8.4% organic growth. We strengthen our footprint with new breweries in Laos, in India. Profits were more or less stable for us in euros because there again currencies played a role taking their toll on the translation, but we had also gestation losses to take in the new businesses that APB has been launching. But overall good organic profit in APB and the confidence that this is a very sound business going forward.</p>
          <p>Second leg in Asia is our own operations that is mainly Indonesia, which had a sterling performance both in profit and volume. And our export to Taiwan, South Korea developed well ... as well as our license with Australia. So that was all on green.</p>
          <p>And the final and the third leg is our 37.5% stake in United Breweries in India. We have not yet considered that as a partnership. It is a stake we have in United Breweries. We are working to make it a partnership. It is now too early days to come up with details of how that will work, we're working on that. I'm confident we will come there. But I take the view that is worthwhile taking the time of making good agreements between partners than to make quick agreements and then regret it for the next 20 years. So, we will still come up with partnership agreements for India.</p>
          <p>That having been said, I end with the outlook for 2009 and beyond, and I called it Outlook &amp; Priorities because, unfortunately, I do not have a crystal ball and we do not have a very direct influence on the economy, but we know what we have to focus on in these particularly difficult circumstances.</p>
          <p>And the one and most important priority for the company is to have a top priority on cash flow generation and cash conservation so the cash conversion rate is set us from 2009 to be above 100% and that's for the period '09, '10 and '11 and is done ... was aim to reduce the debt coming down from the 3.3 EBITDA &#x2013; net debt to the EBITDA ratio to 2.5, that is what we set ourselves as a target. It is obviously that one of the key attention areas for top management is the improvement of the performance of the newly acquired businesses.</p>
          <p>We will continue with the rigorous cost cutting programs through what we call Total Cost Management. It is a new program, successor of Fit 2 Fight with we launched as from '09 will cover the periods '09, '10 and '11. The cost base will be enlarged towards Fit 2 Fight and contrary to what we did three years ago, we will not announce a target upfront, but we will report on what we have been realizing from six months to six months and you will hear from the marketplace country-by-country what we are doing restructuring our businesses in every update of six months you will be updated what the program is contributing to.</p>
          <p>And finally, the last leg to concentrate on is to continue to build, which means invest in the key winning brands. Internationally, that's Heineken for sure, but in every local market those brands who can make our value share growing, whilst &#x2013; and that's not unimportant &#x2013; maintaining price positioning in an order to have a desired level of operating margins.</p>
          <p>Now, when we make all this happened, we have the absolute conviction that we will emerge as a stronger and even more competitive company going forward. Thank you for your attention. And before passing the word to Ren&#xE9;, we have, as ever, a light intermezzo, which is a piece of advertising and this time something coming out of Ireland. And now it comes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good afternoon. And as usual, I will take you a little bit more in detail through the figures and by, in fact, the different ways how you can look at the figures of 2008, as already said by Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. What I think is the most important is that in our existing businesses we performed very well looking at the organic growth figures. And 7.4% organic revenue growth, and 8.7% EBIT growth and then 11% organic net profit growth, these are strong figures, certainly when you put in against the backdrop of an deteriorating economy.</p>
          <p>But secondly, we have the new consolidations and as said, they have the negative effect on our net earnings. Their positive EBIT contribution was more than offset by their financing cost and so before exceptional items and the amortization of brands, net profit decreased by 9.5%. So they brought it down from 11 to minus 9.5.</p>
          <p>And then finally, this year &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; I didn't click the right one. And then, finally, we took exceptional charges, 757 in 2008 and that resulted obviously in a big drop in the reported IFRS net profit. As usual in my presentation, I will focus on the beia figures or the figures before exceptional items and amortization of brands and customer relations. But given the huge impact of these exceptional items I will quickly go through them with you.</p>
          <p>And here you see the buildup of the exceptional cost, the Fit 2 Fight restructuring costs relate to two big projects, one in Spain, the closing of the Arano brewery, the other in France, the further restructuring of the production footprint which includes the closure of the Fischer brewery. In the press release it states that the Fischer brewery will be closed in the first half the year, actually, this versus the end of the year so that is wrongly stated in the press release.</p>
          <p>And &#x2013; yes, and then, restructuring cost, obviously, are the costs which we have made to get the synergies out, the synergies of this acquisitions. So that is the closure of the S&amp;N head office in Edinburgh, the integration of the organizations in the U.K., in the U.S. and in Ireland including the closure of the Beamish &amp; Crawford brewery in Cork in Ireland. As said, we have now realized on an annualized basis 90 million of the synergies which is close to half.</p>
          <p>Then to Russia, despite the good performance in the markets, we have to write-down quite of the goodwill and that was caused by the decrease, the steep decrease, of the ruble and weak outlook of the Russian economy. And we wrote down the goodwill there was 275 million.</p>
          <p>In India, as said, our stake, certainly 7.5% stake in the UB brewery is valued at market value. The whole Indian strong market crunched, UB shares dropped very strongly and the share &#x2013; the fall in the share price of the UB shares forced us to lower the book value of our Indian stake in the books by 200 million.</p>
          <p>The value of the U.K. pub portfolios, the 600 pubs which we really have on our balance sheet has been reduced by 51 million. And then finally, in the other financing cost we found in S &amp; N, a number of interest hedges which make absolutely sense from an economic point of view to get floating rates in to fix but the way they were structured doesn't allow them for hedge accounting and the negative value they currently have because of the decrease of the interest cost, we have taken as an exceptional item because over the duration of these hedges that will reverse over time. So the total effect is 757 million and it is important to note these are non-recurring items and 80% of it are non-cash.</p>
          <p>Let's then have a look at the volume of development first of all in the full 2008 consolidated volume grew organically. So without the acquisitions by 3.5% and the Heineken brand grew 4.7%. Obviously it's very interesting to look how that split was over the quarter certainly in view of the current economic circumstances and you can clearly see from the growth figures on this graph that during the year, the growth slowed down from 5% in the first half of the year, 3.2% in Q3 up to an even slight negative volume development in the last quarter. That is for the consolidated volume.</p>
          <p>The Heineken brand had the same trend that did better and even in Q4 was still growing by 1.5%. Obviously, the picture is different region by region, Africa and the Middle East and Asia were growing during the whole year. The Americas had the strongest slowdown and Europe had also that slowdown for us is Q4. However, when you then look at the profitability, you see that despite, the lower volumes in the second half of the year, the profit grew faster in that same period.</p>
          <p>We have in the second half of the year, an organic EBIT growth of 10%, for us it's 7.5% in the first half of the year and that was driven by good pricing and the cost activities. Looking at the revenues, first of all you see the big increase in revenues, 27% or a 3.1 billion to &#x20AC;14.3 billion and clearly that huge increase is to a great extent due to new acquisitions. New acquisitions added 2.350 billion to the revenue line or 21%, and 90% of that is for the Newcastle businesses, but also the organic growth, as said, was strong with an organic growth of 7.4%.</p>
          <p>When you look at that organic growth, you see what we already saw in the first half, that the way it is built up is different from what we have seen in the past. It is very much driven by higher pricing and mix improvements and less by volumes, and we see that even more pronounced in the second half of the year, as at that time the price increases which we applied in Central and Eastern Europe in Q2, were fully coming through in the revenue line.</p>
          <p>And I think it's very important to see that despite what is happening, we keep that revenue growth on the high level. The step up which we had in 2006 is still there, although the build up is differently. And the strong increase in price mix signifies the strength of our brand's portfolio and our commitment to pass on increased input costs to the market.</p>
          <p>2008, as said, was the last year of Fit 2 Fight. The program has been hugely successful in total 469 million gross savings versus the target of 450. The Fit 2 Fight ratio dropped by 540 basis points in the three-year time period to 29.5%. Five breweries were closed and we had a total reduction of FTEs involved in these programs of 12,000.</p>
          <p>We have been criticized or pushed to launch publicly new cost saving programs to launch new targets, and as we have said already half year ago, we don't do that, but that doesn't mean that we don't continue to reduce cost. Cost reduction stays very high on the agenda internally. We call it Total Cost Management, TCM, and a lot of initiatives are in place and are being executed.</p>
          <p>For 2009 and 2010 we have already announced publicly the closure of breweries in the U.K., in Ireland, in Spain and in France and &#x2013; but cost reduction is not only about brewery closures, you have to attack all cost categories and that is also a difference between Total Cost Management and Fit 2 Fight. We have broadened the scope and it is, as well, all fixed cost including sales and marketing, including energy and water, but also input cost, transport cost all is in scope of TCM. Secondly, a big difference with Fit 2 Fight is that we will look much stronger in the direct cash affect of this cost saving initiatives, because we will target these cost initiatives with you immediately cash effects, first.</p>
          <p>The strong top line in combination with these cost cutting activities has led to a good organic EBIT gross, and that was 8.7% and here you see the contribution of the new consolidations, they contributed 71 million, bringing the total increase in EBITDA to 11%. Between EBIT and net profit, obviously a lot is changing, financing cost had the big impact in 2008, 411 million financing cost in that year, 320 million relates to new businesses, new acquisitions, and obviously the biggest part is the eight months we have S&amp;N in our books.</p>
          <p>Looking at the net profit, net profit (beia) was just over 1 billion <mark type="inaudible" />. Effect of the new acquisitions was substantial by 198 million or minus 18%. And once more, that is because their financing costs exceeded their limited contribution on EBIT level.</p>
          <p>And so it is very clear that what we have to do is improve these businesses and bring up the profitability of these businesses. And here you can clearly see how you can look at these new businesses, first of all you see the big impact it has, it's size wise, we are increased by around 25% but at the same time you see that the EBIT margin of these new businesses is 3% versus 15.5% we have in our own businesses. So the cost we have at hand is to bring these businesses up to the levels we have across in the group. The attempt to the benchmarks we have in the group and we have for each of these businesses an specific plan to do that and to improve their profitability.</p>
          <p>Obviously, all these acquisitions has changed our balance sheet in a big way, but the financial structure of the company stays sound. The reduction of equity, which you see here, is mainly the result of changes in the translation reserve and in the hedging reserves, caused by huge currency swings at the end of 2008. Only the translation reserves has already an impact of over 600 million on equity.</p>
          <p>Our net debt at the end of the year was 8.9 billion and that equals 3.3 times EBITDA and that is obviously much higher than what we are used to. It's also much higher than where we would like to have it and we aim for a net debt EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times. And so the cash we will generate, we will certainly use to reduce our debt levels.</p>
          <p>Maturity profile, an hot topic nowadays, what do you need to refinance on short-term. Here you see the profile as it is by the end of the year. It's well-balanced and we don't face important refinancings in 2009. We have committed credit facilities in place to pay all the debt which fall due in the coming 12 months.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we have an EMTN program in place. We are aiming to go to the bond market when there is good opportunity to get money out of that market. Interest rates are, to a great extent, fixed around 85% of the rates are fixed.</p>
          <p>Hunt for Cash, obviously in theses times, cash is king. And so, we have re-launched our Hunt for Cash program. It was hugely successful after the BBAG acquisition. We brought it back and it is now full on the agenda in the company. So therefore we call it Hunt for Cash Two. Aim is to bring the cash conversion rate back to above 100% and as you know the cash conversion is free operating cash flow as a percentage of net profit before minorities.</p>
          <p>In 2007 and 2008, our cash conversion was around 50%, so much lower than what we are aiming for. At that time that had very good reasons because we had huge capacity expansions in Central and Eastern Europe and in Africa, next to a number of greenfields.</p>
          <p>However, the economy has changed, the outlook has changed. And so cash generation is our first priority and will be the focus in the company. We screen investments in a different way, hurdle rates, pay-back times are short and clearly, we rank the investments in a different way given the limited funds we would like to spend on that. And you see already the first results of that when you look at our CapEx plan or budget for 2009, that is 400 million below what we have in 2008 with 700 million. I need to remind you that of that 700 million, 230 million is an overflow of still expansion plans which are executed, which were started in 2007 and 2008.</p>
          <p>And next to that, we will of course focus on further reducing working capital and there where in the company that are redundant assets we will try to sell them as soon as possible. And maybe most importantly is that all our top 500 managers in the company have a free operating cash flow target as their main target going forward. And that means that one hand, Hunt for Cash will help them to achieve that, on the other hands Total Cost Management will help them achievement. But the whole management in the company is lined around that.</p>
          <p>So let me summarize 2008. A year of strong organic growth, existing businesses did well. But the overall profitability effected by the new acquisitions and impairments. However, the strategic rationale behind these acquisitions and the markets we entered in, stays strong and we will, overtime, improve their performance.</p>
          <p>For 2009 and beyond, we will focus on improving the cash flow generation and we will bring the cash conversion rates to above 100%. We target a net debt EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times. And we will continue with our rigorous cost cutting activities through Total Cost Management. And lastly, we will absolutely not stop investing behind our key brands and maintain their price positioning in the market. And together, all these actions will make sure that Heineken comes out of this stronger and even more competitive than before.</p>
          <p>This is what I would like to share with you. Before we go into Q&amp;A, you get obviously again a nice commercial. It is the commercial out of the Dutch market. It's in Dutch, but I think you will understand it. Because it's flowing around on the Internet, millions and millions of people across the world have seen it, reacted on it. There are hundreds of blogs discussing this commercial, but let's just have a look and have a little bit of fun.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi, so it's Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. Couple of things first of all, the remarks you've seen over the last couple of years on input cost were absent this time around. I'm just wondering, presumably you are seeing things easing versus what you told us in August, I think you guiding then for input cost inflation about 8% this year, what's it looking like now and can it drop heading into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's clear in August, we guided to 8%, we have done half cap rates the other half is obviously cheaper than that 8%. You see the trend going down, we will certainly benefit from that, and that will have a positive impact although overall you can not just take the market prices of malt and translate that to our input cost. Therefore, we will continue to push for price increases in the market because we have to restore margins based on what we have lost in the last two years and to make up for still a bit of cost inflation in our &#x2013; the on cover products.</p>

          <p>Are you still expecting input costs versus '08 to be up there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That depends a little bit on the balance, but it will be flattish.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Flattish. Okay. I also wanted to ask...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that is not going forward, a sign that it will remain flat or that it will go down or whatever. That stays volatile. Especially on the commodity prices of barley, you cannot predict what the next harvest will be. One has to realize the '08 harley &#x2013; barley harvest has been one of the best ones we have had for decades, for once we had a good thing. And, of course, the prices could drop really after the harvest because there were surpluses for the first time in many years. But going forward the structural elements, which made the commodity prices for cereals to go up, they remain, and that's a higher demand from Asia and the bio-fuels and that remains. So we have to be cautious to make projections about these falling trends on the second half of '08 into the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And on the U.K., the 87 million that S&amp;N's &#x2013; on the S&amp;N business making 87 million in the whole of '08, term '08 versus 253 in 2007, are we now looking at a situation where synergies are more about shoring up profitability to where it used to be rather than building on what used to be the existing level of profits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you got to face two phases. Clearly the results were disappointing. Secondly, we relate for results in euros, and we come from the British Pound to kind of &#x2013; that is the situation we're in. But we have clearly a work to do in margin restoration essentially in beer and there are two aspects of it. The cost aspect, we can add to more efficiency of the U.K. operation. That is one part. And the second thing is pricing. In this market, beer producers have been lagging behind the price hikes on the input cost materials as opposed to Continental Europe. That is a fact.</p>
          <p>Now that work will be long, but we will have to do it and certainly as market leader. That's the second aspect. And the third one is to work on the strong points you have on the strong brands you have to win share &#x2013; to win share with your brands and to win share in the channels where you are strong. And so think about a brand like Heineken I was indicating, it's growing by 24%, that clearly there is a potential going forward. There is &#x2013; we will continue to invest money behind cider. The category is growing. Our share is growing. The margins are healthy. This is a good business. We continue to invest in it, right. And also, we see opportunities in other beer brands in the U.K. portfolio to do a better job going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Chris Wickham here from MainFirst. Just two things; one going back a little bit to the question with the, the press conference this morning on marketing costs. And I think you used the expression there, of a zero-based budget approach to advertising and selling expenses, which I think is a phrase we've heard from another industry participant. And I was wondering what that actually means in terms of the direction of advertising and selling expenses as a percentage of sales.</p>
          <p>I mean, obviously last year they dropped to 11% from 12.8%, the year before. And the second question just refers to inventory and the trade, and sort of relationship between sales and depletions. Obviously, you have a very different kind of structure in the U.S. and therefore you give us the numbers in a different kind of detail. What's your feeling now in terms of just where we are in terms of pantry inventory, in terms of trade inventory whether there is anything to be coming out of the system before we can move on in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two very different questions, the one is what marketing? Yes, I used the word zero-based budgeting not as a kind of &#x2013; to indicate, and now we start a program of zero-base budgeting. But when you look at your marketing costs that approach of starting from a clean sheet, what do I have to do with the brand portfolio I have, in any given operation is a good approach. So the kind of mental mechanism and discipline of a zero-based budget approach for marketing and sales cost is a good exercise to do for the portfolios you operate, leading you to make choices, choices in the brands you support, but also measuring efficiency.</p>
          <p>And the third part is also leveraging falling media costs &#x2013; you have opportunities also, you can make more out of the same dollars, or you can have kind of, less money and still the same. So all these elements have to be taken into account. But the ZBB is not meant as we start a ZBB as some of our competitors have been doing, no. It's more the mental approach, how do you approach marketing costs in terms of making tougher choices. Is that clarifying what I've said this morning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps we just lead on with what sort of &#x2013; what should we be expecting, because that gives you two options. I mean one is to maintain the same percentage of sales and get more, hit more eyeballs, or the other one is to hit the same number of eyeballs, and actually get a saving which benefits your margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is things which depends from markets. You cannot put a kind of a global approach of a global number on a business like ours. We operate in 66 different countries, with over 200 brands. So it's more of a local approach that will lead to choices which you refer to and the add-up will be of course monitored, but it's the discipline that you have to have when operating each and every brand portfolio, and the aim of it is to grow your market share in value, because you don't do that for free. It's not something that is only meant to cut out marketing cost, no. It is to spend better in order to grow value share; that's how you have to see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But maybe adding on that, which is very much &#x2013; how do you spend it, and how well do you spend it. You're also looking at what sort of a percentage would you see us going forward, it is expected that that will be a bit lower based on the fact that media cost will be lower in a market which is uncertain, it is unlikely that you would translate all these efficiencies directly into extra spent or extra contacts in the market; that is not to be expected, honestly.</p>
          <p>Then on the US inventory, we are working on working capital, the trade obviously is doing that as well. You see it already, it's not in the US a big way, but when you look at depletions versus sales, and you see that the difference depletions are slightly better than sales, which means that the trade is going slightly tighter on stocks, but it didn't have a major impact in 2008.</p>
          <p>We have to take perhaps the question out of the lines if you, as I was instructed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, two questions if I may. First question is on your program, Total Cost Management. Can you put that into a perspective of what you have done with Fit 2 Fight savings much broader and maybe somewhat more color on where it might move and how much the total cost might be reduced or margins might be improved. Concerning the African one that was a very good second half again and really exploding second half again. How do you see the 2009 developments in light of lower oil prices in Nigeria and also the lagging effect in input prices in that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the TCM. As I said, it is building on the cultural change which we made in the company with Fit 2 Fight. And that was really to get the company on cost reduction. We feel very much that it is embedded in the way how we manage the businesses, in the way how people are money toward it. But we &#x2013; as said, we will broaden it to more categories and don't make it as limited as Fit 2 Fight, but you will see to a great extent continuation of similar things and what is announced is the closures of the breweries in Ireland, UK, Spain, and France. But, for instance, you will also see that internally we have a big project on non-product related spend so where we scrutinize all the things we spent out of pocket which are not strategic input costs like bottles, cans, and barley. See how we can group that, how we can make that more efficient; a number of these kinds of elements are included into Total Cost Management.</p>
          <p>Your question about Africa, of course Africa would not be immune for recession also, though I'd like to make two observations. The first one, it has not been hit the same way as other markets in terms of the credit crisis hurting also the real estate of the people. Africa is a different environment. People do not live from credit and mortgages, and so its a cash economy with highly rapid flow of short-term money and cash money circulating in the economy. So that gives, for African economy, a kind of a resilience that you perhaps might not find in other more developed economies.</p>
          <p>That having been said, what we observe so far in Nigeria the oil, the crude oil prices have been coming down for quite a while and we did not see, till now, a fall in the demand rate, despite that over the last two months the naira has indeed dropped quite a bit. That is, it is not the only currency which has dropped against the euro. That poses evident challenges going forward. We run our business in euro. We have been facing these kind of situations.</p>
          <p>The last one it was in 2003, if I remember well. It takes a time of adaptation, but be aware that everywhere where we operate in Africa, we have very strong market positions from &#x2013; to operate from and the businesses inherently have a great flexibility to amortize some shops. But I do agree, there is embedded, of course, as in every other market there are risks embedded also in a country like Nigeria. But overall, when we look at the recent performance coming out of Africa, it's still going very strong, despite all news that is flowing around the price of the oil.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Paul Hofman from Chevreux. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon, Paul Hofman of Chevreux in Amsterdam. Just one question on pricing, it's now 7% accelerating. You mentioned, you want to continue to push prices. Yeah, what about 2009 overall; what are your expectations high ended deflatedable pressure volume further? That's one. Secondly, if you do nothing on pricing what would be the lagging impact of the price actions you take &#x2013; took in '08 for this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, yes, we said, we continue to go for price increases, are we afraid that that will hamper volume in most of the economies, which are very price sensitive. We have the whole portfolio of products, or if there is down trading we pick that up at the lower end of the portfolio. But we think it is very important that we maintain and restore our margin levels, because once you get out of the crisis whenever that will be, if you have been discounting and downgrading your brands ultimately you will harm the long-term future of your business. Secondly, one thing not to forget in although there is a downward trend and over time we benefit from that in the input cost and is that a lot of the input cost are euro or dollar related and lot of the economies we operate in are not. So even in U.K. for instance, part of the input cost basis is not pound related, but is euro related and that will force us to put up prices also in markets like here in the U.K.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And, in general, one has to realize, and I have said that many times, I put margins in front of volume developments, that is &#x2013; that I think it's a sound discipline to have. Obviously, in some markets, your position to do that is weaker than in other; that I recognize there is competition and there is power and push backs coming from your client. That as a principal of management, margins comes before volume. From the room...</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jason DeRise, UBS. Can I ask I guess two questions? First on S &amp; N, in each one you restated so that it was flat EBIT and then the margin H2 is 5%. Should we assume that 5% is kind of the run rate for now and then you are obviously going to look to improve that? And then I guess secondly, just going back to your one of your slides that showed the Heineken volume and your volume overall by quarter, there is obviously a slow down in Q4. Could you share where the Heineken brand under performed, the overall portfolio in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I missed the first one. Could you repeat the first one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The S &amp; N profitability...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In H1 is restated to flat? And than in the second half, it woulda been at 5% EBIT margins. Is 5% the run rate that we should assume for H1 and then from there you will look to improve it back towards a 10% rate that we saw when S &amp; N reported it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are two elements; one is the seasonality of the S&amp;N business, but on the other hand in the first half of the year you had the whole S&amp;N head office dragging down the business or half being carried by half of the business, because we split the business, but we got the full head office. So the overall EBIT margin of the acquisition we did is below the 5% or around 4, 5% and that is clearly where we have to work from getting it further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the other question was on the Heineken brand versus the portfolio in Q4. We saw at the group level that the Heineken brands slowed but still was growing faster than the group. But obviously there must have been some markets where it was lower, I'm assuming the U.S. was one of them, but could you highlight any markets where there was deterioration there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so in general you'd see &#x2013; and so overall the Heineken brand as it has done for many, many years is growing faster than the total portfolio or the total beer market. We see that holding up very well in mature markets when you look at, for instance, the performance in France where the Heineken brands still grew over 4% in the market which was declining. You see in some central and eastern European markets which are pretty price sensitive that the Heineken brand is under pressure. We didn't see that in Russia. The growth in Russia was still very good. But for instance in Poland, we saw that the Heineken brand was under pressure. We react on that staying on the price positioning what Jean-Francois said, that we don't react by lowering the prices and discounting it. We sit it out. We think it is very important to have the positioning and the image of the brands right and we position ourselves when purchasing power lives again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one follow-up on that. Could you quantify the margin impact of down trading from the Heineken brand, when you say that, I think before you used to say it was 40% of your EBIT, that's obviously going to be a little bit less after the acquisition marginal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is &#x2013; companywide you see that the Heineken brand runs more than the overall portfolio that is clear. But you have to see that country by country has to do with the size of the brand, the position of the brand in a specific company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The single country where the Heineken is, as a brand, much more under pressure and it affects of course, because of the high volume base, volume is the U.S. I explained the reasons, structural reasons why we are not totally satisfied with the performance. One is also to realize, as it is a big brand with a large distribution, we are suffering in the U.S. from a down trade phenomenon particularly in the conveniencey shopping habits of the people, that is where you see down trading happening. So strangely enough you don't see that in Metro New York in the Deli shops nor in the on-trade, but you'll find that in the kind of mainstream conveniencey shops, there is where we suffered the highest drop in our sales and that is also linked with the crisis where people really down trade because they're confronted with offers from the national domestic brands, which, you know, at price points which are very attractive at some point in time, you find yourself confronted with the Heineken at the double the price of the Coors Light and then you kind of lose sales. And that is the phenomenon of down trading which is happening in a particular channel in the U.S. that is in complement and I forgot to say that is, as equally important as that we have to continue to sustain our brand going forward with kind of better and more exiting campaigns that we did in the past.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just couple of questions on the U.K.. You mentioned that pricing was obviously going to be an important lever in the U.K.. Can you give some insight into your confidence on getting real pricing into the retail channel following your discussion with retailers and is having and ex-colleague at the helm, one of them help or a hindrance? And given the fact that you haven't written down the goodwill on the U.K. acquisition that must indicate your confidence in rebuilding profitability pretty rapidly back to the per acquisition level. Can you give us a feel of what timeframe you would expect to do that?</p>

          <p>You are at the heart of the problem or in the heart of &#x2013; of a part of the solution as I indicated that you will also understand that I would not share our dealings with retailers going on. You need to show nerves in the situation, let me put it that way, and that is a long term, that's a long term exercise. But frankly, the power of U.K. retailers is there, but it is equally there in France. It is there in the Netherlands. It's there in Spain. It's there in Italy. Those negotiations, they come back every year. There are times at which they can be protracted, that's true, but you know, we have professionals who come through, and that needs skills. And I think I'm confident we have the skills on the ground here in the U.K. as we have them in many countries, need to be patient, tactful, skillful and what we call in Dutch <mark type="inaudible" /> which means you know resilience overtime. You don't build back margins by just improving your price, your list price as such. It is a work that you have also to do to get always with your customer.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do not want to put a timeframe on that, but I mean at least three years for sure. That is for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just very quick question, you report the Heineken volume growth, the Heineken brand volume growth. Are you able to give us a feel for what you've done in terms of Heineken brand value growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We tend &#x2013; we have a guideline for the Heineken brand which puts the, in principle, the minimum price premium of the Heineken brand at 30% above the leading mainstream brand in every given market. Depending on the market situation, we always try to have, because our experience has been that somewhere between 35 and 50% is the best price premium for beer, leveraging that point of higher margin and good volumes. So that is where we steer it through. So you have a number of markets where Heineken is still small, very highly positioned and you have markets.</p>
          <p>But we have been quasi eliminating all these market where the positioning of the price was lower than 35%. The last ones to be in that situations were Latin America and we have been working on that in the last three, four years and bringing in countries like Chile or Argentina, the price premium up to 30 to 35%. And guess what happened? The sales grew. And the market share grew. Because the first feature of a premium brand is a premium price.</p>
          <p>So that is how &#x2013; how that works. But take another example like China, there we have a price premium of 400%, but the average price of mainstream beer in China, you know they -- we sell and I take the ex-brewery net prices that is about between 20 and &#x20AC;22 the hectoliter, that is &#x2013; that is very, very, very low. And our ex-factory or our ex-works price there is quite a five times that amount. Because you understand, if we would sell it at a price premium with even 100% you would find Chinese Heineken all around the world with that kind of low prices. So that is we have to manage our pricing very carefully because we are a worldwide distributed brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in terms of the year just gone, you did 4.7% volume growth of the Heineken brand that there is specific volume growth number, when at the group it was organic 7.4, but the Heineken brand itself had driven value at a greater rate than that?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Nico Lambrechts from Merrill Lynch. Just first question around CapEx the reduction to about 700 million. Would it be correct to infer that the CapEx of a billion in the prior two years, about 35% of that was expansion CapEx? And are you actually cutting the CapEx to a level where you are deferring maintenance type of CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first assumption is correct. Yes, we have had a period of high investment into new capacities. The market was growing many emerging markets. So we have been building in Africa, Central Eastern Europe, in Russia in particular, so that is coming to an end and was the actual evolution that is debt extension CapEx is out of the way. In '07 where we still have a 700 million program underway there is an overflow, Ren&#xE9;, of 200 to 230 million coming out of '08 back in '09, for completion of projects which were launched previously. And the last part of your &#x2013; the answer to your question, we would never let go our investments into a deteriorating stage, but since we are a kind of a company who always very, very neatly invested in its fixed assets, we have a little bit of a leeway to cut back on our replacement investments for a few years because we are in the industry really on very high norms. And finally, we would never take any risk with safety &#x2013; safety of people, safety of the foodstuff we produce of course.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>They mentioned gross margins in '09 will be flat in most markets, should we take that at face value or would you have a similar trend? And then in terms of &#x2013; there's many moving parts. There is raw material prices, there is pricing, there is cost savings, that type, would you be managing the cost savings targets in order to maintain EBIT margins flat into '09 or how should we think about EBIT margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gross margin has gone down in the last couple of years, and so the minimum we should aim for to level it up. That will be in big strides to get that done in the markets. Certainly seeing what the currencies are doing, don't underestimate the currency effect on the input cost in major parts of our business. So I don't think &#x2013; don't copy what others are saying. And looking at our operating margins, what we have done year-after-year is improving our operating margins on an organic basis. They are disturbed by currencies and they are disturbed by new acquisitions. Going forward, they won't be disturbed short term by new acquisitions. So it is, you go from that low base, the low margin, the new acquisitions help you start building up but organically, in principle, our operating margins should improve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on your point about currencies, I mean, Ukraine over the last three months depreciated 15%, inflation expectation is 16, Poland currency depreciated 30 and inflation expectation is 3. How do you manage your business in that? Well you do have &#x2013; you're importing a lot of stuff? Can you give us a little bit &#x2013; do you put the price up 50%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also that &#x2013; at a certain moment there is a limit, and that is exactly what I say. You can say gross margins stay stable in a country like Poland, it will be extremely difficult because you cannot make up for the increase in zlotys but your input costs are up because most of the input costs are, they're euro denominated.</p>
          <p>And let's face it that it's going to be for '09 the single biggest business risk for any business that operates in a euro base and reports in a euro base, in the worldwide, that's going to be the &#x2013; the falling exchange rates, it's going to be a complicated thing to manage. Some countries are used to be running in euros even if it is not euro denominated but there are only few ones. All the others you have to reckon that it's not going to be an easy ride.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Central Eastern Europe division is probably the most exposed. What is the percentage of euro input cost or non-local currency?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you can almost say that you have &#x2013; let me put it that way, there has been and I think that is what you're going to see changes in. In an environment when all these currencies in Central Europe take the Czech Republic, and Poland and Slovakia, they have a kind of a stable environment for years. I have seen many contracts in barley made in euros, but I have seen also that barley comes from Slovakian or Czech ground or Polish and is being molted in these countries.</p>
          <p>You can also expect that a number of these contracts will also change going forward and we will of course &#x2013; business will fight for that. So it's going to be a mix picture and, of actions that you have to do to mitigate the effect of just, in order transaction and the translation. The translation you cannot do away with it, but in the transaction you have a number of mitigation things to be done the same applies for Russia, obviously. You know, these things &#x2013; it's reality, if you have a very good harvest in Russia, negotiating in ruble is an opportunity if you have very big shortfall because the harvest is totally of zilch quality in terms and quantity you have a much more difficult position that is the reality. So you need also a little bit of luck, if I may say. But it's certainly these mitigation mechanisms where you will ... you will look for.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may lastly, you made a comment in your presentation that you said, beer might not be as resilient as other food staples. Could you share with us your thinking about beer relative to other food staples, maybe spirits within the food basket?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I wouldn't make comments specifically on ... you know, the category we belong to is the enjoyment category, it's also impulse buying, it is to do with going out and therefore we are a bit more affected than the basic food stuff that you have to take in. But also, and talk to any supermarket chain, you have big shifts of course from beef to pork and poultry meat going up and that kind of things. So you see changing habits. So I was just referring that for towards the food category, we are perhaps less immune for recession than they are, but inside these categories you also have big variations of course. So it's difficult to pinpoint a percentage on that. It's more of an image. I have a question from the telephone.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions, if I may. First of all on some external factors that may impact volumes in Vito countries. Last year for example, excise duties, introduction of returnable packaging, and the smoking ban have negatively impacted volumes in some important countries, if any elements you are aware of that will continue to negatively impact volume growth in '09 in some of these countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have the list in front of me, but I know that are a number of countries where excise increases are either implemented or on the table. We have it first January in the Netherlands, we have it in November the second one here, and then U.K., so that will further drive through. And you will see where governments are under pressure, under budgetary pressure that's it is an easy thing to do to increase excises. So I don't think that will go away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then a second question on exceptional charges, You mentioned that the benefits of the Total Cost Management program will be announced at the Okura and was wondering whether there are any exceptional charges related to this cost program? Whether these will be taken -- orphaned from the daily operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When &#x2013; and so for, where you have exceptional charges are for instance for brewery closures, so that the four ones which has been announced there the exceptional charges are in the 2008 figures. If there are others, we will communicate that at that time but as I said you will see that the program is very much focusing on things, which are immediately generating cash and so we will abstain from restructurings where you have to invest upfront a lot in redundancy packaging, extension of other breweries to absorb that capacity and where the payback time is too late &#x2013; too long. And that is a change from Fit 2 Fight which was really judged on the economic value, you will see that in Total Cost Management the cash component is getting a much bigger emphasis.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Trevor Stirling, Sanford Bernstein. Sorry to return to the ugly question of the U.K., but two interrelated questions in the U.K., the first one, it looks as if there was an underlying fall in EBITDA of around 60% in the U.K. over the eight months, but presumably that got worst towards the end of the year, looking at the U.K. volume numbers. So, are we looking at further significant EBIT reductions in the first half? As for second part of that question, if backing out the 12 months and the eight months, it looks like there's a 24 million EBIT loss in the first four months of '08, clearly a part of that is the S&amp;N head office, but is that a good base to work from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, as I've said on one hand, there you see the head office bringing down the overall result. On the other hand, in markets like Portugal, the seasonality is big, and so the first four months are not profitable months. So you have to see it on a total &#x2013; on total year. And so your first question was...</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The U.K., when you look at what has happened in 2008, you can explain the full end results by, in fact, four buckets. One is, huge volume drop, S&amp;N lost 1 million hectoliters of beer and that is an huge amount. They made up by cider for a bit, but certainly not at the same extent. Then secondly, the pricing, where they really fell short on margins on their products, that is something, which absolutely has to be restored. Third is that, the overall market dropped by 5%, but it was the on-premise which was hit the hardness at close to 10% or 9.5%. And we are additionally exposed to the on-premise by S &amp; N Pub Enterprises and our Waverly wholesale business. So that was the third bucket and then the fourth one was just currency, that we made the huge currency loss and translated the pound results into euros; will that continue, yes or no? I don't know. Number of these elements will continue. On the other hand, we're working on the brands, we're working on the cost structure, we get synergies getting in. So there are lot of compensating factors which would bring the UK again in a positive mode.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Second technical question, on the P&amp;L there is a 107 charge for other finance, am I right then that 74 million of that is the one off, and 33 is recurring charge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So there are lot of smaller hedges, which we just take recurring in our financing cost, this 74 was a big one, which normally you would structure it away, that's much to do with how you document the hedge. And how exactly the duration and maturity is structured, therefore we couldn't use hedge accounting but normally you would do for this one, and therefore we set it aside as an exceptional, as we will do with the reversal over time.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Melissa Earlam, UBS. Two questions, please. You mentioned the Odyssey cost savings program in the US. Can I just confirm that is distinct from Fit 2 Fight? And can you give a timeframe for that, and if possible quantify it?</p>
          <p>And secondly, a mid-term question on your brewery footprint, you mentioned that you chopped five   breweries over the timeframe of Fit 2 Fight. On a mid-term view can you anticipate during a kind of pan country production footprint, so envisage a production hub, say for Benelux a production hub for Iberia? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On Odyssey, the part they realized in 2008 is part of Fit 2 Fight, but Odyssey is going much further than 2008. It is that when we started Fit 2 Fight the US was still in a booming mode, and so, that is more or less, a commercial organization. So, we said leave them alone, and leave them focused on the markets. Now with the changed circumstances we have told them, hey, you cannot escape the cost saving and efficiency measures we are taking all across the markets, and they have quoted there Odyssey project. But, so the start of it is in Fit 2 Fight, but you will see that continuing in the coming period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the breweries, we have over the last three years, closed five breweries and are all in Europe, by the way. Recently, we have been ... and that's outside Fit 2 Fight that's coming up now announcing the closure of Arano in Spain, l'Esperance in France, the Cork, Beamish &amp; Crawford, in Ireland and the Berkshire brewery here in England. That is around and about close to 8 million actually the capacity, which is taken out of the system in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>The idea that you can make hubs is of course a very good idea, but you work on an existing base. In the food industry, brewing is the most capital intensive industry you can find around. So the value of an installed base is of course huge. We are constantly updating a kind of a perfect allocation model across Europe. But from time-to-time, you would logistically say, you know, the best idea would be to put a brewery totally new and automated at the south Paris and close all the others in an radius of 500 miles. But it just doesn't add up with a capital cost and seeing how the markets do evolve. So we have a model, which is a complex model integrating all the parts, and the fact that we operate loads of local brands in all these countries.</p>
          <p>So we are constantly looking and updating our system. The name of the game is to stay away from over capacity problems. Name of the game is that you have to stay always at the top of productivity in the system you operate. And that when temporarily you have over capacity, which is not possible to totally close, that you at least make sure that you don't over man them. So that you take away the labor and maintenance component out of it. So that is how we operate our supply chain in a constantly re-actualized way.</p>

          <p>Sorry, Bill Casey from Bradshaw Asset Management , I got the mic sir. This is just a question on the Russian 275 million write-down and just a little bit more clarity on your assumptions. You mentioned the economy and currency fluctuations and maybe just a little bit more light on how the assumptions differ from say the Scottish &amp; Newcastle brewing business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in the impairment testing IFRS forces you to do on all cash generating units and impairment testing. What changed in Russia is that, on one hand, you see the weighted average cost of capital assumption going up. Now I think in the model, but I'm looking too young or it was 14.1. At the same time, the long-term inflation went down. So the gap between the work and the real or &#x2013; and the inflation, so the real cost went up. And when you then, put it in your model and you discount it, you get an answer, which lead you to the 275 million. And as a long-term inflation, we have used 5.8, I think. So the gap between the 14.1 and the 5.8 well, then you can see what is happening to a model.</p>

          <p>It is Matthew Webb from Cazenove. Two questions, please. Firstly, on the U.K., you said that certain of your brands have received inadequate investment in the past. Is that something that you've addressed at all in 2008? Or is that an additional cost that you're going to have bear in 2009 and beyond? Second question, also on the U.K., I'm afraid. You said that you've lost some share in the Cider category in the off-trade. No?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you not? Oh, I misunderstood you in that case. I only have one question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, correction. We won both in on-trade and off-trade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in Cider we won 2% in on-trade and 1.7% in off-trade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I misheard you. Just the one question then, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the investment in the brands, it's not only a question of money. It's a question of how you make a brand alive. It's how you differentiate one brand from another. It's daring, how you make your advertising as far as communicating with the consumers. Not necessarily a question of just throwing money at it. And I make an example, I think S&amp;N has made a superb drop with a brand like Boomers in it, and creating the image starting from a brand which was, you know, lagging and creating growth out of that brand by leveraging very good communication around the brand and showing up and making up also for these superb results.</p>
          <p>So it is not out of reach but one thing is, in the beer category in this country, I would say that advertising is a little bit undifferentiated and I think it's in that path that you have to look for how we would like to support the brand. Again, this is not a short term just putting a number for a year and then you'll get an affect. Building a brand is a program that you are going to work on for many, many years, but that's the business we're in. You always think in terms of a decade when you do that, but that does not necessarily mean big spending at all times.</p>

          <p>Nikolaas Faes from Exane BNP Paribas. Earlier you mentioned that it will take you at least three years to get back to profitability where you were in U.K. Can we say the same for you &#x2013; for yourself as on a Group level, at least three years further 18 year back to margins that you were in 2007? And secondly, can you share with us the target that you have in asset sales which you mentioned in the press release? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No we did &#x2013; no ... We said it's going to be &#x2013; it was about pricing in the U.K. and I said it's going to take you something like three years to get back on kind of pricing level which gives you the gross profit margins to work on. So that's what I was saying around the U.K., specifically. What you ask for the Group is a kind of a guidance that we can't give you. We obviously work for margin improvement. I think I was clear about it, but we can't give you a guidance on it.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the asset sales, we operate only core assets. Let me put that upfront and the asset sales are more in the light of &#x2013; in all operations you have kind of assets like real estate pieces of, pieces of land which you have around and which might not be of necessary use. So, all these operations are in the hand for cash program like we did three, four, five years ago. We redo it again. And all these assets are screened and the assets which are not necessary for the proper business that they've been disposed. That's the <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

          <p>The timing is difficult.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Karel Zoete from Rabo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions if I may. First one on your wholesale operations in Europe which is a sizeable <mark type="inaudible" /> for you, how is this business coping with say, lower volumes from already rough &#x2013; well rather thin margins as well as that many bar owners are having a tough time by providing them credits? Second question with regard to media range, because media has a big customer for you ... what are you seeing with the rates, are they down to 10%, 20%, little bit more color on that please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the wholesale, you take the media. The wholesale business is &#x2013; is definitely in Europe, under pressure, because the on trade business is clearly the one which is the most under pressure at this time, so the name of the game is to restructure. We do that constantly. We were doing that already before the recession, the trend of a negative &#x2013; negative trend in the on trade is already busy for quite a number of years. So it is a game of resizing your infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Wholesale is a regional business, so you have to resize your infrastructure, resize your offering; examples as we are offering a coffee line in the Netherlands as an additional business because there is business there, so to improve your top line on the cost size, we resize the business in order to restore as quickly as we can the kind of operating margins we work with &#x2013; with net, net are indeed very thin. But these wholesale businesses are instrumental to give us the market shares in the on trade business in the  major countries where we operate in Europe that is why we keep them. But they are of course more sensible to fluctuation and they call for always for the most urgent action not to let them down. And if I look back, you've seen in the result of the Fit 2 Fight, 22% of the 468 million savings realized over the last two years have been wholesaling and that is of course mainly in our wholesaling Western Europe. So, going forward, we'll continue to focus on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And with regard to credits &#x2013; in the businesses there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to credits, &#x2013; plus you &#x2013; well the wholesale business obviously had quite some credits to buyers which are having a tough time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard time and I think everybody does the same, right? So, we look at our creditors in some countries. We might accept slightly increasing bad debt coming out of that business. But not to a tune which would endanger the business of course, but that is absolute the priority of the Managers out there is to manage that very, very tightly indeed. And then on the media cost, yes you see in certain countries price is going down by real substantial amounts, up to 30-40%, but don't apply that to our total sales and marketing cost because there is much more in that than just media. And on the other hand, you see sponsorships, for instance our long-term views as &#x2013; so there you don't have that effect, so it is a mixed bag but television, printed media is it going down rapidly.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, good afternoon. I have two questions. I would like to get back on CapEx briefly. You said that the 700 million guided for '09 includes this overflow from expansion plans that were started in '07, '08. Does this mean that in '010 and '011 your CapEx could go materially lower than the 700 million guided for '09? That's my first question. My second question is on dividend. You could have kept your dividends stable and still be within a payout of 32 to 35% or be at more towards the high end of that range. Can you explain why you decided to cut your dividends? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the CapEx, yes, it's &#x2013; that leads to the question. If you deduct the overflow from, you can say well that's the new level of investment. And whilst you could think that, we would not pin ourselves to that because once more might drives opportunities or we would have to face replacement investments, which are absolutely necessary. But sure, the overflow of the year '08 indicates that there is room to maneuver going forward without giving a particular number in the next two years going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then secondly on the dividends, yes factually you're right. We could have maintained the $0.70 and stayed in the &#x2013; within the policy and what we propose now is within the policy as well. The reason why we have taken the point as low as possible in the policy is from a conservative point of view. When you look at balance sheet, you see that we have 8.9 billion in debt which we want to bring down, so we have more stakeholders than only shareholders and we share the burden bit equally.</p>

          <p>Ian Shackleton from Nomura. Just going back to the input cost comment that you made earlier on about it being flattish this year. Two questions around that. As we go through the year, presuming things get easier, you still have some hedging in place after the first half, so should we expect, sort of, much better situation in the second half? And how does it work across the regions? I mean, we know a number of your competitors are probably more hedged in Western Europe, unless it's in emerging markets. Does it work like that for you as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment on them at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, these are very differentiated and complicated picture because ultimately it's an add-on of different contractors, different durations and different geographies. So it is not something which you will see equally across the company. That's right. But I find it difficult and I am not able to specify and we don't want to specify that region-by-region or country-by-country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to clarify, when you do say flattish, that is taking account of any currency inflation in emerging markets where commodities are linked to euro, dollar as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, so what we say is that in euro terms, we go to an flattish situation that will mean for companies and that is the discussion we had with over the question of Nico, that obviously in Central and Eastern Europe for instance, you will see an important input cost inflation, because the devaluation of the local currencies.</p>

          <p>It's that the mitigation is in Central and Eastern Europe. There is where you have the most for Africa, you have much less. But it depends. Countries like Nigeria can decide to lower the malt intake. We have been able to deliver even a 100% malt there which is of a perfect quality. I am not saying we are going to do that, but we have that kind of mitigations in countries like Africa to go more for local sourcing. Central Europe, I have been pointing out already, we have our own malting operation in Slovakia. We can also, you know, if we sell in euros, amongst ourselves, it is finally coming into the &#x2013; our own operation. So you have a number of mitigation factors there. To give you a precise proportion is difficult at this moment in time.</p>

          <p>Hi, Edward Santos from Dynamo Capital. Just two quick questions. First of them is 2.5 times of debt to EBITDA is a target for 2009 or 2009 and beyond? And the other one just a follow-on on commodity cost, are you still 50% hedged for 2009 and if you could give us an idea of coverage for 2010? And the third and last one, in the non-core assets, which you list for an eventual sale, do you include the U.K. pubs as a non-core asset?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To start with last thing no, we see the pubs as absolutely core and SNP as core of our business. The net debt EBITDA is a level which we aim for as a company, but that is not something we will reach in 2009, but we have said we will focus on cash generation. We will pay down debt and the 2.5 times is a level we feel that that should be the level the company is at. And for the hedges, the 50% coverage was when we communicated around August. This level is now substantially higher in input cost are contracted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For '010 any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And for '010 I don't, well malt is a thing you do year-by-year and are some contracts, which are longer term contracts, but that is not a big part of the input cost. Our hopes are normally longer term contracts -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Long term &#x2013; Yeah, hopes are contracts from three to five years. And molt is yearly, and that depends on the crop essentially, on the supply and the quality of the crop. So that's &#x2013; that might be very volatile and that's for sure. Aluminum, we &#x2013; in today's we have to buy the aluminum for the producers. In the old days the producers was doing it himself. We kind of take positions on the aluminum market, so that is also depending of what the aluminum market will going forward. Though it is not as important than in Coca-Cola; Coca-Cola as a real big business in to canning, for us it's much lower.</p>
          <p>And glass, you have to reckon it's very much linked to the price of the energy, 22 to 25% of the price of the glass bottle is derived from the energy prices, and so most of the contracts even if we make them long-term, we have &#x2013; we variabilize the energy component in it as not to have too many occasions lost, I can say that. That's how it works, grossly, what I can say.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> JPMorgan Asset Management. Just going back to the S &amp; N acquisition model, can you remind us how many years it was going to take for you originally to reach your weighted average cost of capital? And it sounds like, you know, it could be another three years additionally to that to reach that target, particularly if you add in the extra restructuring costs. You know, the full in cost of the S &amp; N acquisition, I mean are we looking at 8 years before we actually reach the white?</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Nico Lambrechts, again. Just a question on Russia, I see you &#x2013; and you get that &#x2013; you put price increases of 4.5% percent through in the first quarter, was that the market leader that put them through and you followed?</p>
          <p>Follow-on question, when you did your impairment exercise you obviously had to make volume assumptions et cetera to get your MPV. Could you indicate what your volume assumptions were in the short-term and longer term for Russian market? And then there are shifts around the excise between spirits and beer in the Russian market, if you update us on that and how a move towards cheaper vodka et cetera could be impacted by excise changes?</p>

          <p>The 4.5%, which we applied, I'm not sure, if we were first or the others first, were you awake at 7 o'clock? I don't what they have said this morning. Honestly, I don't know.</p>

          <p>Okay. Autonomously it was not kind of an immediate follow-up, but it's obvious that we have &#x2013; we need to have the room in the market. We are a number three player. Our aim, of course, we have always said it is to increase our share. We have increased our share of market this year by a full percentage point. That's good news. But of course, in terms of pricing power in Russia, we are not as strong as if we would be in the leader position. We are not so strong as we would be in Poland or Slovakia or... So that plays a role of course. But I think this time took it on an autonomous movement of ourselves, yeah.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. The only think what I can say, last year we priced about 2% higher than &#x2013; and this year we haven't seen all the gap because of prices. We did it in February, and I haven't seen anything about that.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you also have, because we always talk pricing as a result and done our full portfolio brands. You don't do pricing as I put, it's on certain brands that you take, and that gives you a kind of an average pricing advantage you move. And so the decision is very much taken in our portfolio where other brands can support some price increases because the equity is improving, the demand is there, they're growing, and we feel you know, you can get a little bit more out of it. That's how we go about it.</p>

          <p>Hello. Two questions. Kris Kippers from Petercam in Brussels. Firstly, on the U.S. market, we've seen Heineken volumes going down significantly, whereas FEMSA is keeping up relatively well. How afraid are you of the situation between your big Belgium competitor and its negotiations with Modelo, concerning for example, cross selling possibilities in the U.S.? And secondly, could you confirm or not confirm officially whether Heineken is really looking at certain assets of this indebted competitor? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the growth rates between Heineken and FEMSA. Look, the price point of the FEMSA portfolio is absolutely not the same that from Heineken. Heineken has the price point of 50 above those activities which is &#x2013; it's much, much smaller than Heineken is growing from a lower base. So it has the excitement of the novelty but it prices at 30%. So and the last and the other brand the Kulta is pricing at difference of 10% above domestic max. So that is more of a mainstream brand if you will and a mainstream plus brand than really being a premium brand. That explains why, combined with very good marketing, these brands are growing at a rapid pace. And I think I explained already the two reasons why Heineken is under pressure, but that just to understand the mechanics and put them in their context.</p>
          <p>Now, the second part of your question relates to of course, speculations. And absolutely not up for me to comment. One has to say about the distribution system. Look, 65% of our volumes transit through mailer chorus &#x2013; now more and more mailer chorus distributors that is secret to nobody. And so this is traditionally how we have been distributing the beer in the United States. It is not in the interest of the distributors to be totally dependent on one sole supplier. We offered them a brand with anti margin and velocity. So we are very strong with our distributors. We have built relations over &#x2013; also decades they're all family businesses as you know the distributorship is protected by the U.S. system in most of the states, so going forward any combinations of competitors, yes they put more pressure in the market, but do not forget the independence of distributors and the power of the brands and the people behind that who build them.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as a general comment, we never comment on anything like business development or acquisitions, but let me make a general comment, as you have seen in the presentation, first priority in the company is cash generation, paying down debt that is from an financial point of view. But also managerially, we have a lot on our plate, we have 11 new markets, which we have to bring up to speed and increase the profitability and so that is where we will focus.</p>
