        <plist>
          <p>Shall we start? I think that it's exactly 10:30, so we can &#x2013; 9:30 in London, sorry. So we can start. Many thanks to all of you for being here with us today for our year-end results presentation. As usual, I'm here with the Deputy CEOs and with Ranieri de Marchis, our CFO and many other colleagues. I want to introduce you also Karl Guha who just joined us at the beginning of the year as a new CRO of the Group which is here with us as well. So also Karl can answer to some question if you want to raise a specific question to him.</p>
          <p>So we will go through the presentation and then as usual, we have the question-and-answer session. We've split the presentation into slides; the first one just to summarize our view on the solidity of our franchise to face 2009 challenges and then a detailed session on the results at the year-end and the fourth quarter as well.</p>
          <p>Starting from an executive summary, we had achieved the four billion net profit results in '08 and we have to really stress that remarkable resilience of the operating profit in Commercial Banking, largely due to cost efficiency. At the beginning of the year, we had started immediately a strong cost control activity and on a yearly basis, we are flat you would see at the forex and perimeter cost. So you would see the numbers that I think are quite good and those for the beginning of '09 in this perspective is quite good. It is also a positive on the revenue side but in the first two months of this year, we already reduced staff by 3,300 people which is quite a good result, is more or less two-thirds of the budget we had. So achieving the results before, we improved the cost structure for the overall year.</p>
          <p>Core Tier 1 is at 6.5 despite the dislocated fourth quarter and also considering the fact that some of the extraordinary activities were expected to happen have been not realized. So we think is quite a good result and you would see also the tangible book is stable quarter-on-quarter which is another very important element, of course before the capital increase. With the capital increase, then we have three billion out of the tangible book.</p>
          <p>We have also to consider the fact that having realized the deal at three euros in reliability for the remaining shareholders is counterdilutive. A lower risk weighted asset, thanks to decreasing asset, the stable tangible book is something we already said. You will see also again that we are reducing the assets before talking of the derivatives quite significantly; we're close to 6%, partially due to FX effect but significantly due to a reduction.</p>
          <p>The loan book is very diversified, with gross NPL growth which is still contained. We have been always conservative and you know that also in '09, we had a conservative view in terms of growth in NPL but the results at year-end are still good. Underlying profitability providing strong loss absorption capacity. This is another very important concept. We will go through the presentation, because when we consider our tangible book vis-&#xE0;-vis market cap really is implied the fact that there is an expected loss. If we consider the loss absorption capacity, you will see the number on how big is the cushion before losing money. So we think that really there is some misleading.</p>
          <p>2009, so far so good. Clearly we have the numbers for the first two months that have not been approved by the Board, so we cannot show you, but again the start is good, with positive contribution of all the division in January and February. And as I said, we had a continuous focus on risk control.</p>
          <p>Starting from the Commercial Banking, the Commercial Banking gross operating profit is quite stable despite of the difficulties of the fourth quarter and we have to be aware of that. And the cost income ratio is even been reduced if we consider the last quarter of '07 vis-&#xE0;-vis the fourth quarter '08. So really we think that this is quite an important number. The 12 billion operating profit clearly are a strong cushion to cope with a further slowdown. And really I want to thank all the colleagues in this area because really they've done a great job.</p>
          <p>This is the cost evolution in the fourth quarter. There is a small growth, 0.4%, which is a reduction in Western Europe and a growth in Central Eastern Europe, 4.4. I think it's very, very important to stress the fact that the growth rate in the third quarter in Central Eastern Europe was about 14%. In the last quarter, as we said, we have blocked the opening of new branches, but in the last quarter, since many contracts were already signed, we have opened 80 new branches in Central Eastern Europe. The process, as you can't &#x2013; not fulfill the contracts that you already signed. So this growth rate is showing a significant slowdown, is also implying an element of inflation. So the cost control is quite good.</p>
          <p>As you can see in the last quarter, we had a reduction of 2,874 people across the board, again both in Western Europe and in Central Eastern Europe. For instance, we are close to a reduction of 500 people in Poland. As I said, in the first two months of this year, we already had a reduction of 3,300 people.</p>
          <p>Talking of capital, we had a capital base that at the year-end considering pro forma the capital increase in terms of Core Tier 1 is 6.5% including negative available for sales reserves, but excluding benefit on own bonds. This is important, as you know, we are not reevaluating the liability side on the bond. Just to give you the number, on the Italian bonds, if you would have to reevaluate due to the enlargement of spreads and the lowering of interest, we would have a capital gain of five billion which is quite significant. We are not doing that; we don't want to do that just to remain since some of our competitors in terms of our accounting are reevaluating their liabilities.</p>
          <p>We had clearly a good contribution of the capital increase, 59 basis points; positive impact of retained earnings and risk weighted asset optimization. Risk weighted assets are down by 6.1%, as I said partially due to FX, but significantly due to a reduction. We have on the other side a negative impact on reserve from FX, 18 basis points and available for sale, five basis points.</p>
          <p>It is also important and I'm sure that there will be a question afterwards the fact that as you know by the European Commission has put a ceiling to the maximum accession to the government bonds you can use. The ceiling is for Italy 8% in terms of Tier 1. We are at 7.3 in terms of Tier 1. So we had room for an amount which is close to four billion.</p>
          <p>We are fully convinced also considering our stress test that we can go through the cycle with existing capital base. Also considering stress test, as I said, but clearly on one side we have to consider the competitive arena. There are many banks in different European countries that use similar instruments and we are competing with them.</p>
          <p>We are fully committed in order to continue to support the real economies where we are clearly being selective in terms of credit activity. So we end finally, clearly, we know that the market is looking for a buffer in terms of capital, so we'll apply for this instrument; have been authorized to start the negotiation with the Austrian and the Italian government up to four billion in terms of total amount. We think that this will provide a further flexibility to our capability on being competitive in the market. Again I would like to stress the fact that many European players consider, for instance, the French one have used a similar instrument. So we have to compete properly with that.</p>
          <p>If we continue to de-leverage the balance sheet, if you reconsider the total assets in the fourth quarter, we had splitted the total balance sheet considering derivatives and without derivatives. The derivatives went up because the NII volatility is increasing both assets and liabilities. So we have 120 billion in assets, 121 billion in liabilities, and if you could match and net as in other regulation is allowed, this time it would be significantly lower, clearly.</p>
          <p>The other asset, the financed asset, went down by 6%. We think that this is an important element of the activity, we are realizing in terms of de-leveraging of the balance sheet. If we consider the capital increase and the netting of hedging instruments, our leverage ratio would be 27, which is quite lower than the European average.</p>
          <p>In terms of tangible equity, you see the number. We went up by the three billion of capital increase. Before the capital increase we are exactly stable quarter-on-quarter, which we think is quite a good result.</p>
          <p>Where the leveraging is going on, as you can see, if we don't consider the derivative that went up for the volatility reason I was talking of, and the government bonds, which went up, and these are held as counterbalancing capacity for liquidity reason. So it is an important asset we must have in the balance sheet. All the other trading assets went down quite significantly; corporate debt securities, traded loans and others. So at the end, excluding the derivative, we have a reduction of 39%, which is quite a significant reduction. We continue to do so also in the first quarter, and we will continue as well in the following quarters.</p>
          <p>Customer loan, I think that this is another key element. Clearly we had a huge portfolio in terms of customer loan. We are perfectly aware of that. We think that is a very well diversified portfolio. Here we have the breakdown, I think is always important, because unless we lose the perspective, 48% is in Italy, 27% in Germany, 12% in Austria, 3.2% in Poland, and the remaining 10% is split in all the other countries. This is something important that you will see later on in other chapter but give you a view on how the split is in Central Eastern Europe in terms of a country that Moody's, also after the last revaluation of ratings is considering as higher-quality countries, medium-quality countries, and lower-quality countries. So again I think that this diversification effect, to date we know perfectly that the countries <mark type="inaudible" />. But we think that the diversification factor will come again as an important value-added element in the future.</p>
          <p>We had seen a deterioration mainly in watchlist loan. In some countries, also the classification system has been tightened quite significantly. As an example, in Russia, after seven days, you have to classify the loan as past due, so it's really a very severe classification system, and as you can see, the major growth is in the watchlist area. Again we had this growth related to the worsening of the macroeconomic scenario, and we have been pretty conservative in terms of classification; the classification is completely automatic so that there is no human intervention. This is important because unless you can have some doubt in terms of classification.</p>
          <p>I know also, and is important that, at least some of you were saying to me before some question on the classification system in Capitalia. Capitalia has technically disappeared and all the classification are made on our standard. This is very, very important. Nothing exists anymore of the old system of Capitalia. So everything is done with the standard of UniCredit, both in terms of capitalization and in terms of provisioning as well. This is an important element.</p>
          <p>I think that this chart are very important, this one and the following one. Here we have defined our loss absorption capacity. So what we have done, we have considered the operating income in the second half of last year excluding trading losses and the dividend we received from B&amp;C Foundation. So then we can discuss the projection of that. But this is &#x2013; and we have annualized this number. If we consider that and we add on the generic provision, we have the maximum level of provisioning we can have before losing money.</p>
          <p>At the Group level is 234 basis points. Just as a reminder, in '08, the loan loss provision for '09, the budget is higher, has been 62 basis points. So we are comparing 234 with 62. In Western Europe, the number is 185 basis points and in CEE is 539 basis points. In CEE, the number is below 100; is 80 &#x2013; is more or less 83, 84 &#x2013; 82, sorry, in '08. So is more than six times what we had in '08. This is very, very important, I think, because unless we have a wrong view, clearly we are conservative on Central Europe &#x2013; Central Eastern Europe. We are always saying is a very diversified area. As you can see at the bottom, 45.5% of our portfolio of loan is in countries that Moody's today is defining as higher-quality countries; 37.5 in countries that Moody's today is defining as a medium, lower-quality country; and 17% is in lower-quality country.</p>
          <p>In the country where we can have the highest impaired loan ratio, so we can go up in this country, in a single country up to 40% in terms of impaired loans; and then we have been conservative. So we have done a sort of an analysis country-by-country of the loss absorption capacity. In this country, we can have up to 40% before losing money in terms of net impaired loans. Clearly we have to go through the losses and so on.</p>
          <p>What we are doing in terms of cost efficiency refocusing and de-risking in '09 and which are the key priorities? First of all, we continue to work on the staff reduction. As I said, two-third of expected exits already happened in January and February. We had close to 3,300. We had identified different areas on which on top of the budget, which was already conservative. We can intervene and we are intervening in terms of having other savings and our marketing, travel, networking, training and consultants, the IT, which are altogether 45% of our G&amp;A cost.</p>
          <p>In terms of refocusing, the primary focus is on Commercial Banking. Also the redesign we have made of Corporate and MIB, creating the Corporate Investment Banking area. Cutting a layer in the organization is a bigger and stronger signal in this direction, is also the second bullet point. In CEE, we have changed completely the focus from growth to cost; exploit the cost flexibility typical of the region. And as I said, there is already a staff reduction as well in Central Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, we are going back to basics, simplify product and presence. So we are reducing dramatically the number of mutual funds we have and we are as well reducing the number of ABS in which there are Asset Management activities.</p>
          <p>De-risking, we continue to have a risk weighted asset reduction, tackling the exposure we have in unsatisfactory risk/return profile across all the divisions; also through a selective re-pricing. The re-pricing we are realizing is clearly significant, in line with the re-pricing we had on our liabilities.</p>
          <p>The Group-wide priority to loan quality is quite strong and there are no compromise, for instance, on Retail forex lending in Central Eastern Europe and we have a further reduction of non-core assets.</p>
          <p>So we entered 2009 with a Group franchise which is strong and is a key element in a difficult year. With a capital position which is already significantly improved, also thanks to the capital increase that has been realized and with a possible increase via the government bond issues. Tough actions ongoing on cost, as I said. Solid CEE contribution to Group results in the first two months and positive trading revenues in January and February. And this is another key element. So, so far so good, but clearly 2009 is not an easy year and we cannot under-evaluate that.</p>
          <p>Going more in detail on the result, this is a page which has been more or less already summarized by what I've said. The net profit is four billion which is 38% down year-on-year, so clearly is a reduced result vis-&#xE0;-vis the previous year but when we compare also with our main competitors, we have to say that we are satisfied with this result. The fourth quarter had a net profit of 500 million despite the difficult market conditions.</p>
          <p>Revenues in the fourth quarter have been slightly above six billion, is 15% down year-on-year. But this reduction is due to the negative number in MIB, 900 million of reduction year-on-year, impacted by crisis and market volatility. You will see later on why the Commercial Banking is up year-on-year by 2.9%, coming in terms of growth mainly from Corporate and CEE region with a stable Retail. We have to consider that in the fourth quarter, we have started to see a significant reduction of interest rate and Private Banking down due to lower assets under management.</p>
          <p>The costs are stable quarter-on-quarter. The provision are up to 1.3 billion and have been increased to face pressure on asset quality, particularly in MIB and some CEE countries. We had the benefit from fiscal deductibility of goodwill which has been offset by the non-cash items below the operating line, goodwill and investment impairments. You would see all the details pretty soon. So in our opinion, our earnings power remains strong, as business is slowing down but not plunging.</p>
          <p>Here are some figures that I don't want to go in details. I want now to only stress the fact that the operating costs are flat year-on-year if we normalized perimeter and forex. I think this is really a key number that show the capability we had of controlling cost in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>What had been the negative impact in the fourth quarter coming from the financial crisis? We had negative revenues coming from the significant dislocation in credit market post Lehman, cash, basis and convertible markets, and 60 million from customer care initiatives post Lehman.</p>
          <p>The available-for-sales impairment we've done in the fourth quarter: 182 million on Sabadell, 93 million on London Stock Exchange, and 100 million in other impairments. Provision, 70 million from customer care initiatives post Lehman. And then goodwill impairment for Ukraine and Kazakhstan up to 750 million. The total impact pre-tax is more than 2.1 billion in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The Commercial Banking is quite resilient. Year-on-year, the fourth quarter is up by 10% despite of the reduction due to the assets under management in Private. So as you can see, we had quite a positive contribution from CEE and Corporate. Retail is flat which is also quite a good result. We had a significant reduction in Asset Management and in MIB due to the market dislocation.</p>
          <p>Talking line by line, there is a significant positive contribution excluding dividends in the net interest margin. The dividends grew up significantly also because we received this dividend from B&amp;C Foundation, but it is before that. So we had a very positive contribution on this line.</p>
          <p>Net commissions are down mainly due to MIB, Asset Management, and Private Banking. Clearly, the assets under management have been reduced and is having an impact on that. Trading income has a negative result of 1.2 billion, and you will see later on where this number is coming from; we will see immediately. We had a significant impact of basis risk and credit spread widening, a negative number of 900 million; the impact of market disruption and volatilities on equities and principal investment which has been negative by 260 million. The other businesses continued to be positive, and so rates and forex and Investment Banking in the fourth quarter provided something like 600 million revenues which is quite a good result.</p>
          <p>In terms of operating expenses, the contribution is different of other cost and staff cost. The staff costs are significantly down, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. We had this growth of other costs, as I said, also the opening of branches in Central Eastern Europe to have an impact on that. You will see in '09 the top line number going down, so both for operating expenses and other cost and staff cost.</p>
          <p>Write-downs, we had this increase at the Group level. As you can see, the main data is due to MIB, which is related to the financial crisis, also partially due to certain classification of asset. So today, we have the continuous impairment test on the assets. But also with the new flows are impaired in fourth quarter, partially also related to the economic crisis. We had clearly a worsening as well in CEE region. We have to consider that in '08 in CEE, we had included as well two new countries, Ukraine and Kazakhstan where the provisioning level is significantly higher than in other countries.</p>
          <p>I was talking of non-cash one-off below the operating line before we had the &#x20AC;750 million of good impairment for Ukraine and Kazakhstan, the impairment of Sabadell and London Stock Exchange and others. So net-net, the tax benefit on goodwill has been more than offset by all the other impairment we had done. So the results are not affected by this positive and negative non-cash item.</p>
          <p>Now I've concluded my presentation. So we have a significant room for question and answer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alessandro Roccati from Fox-Pitt Kelton. Two questions, the first one is on risk weighted assets, if you have any targets for growth in 2009 and if you can give us some visibility in terms of effects of process legality. That's the first one and in terms of an increase or decrease of the market risk in the MIB division. And the second question is on sensitivity analysis on the cost of risk, you've given us the buffer and just wondering whether you can give us any figures in terms of a worse-case scenario for both CEE and the Western markets, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of risk weighted asset, we have an impairment target. In terms of de-leveraging, we are working on that already in the first quarter and you will see a further reduction. But we keep as something internally managed, also because today, as you can imagine, not easy to say to a portion of the world where we will go to reduce risk weighted asset. We are growing on small and medium-size companies. We had a reduction of non-core countries clearly and we had a presence in many countries that are non-core for us on their own book. We are also reducing the risk weighted asset in the MIB area. Process legality of Basel II is closed, could be in a worst case in a stress scenario of close to 60 basis points of capital and this is what we have analyzed. The loan loss provision in the stress test case are significantly lower than the one we have shown as a loss absorption capacity.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not provided the budget of the provisioning side. We cannot provide the stress test case. As I said, that's significantly lower than the one we've shown before. So said in other words, also in a stress test case, we will remain profitable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. It's Francesca Tondi from JPMorgan. And first question on MIB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>MIB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>MIB. Can we have a little bit more visibility? I know you've given some breakdown, just a little bit more color on effectively what are you taking down in terms of the assets, particularly at the ABS portfolio? How you've marked it down?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on MIB also, provisions, what exactly have you taken down? Have you touched at all your LBO portfolio or other credit positions? And on the LBO portfolio, can you just give us an update at least on the larger transaction how you see those performing? The some main &#x2013; initially I think you're looking a bit stretched. If you just can give us a bit of color on how things are going there.</p>
          <p>And the second question, more broadly on asset quality, what are you seeing in 2009 so far in the main Central European countries? What are you seeing in Italy in Retail, for example, versus Corporate? Who has softened the most right now with the significant economic slowdown? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks. First of all, on the ABS, when you look at the de-leveraging of the positions, we went down by about 600 million, all of them through amortization and repayments, is in line with the table that we showed in the past in terms of expected amortization. Of course, the economic cycle going forward may be a little bit more challenging, but we are for the time being still in line with the expected amortization. So around 600 million of repayments in Q4.</p>
          <p>In respect to the LBO portfolio, we went through some minor impairments on a smaller position. As you remember, we had about five billions of positions spread across more than 150 names. Some of them needed some small adjustment of the impairments there. When you talk about the larger positions, they are currently performing very well. When we look at their P&amp;L and their real access to &#x2013; of course, of the economic performance of the underlying companies, there has been no need for impairments for the time being. So we are continuing our existing policy of reviewing quarter by quarter the performance of the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Are any of these transactions in a closed, approaching to breaching the covenants or being very close to the covenants?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not that we know and we are very close to the big situation. So absolutely not expected for at least '09. So we will see going forward, but for 2009, we are not expecting any of those companies to be in breach of covenants.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on your ABS decline of 600 million is all amortization, any markdowns and evaluation that you had taken in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually had to take 100 million of a write-down on the 900 million you saw on trading losses, because we had to re-reclassify back some of the position because we had some derivative elements in the positions, and they were not eligible for full accounting on loan and receivables. Therefore, we had 100 million of markdowns because of this re-reclassification.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And on the asset quality on the Retail and Corporate?</p>

          <p>On asset quality on Retail and Corporate, what we're seeing, clearly, we're seeing a deterioration today. In terms of asset quality, I would say mainly in the mortgage area, Roberto, you can elaborate that, in line with what we have communicated in the second and the third quarter last year, you remember, so is absolutely none. And in Corporate, mainly in the small corporate in Italy, which has been...</p>
          <p>Then in Central Eastern Europe, clearly we are seeing a deterioration more or less across the board but with most significant deterioration in Ukraine, which is under the spotlight. We have analyzed all the major position. We have to be honest. In Ukraine, we are less worried then the market being there and seeing how things are proceeding, but clearly we have seen a deterioration.</p>
          <p>In Russia, as I said, there is a very significant tightening of the classification system. So we have to classify some municipalities with that we think will repay completely, but are reclassified. So clearly there is a deterioration that we are continuously following very carefully. The Italian economy, which do have some strengths, is also showing in the smaller companies some weakness.</p>

          <p>It was mentioned that effectively in the course of 2008, we've seen mainly a deterioration in terms of Retail portfolio on the mortgage side. Maybe the latest signals revenues of &#x2013; with lower concern in terms of mortgage, also in light of the fact that you have to remember that most of the stuff is variable rate mortgage and in light of the drops in EURIBOR, the average installment for the average customer has dropped by close to 30% between half of 2008 and now, while instead we are seeing as a later strength some of concern on the new business portfolio.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Domenico Vinci from Goldman Sachs. Just a couple of questions. One, on funding, if I'm correct, there's a quite significant dip in net interbank funding. Now I was wondering if this is due to the fact that there is some ECB facility coming or this is proper interbank funding and eventually if this is also due to some pressure you're seeing on the deposit base being in Italy or in Eastern Europe. And the last point is on your commercial real estate portfolio, that is quite large in size, do you think this can be an area of potential issues for you in catering 2009? What is your view in terms of what we should expect as potential market losses you can have on this portfolio? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the funding side, yes, the interbank does include all central banks, not only obviously the ECB but all central bank's activity, as you have seen the interbank acts actually on the liabilities side as franc. This has dipped by six billion. When you look at the deposit side, you need to take into account that the deposits are affected by FX, all of the deposits obviously coming out of the Central European countries are translated at year-end in FX rate, exchange rate, which having the profile that they had clearly has reduced significantly both the loans as well as the deposits.</p>
          <p>So in reality, the reduction of the balance sheet on the customer deposit is actually smaller than the one that you see. The rest is a result clearly of what has been the crisis in the fourth quarter, which clearly has affected some deposit taking, but to a much smaller extent than what you can see. So the 22 billion of deposit shortfall in reality is only 13 billion, because again, all of the rest is to be attributed to, as I said, FX translation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on commercial real estate, of course, we are concerned about the sector overall. Having said that, two things need to be taken in consideration, first of all, the diversification of the portfolio, and second of all, the fact that the vast majority of this portfolio which we classify as commercial is de facto residential usage. So therefore, while we are not underestimating the issues because there are a couple of situation in which we are watching and, to be honest, this is something that has been going for a while, there is nothing new that is coming up as a problem. So we think that considering also the levels of the drops we saw in this sector, we should be able to go through this cycle more or less in a confident way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning; Marcello Zanardo of KBW. I'd like to ask on growth and how you manage risk and mainly on net interest income, the positive side, which was the good surprise of these numbers. So the first question is, when you wrote the prospectus in December, you guided to a lower NII, Q4 on Q3. Especially also you said on the MIB division, there were some one-offs in Q3. Your LIBOR is going to fall. So the first question here is, have you started to implement since December a much stronger re-pricing policy all across the Group, given the asset quality deterioration? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question, on the provision side, your pre-provision profit is very big but we've seen in the watchlist going up by 27% in Q4, I think especially in Italy, also in Eastern Europe. And I've noticed that while provision went up a lot in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, rightly so, in other Eastern European countries, they actually went down a little bit Q4 on Q3. Is this because you committed to a guidance in the prospectus which was legally binding and therefore, you waited to have a better evidence of deterioration. So we should expect higher provisions going forward? Is it because in certain countries excluding the CIS, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, you actually saw some more recoveries coming in Q4? So just to have a flavor why in certain countries like in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Serbia, we saw provisions going down?</p>
          <p>Anyway, the stock is pricing almost Armageddon, so it's pricing very high losses, &#x20AC;1. So just wanted to have a flavor of why we saw provisions going down given that your re-pricing potential in NII is very high. You started to re-price and the economic deterioration is evident in many of these countries.</p>
          <p>And then maybe just to touch on the previous question, on the watchlist in Italy, just a little bit of flavor, how much of the deterioration in the Italian, I know that Capitalia has disappeared, but how much of the deterioration relates to the Capitalia ex franchise and how much to the old UniCredit franchise, or is it just across the board as I think it would be? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our re-pricing and net interest margin, clearly, the re-pricing is going on. We have to say very openly that in the first quarter of this year, the significant reduction &#x2013; although EURIBOR is having a significant impact on the net interest margin which was expected, we had said openly that because clearly having a strong contribution on the deposit base and going down interest rates, we cannot go to a negative interest rate on deposits. So there is this reduction and the re-pricing activity is going on, is quite important. For instance, the weight of loans with negative EVA has been significantly reduced because we are renegotiating many different contracts.</p>
          <p>It's important to say also that we monitor continuously splitting availability of credit lines towards small and medium enterprises were so surprising because we think that is important to have availability. So our customers are accepting and those in the project in Creditalia are re-pricing provided that there is availability, and we think that this is something also positive because it means that the relation with many customers is becoming more professional. Provisioning level in Central Eastern Europe, this is done country by country and file by file. So the provisioning which is needed is done. We are seeing, as I said, a deterioration across the board, but again this is exactly what our colleagues are thinking they need and has been also realized by the auditors.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> the restructuring and merging MIB with the Corporate division, and considering your plan on controlling or reducing risk weighted assets, does it mean that in 2009, we should expect from the MIB division on the net interest income a reduction versus the very high level you posted in Q4 and in Q3? Or does it mean that this is going to be offset potentially by lower wholesale funding cost that I guess the division is enjoying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, of course, the de-leveraging of, and de-risking of MIB will bear some consequences on revenues, both on net interest and trading results, although on trading results, clearly our aim is to go to a positive territory. So I think that yes, the answer is that net interest income will come down, because if assets come down, we are expecting &#x2013; partially is true that we are seeing some benefits in the margins, because if you look at &#x2013; for example, following up on the last points Alessandro touched, everything which has to do with also interbank short-term funding is getting rewarded in a better way. So that's the reason why you see also quarter-on-quarter better results in the net interest income of MIB. So overall, I think in absolute terms, a reduction, but in terms of stress and quality, we would expect a better position.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of risk weighted assets, of course, we are taking down the banking book activity, which affects directly our risk weighted assets. On the other end, everything which is RWA related will depend not only about the level of inventory, but also the level of volatility in the markets, and therefore, if we have lower volatility in the market, we may see also a reduction of risk weighted assets driven by RWA.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Jeremy Sigee with Citigroup. Just following up on the last question, are there any one-off or temporary effect that boosted net interest income in the fourth quarter? Were there any fundings in there that we should be aware of across the Group? Secondly, could you give us a couple of data points on your Leasing business? Could you give us the NPL ratio and the coverage ratio on NPLs to total loan, and coverage of provisions as a percent of NPLs?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, could you just talk a bit about your planned further capital-raising? I assume that the four billion is intended to be all Tremonti bonds or other preference share type capital. Could you talk about why it's lower than the five to six billion that a lot of people were expecting? And could you talk about what sort of private investors you hope to attract into that capital-raising?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can start from the last question. As I said before, first of all, I don't know where the five to six billion are coming from, to be honest. As I said, there are threshold that quite correctly in my opinion the European Commission has set on the maximum access to such kind of instruments in order not to distort too much the competition, and for us this threshold allow us in theory to go up to 3.8 billion. So we said four billion, we will be slightly above the 8% in Tier 1 ratio which is the level that has been approved by the commission for the Italian instrument.</p>
          <p>In Austria, the threshold is slightly different, would allow us to get at the maximum 2.7 billion in Austria. But we think that we will stay below that. As we have seen mainly in Austria, there is a significant cost reduction if private investors will invest up to 30 &#x2013; no, as a minimum, sorry, not up to but a minimum of the 30% of the intervention, and this 30% could come by 10% from the holding company which clearly in terms of capital would be not considered at the consolidated level. So if there will be a subscription by private investors by 20% of the intervention, the cost of the instruments will go down from 9.3 to 8%, and you don't have any restriction in terms of dividend payment. I have to say that the restriction on dividend payment is not a worry for us because we have the capability of funding dividends also with a reduced dividend coming from Bank Austria. But again the reduction of the cost could be quite interesting.</p>
          <p>As we have seen, AFTA has been able to find investors, so we will analyze also this opportunity. As I said before, the Board gave to us the power of analyzing all these options in order to optimize the position also in your interest. I think that these instruments are quite interesting, because are really contingent capital, so are bonds. So there are no government's rights. And there are some loss absorption structure as well. So clearly are not cheap in the sense that the cost is in the range of eight, 9% after tax. So yes, are nondeductible, so if we consider the actual cost of capital are good &#x2013; in a normal situation are slightly expensive. We think that we have to consider again in the interest of all our shareholders.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Leasing, I'm sorry, I don't have all the granularity of that, but we can get back to you. But I can give you, of course, basically the net write-downs on loans was 96 million for the full year. So which is part of the Corporate division net write-downs on loans, so you have to deduct it, but clearly one thing which is clear we have been quite aggressive in re-pricing the Leasing business, not only during last year, but particularly also at the starting of the new year. We have substantially increased the margins on the business. But we can get back to you with all the details. We'll take care.</p>

          <p>Anke Reingen from Execution. I have three questions, please. The first one is on capital and then I am just trying to understand if you think in 2009 your Core Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, you will be able to growth your Core Tier 1 ratio organically given the impact from risk migration you mentioned, for example.</p>
          <p>And then also trying to understand in terms of your regional allocation of capital and potential dilution of return. First, in terms of the capital from the government funds, will you only be able to allocate the Austrian funds in Austria? Or will you be able to reinvest the capital, for example, via Bank Austria and CEE?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on asset quality, can you please tell us how much in CEE in impaired loans, how much there as percentage of total loans and then potentially the coverage ratio? And then lastly on MIB, just to get a better feel of what we actually should expect for 2009, because I'm a bit confused what actually a run rate could be. Would you target to return your cost of equity in 2009? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the capital question, yes, we can use that as a normal course of business also on the CEE, the portion that we can take from Austria. I mean, I would like to point out that all of these capital instruments negotiations have not yet started, but informally let me put it this way, the capital injection in Bank Austria could be, as needed, redeployed in the CEE as normal course of business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know predicting MIB results is a &#x2013; would be quite challenging. I can only tell you that yes, we &#x2013; for the first couple of months we are substantially repaying the cost of capital, but to do a forecast for the entire year would not be appropriate given the fact that we cannot control mark-to-markets developments. But in terms of quality of assets and the ability of the underlying assets to repay, and the level of activity and our involvement in the general scope of MIB businesses, we feel confident that we can move towards that level. But as I said, first two months good, then we will see.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I captured completely your question. I think you asked for impaired loans in the CEE. Impaired loans in the CEE, net impaired assets in the CEE is 1.7 billion, and then you should add 239 million coming out from Poland, obviously, the CEE region, 239.</p>

          <p>I have three questions. The first one is on MIB. The negative basis rate has come back a lot in January and February, has tightened dramatically as all the convertible book. Have you kept the position at year-end and are you selling into this quarter or we should assume that basically results will be positively impacted just by the change in the negative basis rate?</p>
          <p>The second is on the deposits. You provide within the data all the breakdown of the deposit flow, the change by country geography. And basically what I've noticed is that the &#x2013; surprisingly, let's say, you have been affected probably more in Italy than elsewhere and I would like to understand qualitatively how much of the deposit outflow in the fourth quarter was driven by adverse press campaign on you for political reason versus operating trends? Sorry, I asked this question because the &#x20AC;4 billion net profit is one of the highest in Europe and it's funny to see one of the highest net profit in Europe year-end in such a high deposit outflow in your home country which I haven't seen elsewhere.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The net profit has been stated yesterday <mark type="inaudible" /> because &#x2013; sorry, a portion of this reduction &#x2013; the portion in Retail is really small. There is a portion that were deposits of the shareholders that invested in the cash use and have been moved to another financial institution. And then there is a portion which is the branch sale; it's 1.8 billion. We have sold branches. And finally...</p>

          <p>The third question is on this further authorization of the Board that's given you regarding this four billion additional bonds. Given the stress test you have provided, basically you can absorb up to an Argentina crisis on all the 30% NPLs and then 15, 20% losses. So as even in that situation, you estimate to make profits, let's say, over the next two, three years. Should I consider this four billion bonds as soon as you can you'll pay them back?</p>

          <p>Sorry. Going back to your question on basis, of course the first two months activity was very favorable, not only due to some good client activity, but also to exactly the effect of basis tightening and therefore to answer your question, yes, we kept the positions, so we are seeing good benefits coming in the first two months. On the other hand you should know that despite the net favorable results on the trading side, we saw a new phenomenon in the first two months of the year, i.e. the big enlargement of spreads of government bonds and public entity, regions, and so on. So covered bonds, so think about all the inventory that was trading at quite tight margins has been going through severe re-pricing, more in line with primary levels than the secondary ones. So net-net we have seen a positive benefit of that, but the first quarter also brought some readjustment and surprises in terms of pricing of risk across credit.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Domenico Santoro, Exane BNP. Just two questions, the first one is again on the interest income. I wonder if you could help me to reconcile the interest income in Retail and in Corporate, because as volumes are down, interest incomes are up in both the division? Probably I'm missing something in terms of re-pricing and so on, maybe as the colleague was suggesting before, there is some one-off that we missed. And then interest income is of course the guess point for 2009, I wonder if you could give us an estimate &#x2013; a guidance in terms of interest income growth for 2009.</p>
          <p>The second question is on Core Tier 1. If I had understood correctly, you expect Core Tier 1 without capital instruments &#x2013; government capital instruments to be up in 2009. So I wonder if you have considered any negative impact coming from currency, depreciation in your numbers and maybe can you tell us something about dividend. There will there be any dividend in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On net interest income in Retail, comparing to the previous quarter what we have effectively has been a positive spread effect on loans and on inflows of mortgages and then consumer loans that have offset the decrease in the side of deposit spread, but you have to remember that we had a strange Q3. I even said at the beginning of the quarter, we even had an increase in the level of EURIBOR. A lot of them instead changed the course. So the averages are slightly higher than one could think when you just look at the ending point. Now that's an important &#x2013; maybe &#x2013; I think it is a main element &#x2013; factor to keep in mind, because I don't remind instead any element of exceptionality on top of these elements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe it can help if go to slide 42 of the presentation. In a respectable corporate division, one element, which is not to be underestimated, you may remember the capital market days back in June we say that we were tackling EVA negative clients. If you look at page 42 you can see how the development of EVA relationship went from September &#x2013; December '07 to December '08 as an index base, 100% to 78%. So as time goes by you get the benefits towards end of re-pricing, particularly relationships that were very negative or just barely positive, so that's one element. You have the late effect of that coming in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in reality interesting enough &#x2013; sorry, before I said something that is likely wrong. In essence we had one exceptional item in net interest income in Retail, but there is an opposite effect, the loss on the part of Lehman &#x2013; sorry on the <mark type="inaudible" /> Retail participation, no, where it passed through the payments of the Lehman's reimbursement. They passed through after the total amount net of &#x2013; instead of slightly counterfeiting element on the opposite side is minus 54. So it really is minus 54 of exceptional negative net interest income item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing on capital, as I said, we cannot budget changes in exchange ratios because it's technically impossible. I said we have &#x2013; an increase in the Core Tier 1 with the exchange ratios we have in the budget, and also not considering available for sale reserve changes. This is important clearly because you cannot consider these elements. So the operating business, the one which we are talking of which I think is quite an important element.</p>
          <p>As we said, we are continuously focused on improving our risk weighted asset structure as well. In terms of dividend the budget is and the capital base is implied a dividend but the decision on the dividend will be taken at the year-end. This has to be clear so today we are not considering this option but we estimate that we will be capable to do so, but we are not considering that for the time being. Clearly, it's better to go to the year-end and we'll see.</p>

          <p>And how much? And the second would be on the government capital, what type of ROE do you expect you can get on this capital given the increased spreads that you're getting from new loans right now?</p>

          <p>Sorry, we have not provided the budget so I cannot provide the return on equity, and clearly today, the visibility on the future is not particularly high I think for all of us. So again, I think it's better to go to a more normal situation before providing numbers. And I think that really today it would not be proper to work on &#x2013; to say we will go up as I've seen for some competitor, or we confirm a pre-tax return on equity of <mark type="inaudible" />. So I think it's not proper today. And we think, and we are fully convinced of late that in the future there will be for all the system a lower profitability than the one we were expecting before the crisis.</p>
          <p>Also in normal time, I'm talking, because all of us, we will have more capital, maybe we're wrong, but we think that the business model mainly based on very strong commercial franchise with a significant retail customer base providing deposits. And a significant origination control will be a key element in order to be profitable and stable in the profitability, because clearly one of the key focus for all of us will be to have a business model where the volatility of the results will be significantly lower. Personally, and again maybe I'm wrong there, I think that our business model is quite proper in order to realize such kind of result.</p>

          <p>Yes, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay. The CEO of HVB is currently on tape saying that he expects for HVB more than 1 billion of provisions in 2009, which is again 760 million in 2008, which would bring more or less loan loss provisions to 62 bps versus 43 bps in 2008. If I apply the same proportion to the group, that obviously varies in statistic, I will get 90 bps. So I know you don't want to provide a guidance on that, but would you judge a 90 bps an exaggeration? Or you think more or less you would be in that range?</p>
          <p>The second point is on again loan loss provision. You said again that will be higher than 62 bps, and in the fourth quarter it was 86 bps annualized. So again we got close to this 90 bps the CEO in Germany is talking about. On goodwill, you impaired goodwill for 750 million mainly in Ukraine and in Kazakhstan and &#x2013; but in these two countries you still remain with some goodwill. Can you please explain how you decided for that amount? And what then you have in mind given you have 21 billion of goodwill in your balance sheet?</p>
          <p>Then the Board approved a reorganization, an internal reorganization with different aggregation of businesses. Can you please comment what implications you have in mind from this reorganization? What exactly you have decided and if that to touch in some way the strategy or the business development?</p>
          <p>And finally on the cost base, because you were talking already about the Forex impact in some of your numbers already in the fourth quarter, the devaluation in CEE is keeping going, this year, do you mind, give us an idea of how much just for Forex costs can come down? And if you think that overall the group can achieve a 5% cost decline this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I will start from your first question Anna, on cost of risk. We are in that range in terms of expected cost of risk for this year. Second question on goodwill, I think that I will leave then the floor to Ranieri, but in any case we went through all the cash generating unit in terms of goodwill assessment in a very conservative way. And we have confirmed that even in a conservative scenario the goodwill we have is sustainable. It is also important to say that for the goodwill analysis of Ukraine and Kazakhstan, it's something that has been made also by the second auditor of Bank Austria. As you know there is the savings association auditor in Austria that go through the audit of the numbers. But, I don't know if you want to add something Ranieri on to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean the process is exactly what Alessandro said. I would like to add that for Kazakhstan and Ukraine specifically because of the uncertainty on the markets, I mean goodwill is an exercise, impairment of goodwill is an exercise of what would be the profit next year or the year after, but what would be the fair value obviously of the company, which basically means an extrapolation, obviously of the future cash flows which determine our value. Specifically in Ukraine and Kazakhstan we also use a third-party auditor in addition to the auditors that obviously need to sign off on the books, which they have reviewed, those books again.</p>
          <p>So clearly the sustainability of the goodwill is not the profit of tomorrow or the next three-year plan, but is the fair value of the company, which in this case obviously is through the cycle as well, because obviously there are some expectations of recovery and there's no default, obviously an assumption embedded in this type of analysis. Said that clearly, it's an estimation process, and therefore with all the caution that I want to let's say have in this type of analysis. You also had a comment on loan loss provision, which I don't know whether you answered Alessandro, about the projection obviously on loan loss provision of the fourth quarter. Clearly the fourth quarter loan loss provision are higher than the average, so clearly as you look at the average of 60 plus basis points, fourth quarter indeed is higher, and I think is a basis also for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, is the answer I provided before. In terms of reorganization, the aim of this reorganization is to confirm what we have already said. That means the fact that our MIB structure is fully integrated in our inductivity for our customers so and we think that with this organization we become more similar to many of our competitors that do have exactly the same setup. We have also shortened the organization, because now on one side is the network, on the other side are the products that are put directly to sale so that there is a layer less in the organization in order to be closer to the customer base. And I hope that with that I have answered to your question.</p>
          <p>Talking of cost, the reduction we are having in Central Eastern Europe is not only due to the FX effect but we are also reducing staff. And so we are reducing the number of people there, which is important. You will see the number for the first quarter. Out of the 3,300 people, there is a portion, which is coming from Central Eastern Europe. So and this is a clear signal on the switch in terms of focus in Central Eastern Europe. But as we know, 80% of our cost base is in Western Europe, so you can reflect or even lowering the cost base only if you are capable to reduce the cost base in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, we have a significant reduction of staff as well. I have to say the Retail Division is the main contributor due to the efficiency we are having, thanks to the Capitalia deal and thanks to the redesign of the costing processes and so on and so forth. But also the other divisions are contributing. As we have seen, we do expect to reduce by 500 people furthermore in MIB. So it's on top of what we have already done. But also we have to cut the G&amp;A expenses and we have already a plan in order to work on all these policies under the supervision of Paolo Fiorentino.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Riccardo Rovere of Mediobanca. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to everybody, it's Riccardo Rovere here from Mediobanca. I have just a couple of questions. I just want to be sure I understood correctly some statements that Mr. Profumo did previously on the capital. Mr. Profumo, did you state that the reason why you are potentially issuing some four billion of bonds in government support has more to do with competitive issues rather than additional capital needs? This is the first clarification I want.</p>
          <p>The second, that under a stressed debt scenario, the current amount of capital before the issuance of these bonds would be enough to carry on the ongoing operations? C, that in your current guidance you are expecting to be able to pay a dividend in 2009? And D, that if you issue four billion of bonds, you will try to repay them as soon as possible? The second question I have &#x2013; just want to be sure I understood correctly all of these statements?</p>
          <p>The second question I have on NII, did I understand correctly that there is no particular one-off in Q4? And should we expect a sudden and dramatic drop in the coming quarters due to fall in EURIBOR, three months? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to the first question is, yes, to all of the sub questions you have raised.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you understood correctly what I've said. On net interest income we will see a lowering in the coming quarter due to the lowering of interest rates, as I said. As Roberto Nicastro was stressing, the fact that there is this lowering of interest rates is also reducing significantly the interest burden for many of our customers, improving the asset quality in the meantime, because if an installment of mortgages goes down by 30%, you can be sure you have a significant positive impact on repayments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Matteo Ghilotti of Equity. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. And just a question on the decreasing coverage of impaired loans, because I have let's say had some negative comments from some clients that noticed this decrease as a sign that in theory you needed to post more provisions in the fourth quarter. So if you can just elaborate on the reason why there was a, let's say, decrease in coverage in 2008 compared to 2007, sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. A significant portion of the decrease is due to the fact that as has been noticed by many colleagues here, there has been a growth in watchlist of SCP NPL. So the weighted average is clearly different, because if you have more watchlist and NPL you reduce by definition your coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>The second thing is that there has been a write-off of past due interest. In Italian, we call inter&#xE9;s de demora. I hope that the translation is a proper one, that we're fully provisioned, provisioned 100% and this is 227 million that has been written off in Croatia and Bosnia because we're fully provisioned, so it's been written off. Then there has been a release in Germany of a provision on the RER portfolio, which as you know has been fully repaid. And so we didn't have any more the possibility of keeping this provision.</p>
          <p>And finally, there is what I said before this very restrictive policy in classification rules that has been changed in Russia on the watchlist having in &#x2013; on the past due, not watchlist having in the past due customers with seven days delay. Finally, a portion of the growth of our NPL in Italy and in other countries is due to mortgages. So more or less one-half of that mortgages and leasing where, again, the coverage ratio is lower because we have the collateral. So all the sum of that is bringing to this reduction of coverage ratio.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Alberto Cordara, of RBS. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. A couple of questions that are related. The first one is can you quantify the P&amp;L impact of IAS 39 in the Q4? I haven't seen an indication in your slides. And the other question is, is it possible to have an idea of how you book your stake in Mediobanca? I would have expected to see a write-down of the stake in Q4, but we haven't seen an impairment, so I don't know if you can clarify on this. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The impact of IAS 39 is 1.469 for the fourth quarter. I would like to stress here a very important element because this is in theory, if we talk of this impact, we are talking of what is the mark-to-market of the portfolio and as you know, the market significance, this is the reason why has been changed to IAS 39. Aligning the European banks to the American one, because this was already feasible in U.S. because the market price are not significant.</p>
          <p>We went through an analysis in the ABS portfolio, re-evaluating the ABS portfolio on the base of a model considering the &#x2013; as you know, 80% of the portfolio is AAA, AA, so we went through an analysis with the PDs of Moody's for the existing rating. And the value of the portfolio with a mark-to-model is 1.2 billion higher than the book value we have. Okay? This is very important since many banks are still evaluating with a mark-to-model system, I think this is a key element unless we see the mark-to-market coming from your question of the impact of the IAS 39. We are not seeing the other side of the coin, which we think is not the right perspective.</p>
          <p>Mediobanca, Mediobanca is classified as a strategic participation and we do not expect to have a devaluation of the Mediobanca stake.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Eugenio Cicconetti of Dresdner. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Good morning to everybody. Mr. Profumo, I have a very simple question. What is the level of Core Tier 1 that makes you confident considering the current scenario as well as your profile as a bank? Because there have been a lot of discussions in the last six or eight months, was the good level or enough Core Tier 1 of 7%, 8%, 6.5. So I would like to have your view on this? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Many thanks for your question. As I said before, the current level of Core Tier 1 is not the target we have because we said very clearly that, with the actual market condition, we think that a proper level is between seven and 7.5%. But what I said before is very important. With the actual level and considering a stress test we did &#x2013; in reality more than one stress test we did, we can go through this cycle with existing capital base, because we have always to remember that the level above 4%, which is the level of &#x2013; minimum level of capital, is a cushion against unexpected events as is defined. And we would remain in &#x2013; also in a stress test case above 6%, because we have the loss absorption capacity we have explained before. So the minimum level is 4%. We did a stress test to consider 6% as a minimum level, and in a stress test case considering our loss absorption capacity, we would remain above that level.</p>
          <p>Then clearly the market is asking for something different. Now I think that there has been a sort of circular element of market and partially authorities. I think that what has been defined by the European Commission talking of this intervention is very important, because this has not been considered enough. The European Commission put a ceiling, not a floor, because they said you can ask up, in order to, up to a certain limit, including I think that all the authorities also, the political authorities are quite interested in having a stable market. They don't want to create an unfair competitive or a unlevel competitive arena. So again, I think that clearly the level of capital required in the future will be higher. We have stated clearly that we want to be higher than where we are now, which is pretty clear. I think that also the question I've received before on what is the capital plan in order to repay the bonds are aligned with this view.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Two questions. The first question is on Core Tier 1 capital, and I'm just a bit surprised by the amount of Core Tier 1 capital, because given that the tangible book value remain more or less stable, but the Core Tier 1 capital didn't, despite the fact that you renegotiated the Pekao porter, and also you sold Treasury shares in Q4. So if you could explain a little bit what has happened? If there's some additional deductions which I don't see from the balance sheet?</p>
          <p>Related to this, just I would ask to be a bit more precise on the pro-cyclicality impact, you stated 60 basis points under stress case scenario. Related to this, I would like to ask over which timeframe and whether Capitalia has already been switched into the advanced methodology as of Q4 or not yet, and what assumptions you've made on the capital floors, obviously to state the pro-cyclicality impact? The second question is if you can disclose the inter-Group credit line to your subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Russia separately, ideally? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The capital walk, I think there are two basic elements that need to be taken into consideration which, obviously are the result of the market turmoil. One is FX, it's not only the effects of the translation of the equity of the single, let's say, companies that we have in the sea, but it's also the returned earnings from those companies. The returned earnings according to the current rule and translated at year-end FX rates, not at average FX rate. So in that sense there is a further compression of capital.</p>
          <p>Second, there is obviously the AfS reserves that we were talking before, not only on equity but also on bonds, which effectively go to the deduction in terms of the capital. So if we look at those two elements are effectively, what I would say, the two main unusuals, if I can call it this way vis-&#xE0;-vis let's say beginning of the quarter, fourth quarter expectations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pro-cyclicality, as you can see clearly from a Basel II standpoint obviously you get the pro-cyclicality event, but I would say pro-cyclicality will be more a forward element than actually a natural element of year-end. As you can see, our risk weighted assets were 112 million, Basel II obviously and that also were in reduction, in reality vis-&#xE0;-vis what we had at the end of the third quarter. We have the full benefit from Basel II in terms of floors.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to everybody. I have two questions. The first one, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that in the last quarter, you also had a positive impact in terms of net interest income coming from the widening of the net interbank position? So my question is, do you consider such a level of net interbank position as something sustainable in the future at proper level? Or is it something that you are already trying to decrease going forward? The second question is a simple one, is relating about the fiscal treatment of the dividend that you are paying through shares? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The net interest income has not gone up because of interbank exposure, because the operational division improved the net interest income in the fourth quarter. So it is not related to the holding company position, it's related to the business lines activities and is due partially to the fact that at the beginning of the quarter in October we had the peak on the EURIBOR. We have to consider that, because that's been the highest level ever.</p>
          <p>So there has been a significant contribution in the Retail division and on the fact, as we were saying before, that there has been a re-pricing. Alessandro was showing, for instance, on how went down the negative EVA customers in the Corporate division. So the main driver in '09 you have to consider that the EURIBOR level is the lower level. So we had a completely reverse effect. We are re-pricing. We have also to consider the fact that you have in many case the re-pricing you have a timeframe related to the maturity of the revision of the pricing because there are committed lines. So I think is an important element.</p>

So do have exactly and then, as you can imagine, the fiscal treatment is different per different customer and different shareholders. But is &#x2013; we have to consider that that is a capital increase, free capital increase, so it's a &#x2013; are shares that you are receiving for free. So this is an important element.</p>

          <p>Can I make a follow up, just because maybe I didn't understand properly, but my point is, in the last quarter, having seen the interbank position going up sizably, is not a way to make funding at a cheaper cost compared to what you would have done as an alternative going to the market and issuing bonds plus, I don't know, 190, 200 basis points?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have very strict rules in terms of maturity matching associated with a &#x2013; of matching or mismatching associated to the balance sheet. So within those limits, obviously we can use &#x2013; or I think that's what you're referring to with this question, in terms of funding short term, what could be longer-term assets. We have not changed those limits and we are within those limits also in the fourth quarter. If your question is would that net interbank position actually shrink in 2009, clearly that will be a function, also of the de-leveraging exercise and the risking associated with that which eventually will reduce the funding needs of eventually of the Group.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out that throughout fourth quarter we have been issuing bonds, in this case commercial, to the commercial network. And at the beginning of January we also issued one billion of the five-year bond in institutional markets. So any time there is a window also in the institutional market, obviously, as part of our funding plan, we'll access the market appropriately.</p>

          <p>We have never communicated that. Since the loan to deposit ratio is improving, we have a reduction of this exposure.</p>

          <p>Okay. So many thanks to all of you. As you know, we will approve the first quarter results the 12th of May and we will have a video conference &#x2013; sorry, a conference call because I'm not sure that the video conference can be effective as the teleconference in terms of hearing. And we'll have the AGM, the 29 of April. So many thanks for your attention.</p>
