          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the presentation of Telenor's Results for the Second Quarter of 2008. My name is Scott Engebrigtsen, and I have the pleasure of guiding you through this morning's presentation.</p>
          <p>We hope that everyone has the material, that we have made available, that is our press release, the quarterly reports, and a copy of the presentation to be used here in a minute. And this can also be found at our website on telenor.com.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, this morning, we had some difficulties in publishing the quarterly report on our website. And it was in place approximately 7:30, and we apologize for this.</p>
          <p>You can watch this recording live, or in recording. This transmission live or in recording on either the Internet, or on a mobile phone. And you may also send in your written questions during this transmission. And for information on these alternatives, please see our website.</p>
          <p>There will be, as usual a Q&amp;A session, directly after the presentations. First, here from the audience present then from the ones participating on the phone. And eventually, the opportunity to do individual interviews.</p>
          <p>And now, let's take a closer look at the second quarter results. And to present the figures today, we have our CEO, Mr. Jon Fredrik Baksaas and our CFO, Trond Westlie.</p>
          <p>I'll leave the floor to you, Baksaas.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Good morning everyone and welcome to this second quarter 2008 presentation from Telenor.</p>
          <p>In this second quarter, we saw 7% underlying revenue growth, combined with a stable EBITDA margins. However, the appreciation of the Norwegian kroner still puts pressure on the reported revenue growth. As we've seen a continuous strengthening of the kroner also in this quarter.</p>
          <p>The mobile activities, both in Norway and in Kyivstar, in Ukraine speaks out, as quite good reported figures on this second reporting. They continue on what was shown in the first quarter, both of them.</p>
          <p>And in particular our mobile operation in Norway has continued the positive trends from first quarter, delivering a solid organic growth in retail revenues of 7% in this quarter alone, which is some notches up -- couple of notches up compared to first quarter.</p>
          <p>The 10 CCs seen in the previous quarter with increased inflationary pressure, has continued, in particular, in Bangladesh and Pakistan and Thailand. And in these three countries, we also see that this has a certain effect on the volume development, whereas the inflationary development in Ukraine doesn't seem to have the same effect as of now.</p>
          <p>CapEx this quarter is affected by the 3G license in Malaysia and 4G license in Sweden. The number of total subscriptions in the Telenor operations are still growing. We added around 6 million subscribers in this quarter, reaching 153 million altogether. And the main contributors to this were Bangladesh, plus 2.5; Pakistan, plus 1.4; and Thailand, 800,000.</p>
          <p>In my presentation on this today, I will focus on Norway, Serbia, Bangladesh, Thailand and also give some words about broadcast, which has some interesting figures, as well in this quarter.</p>
          <p>And I'll start with the Norway. This is the first quarter without Tele2 wholesale revenue, which was around NOK130 million in Q1 last year -- sorry -- which was NOK130 million in Q1 this year and 320 in second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Despite of this, our mobile operation in Norway delivered strong results for this second quarter. The positive trend, as I mentioned, has continued and the growth in mobile broadband users continues. We have reached now around 200,000 data users in mobile in Norway, out of which around 50%, 100,000 is a high-speed data users. So the growth in this market is still promising.</p>
          <p>We're pleased to see that from July 2008, we finally have reached symmetrical mobile termination rates between Telenor and NetCom. However, it seems to remain a special feature in Norway that there will be others that will enjoy asymmetric mobile termination rates, possibly over the period, as there is a suggestion from the regulator to maintain that for another period of time.</p>
          <p>In fixed Norway, the revenue decline is explained more or less by regular factor that we saw last year, mainly that of reduction in DSL lines and whole revenues, not fully compensated by increased broadband revenues.</p>
          <p>In this quarter, we do not have specific price reductions. The decline in wholesale revenue is <mark type="inaudible" /> caused by the crisis actually for leased lines that we introduced in fourth quarter 2007, related to DSL and local loop.</p>
          <p>This price reduction had a negative impact of around NOK16 million in Q2 2008. And we see that the DEM revenue decline is then back on the three notch, namely that of 3.8%. We continue to see these declining trends on the Telephony and we expect this revenue decline to be around 3% for 2008 as a full year.</p>
          <p>CapEx is driven by increased demand for capacity from business customers and mobile operators in particular. Although there is increased demand for capacity, represent challenge, we maintained our operating cash flow ambition of -- which is around 3.5 billion for fixed line operations for the year as such. This, of course, requires that we continue our emphasis on cost efficiency measures, in the same way that we have executed them over the last years.</p>
          <p>I will then turn to Serbia. Serbia has had a very good quarter, the way we see it. The estimated market share has remained stable at around 39%. Competition is a bit more stabilize than what it was a couple of quarters ago. After the turbulence following the entry of the third operator in Q3, 2007.</p>
          <p>Revenues in local currency increased by 10%, primarily due to subscription growth and continuously improving the contract ratio part of the customer portfolio.</p>
          <p>EBITA in local currency, improved by 23%, mainly due to increased revenues, lower sales and a more efficient use of marketing expenses and handset subsidiaries. This is the market in our portfolio activities, which have the lowest average minutes per users, which in our mind means a potential of increased usage going forward.</p>
          <p>Let me then move on to Bangladesh. In Q3 2007, we described that Bangladesh has a very challenging environment for the year and periods ahead of us and so it is. There is a double-digit inflation rate and the increased price in fuel has an impact on the spending powers of that economy. And with the additional political situation, this market is still considered a challenging market.</p>
          <p>We had a record subscriber growth in this quarter, driven by brand repositioning and promotional campaigns, increasing the market share for Grameenphone as such by one percentage point, up from 45 to 46%. We passed the deadline for re-registrations on 31st of May and Grameenphone has barred about 600,000 subscribers currently included in the subscriber base. The bulk of these subs are expected to be churned out in normal course.</p>
          <p>There was made a provision of NOK150 million for potential compensation for GP's -- Grameenphone's involvement in international call termination through VoIP traffic prior to February 2007, as has been mentioned in media articles during this last quarter. We then seem correct to include this as an accrual at this stage.</p>
          <p>Average revenue per user in local currency has decreased over the month, because of the growth of number of subscribers, but also because we have repositioned how we charge by offering discounted rate nighttime. And this has taken the average price per minute down, but it has also delivered a better network capacity utilization over the 24 hours cycles.</p>
          <p>However, adjusted for the provision and the regulatory compliance costs imposed on all operators, which amounts to NOK18 million in the case of Grameenphone. The underlying EBITDA margin for Grameenphone in the period was 43%. My concluding remark in Bangladesh is that the IPO process is progressing and is expected to take place this year.</p>
          <p>We then move over to DTAC in Thailand, we had the DTAC figure being presented a couple of days ago. We expect that DTAC has been able to maintain its revenue market share of around 30% in second quarter. Second quarter is DTAC's -- is normally DTAC's weakest quarter, due to many holidays and startups of schools.</p>
          <p>However, this quarter DTAC has unfortunately not seen the same usual usage pickup in June and the beginning of July, as had been seen in previous years. And this was also clear in the DTAC presentation two days ago. This added on political uncertainty and inflationary pressure, are effecting consumer spending and business, and general confidence in business development.</p>
          <p>An agreement coming out of the blue, so to speak, with previous service provider taking back to 99 -- mid-90s -- has resulted in a 400 million settlement affecting both revenues and EBITDA for the quarter as a one-timer for DTAC. Despite this challenging environment, we managed to maintain the underlying margin of 32%, boosted by a positive traffic balance, generally speaking, for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In Asia, we have reshuffled our managers, Mr. Arve Johansen, who has been Senior Executive Vice President and Head of region Asia will now return to Norway. Mr. Sigve Brekke, the Head of DTAC, will take over his position as responsible for the Asian region. And Tore Johnsen, unknown name for many in this room, will now move from Pakistan to Thailand and take over DTAC.</p>
          <p>And we're happy to also mention that Mr. Jon Eddy Abdullah is back in the Telenor ranks after a couple of years with DiGi, and he will then join in and become CEO of Pakistan and this is will take place right towards the end of August.</p>
          <p>I want to thank both Arve and Sigve on their performances and look forward to cooperate particularly in Group management in the years to come.</p>
          <p>I will then conclude on unit level with some comments on broadcasts. It is a 16% revenue growth year-over-year for broadcast in this quarter. This is a high revenue growth figure, and it's driven by equipment sales because of high definition TV, the high definition set up TV boxes that has been marketed and sold during this quarter.</p>
          <p>And it's driven by the fact that motoring is at its peak maintaining both the digital terrestrial system up and running as well as the analog system. And as we know, the analog system will be shut down period area-by-area as we go forward.</p>
          <p>But it is as a result of these investments , of taking this high definition TV position, that the margins in this quarter is suffering from the cost of building this position on top of the rights cost associated with the euro 2008, which has been expensed by NOK85 million in this quarter alone. Knowing that we will enjoy the benefits of having this develop customer base for a quite a longer period in that. We then expect that the margin will be back in the 20s in the coming quarters of 2008.</p>
          <p>To conclude, I will just give some rough comments on the other geographical areas. In the Nordics, in Sweden the 4G license was acquired by NOK450 million through an auction process. And this of course, ensures that we, in Sweden, will be able to participate in the mobile broadband -- anticipated to be a promising market going forward from here.</p>
          <p>In Denmark, the Tele2 migration all subscribers is now completed and we expect margin pick-up in SONOFON and CBB in the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>In Asia, DiGi reported yesterday, very good figures from DiGi. However, seeing also that in Malaysia the competitive situation might be developing in such a way that DiGi have to -- has to sharpen its activities going forward.</p>
          <p>In Pakistan, we have increased the market share solidly, so that we can say we are at 20% plus. We are also for the first time seeing an EBITDA margin of 20% and some of you has been expected that from previous quarters. So, now it's good that its here.</p>
          <p>In Central and Eastern Europe, Hungary is still struggling from the ring effects of -- coming from the lowering of interconnect rates and the roaming prices. And if we conclude with where I started to say how Kyivstar is performing, there is an excellent quarter from Kyivstar. Also for this second quarter 2008 seeing a margin close to high 50s, low to 60s and a very solid market performance in general compared to the other operators.</p>
          <p>And with those words, I leave the floor to Trond to take us through the financials and our guiding.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fredrik. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Now, I will go through the second quarter 2008, Group figures. As Fredrik said, we had an underlying growth of 7% this quarter from last year, going from NOK26.3 billion to -- then nominally NOK27.2 billion that's 2.4% nominal growth.</p>
          <p>If you look at the numbers on the slide that are put up on the development, we've put up a slide, the fixed currency effects and having currency effects at the end, showing that Asia is growing with approximately NOK1.2 billion. The major contributor is DTAC and the major part there is, of course, the settlement of the agreement -- of the service provider agreement from 1997 with 400 million of the 512 that DTAC has improved it from last year.</p>
          <p>In addition, both Pakistan improved with more than 360 million, DiGi with 220 and Grameenphone with 114 in -- than -- that is compared more underlying numbers not the reported Norwegian kroner.</p>
          <p>On the Central Eastern Europe, we have a growth of 600 million. The major contributor there is Kyivstar, but we have positive developments also in Serbia with &#x20AC;600 million.</p>
          <p>In the Nordic, we have a slight decline in Norway, both in fixed and mobile. And then Denmark and Sweden is slightly improving. Broadcast picking up with the growth that Fredrik just mentioned, and other business with 482.</p>
          <p>And then we have the currency effect from last quarter, actually then offsetting the growth of 9.2 -- from 9.2% down to the 3.4% as a result of the currency effects year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Going then to the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. You'll see that the development here goes from the 9.3 billion nominally to the -- 9.254 to the 9.317 and that's lower than 1% nominal growth.</p>
          <p>And we also have the fixed currency effects here, showing that Asia is improving with 625 million year-over-year and the major contributor there is also DTAC. But in there is also the accrual from Bangladesh of 150. So the net effect on the non-period effect or the one-off effect is 260 million in the Asian region. And so the Pakistan is -- has a positive development as well as India has a positive development year-over-year.</p>
          <p>In the Nordic or on the Nordic part, you'll see that it's a decline of 250 million year-over-year and it's both the fixed as well as in mobile. Mobile, is a result -- and the major result of mobile is the Tele2 contract. Fredrik mentioned that the revenue base of Tele2 in second quarter 2007 were approximately 320 million.</p>
          <p>We see as positive trend the retail revenue and other revenue have compensated for more than two-thirds of that loss in this period. So, we almost recoup most of that revenue loss, we recouped in other sources of revenue.</p>
          <p>The Central and Eastern Europe almost 400 million up. The main contributor there is Kyivstar. And that the element here is also that the major part of Kyivstar is the currency effects.</p>
          <p>Coming down to the currency effects, actually offsetting 90% of the underlying revenue growth or the EBITDA growth with 500 and -- more than 570 million, leaving us then at the revenue growth of less than -- or EBITDA growth of less than 1%.</p>
          <p>Going then to the CapEx, we've divided this slide into ordinary CapEx as -- and added on the licenses. We see that the trend year-over-year goes from decline to NOK4.8 billion from 5.2. You'll see that the decline comes in Asia, specifically in Grameenphone and also in the CEE.</p>
          <p>Both Kyivstar and Serbia have low CapEx spending this quarter and it's probably lower than the normal on the average. So I do think that second quarter would be sort of exceptionally low, relative to the CEE region.</p>
          <p>And we also see that there are some additional CapEx spending in the Nordic, basically in fixed side in Norway, as a result of the demands from business and mobile sector on the fixed side, as well as the 3G as well -- and as well as the HSDPA development in Denmark.</p>
          <p>Then we are coming to the 3G license in Malaysia, as well as the 4G license in Sweden, getting us to the total CapEx this quarter of 6.4 billion or 23% CapEx to sales in total.</p>
          <p>Spending a bit more time on the CapEx to sales ratio. We introduced now a slide that goes three years back and we see that development of the ratios in the Nordic region goes from 7% up to 10% of CapEx to sale. That is mainly driven by mobile broadband as well as the 3G license in Denmark, as a result of a slight increase in ratio in the Nordic.</p>
          <p>Going through the CEE and Asia, we see that it is a declining ratio over the period. We see that Central Eastern Europe goes from 20% -- 27% CapEx to sales ratio down to 12. I did mention though that the second quarter might be a bit on the low side relative to a trend basis, but it still shows the trend going downwards.</p>
          <p>As well as Asia going down from 43% to 30% from 2006 to 2008. If you then compare that with the columns that we have on each of the regions, it shows that of the total mobile CapEx spending in the second quarter we've spend 65% of our total spending in Asia. And that is due to the simple fact that it is in Asia where the growth is and that is where we're capturing that growth for the future earnings of Telenor. So even though the ratio is still high, it is positive trend in the ratio as well as we are spending quite a bit as a result of capturing basically 100% of our customer growth in this quarter.</p>
          <p>And we see that the ratios in the Nordic is about -- we spend about 21% of our mobile CapEx and that is driven, as I said, mostly by the mobile broadband as well as the 3G license there in Denmark. And the average of spending is 14% of our total mobile CapEx spending in the second quarter. This is just to give you an overview of both trend and the allocation of the resources that we prioritize relative to how to spend our CapEx for the future growth.</p>
          <p>Going then over to the reported P&amp;L and the previous number has been on the pro forma basis including Kyivstar in the numbers. Here Kyivstar is reported as associated company on the associated lines, but we have to also say that in second quarter 2007 Kyivstar was not included as a result of the injunctions that were in place in that time.</p>
          <p>So I'll go through it line-by-line. Revenue increases from 23.1 billion or 23.2 to 23.8, an increase of approximately 3% in reported numbers. EBITDA 7.2 billion, leaving us at earnings before interest and tax on 3 point -- almost NOK3.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Then we have the associated company at 1.8 billion. You'll see that it's a big increase from last year. It's -- and the effect of that is that Kyivstar is included this year and were not included in number of last year. So the growth of 1.50 billion is mostly due to the Kyivstar numbers.</p>
          <p>The other associate number in the 1.8 is of course VimpelCom and as a result of the -- on the currency changes or the currency effects in the first quarter numbers, we have also corrected the VimpelCom numbers in second quarter as result of the unexpected profits made on currency in the first quarter of VimpelCom results.</p>
          <p>Net financial cost of 520 million and profit before tax on 5.2 million, leaving out net income to Telenor at 3.5 after minority interest, so the earnings per share is 2.11 this quarter.</p>
          <p>The net debt increases from 35.7 to 41.6 and that is mainly due to the dividend payout. If you go through the sections, you see that the CapEx spending is 4.7 in cash outlay. And the major difference between the cash outlay and the recorded CapEx is the non-cash investment on the 3G license in Malaysia of approximately 1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>The interest and taxes paid is 2.2 billion, and dividend payout is 6 billion. Telenor has paid out dividend of approximately 5.4 billion and the remaining 600 is dividend paid to subsidiaries, now to minority shareholders in subsidiaries. And then we have adjustments on accruals and then the earnings leaving us at the 41.6 billion in net debt.</p>
          <p>Moving then to the outlook for 2008. We have revised our revenue growth forecast on reported figures. Reported figures is on the top-line, excluding the Kyivstar numbers. And we have changed that from a guidance of around 5% to around 3%.</p>
          <p>The reason for doing that is basically the effects that we see mostly in Thailand and Bangladesh, but that has to be added with the currency. So the underlying effects from the Asian region and currency effects has an even proportionate effects of the decline from 5 to 3%.</p>
          <p>And then our remaining two ratios, on EBITDA margin and CapEx to sales, remained the same, and is also includes the licenses. But as a result of including the licenses in this guidance, that means that we are probably on the -- more on the upper rates than the downer rates -- on the down rates only around 20%.</p>
          <p>And my last comment to this is of course that we base this outlook on the currency situation as of June 30th. And as a result of the development in currency and also the development in Kyivstar, our underlying assumption of the revenue growth is remaining the same from previous. That means that even though we have a reported -- on the outlook on the reported numbers is going down, our underlying assumption of an underlying growth of 6% remains the same. And that concludes my part of the presentation.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Well, are we exploring the world? The buyback question that you raised is, of course, has been with us in previous quarters. And we have in previous quarters executed the buybacks carefully, trying to balance the existing debt ratio on the balance sheet, up against the share price basically. And then we will take a new revise look on that. Despite the fact that the net interest during that increased this quarter reported loss, because of the dividend payout in this quarter. Though, we will execute the share buybacks on the same principles basically that we have adopted on the previous periods and we have the authorization after the general assembly to execute in that format.

You have 400 million in the DTAC situation. You have 158 in remain bond and you also have 85 via supervising broadcast. Is that sound right to get the underlying EBITDA trend this quarter?</p>

          <p>It's Maurice Patrick from JPMorgan. Two questions. Just a first one, I am not sure I understood what you said. When you give the EBITDA margin for 2008 before specific items all above 31%. And with a way to understanding that the 400 million positive and also the everything exceptional one-offs this quarter, those should be included in that EBITDA number, is the first question. And the second question relates to reconciling your 5 to 3% guidance cut, but remaining 6% underlying. You've explained half of that cut being ForEx and half being Asia weak. Presumably, we should therefore assume that you are correct -- that out performance at Ukraine, which is give you the 6% flat. Is my understanding there correct? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can do it simple. I think it's -- yes some of it basically. It's -- the understanding is that the guidance relative to the margin is including EMEA is this year or the actual as of June 30 and in addition to what we expect going forward. So your assumption is right on that. When it comes to the 50/50 margin or the even proportionate element of the decline of the -- from 5% to 3% and your understanding of that Kyivstar is actually the improved performance in Kyivstar is upholding some of the year at least 1% decline of that 150% and it's upholding the remaining part. So the underlying is 6% including Kyivstar now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Andrew Hogley from Execution. Two quick questions. First of all, at the Investor Day, you spoke quite a lot about the need for 3G licenses in market such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Thailand and Ukraine. Just wondering if you had any update on the timing of those processes and your latest thoughts on how much that's going to cost licensees this quarter, are clearly, a fairly major impact on cash flow? And secondly, is there any developments on getting cash out of Kyivstar, that seems to be building up very strongly? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The need for 3G as -- in the market develop is so that I think Kyivstar and DTAC is probably, those two operations in Telenor that feels this as something that would be the next step to take for those two markets. The need for this in Pakistan and in Bangladesh is not at the same level as the -- to those countries, the way I see it. On the other hand, there -- the uptakes on the process is difficult to judge. Ukraine anticipated, yes, probably end of the year maybe. But it's a maybe around that because the decision making process around this is not necessarily -- has not necessarily speeded up the way we see it this year. However, Kyivstar has an access to telecom 3G license. So basically, Kyivstar is in the position of offering 3G services based on MD&amp;O. In Thailand, it's anticipated that this process also will conclude throughout this year, maybe into next year. However, terms around it will be very, very difficult to have a meaning on -- at this stage. Pakistan has indicated that they will do it, but under the political situation in Pakistan, right now, I don't think that they will rush a decision and in Bangladesh this a complete open question. As for price tax on the licenses as such, this depends heavily on how authorities are looking at the methods of distributing this. If they may -- if they choose a -- an option like type of the method also limiting the number of the licenses up against the number of players. You have one situation and you have another situation, where the government might want to give a specific incentive for the industry to develop this easily and efficiently. And of course, then you have two different price tags attached to it depending on that development. As for the last part of the question maybe you can give a comment on that, Trond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, cash in Ukraine is still there and it's really dependent on the discussions we have with our authorities down there. And as a result of the injunctions that have been put in place from a company called EC ventures on the owners, the other owners of Kyivstar. It might be difficult in the short timeframe to actually agree on how to get that money out. We are continuously working with the Kyivstar on assuring us that -- how they are handle that amount of cash is done in a proper and in a most secure way. But it is difficult to actually estimate the time on when, we're actually able to get that money out of Ukraine, as a result of the dispute we have with the Alfa Company.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Peter Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux. Two questions, please. Firstly, domestic fixed line -- you maintained the outlook of 3% revenue decline for the full year despite we've seen, somewhat higher decline in the first half. What makes you think that things will improve, so to speak, in the second half of this year? And secondly, you talk about the challenging market in Sweden. I believe you mentioned that before, but would you care to elaborate a bit, have you seen any deterioration of the Swedish market recently? And are you referring mainly to fix broadband or mobile or perhaps both. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You're right in pointing at that we are a bit more optimistic for the second half on fixed line in Norway, compared to the previous, in the first quarter. And what leads us to have that opinion is the fact that the price reductions that we've had for these lines, effective from mid-fourth quarter 2007 is not something that will repeat itself within that time framework. So, we are in the belief that we might have a better situation on that score, forward to last quarters of this year. We said though around 3%, so I didn't say three percent <mark type="inaudible" /> which I am sure, you surely noted.</p>
          <p>In Sweden, the competitive situation is driven by the fact that termination rates have been reduced and that has taken the growth rate in revenues in the Swedish market down. And we see that we are also suffering from that. We have refocused our efforts in the Swedish market on fixed line services in such a way, that we concentrate on own infrastructure, because it's -- we see it too cumbersome to work on wholesale service offering from <mark type="inaudible" />, which we feel is much more combursant organized than what we have each year in Norway.</p>
          <p>So we concentrate on own infrastructure, and that of course reduces the market potential, the market footprint, to a certain extent. In the mobile area, we have had a period where we had suffered a bit from not having an initiative sufficiently visible up against all the players in Sweden. And we hope that in Sweden we can get back into -- get in the initiative and the visibility of the Telenor brand more strongly prudent in -- the Swedish marketplace. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a question regarding the inflationary pressures you mentioned the particular Pakistan, Thailand and Bangladesh there. Now if I look at the developments on the pricing side in all three countries, it looks to me as if in all three countries the Q2 trends were actually worse in local currency than the Q1 trends. I'm talking about the year-on-year trends. So, I was just wondering, at what point do you believe the inflationary pressures are such that you start seeing this coming through and some sort of slowing price decline as well, i.e. at what point do competitors react to that situation as well?</p>
          <p>And then following up on Peter Kurt's question on Swedish Mobile if I may, you had a bit of a margin downtick that went beyond what the market expect and what you saw in Q2 '07. So, I was just wondering given everything you told us here, at what point do you believe you can push the margins up and free and given that you seem to be talking about investments in the brand, which are higher than you would expect them to be in the longer term. I mean how long do you expect that investment period to regain the initiative to last in Swedish Mobile? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are two questions with sort of evaluation attached to them. In Bangladesh, we have repositioned our tariff structure in such a way that we are offering cheap or net traffic for customers in off-peak hours, that means night time. This -- and this is then of course done in such way that we should limit the traffics, needed to handle peak traffic hours. And this has led to a traffic migration from peak hours to off-peak hours, leading to a better utilization of the asset base as such. But also leading to a lower ARPU and lower revenue per customer in the same period.</p>
          <p>This is then a longer-term investment, you recall, into brand positioning up against competitors. And if we can take usage up, and even inflationary pressure, generally speaking, and existing low price structure on mobile tariffs. We believe that we are positioned to at least, be a bit more robust up against future price competition, knowing that none of the other operators in Bangladesh see the situation very much different.</p>
          <p>And if you go to Sweden, I should have had added one more comment to my -- to the last question I got on Sweden. Because, of course, to get Sweden back into a better margin position also required cost efficiency there so still be successfully carry through. And that is an ongoing activity. And I think that we will have -- and I hope that we have things to show to you in that respect towards the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, on both of them, when it comes to your a statement on inflation pressure in Asia, I think that you see a declining trend from first to second quarter. Do you think that we actually see this from more on country-to-country basis, than we see from a generic basis? Because we do see that when it comes to Grameenphone and DTAC, as Fredrik said, when going to DTAC, we actually saw a different usage pattern coming in June and July. Whether that is driven by the inflationary pressure or not ,we are actually uncertain on that. So this is the certainty of your statement it's not or, at least, we cannot say yes to that. And in addition to that is Grameenphone in Bangladesh that is very -- it is relative to the trends than the economy and the macro element in Bangladesh that is difficult.</p>
          <p>And in Malaysia and Pakistan, it's more of the general pressure than any specific patterns as we see of the development, of the usage that we actually can see. So it's more that, yes, we see that we're paying more for energy. We see that the cut off or <mark type="inaudible" /> 52:45 power supplies come more rapidly, and other than that, we don't see the -- any underlying pattern on Malaysia as well as Pakistan. So I do think that on the generic sense ongoing from Asia and say that it's worst in the second quarter than first. I -- we can agree to that in some sense in Thailand and Bangladesh, but we cannot see that in Malaysia and Pakistan, as such.</p>
          <p>And then on Sweden, as a result of holding our 10 billion cash flow targets in the Nordic region, Sweden is of course part of that and has contribute their share of improving their cash flow as result of that target. So go from when it comes to the margin side as well and then also to the cash efficiency that Fredrik is mentioning. So, in the medium term that target is definitely there, but we haven't timed it anymore specifically.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. It's Stephen Pederson, Nordea here. Most of my questions have been answered. However, I would like you to give us a little bit more information on the effects that you are seeing from cost inflation in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Thailand and if you see some sort of trend where effects are increasing at the end of the quarter? That's my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think most have been said on that score. I don't think we are able to say whether this effect is softer towards the end of the quarter compared to -- or beginning of the quarter, other than the indication that you might see in DTAC in Thailand. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and mostly what I didn't mention about Malaysia and Pakistan is that the competition level in there relative to both the international traffic, and this is typically in Malaysia, but also the growing competitiveness of China mobile in Pakistan, is of course also driving some of the pressure on the margin there. So it's -- I wouldn't be just looking at the uncertainty on the inflationary pressure, as a result of Malaysia, when looking at Malaysia and Pakistan.</p>

Just regarding the revised guidance here, what has happened -- has the trend accelerated since the Capital Markets Day there, in the mid of June there, or do you see the trend that is accelerating that behind your downgrade hit today? And then regarding the IPO in Bangladesh, if you could say something a bit more on that what -- how this process is looking, and the communication there with the regulator? And then thirdly, when it comes to view change or when it comes to a regional consolidation, you stated during the Capital Markets Day, that you're prepared or taken less or more flexible towards contour (56.18). Do you say an initiative sort of a need to do a regional consolidation in -- within the Asia there? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the guidance, my comment in the Capital Markets Day was that, it was then I need to report and basically, and that's two basically stands as a result of -- as I said, its actually half on half relative to how we see the development in Asia. And that half is not sort of major enough, really to mention on the Capital Markets Day and we're not adjusting guidance as such, on the Capital Markets Day. When it comes to the currency effects that is something that we make status on relative to how we're going to guide going-forward well and the effects so far. So, basically, since the proportion is 50/50 and that decline there, basically, it hasn't changed as much on the effect of the decline of operations relative to the half portion and not the currency. It's nothing that has come up just sort of the last three weeks of the course.</p>

          <p>As to the IPO process in Bangladesh, I said it was progressing. And that means that there are applications for listing under preparation. And also then the conditions around the whole listing, is being worsened. So my word being in progress covers that kind of activities for the time being. We are positive to contribute to the development of national equity market in Bangladesh. We are seen that the Telco Company is an obvious player in trying to expand the role of the equity market in an economy like that. As for regional consolidation, there are no news or thoughts on that, whether this situation the way escalates or pushes that into another gear. That's remains the same. We have no further comments on that as to what we said in the Capital Markets Day, just a month ago.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Thanks very much. Just a question on VimpelCom and the contribution, in the second quarter. Can you just clarify precisely what was the better part of that strong number in this quarter? Secondly, would you say that sort of ongoing workforce reduction is part and parcel of managing an incumbent business, and therefore, it right to give those expenses as sort of ongoing business expenses? And can you give any guidance for the full year restructuring cost? And then just quickly on the side, on Swedish, Swedish mobile broadband. You decided to buy the 2.6 Gig license. But you haven't really made a big push on mobile broadband to date. Why did you feel the need to buy that spectrum and allocate more capital to the Swedish market, when potentially there will be plenty of opportunities to buy other spectrum, further down the line?</p>

          <p>On the VimpelCom; VimpelCom in their first quarter report, they reported an US$185 million gain on the currency -- on the exchange gain. That's 100% level that they've reported. But I don't think that we or any other of the analysts basically had in there sort of -- on their sheets when they actually admitted the first two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I have to give a comment on the workforce reductions for an incumbent, generally speaking, I think that there is unavoidable that an incumbent will have to focus on cost structures, and that workforce is a major part of the cost structure as such. And we have seen in Norway, over the years that, yes, these kind of efficiency measures have been part of daily work. When we have modernizing our different work processes, and that work will continue. There will be new technologies to deploy and to start to apply. And I think everyone in the marketplace will be in search of those new elements that will increase efficiency. And this is a regular, normal work compared to period in an incumbent's daily life. And more than the incumbent, I mean, all operators will have to focus on that side going forward.</p>
          <p>As for the 2.6 gigahertz spectrum options that took place in Sweden, why we're in feeling is important to take a position in that spectrum. We are of the opinion that mobile broadband will be part of the future. We are seeing promising signs on the and pick-up on that already in these days. So, we believe the 2.6 gigahertz will be a platform where this really will play out on a broader scale in the license period of 15 years. And in order, not to be trapped in the position of being, or not having access to spectrum ourselves, we participate in that option, and you know the result. And one of the reasons for us participating in that, is that, if all the spectrum had ended up in -- an around one player in the marketplace, the wholesale effects of access to that spectrum is an uncertainty that we wanted to avoid in that timeframe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Jakob Bluestone from Merrill Lynch. First of all, if I understood correctly, at the beginning of your presentation, you said that you are not seeing much inflationary impact in Ukraine. And I was just wondering, in terms of how you think about your guidance for underlying revenue growth? Do you expect to -- that you will start to see an inflationary impact? Secondly, could you just give us a little bit an update just on where you are in terms of any potential M&amp;A and how you're balancing that against the share buyback that you talked about earlier? And then finally, some detailed question, but in the other division and particularly in new businesses part of others profitability jump around quite a bit. So you had an EBITDA loss of 154 million, which is of 100 million worth in last quarter? And I'm just wondering could you maybe give us a little bit of guidance on how we should be thinking about profitability in the new businesses segment? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we start on Ukraine. I didn't say that, Ukraine didn't have inflationary pressure because Ukraine have that. But I would say that, we expect that people have started to take consequences in their consumption is not of the same type that we see in Asia. Meaning that, the Ukrainian society has a better individual cash position obviously than specific countries in Asia, seeing the effects of energy and fuel prices are rising differently than they do in Ukraine for the time being. The other side here is, of course, also that from a price point of view which we have also touched upon in the presentation earlier today. In an inflationary period with stable prices, you could argue that the feeling of stable prices is better than reduces -- when we reach for further reductions in price structures as we go forward. And ultimately may lead to also the possibility of raising prices dependent on how other production factors are following in the inflation in general, that is fuel and of course also ultimately man -- the prices of man hours. As over the potential of M&amp;A as up against share buyback, I think we are pretty relaxed on M&amp;A. We take them when they are available to us and that so called window of opportunity, might be sort of around the corner or it might be further in to the future. So we are not sort of taking a look on the share buybacks and we make the share buyback evaluation a separate one from M&amp;A activity as such. And Trond, if you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. On the other side, I just think that relative to guidance I think that -- we are on the ordinary course. Certainly the other businesses basically have portfolio of products -- product companies that we have in different types of businesses in the telecom industry. And the reason why we have the drop this quarter is basically one-off that is write-off in contracts of connected objects in a company that we have that is our -- and that's a sort of a entrepreneurial contract that we have and that is as a write-off of approximately 75 million which -- that's basically the major difference. It will, of course, be sometimes that we have a start-up projects that will hit the outer bounds. But the major part of the -- sort of the increase in the other cost is basically the write-down on that contract of 75 million and some sort of special costs those came into the quarter as such way. So I -- relative to guidance I think you can sort of stay on the first quarter level.</p>

          <p>It's taken in other items, yeah. It's part of the 99 million that I mentioned earlier in the Q&amp;As relative to the specific items in the other items. So on part of that its lot of minor items in that this quarter, but the biggest element is the 74 of the write-downs in the contracts.</p>

          <p>Hi, yeah, can I just go back to Pakistan and the inflation if you -- sorry to going about, but its sort of you haven't downgraded guidance that we are seeing on an underlying basis because of Pakistan. You are saying -- sort of they are obviously are micro process, but they are not to some reason heading the consumer there as they are in Bangladesh and Thailand. But all of the economic indicators for Pakistan would really pointed out market more than any as being the market we would expect a big consumer squeeze. Can you -- so difficult question to answer, but can you perhaps explain why you think that is happening in Pakistan? And that's the first question. Then second question moving on to the Ukraine at the -- at the capital markets they talked little bit about sort of price and more that was taking place between your competitors NTSN and <mark type="inaudible" /> life is there, can you talk to maybe update just a little bit on that and at the time you said you was sort of abstaining from competing on the sort of price points they were offerings is that still the case in the market? Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Maybe as a bit confusion here. As to the consumers squeeze as he call it. My point was more at -- that was not help in the same way in Ukraine as it was helped in Asia. I don't think I mentioned specific that this was not help in Pakistan, because if you take a look on Pakistani development, the ARPU development is negative in Pakistan. However you could argue that is driven by new segments coming in as penetration already has reached the level of around 50%. So there might be sort of other explanations as well. But the rising in fuel prices is the most urgent, sort of, effect of inflation operation felt in Pakistan the way we see then we see it also from an operational point of view as the both logistics and price level to support the [indiscernible ] telecom operation has to come quite conversant. As we have to run with back up liquidity on our -- due to large extend. Not being able to rely on great supplying. In Ukraine, yes, I think we can say that the price competition hasn't been as appeared in this quarter as we have seen in previous quarters. And I think we can say to a certain extent, yes, to the fact that we are -- that there has been a better price balance in the market in this specific area. That doesn't mean that this will continue of course. But in this quarter what we said earlier this spring has probably been part of information of the competitor situation this year. We have to expect though that there will be a drop of SIM cards in that markets since the SIM card penetration is way above 100 or around 120%. And as time passes, I think that there -- there will be fewer active SIM cards in the market. But actually penetration by population might still be increasing.</p>
