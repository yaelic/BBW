      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning for those here in the U.S., in America. Good afternoon for those who are in Europe. We are starting our conference call through the Page 2, the highlights for the quarter. The first one is recurrent results, R$3.5 billion with average ROE annualized of 20%.</p>
          <p>The second one is our loan portfolio growth. The total portfolio exceeds a little bit R$400 billion at the end of the quarter with a 0.9% growth when we compare to the end of 2011 and 16.1% when we compare to March last year.</p>
          <p>Additionally to that number, we have private securities in a total amount of R$17 billion. So our total risk, considering these securities in terms of credit, is R$417 billion. We are going to go more deep in credits in the coming slides.</p>
          <p>The third highlight is the financial margin with our clients. The growth was 3.2% in the quarter and were reaching R$12.4 billion and a growth was 14.6% when we compare to the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Net interest margin with our clients increased 20 basis points in this first quarter. The credit spread increased 50 basis points in the quarter, reaching 13.5%, while the risk-adjusted credit spread, net spread, presented a 60 basis point decrease in the first quarter of 2012. And we are going to show these trends in the coming slides also.</p>
          <p>Fourth highlight is the banking fees and results from insurance business. The banking fees and all these revenues from insurance, pension plans and capitalization, the growth was 14.1% this quarter, achieving R$5.8 billion. It was a decrease of 2.6% when we compare to the last quarter of 2011, especially related to credit and seasonality.</p>
          <p>This is this number from loans ratio and loan losses. Expense for allowance for loan and lease losses, net of recovery of credits, the total was R$4.8 billion in this quarter. The expense for allowance for loan and lease increased 10.6% when we compare to the last quarter of 2011 and achieved a total of R$6 billion.</p>
          <p>The 90 days NPL reached 5.1%, a 20-basis increase when we compare to the 4.9% of the end of last year, in line what we said that we are expecting an increase in this first quarter and it continues to show this increase.</p>
          <p>The sixth is the non-interest expenses. That was a decrease of 4.6% when we compare to the end of the year and an increase of just 6.1% when we compare to the March of 2011.</p>
          <p>This altogether, the revenues and the expenses, we achieved in this quarter 44.5% in efficiency ratio, a decrease of 250 basis points compared to previous quarter and almost 300 basis points when we compared the same period of 2011. During these past 12 months, the efficiency ratio achieved 46.6% and we continue to target 41% for 2013.</p>
          <p>Subsequent events. This week we have received the approval of the Central Bank of Brazil about the acquisition of 49% of Banco Carrefour that was pending since last year. And also, we announced that we sold our stake in the BPI in Portugal to the La Caixa, Barcelona Group.</p>
          <p>Going to the next slide on Page 4, our results. A recurrent result of R$3.5 billion; the highlights here I would comment on the financial margin with our clients, an increase of 3.2% in the quarter and an increase 14.6% in 12 months. Also, another highlight here is related to the results from insurance, pension plans and capital operations. That achieved R$1.4 billion, an increase of 5% almost in the quarter and almost 20% in the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>All these good performance in terms of revenues was offset by an increase of expenses for loan losses. The total, as I mentioned, achieved R$6 billion in the quarter, an increase of 10.6% in the quarter and so it's almost 38% when we compare to the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>And other expenses that we continue to focus a lot in controlling and reducing expenses. The growth was a reduction in the quarter when we compare to the last quarter of the 2011 of 4.6% and an increase of 6.1% in 12 months. That is a little bit ahead of inflation.</p>
          <p>I will jump the Page 5 and 6 that we already said; it's more graphical pages. And we can go to Page 7 on the financial margin. That increased from 13% to 13.5%, with the gross credit spread. And net credit spread reduces from 8% to 7.4%, and 7.4% to 6.8% when we adjust the NIM with the clients. So it shows a decrease, as I mentioned in the first part of the presentation.</p>
          <p>Total assets achieved almost $R900 billion; the stockholders' equity, R$72.4 billion by the end of the quarter; loan portfolio, as I said, R$400 billion; and total funding with clients, here including the mutual funds, R$926 billion.</p>
          <p>On Page 9, we can see loans by type of clients, a breakdown of our loan portfolio. As I mentioned, the total including endorsements and services achieves R$400 billion by the end of the quarter, split of R$147 billion with individuals and R$231 billion with companies.</p>
          <p>In the case of individuals, we can see a seasonal reduction in credit cards portfolio because of the huge use usually in December or in the last quarter because of the Christmas and New Year's Eve. We can see a growth on personal loans of 6.5% in the quarter and almost 40% when we compare 12 months.</p>
          <p>Vehicles, a reduction of 1.7%; here is not only seasonal reduction, it's more strategic and the lower demand also for car financing in the whole industry reduced the portfolio in 1.7% in the quarter and also was flat also when compared to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:12:16).</p>
          <p>What continues to be with a good demand is mortgage. A increase of 8.5% in the quarter, 57% in 12 months. The total with individuals is R$14.5 billion and we have to add almost R$7 billion related to companies, that is inside the companies' numbers. So the total related to real estate is almost R$22 billion, what is a little bit more than 5% of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Going to the companies' business, corporate continues to have a better demand, 1.8% growth in the quarter, and we continue to be very selective when we are talking about small and very small and middle-market companies. The portfolio were almost flat, a decrease of 0.1%, and 9% growth in the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>On Page 10, we can see more details about our ratios related to credit. 90 days NPL ratio increased from 4.9% to 5.1%. We can see the same trend in this graphic in the total of the financial system in Brazil use the numbers released by the Central Bank. We can see that the total of the industry increased from 5.5% to 5.8%, so we are in the same trend. This was pushed more with individuals, an increase to 6.7% and companies increased from 3.5% to 3.7%, what makes this average of 5.1%.</p>
          <p>What we can see on the graphic, on the right side of this 90-day NPL ratio, is the 15 to 90 days is the first delinquency, the first time that we can have a delinquency. We can see that in the case of individuals that jumped in this ratio, was from 6.9% to 7.8%. What is potentially a bad sign for the trend in terms of NPLs over 90 days. And in terms of companies, these numbers were almost flat. And we have a total of R$26 billion in provisions for loan loss.</p>
          <p>On Slide 11, we can see the credit ratios, the coverage. The coverage continues to be good, although it has been reducing in the last 1.5 years, it finished up 148%. If we don't consider the E to G companies' rating, this number is 132%, so that is a small decrease of 1%.</p>
          <p>On Page 12, we are putting here some perspectives that we see in terms of credit. The first one that is loan losses provision, the expense. We show, as we have said and you know, R$6 billion in the first quarter and we expect that the expenses in the second quarter to go in a range that's R$6 billion to R$6.4 billion, and in the third quarter, R$6.5 billion to R$7.1 billion. This is related to these early delinquencies numbers that I talked to a slide before that is increasing the numbers the first time. And also, to this environment, economic environment of low growth that Brazil is passing these quarters, the reason that we expected these numbers for expenses in the coming quarters. The most impacted, of course, are vehicles and personal loans. That's the two lines of credit that we expected to continue to have more impact in terms of creation of these expenses.</p>
          <p>We continue with stimulus or contain our responsible use of credit. We have been more selective in terms of clients. We are getting more collateral, especially in small companies. We increased the collateral for this segment. And we had problems we remember in the beginning of this year, but this segment, in our view, is totally under control in terms of expenses and in terms of credit quality.</p>
          <p>Our problems are more related to the vehicles and personal loan, especially vehicles that we have. We are market leaders with more than 30% of market share and, in this environment, really we are facing problems, especially with the creditors that were originated in the second semester of 2010. So that's the reason.</p>
          <p>On Page 13, we can see the total funds, including here our working capital and funds and deposits and mutual funds. We have a total of R$1.2 trillion.</p>
          <p>On Page 14, the ratio between loan portfolio and funding continues to be very good. We don't see deposits are the issue to continue to grow the credit for us.</p>
          <p>Banking fees, we can see here that the reduction in the quarter was more related to loan operations and credit cards. The other services and fees and tariffs was in a good shape this too is more related to seasonal issues.</p>
          <p>On Page 16, we can see the expenses, non-interest expenses and efficiency ratio. We continue to focus a lot in these numbers. We expect it to continue to reduce and to achieve, as I mentioned, the 41% efficiency ratio by the end of next year.</p>
          <p>In terms of division of the recurrent results among the five business lines that we usually show, we can see this in the first quarter, that we had a small reduction in our Commercial Bank more related to the delinquency; an increase in participation in the recurrent net incoming of Ita&#xFA; BBA, that jumped from 19% to 21%; our Insurance was almost flat, a reduction in 1%; and stable in terms of the Consumer Credit.</p>
          <p>And our treasury operation and remuneration of the excess of capital has increased from 21% to 23%. The numbers were not much different from the last quarter, but some difference especially related to delinquency.</p>
          <p>BIS ratio of 16.1% on Page 18 also is not an issue in terms of funding the growth of Credit and the growth of the Bank in the coming years, market capitalization by the end of the quarter or R$158 billion and the liquidity, total liquidity, considering New York Stock Exchange and Bovespa, of R$743 million.</p>
          <p>To finalize on Page 20, the sale, the operation that we make selling our stake on BPI, we had 18.87% of the capital of the bank. We sold that to La Caixa, Barcelona. That has a good presence in Spain and also, we will increase and control the bank, this bank in Portugal. We sold too the stake for &#x20AC;93 million and this will really impact our stockholders' equity in R$100 million and a non-recurrent negative effect of R$200 million in the second quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>That's when we wanted to talk to you in this presentation and now we are open for the questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Carlos Macedo from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. I have two questions. First one is referring to your guidance for provision expenses. This is a significant increase from what we saw last year and then again, an increase from what you reported in the first quarter. And it seems to go against a little bit what other &#x2013; your peers are saying and the data that's come out from the Central Bank, including today, where there seems to be an improvement in asset quality already in March.</p>
          <p>Is there anything that you're seeing in your portfolio? Is anything that you originated that might be different from what the market is seeing that should lead you to make these significantly higher provisions in the upcoming quarters? And is this something &#x2013; if it is, should we expect the level of provisioning going forward to remain high? Or should we get a normalization maybe towards the end of the year, beginning of next year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is related to expenses. The head count for the bank continues to go down as you further deploy your efficiency program. However, in the first quarter, we did see personnel expenses go up quarterly in a quarter that typically you see personnel expenses going down.</p>
          <p>Was there anything in the quarter that led these expenses to go up? Or are there any expenses related to labor expenses or something like that? And is there a level that should be more recurring going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Rog&#xE9;rio Calder&#xF3;n speaking. Hi, Carlos. Your first question is regarding our guidance on expenses, bad debt expenses in comparison with the other peers. What we are guiding is the impact of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>I think it's important to highlight what makes a difference when comparing to the others' portfolio is the fact that we have a different mix of risk. And we have a much higher presence of vehicles in our portfolio. And vehicles is the one &#x2013; is the type of credit that is presenting the worse performance in terms of delinquency. I think this is mainly, is probably what is leading this difference.</p>
          <p>In terms of the shape of the curve of delinquency, if you compare our delinquency with the system's, it's pretty much in line. And in some cases, of course, we have different timings, sometimes we are pioneers in one products or not and then the consequence of this behavior sometimes is different in the line of time. But the trend is not different except for the different proportions of the credit portfolio, different risks taken.</p>
          <p>Regarding expenses, there I think the only figure that we have that is abnormal, not recurring the first part of the year, is that we had some additional level of layoffs amounting to around R$60 million or R$70 million in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we should &#x2013; so, looking at that number, maybe the recurring number would be R$60 million or R$70 million lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And now going back to the first question, so this vehicle, this auto loan, the mix, is it something that you're resolving? When should we expect to see your provision expenses normalize? I mean I have to assume that you're addressing those issues and that, in the future, they will normalize. And to what level should we expect them to normalize, maybe looking as a percentage of average loans? If you do increase the provision expenses to the levels that you have guided, you will be roughly operating at 7% of average loans being your provision expense. That's about as high as it's been, with the exception during the 2008 crisis, when a lot of the provision expenses were made preemptively for the corporate book. Is there a level that we should &#x2013; that you believe this will normalize to maybe next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe the level is going to normalize towards the end of the year. And you are right when you say that, of course, we took some measures on controlling this increasing delinquency. And, as I mentioned in the first question, Carlos, the main issue is in our auto loans portfolio. And when we look deeply in the auto loans portfolio, we figured out that we are still seeing the consequences of the origination done during the end of 2010 and mainly during 2010. You remember that we had some micro-prudential measures by that time, interest rates went up; the quality originated by that time was not good. We tighten up by April/May and as from that time, we start to build up a different portfolio, lower risk. And what we see now is the first payment before &#x2013; for instance, much better than before, we have now 50% of the first payment before that we were presenting a year ago. But it's a long duration portfolio, so it takes some time to reach the turning point. That, we believe, is going to be reached by the third quarter. This is the main factor why we are postponing this consequence of delinquency increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just in terms of the provision expenses as a percent of average loans, 7% or higher, given the provision expenses you're expecting for the next two quarters. Historically, it's been around 5%. Should we expect it to go back to 5? Obviously, respecting the difference in mix, or is that &#x2013; are we at a higher base line permanently given that conditions for auto loans in Brazil have declined?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should decline, but it's not going to be back to the same level we present in 2011, if I'm not wrong, with the 6.2% or something and we don't expect to reach the same level in 2012 definitely. And 2013 onwards, yes, it goes down. I cannot say anything on the quantitative right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Rog&#xE9;rio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alfredo, Rog&#xE9;rio, two questions from me. One, a follow-up from the prior one and then one on your performance of the financial with the clients, financial markets with clients. On the asset quality side, the follow-up, if you are now saying or suggesting that this NPL cycle will not peak until the third quarter, it will have lasted overall about 21 months or so, because it started early last year, so it doesn't peak until September or October. It's close to two years, 20 months, 21 months or so, which is much longer than normal.</p>
          <p>I mean in the past, the cycles in Brazil have tended to be much shorter, partly because the duration of your other portfolio is short. What makes it different other than your client concentration on the market in also loans, what make this cycle so much longer than normal, given that unemployment rate has remained very low in Brazil?</p>
          <p>And it seems that it has surprised you because in the past, you have guided for the shorter cycle. I think if I go back to a few conference calls ago in Italy, you were expecting it to end towards the end of last year. Then you prolonged that to the first half and now, we are saying third quarter. So it is already in your models; we're surprised by this lasting much longer. What's underpinning this cycle that will likely now last close to two years or 21 months or so?</p>
          <p>And on the financial margin, which clearly was a very good performance in the quarter, Rog&#xE9;rio, as you explained, it grew year-on-year close to 15%, so only a touch below the loan growth that we saw year-on-year for the quarter. Do you think that's sustainable through the rest of the year or at some point, we're going to see more margin pressure affecting this top-line income performance, given not only the ongoing decline in interest rates, but the recent launching of programs at lower rates following the lead of the public sector banks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Daniel. In terms of asset quality, I think &#x2013; I think, no definitely, what made the difference between what we were forecasting and the actual figures is the fact that every time we make an estimation, this is linked to a scenario. And the scenario that we had in mind by the time that we announced our estimates actually was not confirmed, and we are talking particularly on the speed of the GDP growth. Nobody and we were not expecting that. And I assume nobody was expecting the level of GDP growth or the zero level of GDP growth by the third quarter last year and very, very modest growth in the fourth quarter and beginning of the year as well.</p>
          <p>So, because of that, we are &#x2013; actually, we made our new calculations in our models and we concluded that this increase in delinquency is going to continue up to the third quarter, no. At that time, we know that, we have that information. We decide that would be for the benefit of you to make it clear for you as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>Regarding spreads, we believe that if you take the year as a whole, as we had the beginning of last year at a higher level, probably we are going to post a light decrease year-on-year. But it's really a slight decrease. So we are not really forecasting any stronger compression in margins for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to clarify, Rog&#xE9;rio, because sometimes when you mention margins in your presentation, you talk about the absolute amount of reais you make in your business with clients and sometimes the percentage. When you are saying that you expect a small contraction, are you talking about the percentage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking on net interest margin, the percentage, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Because the amount of reais you make in this line actually increased almost 15% year-on-year. You are not calling for a decline of that line, it's still going to be growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. I have a question on &#x2013; I have a couple of questions sorry. The first one is on your margin. I'm not sure I understand the expectation for slight or modest, very modest as you mentioned, Rog&#xE9;rio, decrease in net interest margins. If I look at the composition of your margins, your rate sensitive margin actually fell a lot on a quarterly basis and given that selling rates continue to come down and your balance sheet is asset sensitive, the negative repricing will continue throughout the year, as you saw in the first quarter. And where your margins did better was on the spread sensitive parts.</p>
          <p>Now, if I just follow the other things you're saying, which is your NPLs will continue to go up, you're going to change your mix towards less risky products. If I look at your new pricing given the government clamp down on spreads, it just doesn't seem to me that you're going to be able to produce an increase in the spread sensitive part of the margin. So can you be a bit more specific exactly why you think you're going to have just a slight decrease, when we're seeing this underlying trend play out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try to do it, Jorge. We are saying that the expected growth for our credit portfolio is between 14% and 17%. And we are saying that the net interest income is going to grow somehow lower than this, what means there is a slight comparisons, not too much lower than this, a slight compression net interest margin, that's what I said. This is all before bad debt.</p>
          <p>In terms of bad debt, I think better than saying anything, what we did was to present the figures. So our expectation for the bad debt expenses in the second and third quarter was just showed to you. So I think if you get all together, you are going to realize that there is no such important reduction in our net interest margin.</p>
          <p>And if you want me to summarize why, this is because of the mix of our portfolio. We are now replacing to the vintage originated in 2010, except for those with longer duration like vehicles that I said before regarding delinquency, we are replacing the portfolio originated in 2010 by a portfolio that was originated, built up during 2011 at a marginal &#x2013; higher level of margins. That's what causes the margin to be resilient or just posting a slight decrease.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just maybe the best way for us to understand exactly what you mean is what does a slight decrease mean to you? I mean are we are talking about 10 basis points, 50 basis points? What do you think relative to the margin of 2011 the 2012 margin is going to have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The credit portfolio is going to grow between 14% and 17%. And we are forecasting the net interest income to grow low two digits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. So, in terms of net interest margin, is that a 10 basis point contraction? Is that a 50 basis point? Is that a 100 basis point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't announce any guidance on this. If you take the calculation on the efficiency ratio, Jorge, it implies around 12%, 13% growth in net interest income. What's reflecting the net interest margin, I don't have the figure here, but I think you can make the easy calculation on this. So net, the credit growth is going to be 14% to 17%; net interest income, somehow 12%, 13%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you. The second question is on returns on equity. In the Portuguese conference call, you mentioned that you expect return on equity to be 22% to 23% in 2012. And look, I was not at the conference call, I just heard that from someone else. I just want to make sure that that was correct. Is that right, you said 22% to 23% for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I didn't. What I said is that we &#x2013; when questioned about the sustainable level of ROE, I said that we believe under the current scenario, the current way of doing business in Brazil, our sustainable return on equity is around 22%, 23% and that we probably will not post this year because of this increasing delinquency. I said actually...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Other way around...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I said that is a sustainable level for some years, while the cost of capital is at the current level. Of course, when the cost of capital brings down to a different level, probably we will be able to keep the same value creation, but not being able to post the current level of return on equity. So, just to make it clear, I didn't say that is sustainable, it's possible to deliver 22%, 23% this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And so what is your estimate for ROE this year?</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, guys. I have two questions as well on asset quality/loan growth. And, Rog&#xE9;rio, I hope this question doesn't come across as too confrontational. But your guidance has been continually pushed back on when we see the peak of the NPL cycle. And I think your investors have gotten somewhat frustrated by that sort of continual pushing back to 1Q, 2Q and what not. What gives us &#x2013; why should they be confident that this time around, it's going to be different; that the third quarter is really when we see the peak? And are you relying too much on an expectation that the economy is going to really reaccelerate and bail you out on this?</p>
          <p>And my second question is related to this in the sense that your loan growth target is 14% to 17% and given how you've started the year, that implies a pretty substantial reacceleration, about to close to 5% sort of sequential growth, which you haven't reached really since 2010, especially the second half of 2010 which got you into problems in the first place. So my question is this type of mid-teen loan growth, especially given the issues you're facing, an important part of your loan book? And recognizing that you are more conservative than your peers, is that the right strategy in this environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, how confident we are in terms of guidance for the year, I think it's fair to say that we are 100% confident on the measures we took. But there is an implied expectation for growth in our guidance, in any guidance, any time. And what we had in last year was frustration on the GDP growth for Brazil in the second half of the year and also the beginning of the year at a very low level. We are now forecasting a different scenario, but this scenario, yes, it takes into consideration some acceleration, important acceleration in the second half of the year. We are confident that this is going to happen. The level of inventories in Brazil are reducing. What should trigger things with your product to grow as demand is accelerating, we have the interest rates going down; we don't have an increasing unemployment level. So the conditions are positive to believe this growth is going to come, but all the scenarios are related to &#x2013; all the forecasts are related to a scenario.</p>
          <p>14% to 17% is a level that we believe is possible. We talked on &#x2013; discussing this level of approach during this first quarter. We don't have reasons to believe this is not deliverable, but we are going to come back every quarter to talk on this.</p>
          <p>We have a pretty good opportunity to growth in some portfolios; some others are not going to boost growth. And you are right when you said that this implies an accelerations in the second half of the year, an important acceleration, this is also true, and this is related to the Brazilian GDP that is expected to push 1% or close to 1% in the first half of the year, and going up to 4% or 5% during the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>So, altogether, this should create an environment that is feasible for us to deliver what we guided. The guidance was always very conservative and a big range exactly because of these levels of uncertainties, but we believe that is possible.</p>
          <p>Also, remember that the second half of last year, the growth was low. So what makes easier the acceleration in our growth in the second half of the year, while the first half is on the other way around.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Mario Pierry from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Let me ask two questions also. Specifically, if you can give us more color on the deterioration that you're seeing in your vehicle portfolio; can you give us any order of magnitude, how much NPLs have increased? Because it seems to me and from hearing what you're saying is that the bulk of the problem is with vehicles. Are you actually seeing an improvement in NPLs in other lines?</p>
          <p>Also, staying with this topic of vehicle NPLs increasing. I was wondering why the bank follow the public sector banks in announced reduction on spreads for older loans. This, to me, seems counterintuitive where you should be actually tightening your credit standards, not easing your credit standards for vehicle loans.</p>
          <p>And then finally, I have a question here with regards to your provision expenses. You're guiding for loan loss provisions prior to recoveries. If you are right and this economy starts to improve the second half of the year, should we see a meaningful improvement in recoveries? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Mario, let me start from the end. Yes, we are guiding the debt expenses and we expect some increasing in the recovery, meaningful, I don't know what you mean by meaningful, but it's expected to grow in between 5% to 10% every quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in terms of our auto loans I think what is important to highlight is that this is a longer duration portfolio. So it's right, it's true that we took decisions in the past, but it's also true that it take some time to reflect in our NPLs the consequence of this changing strategy. I think I made these comments before, but it's &#x2013; we had in 2010 the worst quality portfolio built up in auto loans and after that, the quality was increasing. We made the selectivity more tight. We had some change in the quality, meaningful change I mean since then and we still have the consequences of the 2010 portfolio.</p>
          <p>I think there's another indicator that is very important to remember, that is the first payment before. This is actually right now in a much, much better level than what we had a year ago, but we still need to run off the portfolio originated in 2010. This is the main reason why the quality of origination was deteriorated by that time and I think it's also important to highlight that the quality of our old portfolio originated right now is at the same level of the best vintage we had in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me rephrase then the question. So do you expect then to accelerate origination of auto loans going forward from this levels on, or is that what how we should read into this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in terms of balance, we don't expect an acceleration of the growth. I just want to make sure it's well understood that it does not mean that we are not doing business in these auto loans area. We actually originated around R$2 billion in new contracts every month, but this does represent a growth because we are more selective and, at the same time, we have a very important base effect. So, even if we had exactly the same strategy, growing on such a big and matured portfolio is a difficult task. And now, with a different perspective in terms of delinquency, this is actually not possible. So we probably will see the same level of the portfolio by the end of the year or even lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if you can give us an idea of &#x2013; I know you don't disclose your NPLs by product, but if we look at your auto loan NPL today compared to the crisis in 2008/2009, are you higher than those levels? Or can you give us an idea if we're seeing an acceleration in NPLs but from what you're saying, it seems like the NPL formation in auto loans should actually be improving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's higher. It's higher than year ago. It's higher than two years ago. If you take the 2009 level, that was the best level we had, it's 150 basis points higher. If you take by 2011, then we are talking around 60 basis points higher.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Marcelo Telles from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning, gentlemen. I have two questions, the first one, of course, regarding asset quality. If you look at the provisioning guidance that you provided for, for the second and then the third quarter, basically would imply is that provisions for the first nine months of the year will probably be up about 28% to 35%, right. And if I look to earnings, the consensus numbers for you guys, which is at around like R$16 billion, it looks like could be talking about a potential for like 12% to 15% earnings downside, which basically place your earnings numbers for the year at about R$14 billion.</p>
          <p>Does that calculation make sense? And do you think that 2013 you can actually have sort of a reversal of that provisioning trend?</p>
          <p>And the other question in the same subject, I saw that you only provided guidance for up to the third quarter for provisions. And I must say I definitely &#x2013; I think it was very good of you guys to provide more color on the provisioning front. But what was the reason for you not to provide the guidance for the fourth quarter, given that you think that your delinquency is going to peak in the third quarter? Is that that you probably don't have enough visibility to expect let's say an improvement in provisions in the fourth quarter of the year? Then I add my other question, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, we don't think the R$14 billion figure you mentioned is right, is okay. We expect earnings growth. We expect single-digit earnings growth for the year, so what brings to an upper level. R$14.6 billion was our result for last year. So R$14 billion would imply a reduction what is by far what's &#x2013; it's not what we are expecting, by far not.</p>
          <p>The other question you made, if I correctly understood, is why we are not presenting our guidance for the fourth quarter in the debt expenses and the reason is actually positive. We are going to do it in the next quarter. This is a figure that is pretty much accurate when we release it and this is based on our current portfolio of credit. So we have the impacts of the rolling off our portfolio.</p>
          <p>And fourth quarter is a little bit different because it would represent some origination that is done right now. So I think we are going to be in a more adequate, in a more precise condition to make any forecasts within a quarter regarding the fourth quarter. But we believe that the peak is going to happen in the third quarter, yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rog&#xE9;rio. And just one final question. Regarding your NII growth guidance that you mentioned like low double-digit growth in NII. I mean I remember when you provided that guidance, I believe that the interest rate implied in the <mark type="ph" /> U-curve (0:58:51) was probably about 10.5% if I'm not mistaken.

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And so &#x2013; okay, so at least you have let's say another 0.5 percentage point declined in the NIM, so are you accounting for that in that number? And given that I mean we saw Central Bank data today, we saw spreads coming down month-on-month, of course, there could be some seasonality factor there, but I mean do you think &#x2013; how confident are you that you're going to actually meet that NII growth? Because you guys are very confident on asset quality and the deterioration, that being higher than expected, so are you confident that, I mean, you are not going to have to revise downwards your expectation for NII growth for this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the current scenario, including this 8.5%, you know that we have an impact, a direct impact of the <mark type="ph" /> liq (1:00:05) reduction, 50 basis points is impacting around R$70 billion in our net asset position. So this is included in our guidance just mentioned.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Marcelo Henriques from BTG Pactual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi again, guys. Just a couple of questions actually on the cycle of the asset quality, the duration. I'm struggling a little bit, so if you could help me please. I mean if you get the credit that was originated after 2011 according to your numbers, it's roughly 70% of the total. And, if I understood correctly, I mean you have been saying that you are more cautiously lending since the second quarter of 2011. And you keep saying about the 2010 origination portfolio, which is roughly only now 18% of the total.</p>
          <p>So how come this can continue creating so much trouble for you in the coming quarters? Or does that mean that maybe you are not as cautious as you should be in 2011 and even beginning of this year, 2012? So I'm trying to understand how much long the cycle can continue if you have like 70% of your book already or beginning 2011, so in 2012, so you can keep pushing forward the delinquency ratios up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to make sure it's clear that most of the delinquency increasing debt we are observing right now is auto loans originated in 2010 what is actually out of the 70% you mentioned. But the 70% you mention, we model it with an implied expectation that was actually worse than the one model is. And this selectivity that we applied before was able to keep the same level to offset this increasing deterioration but not enough to improve out of the prior position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if I understood you correctly, like this 18% 2010, although it's small compared to the other, of course, it's &#x2013; you can create this amount of trouble I mean in the next coming quarters still?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is in the guidance we gave. The running off of this portfolio is included in the figures we presented on this growth in bad debt expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. And the second question is that on the confident of the economy to recover in the second half. And you keep saying that this would be like crucial for the asset quality begins to improve in the fourth quarter. Also, I'm struggling a little bit, help me understand how this could help especially when it comes to the individual portfolio. Because clearly, the environment for new business in Brazil has been &#x2013; maybe I'm wrong, but has been terrific. Actually, you haven't seen unemployment rates all-time low, real wages has been increasing quite substantially.</p>
          <p>So how the economic recovery could help the individual side of your portfolio even more if you already have like a very good, I'd say, scenario for consumer let's say behavior. So how this &#x2013; is there any kind of other indicators that you're seeing or more like income commitment coming down already in the fourth quarter? Or help me understand a little bit how the economic recovery could improve the asset quality on the individual portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think it's important to highlight that we took measures. We became more selective and we took all the measures in terms of improving our portfolio. Other than this, the growth of the economy, of course, helps, both helps because it irrigates the portfolio, but also because it creates a better environment for building up a better portfolio what makes in association with the decisions we took before, it brings a higher quality in our portfolio. The more growth we have, the faster is this replacement in our portfolio. That's what I try to explain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the final question, I promise, it's like a similar question I asked on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:33). And you have been running and especially this quarter with very low ROE to a bank like Ita&#xFA;'s standards, even looking historically probably it's not just the lowest one, but very close to the lowest level ever. And part of the ROE recovery, it's kind of linked to economic recovery in the second half and I know that it's a banker's cycle so you do depend on macroeconomic environment, but I mean if it doesn't come, what you can do? I mean how can you still be able to deliver? Or if doesn't come as much as you are expecting and actually every economy is expecting, what you could do besides what you're already doing on the cost side? Maybe you could do something more, but what you could do to really improve and what are you willing to do to really improve the ROE of the bank going forward? Kind of not regardless of the macroeconomic condition because, of course, it's a fact, but let's say a little bit more or less dependant on this "huge" economic recovery that's supposed to happen second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the way we look at our income statement formation, Marcelo, is the credit growth is expected to be between 14%, 17%. We expect a slight deterioration in our margin, what brings the net interest income to grow around 12%, 13% that I mentioned before. If you add &#x2013; and this has to do a lot with the type of growth that we are going to see in the second half of the year as you just mentioned. The other lines that accounts for our results and our return are fee income, Insurance results and also our ability to control our costs and to improve our efficiency. Those three are the ones that we could present better results in case we need to catch up in any case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Victor Galliano from HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Thanks. I mean most of my questions have been answered, but just on &#x2013; if I can stay, unfortunately, with issue of credit charge and provisions. So what we saw last year was, I think, the provisions were about 4.9%, just under 5% of average loans. So, for this full year, would it be reasonable to assume we'd be looking for something like 6% provision of average loans? And then we could expect it to come down from there as a percentage of average loans into 2013?</p>
          <p>And one other question...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Victor, just one point...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you are referring to the bad debt expenses net of recovery...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Net of recoveries, absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So your figures are okay, it's the same way we look at them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So 6% is a reasonable one for this full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you &#x2013; having mentioned earlier that recovery should be picking up by about 5% to 10% going forward from the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going forward, quarter-on-quarter, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah. So just looking at the divisional businesses, I mean obviously, what you see there, and I think this kind of wheels back into the overall ROE of the bank, it's clear that the problem is with auto loans and other personal credits and probably not with people who are core clients of the bank. It seems like the ROE of the Commercial Bank remains pretty resilient, but the problem is with the Consumer division. Do you see an opportunity here going forward, and maybe with Basel III coming in, for you to reallocate capital into better return businesses and thereby helping your ROE over the medium run?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is what we do all the time, Victor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Allocating capital here or there depending on the best opportunities and return opportunities we have. It's exactly the way we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But looking in reference right now in particular to the Consumer diversion. Given that that isn't going to be a growth area any time soon and that that houses most of the auto portfolio and some other personal credits, do you think there's more scope here on a &#x2013; shall we say on not just a cyclical or quarterly basis but on a secular basis to reallocate capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but also remember that we have all these initiatives in terms of the use, the cautious use of credits. And we pay attention when we want to avoid over-indebtedness in the Consumer area. So we have some room to reallocate capital here or there, yes. But we also...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much for taking my question. Just one final question, you have your substantial stock of excess non-performing loan provisions. Do you plan to meet your target of single-digit earnings growth in the year? Do you think some of these provisions fall in the fourth quarter or is this something that you don't have any intention of doing so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, our provisions are built up and our user base is on the expected loss criteria. They move based on the expectation improving or not. We don't take decision on releasing provisions or not. This is actually the results of our criteria. We don't have any plan to do anything other than respect the criteria.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you have a target for the level of coverage of 90 days capacity loans that you might be achieving towards the end of the year, lower than current levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're referring to the coverage over 90 days, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it's possible that it goes up or down based on the expected loss criteria, but I just highlight that the provision on A to G, what means all the over 90 days, except for those fully provided, is exactly at the same level that we presented a quarter ago. E to G I'm sorry. So it's really very important that you understand that the coverage is actually flat, stable. We don't need...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for the opportunity. I've two quick questions. In terms of the auto loan, just going back to what you discussed earlier. It seems to us that Brazil is running at almost full employment. And I'm just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more why you see such a huge pick up on non-performing loans on the vehicles financing?</p>
          <p>And the second question that I had, given the successful, apparently successful deal of one of your competitors on the IBD business. I was wondering whether or not you'd consider actually spinning off your IB business with Ita&#xFA; BBA and actually listing the operation given that probably the &#x2013; probably not but for sure the value of that operated business is not being reflected on your valuation today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we are not going to answer the second question. The first question, we have the consequences of some vintage that were originated in a negative scenario. Those vintage, particularly in auto loans, are presenting this increasing delinquency. I don't have anything else to talk on this. This is the reason why we are presenting this increasing delinquency. And also, we have some increasing delinquency comparing to the models in some other areas like personal loans but at a much lower level. Auto loans, particularly auto loans originating in 2010 are those more impacting.</p>
          <p>The other question I think we don't &#x2013; we are not going to address. I think what we should say is the very obvious fact that we pay attention to any strategical movements all the time.</p>
