          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Presentation for StatoilHydro. It takes place from our offices in Oslo. My name is Lars S&#xF8;rensen and I'm the Head of Investor Relations. This morning at 8:00 AM Central European Time the material that we're going to go through in a minute was published on our website and sent through wires and through the Oslo Stock Exchange. The material can be downloaded from our website, statoilhydro.com.</p>
          <p>I'll ask you please to take a note of the forward-looking statements on Page 28 in the material and read those carefully. Today's event can be followed by webcast and let me extend my welcome also to the webcast audience.</p>
          <p>As you know, safety is of paramount importance for us. So let's just spend 30 seconds on your safety here in Oslo. There are two exits at the back of the room, marked with green exit signs. If the alarm goes calmly walk out of those and downstairs and out into the open &#x2013; on the left-hand &#x2013; my left-hand side or your right-hand side out there in the canteen. There'll be staff to tell you where to go and where to assemble. Assembly point is just outside the building.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation will be made by StatoilHydro's Chief Financial Officer, Eldar S&#xE6;tre. And after the presentation there'll be a Q&amp;A session, where you can as usual send in your questions via the Internet or you can ask them from the floor here in Oslo. If you want to send in questions via the Internet, use the Submit Question button on your screen and questions will be sent into my PC and I'll read them aloud on your behalf.</p>
          <p>Without any further ado, I'll just leave the words to our CFO, Eldar S&#xE6;tre.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us at this second quarter earnings presentation. Our results this quarter has been delivered in the middle of the deepest economic recession since the 1930s. And although we now see some signs of optimisms and recovery, we must remember that the uncertainty remains high and there are still some fundamental imbalances in the global economy driven by mainly unsustainable borrowing and spending first in the private sector and now it's in the public sector. And these imbalances eventually have to be corrected.</p>
          <p>Fundamentals for our industry have not changed materially during the second quarter as we see it. And although we see some indications of an improved balance in the oil markets, we believe that a continued strong OPEC discipline, positive equity markets and sentiments and also the latest weakening in the U.S. dollar are the main drivers, the main contributors behind the reason to rally in the oil price up to the current level.</p>
          <p>And we believe that the oil price could, at short notice, return to lower levels unless the expectations to a tighter balance are confirmed through stronger fundamentals in the global demand. There's still a lot of inventories, oil inventories both at sea and on land and we therefore see good reasons to remain cautious in the short term.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of weak demand for refined products and higher crude oil prices and I would say slow capacity and cost adjustments within this sector, the refinery margins have weakened considerably. The short and medium term outlook, as we see it, for refining seems rather gloomy and this has also impacted our accounts, which I will come back to in a minute.</p>
          <p>The gas markets has experienced lower demand from &#x2013; mainly from the industrial sector, but also from power producers, which have been added to the typical seasonal pattern that we see in the second quarter. Now having said all this for the short and medium term, we have not changed our long-term view, fundamental view on the energy realities. The world global energy demand will continue to grow and the supply side including oil and gas will struggle to keep up the pace.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter this year, we can look back at a quarter with strong deliveries, both when it comes to production, new capacity growth being added, exploration results and also trading results. We have seen several new fields come onstream, increasing our capacity during the third quarter and also during July, second quarter. And our exploration activity is still high. We have completed 48 wells during the first half of this year and 30 of those have been successful and we are still evaluating quite a number of those wells.</p>
          <p>So let's now look at the financial results, the headlines this quarter. This illustration gives you an overview of our key results compared to the second quarter that you can see on the bottom here, last year. And as you will see, our net income, reported net income is very close to zero. And this is due to an effective tax rate of 99.9%. While our reported net operating income is at 24.3 billion NOK.</p>
          <p>Then however and, I would say not surprisingly, these numbers do not reflect our underlying results nor our underlying tax rate. And to provide you with useful analytical information, in addition to the IFRS numbers, we have therefore introduced adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings also after tax as an additional way of presenting our numbers, both at Group level and at business segment level.</p>
          <p>And the main difference between net income as reported under IFRS and adjusted earnings after tax, which is the phrase we use, is that we have adjusted for some infrequent items, which is not considered to reflect our underlying operations. In addition to that, net financial items are not included in the adjusted earnings, as these items are not considered an aggregate material when looking at the underlying factors.</p>
          <p>To illustrate this last point, this quarter we had a net negative financial items of 4.8 billion NOK, 4 billion of those was due to the negative derivative, non-cash derivative effect on interest rates, while 1.1 billion was due to an impairment of our 10% stake in the Pernis refinery, which is booked as a financial asset. I will share with you in a minute. I should also mention that a full reconciliation of both reported &#x2013; between reported and adjusted numbers is given in our MD&amp;A.</p>
          <p>If we then look at our adjusted numbers, the earnings this quarter was 29.2 billion NOK. That is a decrease of 48% compared to the same period last year. The adjusted earnings after tax fell from 16.7 to 9 billion this quarter, which is a 54% reduction. And the reduction was mainly driven by a 40% reduction in liquids prices in Norwegian kroner and an 18% reduction in gas prices partly offset by higher income from our oil and gas trading activities.</p>
          <p>We have seen good operational performance I've said through the quarter and our cost development is also kept under strict control, which I would come back to shortly. But let us first look at the tax development and after that an overview of the adjustment that we have made to arrive at these adjusted earnings.</p>
          <p>If we look at the adjusted earnings up at the corporate level, the tax cost is largely as expected at around, just slightly below 70%. The breakdown into individual segment taxes that you can see here is also largely as expected. However, slightly on the low side when it comes to the international E&amp;P, and somewhat on the high side for manufacturing and market. And there will typically be these kind of variances on a quarterly basis related to the composition of earnings as it is and also changes in tax positions. So you'll see these kind of variances, but on aggregate the 70% guidance is still valid.</p>
          <p>So the question is then is how do we get from a quite normal adjusted tax rate on adjusted earnings to a 99% reported tax rate? And there is basically two explanations to this. As because we see that the tax on net financial item of 35% is quite normal, so that's basic &#x2013; we are left with two explanations.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we have the low 6%, as you can see tax rate on the adjustments that we do, which is a net cost in this quarter. And the reason for this low tax rate on the adjustments is that we have net impairments in the U.S. with no tax protection of these for accounting purposes, which is valid for accounting purposes. And almost the same effect we see in Denmark related to an impairment of the Kalundborg refinery of 2.2 billion NOK. So this combined effect of &#x2013; from impairments drives the tax rate on the adjustments down and the corporate tax rate up, as you see on this overview.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have a reported tax cost of 1.3 billion NOK related to the 3.6 billion of non-reported currency gains. And we have informed about this in the stock exchange announcement on the 23rd of July. Now this 3.6 billion of currency gain is included in the basis for the tax cost, the tax calculation as presented in the accounts, but not included in our IFRS accounts. And this impact is due to the change in functional currency that we made from the 1st of January this year. And I will just refer to a more thorough explanation of this issue that you can find in connection with the reporting of the first quarter numbers for 2009.</p>
          <p>So hopefully this gave you at least some assistance to understand what happened with the tax rate. And again, you will find full explanation in the MD&amp;A. Then I will comment briefly on the adjustments that we make to arrive at the adjusted earnings.</p>
          <p>We adjusted for a negative 4.9 billion this quarter, corresponding to a tax &#x2013; after tax number of 4.6 billion NOK. And the most important factors here are the impairments. As seen in previous quarters, we are into what I would say is the impairment elevator when it comes to some assets in the Gulf of Mexico portfolio. This quarter, two assets have been further impaired while one previous asset impairment has been reversed. And this adds up to a net negative impairment of 1.4 billion NOK. And the other major impairment I've already mentioned is related to the Kalundborg refinery in Denmark.</p>
          <p>Our more pessimistic outlook for refinery margins is mainly driven by the low demand for refined products and an expected slow recovery from the current global economic situation. We believe it will take time to implement sufficient capacity adjustments, structural adjustments and also cost adjustments in the industry and have therefore reduced the book value of this refinery with 2.2 billion NOK. The value of the Mongstad refinery has also been reduced as such, but has so far not triggered any impairments.</p>
          <p>In addition to the impairments, we have also adjusted for some negative derivative effects mainly stemming from deferred gains on inventories within our oil trading and also the earnings consequences of an underlift 49,000 barrels per day during this quarter.</p>
          <p>So let me then also comment on the production volumes before I move onto the summary of the adjusted earnings. That was the wrong sequence here. Total equity production of oil and gas was 1,845,000 barrels per day of oil equivalents, which is down 3%. Entitlement production was up 1% to 1,729,000 barrels per day, driven mainly by an impressive 41% growth within the international segment outside of Norwegian continent shelf. And this implies PSA effects of 116,000 barrels per day in the second quarter and 128,000 barrels per day on a year-to-date basis, which is slightly lower than we have guided earlier. And this is partly due to a one-off effects adjustments that have been made in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Our best estimate now is that we should expect the PSA effect of around 130,000 barrels per day at an average oil price of around USD 50 for the full year. And this is compared to 140,000 barrels which we have guided you on earlier at the same oil price assumption.</p>
          <p>The total production this quarter was obviously heavily impacted by maintenance activities of around 55,000 barrels per day compared with 44,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year. In addition to the normal decline which is obviously there we have also had some temporary capacity issues on Kvitebj&#xF8;rn and Kristin fields.</p>
          <p>Seasonal gas offtake is also typically lower in the second quarter. And in addition, some gas volumes have been deferred beyond 2009. New fields like Agbami in Nigeria and Saxi-Batuque in Angola have added significant new production volumes compared to the same quarter last year. The volume from other new fields like Tahiti and Gimboa outside of Norway, were however quite insignificant in the quarter, as they came in late in the quarter. And these fields will together with the new start-ups in July on Tyrihans, Tune South and Thunder Hawk in the Gulf of Mexico all came in in July will increase our production capacity further when moving into the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>So this production guidance of 1,950,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day, equity barrels is therefore maintained for the full year.</p>
          <p>And now to the adjusted earnings. Our operational performance has been good in the quarter. Maintenance activities have so far been done according to plan. New capacity has also been delivered as planned or even slightly ahead of schedule. And we have not had any major incidents impacting our operations negatively.</p>
          <p>Our overall trading business has been strong also during this quarter. E&amp;P Norway reached adjusted earnings of almost 21 billion NOK this quarter, which is 56% lower than last year. The main driver is the 41% lower liquids price in Norwegian kroner and the 24% transfer price of natural gas.</p>
          <p>This quarter we have also seen a lower liquids price realization compared to average Brent than we typically see for NCS volumes. We had large turnarounds as mentioned this quarter, mainly in the latter part of the period and hence we had high production in the &#x2013; at the low oil prices in the beginning of the period and lower production when the prices started to increase in June. And so that is part of the explanation. And at the same time and mostly actually because of the turnarounds, the content of NGLs in the NCS liquids production was 18% in this quarter. And that is higher than we typically see because of the turnarounds and the typical pattern is between 10 and 15%. So this quarter 18% and the market for LNG was also weak in the quarter and hence the prices were relatively low.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas production on the Norwegian continental shelf is down 6% which I have already discussed. Overall cost developments in E&amp;P Norway have been good and as expected, partly also reflecting the high level of maintenance activity during the quarter.</p>
          <p>International E&amp;P had an adjusted earnings of 2.8 billion, which is down 53% compared to last year. The main cause is the lower liquids price of 40% measured in Norwegian kroner. Equity production increased by 9% to almost 500,000 barrels per day, while total entitlement volumes increased by an impressive 41% to 386,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Depreciation charges increased by approximately 2 billion NOK, mainly because of the increasing production, but also because of currency impact, the stronger U.S. dollar versus Norwegian kroner of almost 30% from &#x2013; on a quarter-to-quarter basis.</p>
          <p>Operating costs in U.S. dollar is largely unchanged even though equity production has increased. Operating cost in Norwegian kroner is &#x2013; has increased by 30%, which again is driven by the currency impact.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A costs was reduced by approximately one-third due to the ongoing cost reduction programs. Natural Gas increased their adjusted earnings by &#x2013; from 1.9 billion last year to 4.2 billion this quarter. Processing and Transport, that part of the segment was 1.8 billion, which is at the same level as last year, which it should be, while Marketing and Trading increased their earnings by 2.3 billion to 2.4 billion, mainly stemming from stronger trading activities.</p>
          <p>Manufacturing and Marketing finally delivered an adjusted earnings of 1.4 billion, which is slightly up compared to 1.2 last year. Continued strong oil and products trading results and slightly improved earnings also within retail was partly offset by a loss within Manufacturing.  As mentioned, Manufacturing continued to show a negative trend with weakening refinery margins. This is reflected in a loss of 0.5 billion, 500 million NOK this quarter.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, the continued negative outlook for refinery margin has also led to impairments of two refineries, refinery positions. The Kalundborg refinery in Denmark of 2.2 billion and the Pernis, 10% stake in the Pernis refinery of 1.1 billion. And Pernis is accounted for not under the segment reporting, but as a financial investment at Group level.</p>
          <p>Then I would like to give a few comments to our ongoing efforts to increase efficiency, reduce cost. As already mentioned, we are continuing to attack the cost base throughout the organization. In this context, I should also mention &#x2013; remind you that the merger and the realization of merger synergies actually gave us an opportunity to start the downsizing, and start the cost reduction process slightly ahead actually of the current downturn.</p>
          <p>As mentioned at our site visit, for those of you who were there at Melk&#xF8;ya in June, we have now increased our estimates for merger synergies from 6 to 7 billion NOK net to StatoilHydro, and that means approximately the double if you look at this in gross terms. In addition to the merger synergies, we have identified an additional 1.5 billion in annual savings during 2009 as set out at our capital markets update in January. And these savings are mainly within the SG&amp;A area and we have now implemented basically all measures to realize these savings. And you can already see visible evidence of these savings in the numbers this quarter.</p>
          <p>We are now in the process of firming up the next phase of our cost savings program that will be targeted during 2010. And this adds up to a further 1 to 1.5 billion NOK annually and is broadly within the same cost categories that we have addressed during 2009. And finally, we will continue to high-grade our exploration portfolio moving into 2010 both on the Norwegian continental shelf and internationally.</p>
          <p>A few comments also to our strong, I would say, cash flow generation in the first half of 2009. Even at significantly lower oil and gas prices with an average liquids price of around USD 48 per barrel year-to-date, we have generated a strong 84 billion NOK from our operations in cash. And taxes paid amounted to almost 50 billion NOK, which is &#x2013; to some extent actually also reflects taxes paid in relation to higher earnings that we made in 2008. We spent 39 billion in CapEx in the first half and are right on track to meet our CapEx guidance of 13.5 billion for 2009.</p>
          <p>So all together, these developments I think supports our earlier statements on cash flow neutrality this year at around USD 55 per barrel before dividend. Our net debt-to-capital ratio is at around 28% at the end of this quarter having now paid the full dividend for 2008. And we expect this ratio to stay in this range, around this number assuming an oil price level of around USD 70-ish per barrel.</p>
          <p>Then I will conclude my presentation with a guiding summary. And the short version is that there is no changes to our 2009 guiding. Our expected equity production is still the same at 1,950,000 barrels per day. And this is, I would say, supported by and another quarter with strong performance, strong deliveries on production and the increased capacity that I have already mentioned.</p>
          <p>We maintain our CapEx guidance at USD 13.5 billion. Exploration activity results have been good and we expect to complete around 70 wells at a cost of approximately USD 2.7 billion. And finally there is no change to our guided unit production cost, which is expected to stay at the upper part of the range of 33 to 36 NOK per barrel in &#x2013; for this year.</p>
          <p>Next quarter we expect a planned maintenance activity with a quarterly impact of around 55 to 60,000 barrels per day. And the maintenance impact for the full year is still estimated to be approximately 30,000 barrels per day, this includes both Norwegian continental shelf and the international activities. I should also remind you that seasonal gas offtake is, like for the second quarter is typically low also for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>So this concludes my presentation and I then leave the word back to Lars for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Eldar. We'll now start the Q&amp;A session and as I mentioned before we started the presentation, it's possible to send in questions from the Internet if you press the Submit Question button on your screen and I'll get the questions in here on my screen. To answer questions now together with Eldar S&#xE6;tre is the Head of Corporate Accounting, Mr. K&#xE5;re Thomsen as well as myself.</p>
          <p>So, we'll take first question from the floor here and then we'll take some from the Internet and your lines are already marked. So could you please wait for the microphone and state your name and company please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is John Olaisen from Carnegie. A question regarding the cash breakeven assumption of 55 or estimated $55, what gas price to assume into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't give you on average sort of from gas price. It's as you know we have a significant part of gas volumes tied into long-term contracts, which again is tied into oil and oil related products mainly. And there is typically six-month delay in the pricing related to oil. So we have &#x2013; what I can say is that we have calculated this to the best of our knowledge the months from last year that we know and taking &#x2013; sort of base this on reasonable assumptions on the gas markets for this year. So that's one of the sort of uncertainties, so I would say an equivalent type of gas, of oil price to USD 55 per barrel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then to the expected increased production in second half, you mentioned two fields Norway, which will contribute to production growth, Tune South and Tyrihans and to international Tahiti and Kalundborg. Are there any other fields which are about to start up or who will &#x2013; which will contribute to the second half production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not significant. There are smaller projects on the Norwegian continental shelf, but of new fields I think the Tyrihans is obviously &#x2013; Tyrihans is the biggest new field being launched for production since <mark type="inaudible" />. So it's a significant contributor for us, mainly oil, but also some gas of almost 60,000 barrels per day at full capacity. Tune South is slightly smaller to gas development linked to Oseberg. Internationally, it's Thunder Hawk, it's Tahiti and it's also Gimboa, which is sort of test producing now, but we expect to ramp up during the second half of this year. So basically that is the new capacity for this year. Next year we will see new developments in &#x2013; on the Norwegian continental shelf, the Ura , the Nordland mainly oil developments and also Vega, which is basically a gas field. And internationally we'll see the Leismer, the Peregrino come into production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My final question is related to the gas sales going forward. As most of your gas volume is contracted with a price linked to oil basically with six months lag, your client's knows that the gas price will be rather low in Q3. And then as oil price has jumped up now in the spring and in summer, gas price will be much higher in Q4 and Q1. Could that have a positive effect on gas sales in Q3 or any chance that would impact gas offtake?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will not speculate on sort of how the behavior pattern will be on our customers. So there's &#x2013; basically there are two markets here. It's sort of the long-term customers, which has &#x2013; is related to our long-term gas contracts and then it's the spot market. And in particular when it comes to the spot market it's very hard to see how that is going to develop. There's a lot of uncertainty on that issue going forward, particularly on the supply side short term. On the long-term contracts it's depending very much on sort of how the customers look at the situation. And &#x2013; but typically sort of they take lower demand in the third quarter for seasonal reasons. And then there could be other commercial reasons why they sort of would take higher volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take a question on &#x2013; from the Internet while we wait for more questions here from Oslo. It's a question from Anne Gj&#xF8;en from Handelsbanken. Well, two questions actually, one on PSAs and one on tax.</p>
          <p>The first one is the effect of 116,000 barrels per day in PSA phase is much lower than assumed and lower than the guidance. Why is that?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, will you give a new guidance on the PSA in effect going forward?  And then the tax question, why is tax on natural gas adjusted debit almost 80%, and on international E&amp;P as low as 25?  Can you give us any guidance on the tax rate going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the PSA effects I think I addressed that in my presentation actually, indicating that the main reason, I'll say the main reason for the low PSA effects this quarter is an adjustment on certain fields from previous years, from 2008. And that is a one off. One should not be expected to be carried &#x2013; to be maintained.</p>
          <p>But there also are other impacts. So we have added all this together and our best guidance is now 130,000 barrels per day for &#x2013; at a USD 50 oil price. And we have also given previously some guidance on 75, USD 100 per barrel and you could take down those guidances also by approximately the same number for this year.</p>
          <p>On the taxes, I think maybe you, K&#xE5;re would like to give some comments to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll do so. The NG tax rate around 80% is a little bit higher as we say compared to previous quarters. It could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, as it has done now and we keep on &#x2013; the guidance we have given earlier for NG is around 75%, 75% plus, minus. It will probably be for quarters to come as well.</p>
          <p>The tax rate for the international is low, 25%. And that &#x2013; the guidance we have given earlier there is around 40%. And I would still remain that guidance, it's a little bit influenced on lower oil prices will take it down where there are uplift. But this quarter it's influenced by the weakening in the US dollar.</p>
          <p>As some of you may recall in the latter part of 2008, in the fourth quarter, we had a very high tax rate in the international part, because of the rise &#x2013; the increase for the strengthening of the US dollar. Now we get the opposite effect of the weakening of the U.S. dollar as some of the &#x2013; our companies are having a functional currency U.S. dollar, and tax in Norwegian kroner. And it has to have the value of the assets. And we get those effects in quarters where the Norwegian kroner is strengthening from the U.S. dollar.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There's another question from the Internet from Teodor Sveen Nilsen from Argo Securities. It's on CapEx. Several other E&amp;P companies have guided CapEx down particularly due to lower supply costs. You repeat the CapEx guidance. Can this be interpreted that you will increase activity level then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when we gave the guidance for our CapEx level for this year and going back to January this year, we had experienced quite some time with turmoil, low oil prices and it was based on a fresh planning process where we had incorporated all the assumptions in relation to our portfolio, which asset to develop, which asset to continue developing and also what could be expected reasonably from cost savings.</p>
          <p>Short term, very short term, as you know in this industry there is very little flexibility that you actually can do. You are into projects and the flexibility becomes more visible when you move into next year and the year after that. But short term there is very little flexibility. We used the flexibility that we had and they have also being quite aggressive on cost targets and on cost developments and addressing the supplier industry. And I think the guidance that we have given is reflecting the current plans and the cost savings that we can realistically expect from suppliers into our cost base for this year. Therefore there's no reason not to maintain the guidance of 13.5 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Another question from Teodor Sveen Nilsen from Argo, on the financial items. What kind of financial derivative instrument is the financial loss of 3.4 billion related to? Is the loss related to a mark-to-market effect or what is it? 3.4 billion loss financial item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I recall it's 4 billion, and it's a non-cash loss that's related to the, remember we have all our debt in U.S. dollar bonds, U.S. dollar bonds swapped into U.S. dollar. Long term, U.S. dollar interest rates have increased, so this swap from fixed to a floating interest rate has been revalued and led to a loss, accounting loss for our whole portfolio of approximately 4 billion NOK. That's what expense is from. And it is a consequence when you have &#x2013; we have floating, mainly floating financing and long-term interest is moving, we will get this kind of volatility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We can talk a little bit more about financial items here. Iain Reid has got a question. Given the much clearer divisional clean earnings presentation, will it not be a good idea now to strip out specials effects and write downs from the net financial items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that could be a good idea, but so far we don't fully support it. I tried to indicate in the presentation that for all practical purposes, if you take out these items today, if you add together our normal interest cost that we have on our debt, and if you add normal interest &#x2013; sort of interest revenues on our liquidity, and you add reasonable returns from our securities and asset management, you get practically to zero.</p>
          <p>So there's very sort of big differences beyond that at the current &#x2013; for the time being. It has to do typically with other components such as derivatives and financial instruments and all sort of, in this case also the impairment of the Pernis refinery, which is defined as of now. So we have found it reasonable at this stage to report in this way, because we feel that is reflecting the underlying debt and resource in a good way. But that could change, but for the time being we feel it's a good reflection.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a little bit of follow-up question to this and then I'll leave the microphone to you. A good one. It's from Colin Smith at ICAP. He says is it reasonable to ignore the negative gains or losses on derivative financial instruments of 3.4 billion and the Pernis impairment?  Why would one not also strip out the positive derivative gain in net FX, which is plus 2.4 billion and the positive gain loss on financial investments, which is 0.9 billion when considering clean net financial items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as I said, it's &#x2013; we are not ignoring anything. We are reporting everything, so you'll find all the numbers. But for the &#x2013; as we see it today, if your actually ignore all these elements you are back to something which is not material, the net of the financial items, ignoring all these items to put it out there actually take this to pretty much &#x2013; around something, which is around zero. And we feel that this is a reasonable way of presenting the numbers.</p>
          <p>And as I said, if and when things change, we will definitely consider to do more of a normalization practice to put it that way, on the financial development. For the time being, we give you all the information so you can sort of do that kind of adjustment yourself.</p>
        </plist>

            <mark type="inaudible" />. A question regarding the cost base internationally or even unit costs. Do you see the lower costs trickle through the value chain line due to you having a lot of international partners that are large and that are also cutting aggressively costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's &#x2013; I think the whole industry is addressing the cost issue and the operating cost issue and this supply cost issue in the same way. So well like I say, it's not only on the SG&amp;A, this is quite a significant cost reductions that we further reduced in our office cost and administrative cost and business development cost quite significantly throughout our business, streamlining this, and it's very visible in the numbers.</p>
          <p>And on operating cost, it's as I said, it's mainly now due to the currency impacts. And so basically there has been no new fields which in this quarter had sort of &#x2013; had &#x2013; related to that box in the cost. And as you know, we are sort of expensing costs also in the preparation phase of the operations. We'll start doing that only from the start of production. So, yes, it's reflecting cost savings also from our sort of partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take question from the Internet from Endre Storl&#xF8;kken at Danske Bank. Reported lower depreciation charge on a per barrel base in the E&amp;P international in second quarter '09, especially relative to first quarter '09. Is the second quarter '09 level one, which can be expected to be maintained into 2010?  Or should we expect further increase as production rise and new fields are brought onstream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very hard for me to sort of give a specific guidance on that. I think it's depending very much on sort of which specific new fields, the cost levels of new capacity coming in, and also the booking profile.</p>
          <p>And I would say the booking profile that we might do for next year, at the end of this year is going to be very much also determining the depreciations that we will do per barrel on, in particular on the new field development. So I'm not prepared to give sort of to confirm or say that this level is sustainable going into 2010. But what I can say is that it is new capacity, and also 30% currency impact has also significant impact on the depreciation increase from last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We stay in the international area, and that's a question from James Hubbard at Morgan Stanley. That's on risk to volume guidance. What's the impact in second quarter from the OPEC quarters? And if you knew that OPEC quarters would remain unchanged for the remainder of the year, would you maintain today's volume guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the impact on &#x2013; from OPEC around &#x2013; quarters was around 2,000, very low, 2,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. It was higher, around 13,000 I think in the first quarter. When it comes to the impact in relation to production guidance, it has no impact because we have stated quite clearly, we did in January that the guidance of '09 50 is excluding any impact from OPEC. It's impossible for us to guide on OPEC cuts and what that could lead us to. So we are focused on the performance that we can deliver and that is pre any OPEC impacts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There's another question from the Internet. It's from Lucy Haskins at BarCap, Barclays Capital. Has your view on the NCS decline rate moved?  Do you feel more or less optimistic about your long run aspiration to keep NCS volumes flat? Yeah. That was &#x2013; I'll take the other one later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all when it comes to the production development as such this quarter, and what we can see from that is more or less exactly as expected. There's no surprise there. As we see a decline in particular on the liquids part, has to do with the timing of new capacity. And we did not see any significant new capacity overall compared to the last quarter, same quarter last year. But now new capacity is coming in on liquids, also mainly from the Tyrihans. So it's a maintenance issue, some operational issues and the natural decline as expected.</p>
          <p>Talking about sort of what the &#x2013; I can say about the future. First of all on the decline rate, as such we see no change in the guidance, we have not learned any new lessons this quarter, no changes our view on that, 5% decline rate. Then we have made a lot of discoveries and we talked a lot about that at Melk&#xF8;ya, at the site visit, went through a lot of these discoveries, which has strengthened our view on the medium-term outlook for the Norwegian continental shelf. We have built a lot of knowledge on understanding the geology and have improved our sort of success rate on exploration. And also moved beyond only the small discoveries into what I would say is medium-sized discoveries. So it's quite good news on that. And some of this can be developed quite fast track, other of these discoveries will need more standalone developments that will take longer time.</p>
          <p>So I would say medium term it has strengthened, definitely our outlook. But we still have the same perspective, 10 year horizon of the current production level on the Norwegian continental shelf. And moving beyond sort of the 10-year perspective, I think we are still talking about new operation opportunities to sort of approach new exploration opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lucy continues and in that &#x2013; to that extent actually with a little bit, with exploration as well, so let's take that before we take Gudmund. What is the balance in your recent exploration success of small tiebacks relative to big new provinces?  And what is pace at which these discoveries can be translated into barrels of production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, the reason is related back &#x2013; I would say it's accumulated learning basically, our new technology as well, which gives us these result. So hopefully we'll continue that trend and do more discovery based on these kind of learnings, but eventually we will run out of other options. Basically we will not &#x2013; we have not put all these into the bank, and we are running a prioritization processes on these developments. Some of them need more exploration drilling to be confirmed or to determine more sort of the scale and the volume that we are talking about.</p>
          <p>So I cannot give you any &#x2013; typically the developments which are very close to existing infrastructure will have a little more &#x2013; a faster track development than the standalone. But on some areas, for instance on the &#x2013; in the V&#xF8;ring Basin around the Luva, the Luva area and also in the Snadd well area, we need some time to firm up the development solution and particularly for the Norwegian Sea we also need to discuss and find a way of transporting the gas volumes out of that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you prepared to share with us the exploration volume, the resource &#x2013; on the resource level that you have found in the first half of this year?  It's just to try and find out approximately where you could be next year on the capital market stay, when it comes to reserve replacements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we gave you &#x2013; I think we'll wait until we have concluded the year. There are processes around this where we sort of need quality control and need to firm up the effect of commercial volumes that we're talking about. So to report this on a continuous basis, it doesn't give us the narrow level of comfort that we would like to have. So I think it's something that is more sort of we should expect at an annual setting. And I'll just repeat the 800 million that we added through this exploration last year and so far it looks very promising, I could say that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There's a question from Paul Spedding at HSBC, or two questions rather. First one is could you update us on your cash flow breakeven price?  At the Capital Markets Day it was USD 55 per barrel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I showed you in the presentation a cash flow chart, which basically is that we were more or less neutral so far this year. If you adjust for the fact that we pay slightly more taxes than the payable tax for this year, I would say we're quite neutral at the average oil price here today that's around USD 48 per barrel. But obviously gas prices, trading business, oil trading, gas trading, gas prices, it has an impact, it has been quite strong in this quarter. So I would say, overall the guidance of 55 is still valid and is supported by the numbers that we have seen so far this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question from Paul Spedding is, given the risk in &#x2013; given the rise, sorry, given the rise in gearing you have seen so far this year, have you begun to defer any of the flexible CapEx you indicated at the Capital Markets Day, which is around 35% of the 2010 CapEx on non-sanctioned project at that time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are now in the process of firming up the activities for next year and also following years based on the financial situation and the outlook as we see it, and the financial &#x2013; and the balance sheet as we see it. I would say the balance sheet, the way it looks now is not surprising at all, it's exactly as it should be. We have paid the &#x2013; we've taken new loans, we have paid dividends, we pay taxes, so we are on track.</p>
          <p>And I would say the, of course I gave you some guidance on the &#x2013; how we should look at this number going forward for the rest of this year and I think that is quite consistent with the USD 55 guidance that we maintain also on cash flow neutrality. So basically we are &#x2013; that number doesn't give any additional new cause to look at the numbers on the planning process that we are deep into now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll just take a question here from the Internet and then <mark type="inaudible" />. It's Colin Smith from ICAP that asks, at what level do you think the net debt-to-capital ratio would risk your A credit rating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, definitely not the level that we see today. Then I would say it's, there's a lot of factors which goes in. You should ask the rating agency. But there's a lot of factors which goes into the evaluation that they typically would do, debt ratio is one of them. But I would say cash flow is also definitely one of them. And maybe as important, cash flow in relation to sort of the debt levels is important, reserve developments and so on. So there's a lot of factors which goes into that. And so beyond that, I have no further comment other than we're very comfortable with the current level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start first and then you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, yeah. Just a question regarding dividend. Should we expect the very, very weak reported net income for the second quarter to affect dividend for 2009 in any particular way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I should give a refresh here on the dividend policy. We've had a few statements and they're all valid, still valid. First of all the starting point is still the IFRS, has not changed. We haven't changed the dividend policy. So that is the starting point, 45 to 50% of that over time, not in any given year but over time. That's important.</p>
          <p>The second one is that we also say that we will seek to increase the ordinary dividend, that's still valid. We'll seek to do that. And the third kind of statements which you will find in the policy is that we will also take into consideration other factors such as cash flow, outlooks and so on and we will do that. We have done so. I think we have showed that. Since 2006 we have had a payout ratio of over 50, 53 to 63 I think was the maximum over the last three years and 52% since the IPO back in 2001. So we have demonstrated that.</p>
          <p>So we will &#x2013; the starting point is the IFRS and then we will take these are other things into consideration, the ordinary dividend commitment and also the cash flow issues. And that includes these issues that we just talked about that will be taken into consideration, the fair valuation issues, the impairment, the derivative issues and also the tax issue which has been introduced now through the new functional currency practice that we have introduced. So all these element will be put together into an holistic evaluation, but let me repeat the starting point is still the IFRS as such.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So I think we'll just repeat, that's a good question, it reminds me that this is an organic number, it does not include any acquisition that we might do. And this is basically a principal on top of that.</p>

          <p>Got a couple of questions from the Internet. It's from James Hubbard at Morgan Stanley. The Pernis write down, given the weak start to third quarter refining margins, will you need to take further write downs either at Pernis or Mongstad?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a good question, and I can't say yes or no. It's an evaluation that we will have to &#x2013; as you know, as you have seen now we are on the edge. We have done write downs on two of our refineries. The Mongstad refinery is getting closer to an impairment, it's not impairment as such, but it's getting sort of closer, put it that way. So this means also that we're going to come to the Pernis, we are &#x2013; these are financial assets so in effect, we will have to do a quarterly evaluation in any case. And so it has been going up and down actually for a long time and will continue to do so. So basically with the current outlook it could move, it could become worse. But that's something I'll just say, it's quarterly adjustment that we do and I cannot rule out that that is &#x2013; might happen.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Got a couple of questions on the trading both in M&amp;M and Natural Gas. The first one is from Aymeric de Villaret at Societe Generale in Paris. Can you elaborate on trading profits both in Marketing and Manufacturing and in Natural Gas? Both seem quite high in the second quarter. Can we have a guidance for the next quarters or can we expect depending mainly for Marketing as forward prices continue to be higher than spot market prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just got first the oil side, I'll say we have &#x2013; the main &#x2013; here is one situation that we have had out there for quite some time, now the Contango market situation which have more reasonable but it's still there. So I will say that the storage strategy that we have derived from that situation, and it's also situation not only on crude, but also on products has been the main driver behind these results.</p>
          <p>There also other components, for instance arbitrage gasoline, moving gasoline from the European market into U.S. and so on has increased the revenues. So we are doing I would say now, a sophisticated trading business. And I think we can sort of continue to deliver good results on trading. But it is trading and as I said the main situation of Contango is &#x2013; has been the main driver. But in a different situation, you should not expect that kind of earnings. But still I think we have a good trading business on the oil and products side.</p>
          <p>On the gas side it's been quite consistent over some time now that we have delivered good results. And again I would say it's sort of gradually developing and improving the quality of this business. We are integrating, it's very much an arbitrage business, not very speculative. It's an arbitrage moving volumes between the different markets.</p>
          <p>And &#x2013; we're also integrating very much sort of our long-term business with our short-term business, and that has also created sort of a better overview of our total volumes than in, sort of in basic talk about an integrated, fully integrated, say, some trading activity on the gas side. So again about system abilities, this is about trading and I can promise nothing. We will see volatility on the trading results also on the gas side and basically, I think this quarter has been a good one. As such, that's a general comment.</p>

It's mainly &#x2013; it's NGL, but it also has to do with the skewed say, production profile due to the turnarounds and the maintenance season, which mainly started in June. So I would say that also add quite significantly actually to the discount that we have seen in this quarter on the oil price.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the sustainability on NGLs, it's &#x2013; that's very difficult to be very firm about. It's actually quite different market, NGL basically knocks down LPG enough that it goes into the petrochemical, which is sector mainly also refined from petrochemical, which is driven mainly by industrial demand. And it's very hard to say sort of how the recovery and how that's going to look going forward. LPG is mainly going to interheating.</p>
          <p>In the summer season there is low demand for that. So it's coincidental with the summer season on heating is driving LPG demand. So it's a totally different market than crude, so it's very hard to see &#x2013; to be very specific as to sort how this relationship is going to look. But typically we have some of the same situation in the &#x2013; actually in the same quarter last year where we also had a quite big discount compared to Brent.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Barry MacCarthy from Royal Bank of Scotland. <mark type="inaudible" /> Royal Bank of Scotland has a question about refining assets back to what we talked about a minute ago. Are you considering disposals for your international refining assets, given your bearish outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our main issue is to run the refineries as efficiently as possible, to do necessary adjustments as such and to the extent we had such, I would not talk about it to put it that way. So it's &#x2013; but there is basically no &#x2013; I can't give any sort of &#x2013; I'll on principal not give any comments to that. So I will say our main focus is to improve the efficiency, continue improve efficiency. Take down cost which is the first immediate response when you have lower margins. And that's what we're trying to do and increase the turnout or the sort of overall efficiency also in terms of product deals on the refinery.</p>

          <p>Oslo has a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, two actually. Has to do with relatively soft natural gas markets in the U.S. and in Europe particularly. Does it impact your marketing strategy for Sn&#xF8;hvit LNG? And in what &#x2013; well, that's the first one. The second one, is the current situation in the natural gas markets affecting developments on Shtokman?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well when it comes to typically LNG, it's the big investments and upfront investments and that kind of facilities typically are being run at full capacity whenever your capacity is available. Now we have a maintenance, plant maintenance process on Sn&#xF8;hvit for approximately 80 days starting in the mid of August. So that will be carried out as planned and then they will produce as much LNG as possible.</p>
          <p>Where the LNG is moving is depending very much on the markets. And so we have some commitments to the Spanish market, but rather the rest goes to U.S. or other markets. That's depending very much on how we look at the markets at anytime. So that's my general comment to Sn&#xF8;hvit.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Shtokman, that's a long-term project. So I mean you're far beyond 2010 before you see any volumes from Shtokman. I think a project of that nature, long-term nature really have to have a very strong long-term fundamental view on gas, which is guiding you on the investment decisions.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Just have to log on again. System got logged off. So I'll take a question from MF Global, Neill Morton. There have been conflicting comments recently about the sale of gas from Shah Deniz Phase II. Russia claimed to have bought the gas but the Azeris seem to have denied this. Could you clarify how the marketing of Phase II from Shah Deniz works? Is BP &#x2013; are the BP-Statoil &#x2013; is BP-Statoil still in charge as co-marketers or does Soka have the final say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this is a consortium so there are several partners who each have a saying in the gas &#x2013; in the marketing of the gas. StatoilHydro is the operator for the commercial activities on Shan Deniz. And then there is no gas sold, not a single cubic meter has been sold related to the Phase II of this development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a similar question from Jason Kenney at ING. Let's take the question from Gudmund now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on Kari Aga where Russian interests are going to get 20% on this field. And I was just wondering if this is interconnected with Shtokman in any way? And how does this change &#x2013; possibly change your view on operating in Russia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a totally separate issue from the Shtokman. This is part &#x2013; the fact that the Russian company were supposed to enter into this field with 20% has been part of the agreement, part of the production sharing agreement all the time. So this is nothing new for us. This is supposed to happen and now we are with the operator total in the process of discussing the commercial terms around this. So I would say it's a totally different situation and has no &#x2013; as you see today has no relevance to the Shtokman issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Seem to be a number of questions around PSE effects for the rest of the year and so on. I think I would just answer those questions by saying that we've guided 130,000 barrels per day. Eldar said that in his presentation and we stick to that going forward. So how is the...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At USD 50, yes. And then you can basically use the sensitivity that you already got from us to model that going forward based on different oil prices. We haven't got an update on 70 and 100 and so on which people seem to ask for. But we haven't got that so us the sensitivities that you already got and that will give you a fair indication.</p>
          <p>Okay. There's a question from Jason Kenney at ING. He asks about the Norwegian Sea and the Gro discovery. What kind of development scenario is envisaged and when?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's far too early to say. Gro discovery is, well it's a discovery. What we can say about it is it's a challenging issue, it's not easy first of all to address. And there is a lot of uncertainty as what could be the volumes from this discovery. So I think we still need a lot of work and to firm up, take it from you on what is there and how it can be developed. But like for the Luva area, this is a new area that would need the transportation solution to export the gas from the region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a question from <mark type="inaudible" /> at Chevreux in Paris. It's about dividend policy again, so I think we need to repeat what we already said. The dividend policy, do you plan to base your targeted payout ratio on adjusted net earnings, first in line...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I were to comment on this, I would say exactly what I said earlier. So no, there is no new policy, which replaces adjusted earnings with IFRS net income. The starting point is the net income. Then we have additional issues that we will take into consideration. First of all, the commitment to the ordinary dividend, which we have stated to grow that hopefully.</p>
          <p>And then also that we will take into consideration these non-cash components which is influencing the reported numbers this quarter. And also the tax issue related to the change of functional currency. So we would take that into consideration, which is also a reasonable thing to do in relation to our stated dividend policy. And again refer to our &#x2013; the practice that we have had, which gives confidence in this respect to this practice.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a question from Michele Della Vigna then we'll take one from Gudmund. Michele Della Vigna at Goldman Sachs has one question about OPEC volumes, but I think you already answered that earlier on. Second question is, how much production do you expect the major new start-ups in Q2, Tahiti and Thunder Hawk, Tyrihans and Gimboa to add in the third quarter and the fourth quarter?  Could you give us an update on Peregrino and what is the current percentage of the completion of that project in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to do the Peregrino first, there's no &#x2013; basically no update. The progress is as planned and is the production start on Peregrino, towards the very end of 2010 or very early 2011, so in that range. So there's no new information on the Peregrino. Then the first question was again remind me on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was how much production do you expect from Tahiti, Thunder Hawk, Tyrihans and Gimboa to add in second &#x2013; in third and fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mentioned, I was quite specific earlier on Tyrihans actually that it was around 56, I think that plateau &#x2013; there is a ramp up period. So I haven't got specific information on the profile of this ramp up. And when it comes to Tahiti, it's also a ramp up situation. It's a very small contribution in the first quarter. It's ramping up gradually and total capacity is at around 140, 125,000 lower liquids and some gas and we have 25% stake in that. Thunder Hawk has a total capacity of 36,000, something like that and I think a plateau of around 8, 9,000 barrels on our hand. That at least will give some indication on sort of the volumes from these specific fields.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But at least expect enough to come to reach our light in 50. So that's clear. We've got a question from Gordon Gray at Collins Stewart. Well, there's a question about PSEs and I think we've been there a couple of times, so I'll just skip that one. Second one is, how much NCS production do we expect to gain from return to normal operations at Kristin, at Sonora and at Kvitebj&#xF8;rn apart from the normal effects from summer maintenance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't recall exactly the production volumes on the Kristin for the time being. There is one well which is not producing, has been out of production for some time. We are working on that and that represents approximately 25% of the production capacity currently on Kristin. So when we get that back into production, we will increase the production. That is going to have no impact on the Tyrihans production which is tied back to Kristin because there's this capacity on the Kristin field to deal with both the additional well of Kristin and Tyrihans production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then Gudmund?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on oil sands <mark type="inaudible" /> delivered a $50 million of net profits from their oil sands business. And I was just wondering regarding your last demonstration project, where do you see the breakeven level now, maybe especially with the background of low NGL prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is the breakeven process is &#x2013; well first of all, the Leismer demonstration plant itself is a demonstration plant. So typically it has higher costs we have invested. Also some issues for the future, so it has higher cost and was initiated also in high cost environment. But it's a small facility compared to sort of the whole scale of what you're dealing &#x2013; talking about.</p>
          <p>Cost environment in Canada has been &#x2013; comes from a very heated situation. And we now see that the cost is coming down. And we think that is extremely important in order to be able to move on with new developments. So I would say one X factor is sort of how the cost development is going to move on going forward.</p>
          <p>The other one has to do with how, what kind of value chain are we developing. And so far we have all options open to us in terms of everything, which &#x2013; building an upgrader which we have cancelled basically the current plants at least. And another is to sort of simply export the diluted crude or going <mark type="inaudible" /> kind of refinery, various kinds of refinery commitments and positions in the U.S. So I would say we are considering all these kind of ways of marketing the crude and enhancing the value from this.</p>
          <p>Currently if you do the crude cost developments and focus on the upstream and upgrader version, I would say 70 to USD 80 per barrel breakeven point. But we need to take this down. Basically I think the whole industry is focusing on taking down the cost so that we can take breakeven levels down to more reasonable levels.</p>
          <p>So let me just remind you when we did the acquisition in Canada, originally, it's not that long ago, in that cost environment, we talked about breakeven prices of around USD 50 per barrel. So the only thing which basically changed since then is the cost environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There's a question from Carl Christian Bachke at Fondsfinans which I honestly don't understand. So I'll ask Carl Christian to repeat the question and ask it in a different way because I just don't understand it. But let's take the next one, Paul Spedding. Given that you have already paid a dividend for 2008 and you have a breakeven of USD 55, why won't &#x2013; gearing forward from here rather than stay at the current level as it now sits, if the oil price remains at $70?  And there's exactly the same question from Irene Himona at Exane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we will invest in our CapEx program of 13.5 billion. And so basically that will keep up the gearing level. So, and honestly so far this year we have had a slightly lower CapEx spend level than we expect to see in the second half of this year. So if you look at the number so far, you will get slightly lower than 30.5. So a slightly higher spending level next year. So overall, putting all this together we still maintain the 55 breakeven, cash breakeven level and the guidance that I gave you on the ratio as such.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There's another question from Irene Himona which relates to the reporting currency. You switched to U.S. dollar as the functional currency to reduce currency effects by continuing to &#x2013; but you continue to report in Norwegian kroner and by doing that you introduced translation effects. You competitors who adopt &#x2013; sorry, who adopt &#x2013; your competitors who adopt the U.S. dollars as the functional currency also report in dollars. Would you contemplate reporting in dollars to avoid translation effects and improve clarity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; well, first of all there was the argument why we change functional currency was not to reduce currency effect. There was other reasons behind that. If we &#x2013; obviously, we could change currency reporting to U.S. dollar. We still would be a Norwegian kroner company in a tax sense and in a dividend sense. So you'd still have currency impacts but then from that kind of components. And it would not change. I think it's the functional currency issue and the fact that we are paying tax is calculated in Norwegian kroner, the basis has to be transferred into Norwegian kroner and then you have a tax calculation. And we pay taxes in Norwegian kroner. That is the reason why we have this tax accounting issue and not sort of &#x2013; that would not change if we sort of moved into U.S. dollar as a reporting currency at group level. At least that's what our experts tell us. And if I'm wrong now K&#xE5;re will have to correct me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're quite right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A couple of questions left here on the Internet. Question from Kim Fustier from JPMorgan. Chesapeake has recently reported better than expected results from the Marcellus shale production. Can you give us more detail on your recent progress on the Marcellus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, the current production from Marcellus is still at a rather low level. We are drilling, we have approximately 15 drilling rigs operating within our part of this business. We intend to increase that to around 20 by the end of the year. And then it will increase to 40 and even higher as we move into the future. So the drilling is going as planned. We think it's a good idea to do that in this cost environment and prepare ourselves for the new capacity when we think oil and gas prices will improve going forward.</p>
          <p>So far we are very pleased with the developments. The initial production rates that we have seen has been at least as good as we expected to see when we made our &#x2013; the acquisition and so I would say everything has pointed in a positive direction since we made the acquisition. But again to repeat, the contribution from &#x2013; into our revenues is very low as this is very few barrels we are talking about currently. But that will increase going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second part of the question from Kim Fustier from JPMorgan is your yearly production costs fell by 13% year-on-year in dollar terms in the second quarter. How much of this was self-helped and third-party costs coming down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's impossible for me to answer. I haven't got the analyses to &#x2013; but basically this is, short term, this is not sort of new contracts basically taking costs down at lower rates and so on. This is activities and cost efficiency that we are doing. And also being assisted by our operators internationally, was also doing a good job in terms of reducing the cost efforts. So, I think I would not attribute this to the external costs and rates as such but mainly to the activities and the cost saving that is being done within the operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I've got another question from Carl Christian Bachke which basically is the same question as I got before. But we'll try to answer it &#x2013; to ask it then. You have given adjusted net operating earnings after tax of 9 billion. What is the equivalent figure for adjusted net income after tax?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if we &#x2013; basically what I'll say is that my comments to the financials that I talked about and touch upon earlier, if you take away the infrequent items, which typically is related to impairments, in this case to derivative effects and currency impacts, then you are back to something which is very close to zero. So I would say, I can't give you that it would be exactly zero but it's &#x2013; and tax on something, which is zero is also quite low number. So it's basically, I would say around 9 would be the guidance but I haven't developed that number for you so &#x2013; for the reasons that I've just numbered &#x2013; mentioned, but it would be in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there are a couple of questions still on the Gas and Trading results. So we, I think we have to ask the question again, even if you have answered that question before. It's from Jon Rigby at and Iain Reid, at UBS and Macquarie respectively. Can you talk a little more about how structural the trading income in natural gas and M&amp;M is, whether you consider this is a good quarter or is that the type of results that are going to come back at these levels? What should we expect going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to give an answer to first question, is this a good quarter?  Yes it is. It's a really good quarter in oil. And we have had good quarters not only the oil, crude oil, but also in products and all kind of liquid related trading activities has actually supported the results this quarter. And fundamentally behind that has been the Contango situation with all these liquid markets. So that's the main driver. And obviously the future &#x2013; the market situation going forward is quite important in order to discuss the future. And in the backwardation situation, you could typically not expect the same kind of earnings on the liquid side.</p>
          <p>On the gas side, it again it has been a good quarter. But we just underline that we have &#x2013; I think we have developed a more sophisticated gas trading business. And as a general statement I have more sustainable results from this business, but to repeat this quarter has been a good quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was the same question from Nitin Sharma at Cazenove, but he's got a second one which is back to the adjusted earnings after tax. By excluding the net financial items, does the metric therefore exclude the net interest charges in addition to the mark-to-market adjustments?  Please clarify.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I said on the &#x2013; if you look at the net financial items and exclude these things that we would have adjusted for, if we have done &#x2013; through that exercise, you are left with the interest that we pay on our loans. And you're left with the income that we have from our cash and liquidity. And you're also left with the securities or asset management from, basically from our capital insurance company, which are typically revenues.</p>
          <p>So if you add together these revenues and these costs, history has shown and I think this shows also this quarter, we should try to show in our presentation, you are pretty much close to zero. So if you have done this kind of exercise, you are left to something which is close to zero. And that includes interest rates paid and also interest income from our ordinary business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two last questions on production. First one from Colin Smith specifically on the Marcellus. You comment on the progress at the Marcellus net production at 800 barrels per day have given you, will give you at least 50,000 barrels per day by 2012. Is that still a valid target from Marcellus, 50,000 barrels in 2012?</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it was 50,000 that we said.</p>

          <p>That's definitely, there's no change to that. Nothing at all. Progress on drilling and so on is as planned and there's no change at all to that, those submissions.</p>

          <p>Okay. And there's a second question on more overall production from <mark type="inaudible" />. Are you more at ease with your 2009 production guidance than you were a few months ago?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>I would say I'm more so because simply time has moved forward. And we have one more quarter of good deliveries and also for July, at least not with the information we show has made me more concerned about the guidance. So as I stand here and I'm more comfortable simply because we have taken away some uncertainty. But it's a risky &#x2013; but things can always happen and it hasn't happened, which has an impact so far. And so I'm more comfortable now, but there's still operational issues, we have &#x2013; I will repeat, we are focusing on value before volume on gas. And that is still valid. And this is something that could have an influence on the volume assessments. But as I see it today, it's more comfort on the number.</p>

          <p>Okay. And I see no more questions here in Oslo. There are no more questions from the Internet. So thereby we finalize today's session. I'll just note that we already have the manuscript there on the Internet. So you can read everything he said. And then in a couple of days, we'll have the actual transcripts. So somebody will write what he actually said. And also the additions that we've got here at the Q&amp;A session. But that will all be in the Internet when we type it up basically in a couple of days. So with all that, thank you very much and goodbye.</p>
