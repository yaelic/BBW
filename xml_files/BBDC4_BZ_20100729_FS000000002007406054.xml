      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for participating in our conference call. As you see during the presentation Bradesco's results for the first half of 2010 have fully confirmed our projected expectation at the beginning of the year. These results were achieved within a much healthier, more solid and more promising economic scenario, which remain in place despite the turbulence abroad. We performed well in all these segments reaching and oftentimes exceeding our established targets. We continued with the strategy of prioritizing organic growth and achieved the presence in 100% of Brazilian municipalities. We are continuing to expand our network, and we closed the first half with 49,000 service points throughout the country. At the end of the period, we had 21.9 million checking account holders, 20.6 million of which are individuals.</p>
          <p>In slide two and three, we present the highlights of the period that we would be discussing with more details in the following slides.</p>
          <p>In slide four, we present the reconciliation between reported net income and adjusted or recorded net income, if you prefer, in the respective periods. This quarter our results were impacted by only one non-recurring event, the constitution of provisions for economic plan in the gross amount of R$75 million. As a result, our reported net income of R$2.405 billion increased to R$2.455 billion, generating an annualized return of 24.7%.</p>
          <p>In slide five, we highlight our net income for the past quarters with significant increase in the last two quarters as a result of our growth in the net interest income, higher fee income and essentially due to a decrease in delinquency ratios, which is clear when comparing six-month period. I'd like to draw attention to the evolution of our earnings per share of approximately 6% from R$2.07 in the first quarter to R$2.19 in the second quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>In slide six, in this slide we show the historical behavior of our quarterly efficiency ratio. We will also present a new calculation of the efficiency ratio accumulated over 12 months adjusted to risk or to net provision for loan losses. We analyze the quarterly ratio. We highlight an improvement of 41.9% ratio in the first quarter of 2010 to a 41.5% ratio in the second quarter of 2010, basically because of an increase in the net interest income and in revenues from insurance, pension plans and saving bonds.</p>
          <p>With regard to the ratio accumulated over 12 months, the red curve rises in the last two quarters are essentially due to outstanding treasury gains that occurred in the first and second quarters 2009, which stabled this ratio for such periods. When we calculated the efficiency ratio adjusted to risk, we conclude that this ratio better reflects reality of percentage earnings. A deterioration of the ratio is clear during 2009 reflecting higher provision for loan losses, and it's recovery started in 2010 giving to an improvement in delinquency and the consequent decrease in provision for loan losses.</p>
          <p>Slide number seven, total assets reaches R$558 billion recording an evolution of 15.7% year-on-year, return on average assets remained at 1.7%, while return on average equity increased to 22.8% in the first half. The Basel ratio closed the first semester at 15.90% showing a reduction from the previous quarter mainly due to the removal of a surplus allowance for loan losses on the capital base as a consequence obtained in regulation and the redemption of our subordinate debt. In any event, securities ratio in alliance with our capacity to generate results, puts us in a very comfortable position to sustain the expected growth.</p>
          <p>Slide number eight. In this slide we present the net income breakdown of our main operations. This quarter we saw an increase in the participation of financial activities from 67 to 71% in our results due to an evolution in order lines of lower fees and securities. The Insurance segment despite presented results similar to the previous quarter that had a slight decrease in its participation as a result of the improved performance of the financial segment. Either way, it is an important pillar of our business, accounting for 30% of our consolidated results. When compared to six-month period, p It was also worth noting the reduction of the share of securities in our net income due to lower treasury gains as compared to outstanding gains in the first six months of 2009 and to decrease in the interest rate.</p>
          <p>Slide number nine, unrealized gains remained extremely high at R$9.2 billion despite the quarterly reduction made through the 13.41% decline in the stock markets and the consequent impact on the price of our equities portfolio and offset investments especially our interest in Cielo. Please note that these numbers do not include the potential goodwill from our own properties of almost R$2 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 10, on this slide I'd like to draw your attention to the constant improvement in the interest earnings result which increased by 14% in the first semester in comparison to the same period the last year. This performance was due to high average volume in mining impacted by the increasing <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Slide number 11, the net interest margin remained flat over the second quarter at 7.8%. We haven't reported a significant improvement in these margins in recent quarters and compares to the 7.3% posted in the same period in 2009.</p>
          <p>This performance was primarily fueled by the increase in the average volume of individual loans and by improving funding conditions. Thanks to lower funding cost and the incorporation of Banco Ibi. In an event we continue to believe that the in the mid-to-long term in the margin we recorded a gradual decline to the historic rates in 2008 due to the increase in low rate margin operations and their consequent relative share gains.</p>
          <p>Slide 12. In this slide we present a breakdown of net interest income. The quarterly highlight was <mark type="inaudible" /> which increased by 45%. And this was basically due to great gains from secured, as a consequence of the increasing volume in the interest rates. The growth in funding results reflected previously increasing interest rates together with higher funding bonds. The 20% reduction in the insurance line was mainly due to low returns from assets IPCA, the Brazilian consumer pricing index and the multi-marketed funds. The highlight in the first semester was that 19% growth in the interest margin chiefly driven by volume growth including <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Slide 13. In this quarter, the gross margin, the gray part of the graph, presents an important evolution especially due to increase in volumes. Provisions for loan losses there, the red part of the graph, remained practically the same as in the first quarter, despite a growth in the loan portfolio as a consequence of improvement in the delinquency. As a result, the net margin from lower operations, the blue part of the graph have once more recorded an important evolution. This dynamic becomes clear when we compare that data from the first two quarters of 2010 to the same appeared in 2009 where the gross margin presented an increase of 19% and provision for losses decreased 26%. Therefore we see an evolution in net margin of approximately 9%.</p>
          <p>Slide 14, in this quarter given the evolution and with relevance of the figures and in order to provide a better view of the credit trends, we have included the balance of the debentures and promissory notes whose risk was assumed by our commercial area. Considering this Bradesco's total loan portfolio close the second quarter 2010 amounted to R$258 billion with an evaluation of 4.2% in the quarter and 15.3% in the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>Growth was chiefly driven by <mark type="inaudible" /> SMEs which moved up by 6.7% in the quarter and to individuals which grew by 4.2% led mostly by payroll deductible loans and credit card operations. It's worth noting that the new borrowers, in other words, people or companies, who had no loans with Bradesco in June 2009 accounted for 86% of the total growth we reported in the last 12 months, once again showing that we have grown with quality while diversifying reach.</p>
          <p>Slide 15, as expected the delinquency ratio for loans overdue by more than 90 days considerably improved, reporting 4% in the quarter, a level we all expect to reach towards the end of the year. It's important to note that this reduction was evident in all segments. We believe there is room for further improvement in this ratio although at a reduced pace next to the maintenance of employment and consumption levels reaching 3.7 by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Slide 16, this slide shows the behavior of early stage delinquency of between 61 and 90 days which remain flat in the quarter, both in terms of the total ratio and that of the corporate segment. We also believe the individual ratio will be stabilized in the coming quarters despite a slight upturn in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 17, this slide shows we're continuing to maintain comfortable <mark type="inaudible" /> provision levels with a surplus of R$3 billion in relation to the amount required by the Central Bank or R$6.2 billion related to expected one year gross losses or even R$8.7 billion in relation to losses net of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Slide 18, this slide shows that even though we maintained our surplus provision level, our coverage ratio of the allowance for loan losses for credits overdue by more than 90 and 60 days once again improved substantially. This is not only a consequence of a lower delinquency but also of the increase in the generic provision which more prevented in nature due to client rate and/or operation rates. Certainly, this level gives us more than enough room to successfully cope with and the reversal in the occurring favorable scenario. Consequently once again we see no need to constitute additional provisions in the future, nor do we believe we will have to resort to our existing provisions, with the expectation that the favorable scenario will continue for some years to come.</p>
          <p>In slide 19, fee income increased by 4.1% in the quarter chiefly driven by loan operations and prudent account transactions that were impacted by the increase in the client base, which has expanded by 1.5 million accounts in the last 12 months. This growth offset the reduction in the underwriting fees triggered by the lower volume of capital market business in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In the six months comparison, fee income increased by 13.2% led by growth in credit card operation at 60.6%, loan operation at 13.9%, and a 15.8% increase in fund management fees. With regards to the growth in credit cards operation, this is partially due to big operation of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Slide 20, operational expense increased by 4.4% in the quarter because of the higher personnel expense, especially due to the increase in the structural portion and this was in turn chiefly caused by increased expense from social payment and charge, impacted by the greatest concentration of vacation in the first quarter as well as expense of the workforce. Remember we have a more than &#x2013; we finished the quarter with more than 1,000 new employees, really drive our organic growth of course. We will discuss administrative expense in the next slide.</p>
          <p>Okay, slide 21, administrative expense grew by 3.4% in the quarter and 22.7% in the annual comparison. In both case, the increase was due to respective periods growth including the expansion of our services network and increase in business buying, specifically, with regard to the annual comparison incorporation of Banco Ibi the expense part of the upturn in the first six months of 2010. Additionally, advertising expense in the first six months of 2010 came back to its historical levels.</p>
          <p>Slide 22, although total revenue from our Insurance Group remained flat in the quarter, the Health and Savings Bonds segment improved substantially. Life and Pension Plans segment on the other hand reported a reduction due to seasonal factors. Then a comparison there was a sharp improvement in our business line reflecting the current economic recovery. It's worth noting that <mark type="inaudible" /> leads the sector in terms of revenue with a 24.6% share of Brazil's insurance market. This data is from May of 2010.</p>
          <p>Net income remained flat over the first quarter at R$700 million benefited from lower claims and a reduction in selling expenses which helped to mitigate the decline in the financial results as I mentioned previously.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 presents some of the main figures from our insurance activity. The combining ratio recorded life improvement over the previous quarters mainly due to lower claim. Our all financial assets as well as our guarantees of technical provisions totaled R$88.5 billion and technical provisions stood at R$79 billion, 69 billion of which are related to Life and Pension Plans products.</p>
          <p>At this point I'd like to emphasize once again that we work with actuarial assumption to allow us to be comfortable in relation to our Q2 commitment with the beneficiaries of our insurance and pension plans. With regard to that actuarial table we used strict and advanced calculation criteria adopting the AT-2000 model with an improvement of 1.5% per year. In addition in terms of expected interest rates for our assets we have adopted a long-term rate of 4% per year in real term.</p>
          <p>Slide 24 represent our economic projects for 2010 and 2011 regarding GDP, interest rates, inflation and the U.S. dollar exchange, certainly a very favorable scenario.</p>
          <p>Slide 25, thanks to strong growth in the first, we have to revised our guidance for mortgage loans from R$6.5 billion to R$7.5 billion. Related to the other items we have maintained our guidance and given the results so far we remain confident that we will achieve our objectives.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we believe that our second-quarter results were highly satisfactory. We maintained a softer provision for loan loss despite the growth in the loan portfolio, while certainly the main factor behind is improving. In addition, our operations indicators have been recording a solid and consistent improvement in line with the prudent economic scenario.</p>
          <p>We have maintained and expanded our investments especially in organic growth, although this resulted in some initial cost pressures, it will also ensure sustainability and expansion for our future results.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for your attention so far and we are now available to answer any questions you may have.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations on the quarterly numbers. I have two questions regarding your guidance, first on the guidance of operating expenses, which is a growth of 9 to 13% for the year. And as of the first half you were up 19%. For you to reach the midpoint of your guidance expenses in the second quarter would have to be basically flat relative to the first half. And I'm just trying to understand how does that happen? Is there any cost cutting efforts in place, can you share with us what the plan is because flat expenses in the second half versus the first half seems difficult given the seasonality of the banking business the wage negotiations that happened in the second half? So if you can share with us how do you get to your targets that will be great? That's my first question. I'll ask my second one later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jorge, it is Abreu. Look, I think it's not comparable when we consider what's that in the first &#x2013; consider on the &#x2013; compared with the first half with the first half 2009. Because in the first half 2009 we have very, very &#x2013; we have &#x2013; we kept the expense, let's say, the expense was lower than the normal. When you consider other year remember that the last year 2009 we had some expansion in expense; that's why when you compare the year-over-year, we can see it's not a big challenge to reach this guidance that we gave. When we gave this guidance we have our budget and you consider some assumptions in terms of agreement with the employees in September. Of course if you depended &#x2013; if the agreement would be <mark type="inaudible" /> we have in place.</p>
          <p>But we don't have so far, we understand that we are running a bank with specifically in terms of expense, in a base that is lower than that we had in our past, that we understand there is no &#x2013; it would be a big challenge to be around there. I don't know if I answered your question perfectly, but I understand your point, but it's not really comparable when I looked at first half it was different, we had big differences.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, I guess then &#x2013; so your, but your guidance is based on your expected expenses for 2010 versus 2009, correct, regardless of whether there were some different one-timers or extraordinary items in 2009, so your guidance of 9 to 13 is full year expenses versus full year expenses. So the point is that the first half your expenses are 9.5 billion for this year. If you do 9.5 billion for the second half which seems difficult given the seasonality of the banking business, the way negotiations that are coming, then you don't &#x2013; that's the only way you'll meet your guidance. And so I'm just trying to understand there is &#x2013; then should we expect September and December to have sequential decline in agreement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember that you &#x2013; the second half of 2009 you have a growth in expenses. When you compare a year, a full year, you have the same impact, of course we had some growth and expenses in the two quarters of 2010. We expect that we'll grow low &#x2013; that's if we grow in 2009. The growth will be low in 2009 when you compare the total it will be... Understanding my point here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let me ask my second question. Thanks for your answer there. The second question is on lending and what's happening in the economy. There is a debate, ongoing debate right now whether the Brazilian economy showing some signs of a slowdown. Some of the numbers that are coming out, May GDP number was flat; industrial production, two consecutive months with no growth and coupon minutes today certainly hints to that.</p>
          <p>Your loan book is up 15% for the year. That's way below your guidance of 21 to 25%. Two questions, one are you seeing some evidence of the slowdown that some of the macro numbers the coupon minutes are referring to in your own business? And the second question is given where you are in achieving the guidance, is it likely that the guidance is going to be probably at the low end of the range or maybe even a bit lower than the low end of the range as a more realistic number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, you're right I think the Brazilian economy is passing through a moment, more through, let's say more through adjusting at the moment. We don't understand that this we are, we have been growing in more that we could in fact for the beginning of this year in the first half of &#x2013; in the first quarter to.... I think in the second quarter we had some accommodation in terms of growth but not a &#x2013; it doesn't mean that we expect to have some deterioration in the economy going forward.</p>
          <p>But we'll continue to dictate that we continue to extend in the let's say more normal growth for Brazilian economy &#x2013; not like, Brazil is not &#x2013; we cannot grow 7.5 that we have to expect for the year for a long period, unless we can create many, many places, other things. That the Brazil economy is going through a way to go back to the more normal growth. That's why &#x2013; it's the scenario that we have.</p>
          <p>Having that we understand that the second half of the year normally in our budget, normally we consider economy &#x2013; Brazil economy in the second half of the year is more, have more dynamics than the first. It has many, many events, it has more money in the hands of the population. That's why we expect that we continue to reap it.</p>
          <p>We are not feeling this &#x2013; any movement that we cannot believe that we can see. We talked this morning in the conference in Portuguese about the large corporate. The only doubt we can have in large corporate because large corporate is normally the most difficult to predict because normally when we talk about large corp, just one operation and feel that the guidance with just one operation that we don't , we cannot view. But the rest that we are confident to &#x2013; maybe we'll be more in the low of the guidance, yes, but we are, we understand that's possible to reach.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Carlos Macedo from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on the results. I've got a couple of questions. The first one, much like Jorge's question just now on expenses, looking at your fee income, and it's up almost 12% year-over-year and the seasonality does bode well for the second half of the year as well. I'm just wondering if your guidance of 11% fee growth, if that's something that you're going to meet with some degree of ease.</p>
          <p>And the second question is in terms of expansion, you were guiding for a pretty strong expansion in branches and so far only 70 branches have been opened, or less actually in 2010. I was wondering if you're still going to meet that guidance, what is the new guidance for branch openings in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, Carlos, in terms of fee, we are posting very good numbers when you understand &#x2013; we don't have the &#x2013; where we thought we'd be, more than <mark type="inaudible" /> in terms of growth at the end of the year. Unless we're not expecting to have many change in regulation, and then that could be affected in a bigger changing in this. So we are confident we can, we will be very close to the higher point of the guidance maybe.</p>
          <p>In terms of guidance, thanks for your questions, it's good to clarify, in fact we gave a guidance that we will be opening 250 new branches this year. When you look at the numbers into June we can see only 22 branches. We are increasing the, remember that the first quarter have adjusted one or two branches right.</p>
          <p>We are now in a process that we are inaugurating more branches going forward. But to think we'll not be able to match this guidance of 250. I think the loss, the speech that we had in mind to develop this business is not going the way that we've had in mind first. But we think that it can be reached at the end of the year something close to 160 and 170 new branches and the 250 we will be reaching by the first half of 2011, but it doesn't mean that we are, we give up about the 250 branch, but it does postponed the inauguration of some of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. You mentioned before opening 500 branches or more in three years, 600 branches in three years, is that still a goal or is that coming down as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we don't have the exact yet &#x2013; it's possible to do so. We understand that we have space to, we have the many, we think in spite there are many, many places where it is impossible, is it was to opening branch. But I cannot give you like guidance because we don't have these in our plan, strategic plan so far, okay. But I would say that considering the scenario of Brazil, economic scenarios for growing economy, I would say that there is no reason to believe that it's not for &#x2013; we will not continue to expand the branch network in the reason like this to have a transfer &#x2013; maybe in the next three years, it's okay. But not, again, it is not a decision that we already have taken but it just to give a feeling that we have about that. This 250 I can tell you because it's in a process to be opened.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Domingos, I had a question on your interest rate scenario, if I understand correctly you now predict Selic to be 11.25% by year-end and then to stay there through out 2011. So only 50 basis points more hiking and then a long pausing by the Central Bank throughout the rest of the year and in the entire 2011. What's the impact of that scenario if you want to come true on your top line income and net interest margin? That's question number one. And question number two, although you're not forecasting 2012, if your economy were if you take best guess by now would they expect by 2012 the Central Bank to restart the easing cycle and start, we lower in interest rate to turn back to the single digit level that we had before the hiking cycle started?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly Daniel, there is change in the macroeconomic scenario for interest rate. It was, I'd say that this change was more driven by the global scenario. It have internal inflation and everything you have some indicators that inflation is more I would say under control as there is no reason to Central Bank to give slightly more the monetary polls. I would say that that the affect in our numbers is not as we have been talking, it's not direct because it had some balance of this.</p>
          <p>We can have &#x2013; we will have lower revenues from your working capital. But on other hand you can gain more in your fixed portfolio, so I would say that it should be affected the rest of the, in this sense. And I gave a review that we don't have this guidance for 2012, so we don't have this numbering too. But I would take a risk to say that, we can see the scenario that the Brazilian economy continues to grow in a good way like 4.5% with inflation in control. That will be a space for banks and the central bank to reduce the risk rate going forward.</p>
          <p>Look, we understand that this scenario is very, very positive for bank. We'll talk about structurally it's very, very positive because you increase the demand, for our part, it's in very good shape. We've experienced this the last year few years. 2008, we remember that we have an expansion of the economy that supported products like mortgage, products like auto finances. You have more people that are capable to buy this things, so it's a &#x2013; you reduce the risk gradually so you can reduce the spread in other way. So it's a &#x2013; I see a very, very good very, very positive scenario with interest rates in the lower risk for those two reasons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Domingos, that exactly what I was pointing to, the consolidation of that positive scenario that continue to increase the demand, the structural demand for loans, for which some people would argue that eventually you need lower rates even than the current ones. So I wanted to sense whether you expect that sometime by 2012 we hold the starts continue to be aligned that easing cycle to resume and you gave me the answer that was expected. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. How are you? I want to ask a question about the insurance and pension business and if you could just somehow &#x2013; I don't know if you can talk a little bit about what you're seeing there from a competitive standpoint and whether you're concerned at all about the sustainability of the results, especially as we see rates go up, are you going to see other competitors start to compete aggressively more aggressively on price? Because when I look at your insurance business your combined ratio is 84 to 85%, which from a global standpoint is very, very good. And I'm just want to get a sense from you as to how sustainable the current levels of profitability are, whether you feel like you can continue to grow the bottom line, over the next not only few quarters, but over the next couple years?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the sustainability of our results, we don't have doubts about this. It's because if you make some analysis from 2004, 2005 and 2007 and going forward, you can see a sustainable combined ratio, which means around in 85-84, but I would like to mention to you a very interesting thing related in policies to dental. In terms of a dental which we have a huge operation jointly. We don't operate not start until not &#x2013; until now the seniority, which we plan to restart in the end of this month and it continues until the end of the year. In this kind of operation would be a very strong opportunity to reduce costs and the order size in terms of a health. We have a lot of opportunities to put pressure in our stakeholders to reducing at least to maintain the cost of the services related to the health.</p>
          <p>In terms of P&amp;C, there are a lot of interesting opportunities and we're running now which a lot of operations relates to the enrollment insurance to &#x2013; according &#x2013; I think I mentioned to you and everybody before or we sold in the last eight months around 1,300,000 new policies overall. So, this kind of information to you and to everybody is there is a very huge opportunity to getting market share in our operations. You can see our quarterly news from the insurance department. We've got 1.6 points more than market share in six months. This is a very, very huge opportunity to grow up our results from the next six months.</p>
          <p>I'll say to you, almost 100% because our company is very realistic in terms of the technical provisions. I remember you &#x2013; that provisions we made for a lot of the floats, happening in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and the famous is easy which calls in Portuguese <mark type="inaudible" />. Everything was made by provision by us in the results of this decline, so it would be a little bit down, or for lower of this provision, which has happened to in all the statements, a lower combined ratio and a lower claims ratio. I'd say almost 100%, absolutely right. When I say to you end of this year our results are competitive and sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. That's very helpful. If I can ask a follow-up question as well on, to may be to Domingos, but you've pointed out a pretty favorable scenario for the meeting in long-term for Brazil in terms of economic growth, and there are some concerns however that have been expressed some industry participant including Serasa about the debt levels of the Brazilian consumer I believe the exceedingly high level of debt servicing capacity that debt servicing load that the Brazilian consumer currently has and that leveraged have increased. Are you concerned at all that that about the borrowing capacity of the Brazilian consumer and whether that will ultimately lead to slower growth and even, an increase in asset quality or NPLs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look so understand that the data that Serasa normally they are posting, I saw some reason that will have that deterioration in terms of delinquency. I'd say that we are not perceiving this in our data. Look, sometimes the Serasa data they are not, they don't consider &#x2013; they don't have a comparison like they just consider like this for example in 2009 we had 100 people in that and now we have 120 now. So let say that delinquencies increased 20%, it's not true because depend all in relative basis it will have in 2009 100 people among 1,000 people which means 10%, it will have a 120 now among 200 it's 6%. So, it's something different that sometimes you have this kind of as I'm not telling that is the case that you're talking now, but sometimes it has some kind of this data, it had some concluding data when we compare what Serasa is saying to what we had here, all right.</p>
          <p>But what I can tell we have a math of solid in Brazil that is continuing to expand, you have an employment rate in the lower level that we have had. We had a discussion on this week with our economic team. They are, upon investigation, that they understand that Brazil is stooped to a new level of unemployment rate.</p>
          <p>So, everything that we have, that's why we have no reason to believe that we can have these kind of some, expect to have deterioration &#x2013; has been the same. And when you see that the debt level of confident you know that the what we mentioned in our speech, we want to say that our growth in grades this year when you can see that year-over-year, the growth that we have 86% of this growth was explained for new &#x2013; in other words, new borrowers, what you mean is that you not you have new people coming to the market and people have come with a view of demand and everything, but we're putting all your growth in the same-to-same familiar on this.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Let me ask you two questions, one is related to your insurance operations as you showed, partial results from insurance increased almost R$200 million in the quarter, but then you gave all of that back in lower investment gains from insurance. So, I was trying to get a better sense of the composition of your investment portfolio in insurance or what kind of recurrent that you realized during the quarter. And then my question second question is related more related to the bank, I understand right that it is the time of the year when you start the negotiations with the Union, what kind of wage increases are being demanded by now, what you're expecting in terms of wage increases for the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Okay, Mario, Abreu will talk about this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look it's very early to say about what they're asking because normally they're asking something that is prohibited to say like not common to say. I would say that the expectation, that our expectation is that we'd be normally, they start with a big amount and that we close with the amount lower let's say in other words, we expect something very close to inflation that and maybe inflation maybe you have something in terms of profit sharing we'll have something this way. But we have been in our guidance as we talked with our employees Union before and now when we our guidance but we have some expectation that of course we cannot tell how much we have in our guidance. But I don't think, I think the guidance that we gave we had relatively protected with what's going to happen. Unless we have a big surprise in terms of what will be to come up with the agreement with it, right.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of where investment results could be a little bit lower in the second quarter and release to the first quarter is basically in terms of the shares with the equities in the stock market. The most part of our portfolio in terms of shares is marketed to market, but some of them are used to make some movements to sell and buy shares all the part of this is invested in funds which you have to make in mark to market have every month. It's basically in terms of shares, in terms of our portfolio in equity. In terms of the composition or the breakdown of our investments are set, I'd say to 95% is in bonds, going into bonds which as a record in terms of accounting maturity payment in and 3 billion or 3.5 billion are equities in stock market. This is a reason why in the second it was lower than the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Samuel, if I can just an idea then of your equity investments as a percentage of your total portfolio then is above 5% what was this ratio let's say a year ago, have you been increasing your exposure to equities?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in relative it reduced a little bit, has not increased our exposure in terms of shares or in terms of the equities. We're only talking about equity in stock market and all equities related to the permanent investments <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Most of the question that I had have been answered, there is only thing remaining is to regarding the performance of the securities portfolio, and again I don't if Domingos, Samuel would be best to answer, and when you look at the movements in your equity accounts we see a 400 million mark-to-market loss all available for sales securities, and I wanted to see if you could give some idea of what proportion of this mark-to-market loss comes from the bank balance sheet versus the securities portfolio in your insurance operations. The reason why I think it's &#x2013; I would like to know, this is a very volatile account which has very strong movements given when interest rates move in Brazil, so what could we expect for this line going forward, I mean what has been the performance in this mark-to-market losses are there, stabilized and you're recovering recently and basically what is the breakdown between bank and insurance operations?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, if you look at your audited financial statements you have the movements in your shareholders' equity, beginning equity earnings for the quarter, buildings and into some payment. And then there is some mark-to-market Cielo of portfolio and the movement in the quarter for that account is minus R$405 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look Mario let's say that first thing on insurance I would say there is no mark-to-market there because the fixed portion of what's for influence you will have you have mature it. The portfolio and equity is you'll mark-to-market in the equity there is no mark-to-market visibilities are there of course to classify like that. So the rest in the banks probably fixed portion that you have is when this tradable you've something mark-to-market in actually the bank?</p>
          <p>Sorry, sorry one moment please just. Sorry boys I don't think we got exactly your point and I don't know if you are able to clarify right now but I think it's better to, if you can talk later -</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi thank you, yes. Most of my questions have been answered but, just talking a bit about the margins that you saw in the quarter very strong margins and obviously Domingos you mentioned in the conference call that there was a very healthy loan mix you had a change in the loan mix it was very constructive for that with consumer and the SME and also the fastest growing bits of funding there to fund this for actually low cost funding.</p>
          <p>But if you look at the second half and certainly taking into account what you were saying which is that you could see some pick up from the corporate portfolio or to get close at least, or even meet your guidance overall in terms of loan growth you could get some kind of lumpy loan coming through, from a large corporate. Could we expect perhaps to see some margin pressure coming in, in the second half of the year as the loan mix kind of switches back and what do you expect from the funding side as well. Is there increasing pressure on funding cost and cost of funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. In terms of funding cost, no we're not &#x2013; is a very, very favorable moments for funding. We have a very good level of liquidity and result we are moving even to reduce the cost. We are not in any pressure in terms of funding and the sign is positive so, with our expectation. It relates to your point, in terms that we are expected to grow the portfolio in last quarters, yeah, this could be &#x2013; reduce the margin in terms of &#x2013; as a proportion of the total asset, yes, but in nominal terms. I'd expect that margin to continue to expand because we have very good perspective of growing. We have, look we have the matured stock, growth that we have so far in terms of that doing all of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Okay, in other words, we have approval for this new portfolio in a full six months, let's say, and we have very good expectation and continue to grow. So, in sense of &#x2013; let's say in terms, lets say margin in nominal terms our expectations continue to increase and, NIM, the net interest margin, as we mentioned we are to be honest, we are positively surprised that we are keeping the same level that we started with, 7.68. We have some movement to have these magnitude to reduce because we are working with lower margin now, right.</p>
          <p>But again once you have a start with the total portfolio with the sensitivity of the old portfolio with higher margin has been sustained at this margin level. But we've as we mentioned in the speech, we understand that the natural movements for these net debt margins to reduce going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you're talking about the margin maybe coming under pressure but net interest income healthy, net interest income growth, is that what the distinction you're making?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one moment please. I'd say that again, we have experienced a very, very strong growth in terms of spreads. We're growing and the economy is very, very good. Of course we have pressure in terms of spreads. We have &#x2013; the scenario is very, very competitive. But again we are returning in terms of spreads at the level that we had before at a price. We are not expected to reduce more spreads unless we have a scenario where we have expectation of reduction of delinquency. This way we don't expect to have dramatic change in this in a short time. In the long term, again, we've reinforce what we said before that, we are &#x2013; would be more operational with the lowest spread, we are changing our mix, we're changing our portfolio. So the net interest margins tends to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one quick one follow-up if I may on the credit quality and provisions, are you comfortable with the current level of provisioning that you're doing? I mean in terms of the quarter it was about as my calculations 1.35% of average loans, are you comfortable with this level of provisioning going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>The first quarter was to have an idea of 38.9, and now it's 37.5. You asked me if you are &#x2013; we are comfortable, I'd say that we are very, very comfortable with this level.</p>

          <p>Of course it depends on your portfolio that you have. It can change some time. If you grow more in a portfolio that we have more risk. Of course the margin tends to grow more, but the provisions tends to gain more representativeness. But assuming the same level these are not levels any change in mix portfolio this level 37.5 is very, very good for us.</p>

          <p>Hello Abreu. Hello, everyone. Thanks for the opportunity and congratulations on the results. Most of my questions have already been answered, but I like to touch on the competitive environment currently but if you could the elaborate a little bit more on, if you are seeing any signals of competition is starting to increase. I asked that because I mean look at the Central Bank data. We see some like decline in the spreads in the quarter though particularly <mark type="inaudible" /> announced on consumer credit which includes the payroll lending. So can you comment a little bit, it's basically the trend you're seeing that could have actually, lead to some margin pressure in the future? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look Marcelo, thank you for you comments and look it is &#x2013; as we're talking before with Victor Galliano, I think the competitive environment is very strong, it always has been very strong. To understand that, it's best to, in general terms to understand it's best to reduce the spread is not the competition is a force that can induce a reduction in spread, yes. But I think the most important thing that we can have to reduce spread is that perception about risk inside Brazil. When the standard spreads are going down not only because the competitive environment much more because the perception of the risk, everyone has a bank, everyone has been the same perception that the economy is growing in a good way. So, it means that there is space to reduce that.</p>
          <p>We have not &#x2013; we'll talk about some specific segments. We have, for example, you mentioned the vehicle &#x2013; auto finance, remember that till the end of 2008 the spread in this market was very, very low. During the quarter, the spread went up and now it's continuing in a way to reduce. We don't think it will reach the point that it was before the crisis, because I think the crisis gave not for us but everyone in the market that gave that some signs that there is the space to reduce spreads for some space in some side, that's what I understand.</p>
          <p>Specifically, I would say and not note some &#x2013; do not hear from our commercial people and specifically like this for not different in this market and not different in consumer side market about this, for competition. But again I think it is reduction spread is more because everyone has been the same let's say level the scenario in my opinion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. My question is regarding competition also, but more towards NDS. We've seen this bank growing at faster pace than private bank in the Brazil in the last months and also if you look at Bradesco financial statements you'll see that phenomenal landings are one of the highlight for the quarter. So my question is to what extent does thus NDS competition concern you and also do you feel the NDS could be cannibalizing their highest spread credit products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the NDS has a very important role in the Brazilian economy. I think they are, to be honest, they are the only instrument that we have to long-term finance in Brazil. We don't have funding for &#x2013; to manage that we have funding to finance operations for example 10 years, 12 years because we don't have appropriate funds for that. So I think the NDS has a very important role in this space.</p>
          <p>We are important not only, Bradesco, but all the banks in Brazil are very important part of the NDS and its operation in a way that we can reach different clients. So it's a &#x2013; but in that we're saying directly more or less on big groups or something like this. It should be an honor if you ask me if you agrees with this, I'd prefer that they use more this partnership with bank to be more. But, once they decided to make this, they will like to take the risk directly in that, in some part of the debt. But I don't think it should change dramatically the situation, when you see the data about market share, you can see that the Bradesco gain in market share, but look it is very specific market share, very specific market, all right. So, I don't think it should be making difference going forward.</p>
          <p>We understand that in the other markets, we don't, we cannot see markets, unless we will be active in other markets. First of all they don't have &#x2013; there is a limit for doing that, so I think they have more things to be learned, I think Brazil will ask for a very important moment for next five years, four years, we have a lot investment to be done going forward. So there is no reasonable measures &#x2013; I think they are more worth, we've had some discussions with not only that way that came creating and appropriate condition for the private sector or even the public bank, all the big banks to finance some kind of industry. We need all the support that we have.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi this is a follow-up question. I just want to make sure I understand the number that you mentioned answering a previous question. Did you say that around 86% of loan growth over the last year came from new clients, meaning clients that previously did not have a lending product from Bradesco. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at this in the last three years, you'll see a number very, very close up there. We posted this start in the, if you look in page 37 and I'm sort of seeing it is in Portuguese I don't know in English it will be in the same page. But you'll see very clearly, if you look the previous year you'll see the same. What does exactly is in particular we are finding not selling that it's new clients. Everything is new client. It says that 86% of this growth is expend for the people, that people who found that didn't have didn't have spread at the beginning of the spilt, right?</p>
          <p>Maybe they could be our client at that moment but they don't have in fact going to resolve or not, but just see that five important number of social security and let say okay. If you don't have these new clients that had client this year our client should be willing, a very close 40% that was the growth that we report. But you see what has been happening in the last, not only this year, but the last three years you will see something very similar, so that explains the question.</p>

          <p>That if you are not having many, many people to fulfill the capacity of people statistic, in fact what has happened here, we have a social mobility in Brazil, we are creating new opportunities of expanding perhaps in different line, we've new companies creating that they are needing for finance that. It explains more or less the dynamic that we have.</p>
