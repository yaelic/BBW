          <p>Good morning. Welcome to the Nestl&#xE9; Half-Year Results Presentation for 2012. As usual we'll go through a few slides before opening it up for Q&amp;A. We'll take the Safe Harbor statement as read, and, without delay, it's my pleasure to hand over to our Chief Financial Officer, Wan Ling Martello.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ian. Good morning. We are doing this webcast live from the Swiss Stock Exchange in Z&#xFC;rich, a very warm welcome to those of you who are joining us here in person. And before I get started, a special good morning to Roddy, who, you all know, is our head of IR. Roddy is recovering and will be back in tough form sooner than later. I know, Roddy, you are watching and, if I am not mistaken, this is the first call you're missing in 12 years. So Roddy this one is for you.</p>
          <p>We have an hour and half together this morning. I will take you through the highlights of our first half followed by a more detailed look at the performance for the year so far. I will then spend some time talking about the key elements of our cash flow performance as well as some important changes we have made in this period of building on our transparency in this area.</p>
          <p>With that, let us go to our group highlights. During the first half of 2012 we saw continuing macro trends with regards to consumer sentiments in both the developed and emerging markets. North America remains challenging, as you all know, while the European trading environment has deteriorated, no surprise, especially in the southern countries.</p>
          <p>In contrast, the emerging markets have continued to show robust levels of growth and this is the environment we are operating in. You know what is more important, though, is how we have anticipated, how we have responded to that environment, driving performance that is aligned with our strategic priorities. You know those priorities well. They are reflected in the Nestl&#xE9; roadmap, which I gather all you all have seen many times.</p>
          <p>I believe that the numbers we are going to discuss today demonstrate that we have indeed delivered once again, remaining true to our culture of combining shorter-term action with longer-term thinking. We have been fast moving and flexible, achieving strong performances relative to our markets, in both emerging and developed countries. We've done this by embracing opportunities, making right choices, tough choices even, to deliver sustainable profitable growth.</p>
          <p>We've continue to invest behind our innovations and our brands. We've been deepening and widening our distribution, and we've been focused on flawless execution and we have benefited from having a well-established global multi-tier strategy from value to premium, capturing growth across all consumer segments. And above all, we have benefited from having over 300,000 people aligned behind the Nestl&#xE9; roadmap, driving our performance such that regardless of the environment we are able to reconfirm our full year-guidance.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a look at our highlights, highlights of our performance. The group maintained the growth momentum, with an organic growth of 6.6% in the first half of 2012. This reflects a very good balance between real internal growth of 2.9% and pricing of 3.7%. The group trading operating profit was CHF6.6 billion, up from CHF6.2 billion in the first half of 2011. The resulting margin of 15% is in line with our first quarter conference call comment that our 2012 trading operating profit margin improvement will be weighted towards the second half.</p>
          <p>You also see here the group's operating cash flow of CHF5.1 billion, that's up from CHF2.1 billion in 2011. Now, why is that? This is mainly due to improvements in operations as well as working capital that I will come back to later on in my presentation. Other elements of this chart, as you can see, I'd like to highlight our net profit, which is up 8.9% at CHF5.1 billion, and the underlying EPS that rose 12.4% in constant currencies.</p>
          <p>Nestl&#xE9; continues to grow in all three regions. Our European performance reflects some tough comparisons for the globally managed businesses, but the zone continues to perform at the same level as Q1. Americas has maintained its momentum, which, with increases in both RIG and organic growth in North America in Q2, we actually saw increases in both RIG and organic growth from Q1 to Q2. This, despite the low consumer confidence there. Asia, Oceana and Africa continued to deliver double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Overall, as you can see on this slide, the emerging markets continued to do very well and grew by almost 13%. The developed markets posted 2.6% organic growth, a good performance in view of the environment in Europe. Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain had a slightly negative organic growth overall. And last, but not least, our billionaire brands grew over 8%, which is above the group average.</p>
          <p>Here you can see the overview of our zones and globally managed businesses. I'd like now to take you through the highlights of each of these individually. Starting with zone Americas, zone AMS, where we had 5.7% organic growth and a RIG that is flattish, at around negative 0.1%. While the North American trading environment remains challenging, like I said before, we actually saw a slight improvement in growth over the first quarter. The frozen aisle is continuing the trend we have seen.</p>
          <p>We recognize that as a market leader in this category, we are at the forefront of returning value to the category, be it through new product offerings or the approach we take in communicating to consumers. This is relevant whether we're talking about technologies, like flash freezing, that preserve the freshness behind our frozen brands, or successful new range extensions, such as those launched by Lean Cuisine and DIGIORNO.</p>
          <p>The frozen pizza category, unfortunately, remains soft overall, but our strong brands are enabling us to hold market share despite the significant pricing we have taken. Talking about pricing, we have also taken significant pricing action in ice cream. The category has also seen increased pressure from private label as well as the regional players in premium take home.</p>
          <p>An important step change in premium for us is the re-launch of Slow Churned, Dreyer's brand Slow Churned, bringing all the taste, but with half the fat and a third less calories. For those of you in the U.S., if you have not tried our Slow Churned, I urge you to run to the store, don't walk to the store, run, after listening to this webcast. I promise you, I love ice cream, you can tell, it's fantastic. It tastes great, it tastes even better than full fat.</p>
          <p>Okay, so we have also seen growth in ice cream snacks and the super-premium. Confectionary has accelerated year-to-date, with innovations such as Skinny Cow still growing very well. Nescaf&#xE9; showed good organic growth, thanks to Nescaf&#xE9; Classical and innovations like Nescaf&#xE9; Memento that target younger coffee consumers. COFFEE-MATE launched new varieties of natural bliss, enabling our consumers to individualize their coffee moment, that achieved high single growth &#x2013; high-single digit growth, I should say.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, for North America, pet care category is growing and we have actually increased our share. Our innovations delivered high-single digit growth, with examples like Beneful Baked Delights and Friskies Plus. We have also entered the ultra-premium segment through a specialty channel with Canyon Creek Ranch, which is a whole, natural food for adult dogs with added vitamins and minerals.</p>
          <p>Our Latin America story is very positive, with double-digit organic growth. The key drivers by category are Confectionery, Coffee and pet care, where Dog Chow and Pro Plan stood out. And, by geography, Brazil, Mexico, Andean and Plata regions are the highlights. Overall, market shares across all categories in the zone were mixed, with highlights being beverages in the U.S. and confectionery and pet care across the entire zone.</p>
          <p>The zone's trading operating margin increased 10 basis points. Moving on to zone Europe, the growth is in line with our Q1 performance, so again it's important to highlight that we did not see a deceleration, which is great. This despite the tough comparison to 2011. Although the trading environment has deteriorated during the year, as you all know as I mentioned earlier, particularly in the south, we continue to see growth both with PPPs, our popularly positioned products, and with premium products, with PPP growing at over twice the zone average.</p>
          <p>In the west, we achieved mid-single digit growth in the UK, driven by coffee and culinary, and in France, with most categories contributing. In addition, the zone's organic growth in Iberia, Italy and Greece actually remained positive. In the east, Russia improved in the second quarter, with strong contributions from coffee and chocolate while the Ukraine, Romania and Adriatic were the geographic highlights.</p>
          <p>By category, chilled culinary, Nescaf&#xE9; and frozen pizza were all strong. Kit Kat accelerated in the second quarter. Now ice cream, unfortunately, had a weak half due to poor weather, and Purina continued to accelerate, with strong performances in Russia and many Western European countries.</p>
          <p>Innovations, including the continued rollout of Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto, Nescaf&#xE9; Cr&#xE9;ma Sensazione are doing as is the rollout of Felix, especially in Eastern Europe. Zone Europe's underlying operating performance was good. The 100 basis points reported decline reflects the 2011 impact of restructuring and retirement plan changes.</p>
          <p>Next is zone AOA. The zone delivered good growth. This performance was driven by emerging markets, most notably, greater China, India, Africa, the Middle East and a number of Southeast Asian markets. Japan also showed solid growth. China and India continued to perform well and are in line with our expectations. Happy to report, there are two partnerships in China, which is Yinlu and Hsu Fu Chi, are very much on track.</p>
          <p>New commercial structures and distribution models are having a positive impact, particularly in Africa, where our continued focus on route-to-market has helped the good performances across all categories. In the Middle East, dairy, coffee and chocolate were the highlights, and as mentioned at Q1, the trading environment in Oceana remains tough. Japan however showed strong growth, driven by innovations such as the Nescaf&#xE9; Barista and Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto systems. And a strong performance once again from Kit Kat. I love Kit Kat too, aside from ice cream.</p>
          <p>Although the zone, we have done well throughout the zone, we've done very well across all price points, PPPs in chocolate, with Shark in China and Munch in India, ambient culinary with MAGGI, and mainstream products particularly in dairy and coffee have had double-digit growth. And in premium, the rollout of Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto in zone AOA continues to be a success.</p>
          <p>The zone's like-for-like trading operating margin actually improved in the first half of the year. We discussed this at the full-year results presentation. The reported figure of 18.9% reflects the dilution that we had expected from the partnerships in China. I will however mention that these partnerships are accretive, both from a cash flow and earnings per share standpoint.</p>
          <p>Okay, now we're moving on to our globally managed businesses. Here, we have Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition, with organic growth of 5.7% and a 2% real internal growth. Let's start with infant nutrition. Double-digit growth across the emerging markets more than offset the slower performance in the developed markets. The key growth drivers were South Asia, Brazil, China and the Middle East. Infant formula delivered double-digit growth, mainly driven by an acceleration of growth in the emerging markets. The U.S. sales have been under pressure as a result of general category softness and this is largely due to, no surprise, declining birth rates and really tough comparables from 2011, where we benefited from a competitor's product recall. Baby food improved its organic growth performance. Cereal, especially in India and Pakistan, are the highlights.</p>
          <p>Jenny Craig unfortunately continues to be under pressure in the U.S. We continue to take corrective actions and it's taking longer time for us to see some results to materialize. In terms of performance nutrition, our strategy of going back to basics is showing improved results. we're happy with how things are going for our performance nutrition category. Trading operating profit for Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition is down 50 basis points and this is due to the impact of weight management.</p>
          <p>Next we have Nestl&#xE9; Waters. We delivered mid-single digit growth, driven by North America and the emerging markets, which again reported double-digit growth. There was a slow start to the peak season in Europe in comparison to the same period of 2011.</p>
          <p>If we talk brands, highlights include Nestl&#xE9; Pure Life, the international sparkling waters, San Pellegrino and Perrier. I was told this morning that we could not find any Perrier in the neighborhood. And local spring water such as Poland Spring in the U.S., Al Manhal in Saudi Arabia, Min&#xE9;r&#xE9; in Thailand and Baraka in Egypt. Overall market shares have improved, especially in North America. Trading operating profit increased by 140 basis points, thanks to sustained growth, a positive price impact and significant cost reductions in our Water business.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Other segment. Nestl&#xE9; professional showed good growth for the first half of 2012, both in beverages and food. And this is driven mainly by strong pricing actions. Emerging markets, which represent around a third of Nestl&#xE9; professional's sales, delivered double-digit organic growth, with Brazil and China among the highlights.</p>
          <p>Nespresso continues to grow at a high level, very much in line with our expectations. Nestl&#xE9; Health Sciences delivered double-digit growth in North America as well as the emerging markets. Happy to report, Prometheus and Vitaflo our most recent acquisitions in Nestl&#xE9; Health Sciences, are both having also double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Cereal Partners Worldwide, CPW, achieved strong growth in emerging markets. This is partially offset by softness in developed markets. The realignment of BPW, which is Beverage Partners Worldwide, is on track. Pharmaceutical joint venture with Galderma and Inn&#xE9;ov also reported positive growth.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to product segments. As you can see here, all categories grew about 6% with the exception of prepared dishes, which was impacted by frozen food in North America. Let me now go through each of these product segments in more detail.</p>
          <p>First one up is powdered and liquid beverages. This product segment achieved 10.8% organic growth, this, I want to highlight, is on top of the 12.5% growth last year. All product segments, all markets, contributed passively, with Premium, Out-of-Home and PPP offerings delivering outstanding growth. That's all product segments and all markets, which is very, very exciting.</p>
          <p>Soluble Coffees had a strong performance and held market shares, despite price increases. There was double-digit growth from Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto, Nescaf&#xE9; 3 in 1 and Ready to Drink. By geography, growth was double-digit in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, our regional brand, Nescaf&#xE9; Dolca, performed strongly, with a good contribution from Mexico and Argentina. Western Europe grew high-single digit, with the UK, Spain and France among the highlights. There was also improved growth in Russia. The Powered Beverage business achieved high-single digit organic growth that's weighted to price and was double-digit in AOA. Ready to Drink also delivered high-single digit organic growth driven more by RIG, with a performance in AOA in particular. The trading operating margin reflected the input cost pressures for this product segment.</p>
          <p>Moving on to milk products and ice cream. This product segment posted 6.7% organic growth, with 0.8% RIG. This builds on the double-digit growth achieved in the same period last year. Our Milk business enjoyed strong growth, driven by Africa, Middle East, China and Pakistan. The continued success of this category is closely linked to our focus not just on innovation but also on nutrition. On this chart you will see the picture of a product call Nestl&#xE9; ACTICOL, which was launched in Chile and Mexico across various formats, from liquid to shelf stable. This is an example of our many value-added initiatives in this product category.</p>
          <p>Our ice cream business had positive organic growth with a strong contribution from emerging markets. In North America, pricing impacted real internal growth. In Northern Europe, this business, much like our Water business, suffered from a weaker start to the season compared with 2011. This segment did benefit from the very successful international launch of peelable ice cream, it's called Pirulo Jungly in Europe. This product group's trading profit margin increased, mainly due to ice cream.</p>
          <p>Moving on to prepared dishes and cooking aids. This product segment was characterized by strong growth in ambient culinary, partly offset by the frozen category in North America. I have already commented on the issues related to our frozen category in the U.S. In contrast, a very positive highlight is our frozen pizza across Europe.</p>
          <p>Ambient was driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets, especially in Africa, China and India. As an example, we've fortified our MAGGI cubes in Central West Africa with iron. This helps address one of the regions most widespread micronutrient deficiencies.</p>
          <p>Okay, now I have a question for this group here. I know Ian talked about Q&amp;A. The way I do Q&amp;A is I do the Q and you guys do the A. How many &#x2013; the question is, how many cubes do we sell in Central West Africa every day? I'll give you a clue, it's in the millions. Yes, sir?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>75 million. Going, going, gone. We sell more than 100 million cubes every day across the region. So next time we see each other and I ask you the same question, I'll be deeply disappointed if somebody gives me the wrong number. But so, that was just amazing, more than a 100 million cubes every day. This is not every year. So, I was supposed to take a water break when I was asking you guys a question. I got too excited.</p>
          <p>In Europe, continuing on this product segment category. We have innovations building on the Juicy Roasting concept that really expand the boundaries of modern cooking. Globally, chilled culinary is stable, with some bright spots such as Herta delivering strong growth in France, where we have also built on our nutrition, health and wellness promise through sodium reduction and improved consumer communications. The 10 basis points decline in trading operating profit margin was mainly due to the Frozen category.</p>
          <p>Next, we have Confectionary. Organic growth of 6.4% and a RIG of 4%. We have been able to deliver growth-on-growth also in this category. The emerging markets delivered double-digit growth, with brand highlights being Kit Kat, Shark and Munch. We have seen an improved performance in Russia with good Easter results and revised portfolio, including the newly launched Rossiya tablets. This, together with our new commercial structures there, gives us confidence about the outlook for that market.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., Skinny Cow continues to do well and our market shares remain stable. The strength of the Nestl&#xE9; portfolio in Confectionary lies in two things. First, our strong presence with local brands, and the geographic balance across the portfolio being the second point. In fact, over 50% of our Confectionary sales are now generated in emerging markets. This means we still have a lot of runway ahead of us.</p>
          <p>We continue to drive our business for the long-term, so while we are investing behind the growth in our emerging market businesses, we are also protecting the fundamentals and investing behind established brands, like Kit Kat. With the very successful launch of Kit Kat in Brazil and the continued strong performance in countries such as Middle East, Japan and Iberia, this 75-year-old brand continues to go from strength to strength. The Confectionary trading operating profit margin was impacted by combined effect of input costs, mix and last year's credit on restructuring and pension costs.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, our pet care business. The pet care business delivered organic growth of 8.2%, driven by strong growth in both emerging and developed markets. The performance in emerging markets was due to double-digit growth in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, specifically Mexico, Russia, Brazil and Argentina. Nestl&#xE9; grew market share in all regions and across all major pet food segments, thanks to strong brands, innovative products and expansion in new channels. The trading operating profit margin rose by 70 basis points versus last year and this is because of improved mix, pricing and lower fixed costs, partially offset by higher commodity costs.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the group's trading operating profit. On this slide you can see our usual margin bridge, the evolution of the trading operating profit margin, which is 15% for the half year. Let me pause here and stress the 15% is the reported result. The input cost pressure during the first half of this year led to a cost of goods increased. This is, however, mitigated by timely pricing and savings from NCE, you all have heard Nestle Continuous Excellence, which we continued to rollout across the organization. The impact after these savings was 50 basis points, and for the full year we very much maintain our outlook on our input costs of a low to mid-single digit percentage increase. So, no change to that.</p>
          <p>Looking at distribution costs, we were able to improve by 30 basis points. And this is due to the cumulative effects of mix and efficiencies. For example, in our Water business, you know we've been able to save &#x2013; get some savings out of doing some work on network optimization. Our reported marketing costs were down 40 basis points and I will come back to this on the following slide.</p>
          <p>Admin costs were up 20 basis points, due to the comparison with last year. The first half of 2011 saw a decrease of 150 basis points as we benefited from restructuring of post-retirement plans. Finally, we continued to invest in R&amp;D, driving our innovation, and this remains unchanged at 1.6% of sales.</p>
          <p>Like I said earlier, I was going to come back to marketing. Here we are. We consumer-facing marketing spend was again up in constant currency for the half. We have continued to drive better returns from our marketing communication investment, improving our return on our brand-building efforts, more bang for the buck so to speak.</p>
          <p>Specific global and regional initiatives have given us very positive results on costs, consistency and quality in media buying and planning. In addition, our consumer-facing communication continues to improve. Our creative content has been recognized, with Nestl&#xE9; now rank second based on the recent 2012 Effie Awards. The Effie Awards were founded in 1968 by the American Marketing Association as a means to recognize the most effective advertising efforts each year. And you can see on this slide on this chart, in the first half of this year our top quartile TV ad performance improved by 12 percentage points over 2011, continuing the very positive trend.</p>
          <p>We've also continued to enhance our investments in digital communications, including strategic partnerships, particularly in the digital space. Two examples from the many are Kit Kat and Perrier. Kit Kat in the U.K. encouraged 600,000 consumers to choose the next Chunky variety through various social media channels. Importantly, we were able to accurately measure the positive impact of the campaign on the Kit Kat brand sales. Perrier's The Drop generated more than 3 million, 3 million online views in less than a month. This is one example of how we are creating significant earned media success for our brands. Let me now share one of these with you.</p>
          <p>[Video Presentation]</p>
          <p>Good one. The performance of Perrier, as I mentioned earlier, was one of the highlights for Water in the first half, building on its double-digit growth in the first half of last year, so very impressive.</p>
          <p>Moving back now to our income statement, you can see here that there are no major changes year-on-year, with the exception of the net financing line. The low interest rate environment over the first half of 2012 coupled with our attention to cash management has delivered the results you see here.</p>
          <p>Now, staying with the theme of cash management, I will spend the next few slides talking about the key elements of our cash flow performance and some important changes we have made to build on our transparency in this area. Cash flow and our efficiency in managing cash well remains a key priority. And ,by the way, this happens to be something I strongly believe in. As I said to many of you when we met at the beginning of the year, cash is king.</p>
          <p>We will continue to focus on our operating margin and working capital management along with other critical elements that contribute to the cash flow, such as treasury and tax. At the same time, we want to build on our objective of being the industry reference for financial performance through increased transparency, highlighting the fundamentals of our cash flow evolution and, at the same time, delivering a more comparable disclosure. Before I go into the details of our new cash flow presentation, let's take look at where we stood at half year. As you can see here, the group's operating cash flow was CHF5.1 billion, up from the CHF2.1 billion in 2011. The chart shows that all the key elements contributed to the improvement.</p>
          <p>In particular, we had a higher operating profit of CHF0.5 billion, we've made a real improvement in working capital, but we also had an easier comparison to the same period last year and that has contributed to the CHF1.9 billion less in working capital that you see here. Given this easier comp, I would not expect the same level being maintained for the full year and, of course, it sets us up for a tough comparison next year.</p>
          <p>Having said that, looking at the longer-term picture on working capital, I'd like to bring back this chart that you've seen before. Working capital remains an area of focus. I'd like to give you a few concrete examples of how we look at this internally. It goes without saying that our structures, our policies, our principles have a direct bearing on working capital philosophy.</p>
          <p>Across Nestl&#xE9;, the concept of the efficient working capital management is driven from the top down. We have well-established cross-functional ownership structures with clear improvement targets and incentives. These elements, among many others, have been driving improvement across several dimensions.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we will not compromise on quality of service. Our customer service levels are one of the key performance indicators for our management team, and we aim to be the best in class. My message to you is that we will continue to drive performance going forward. Although there may be a certain degree of volatility, the long-term trend that we have seen here is set to continue.</p>
          <p>I'd like now to return to my point on transparency. Building on the level of detail that we've previously provided, we have enhanced our disclosure of the operating cash flows. The full details of this are on the Appendix on &#x2013; in your book or in if you download from on our website, it's in the Appendix with some illustrative examples based on full-year figures.</p>
          <p>In essence, we have broken out the cash flow before changes in assets and liabilities, added a line on the evolution in working capital, separated the disclosure of taxes and treasury activities. The objective behind all of these changes is to provide you with a better view on where the cash is being generated. And at the same time, our definition of operating as well as free cash flow is now better aligned with our peer group companies.</p>
          <p>Now while we are discussing changes I would also like to draw your attention to some of the slides we have included in the Appendix. In the spirit of being proactive, we have outlined for you the changes in pension accounting under IAS 19 and how it will impact our P&amp;L from 2013 onwards. In the interest of time, I won't go into the details here. I will just emphasize that this is only an accounting change. It will have a 20 basis points to 30 basis points impact on our margin, but, needless to say it has no bearing on our underlying performance or our cash generation capacity. We will, of course, restate 2012 when we report 2013.</p>
          <p>This brings me to my concluding remarks. As I said in my opening comments, I believe this first half performance in a very tough environment demonstrates the power of alignment behind the Nestl&#xE9; roadmap. It's been said that great global companies do three things really well; they know the local consumers very well, they leverage globally and they transfer knowledge very effectively. Nestl&#xE9;, as you all know, is the very decentralized organization. We know how to meet our consumer needs, we know how to partner with our local trade, we are part of the fabric of the local community. The competitive advantage that Nestl&#xE9; has that is not obvious to outsiders is our ability to align 330,000 people across 150 countries. For me, coming from the outside, this absolutely blows me away.</p>
          <p>There is also no doubt that the roadmap is as relevant today to drive performance as it ever was. We have delivered what we needed, top and bottom line in the first half, to confirm our guidance of achieving the Nestl&#xE9; model once again in 2012. And we have done so well continuing to invest and to make the right choices, investments that will enhance our future performance, that balance our short and long-term focus that I mentioned earlier. Nestl&#xE9; has delivered in the first half, will deliver for the full year and continues to enhance our longer-term capabilities to win in our markets globally.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation. Let's now open it up for discussion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Alex Molloy from Credit Suisse. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, on cash flow, clearly in 2011 this was an area of considerable investor focus and generally not particularly favorable. With the better cash flow performance in H1, can you say to what extent was that due to increased focus on management's part and a determination to improve the cash flow performance? That's my first question. My second question is margins in Europe were down 100 basis points. As you said, pensions and restructuring played a role in that. Could you say whether underlying margins excluding this were up or down? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I just talk. Hi, Alex. How are you? First of all, before I should have talked about the new rules of engagement. We expect questions to be multiple parts, if not, we do not answer those questions. So you actually without me telling you the new rules of engagement, you had a two part question.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash flow, definitely, categorically there is increased management focus. And so if you look at where we're going to end the year, it will not be, like I said earlier, do not extrapolate, so like the improvement in working capital, we will improve vis-&#xE0;-vis the position last year, but don't do an extrapolation. But all the elements, whether it's improving operating margin, it's better cash management, better management on working capital. To your point, it is management's focus and determination to make an improvement in cash flow. In terms of our zone Europe's trading operating margin, you're right. Excluding that, we actually improved.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just back on to that cash flow, trade, net working capital, do you have any sort of goal in your mind where you think you can get to as a proportion of sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We obviously, like I said before, do have internal goals. And we actually, as part of management's incentives, short-term bonus, everybody has a goal. So, we have specific targets by business that will roll up to the group. Obviously, it's a target that I'm not going to share with you all, but we do have goals internally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the U.S. issue, you say that basically organic growth accelerated in Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us an indication of what the acceleration was? Because if you look at the Americas, it seems if you strip out Q1, Q2, organic seemed to slow down somewhat overall for the Americas. And I'm just trying work out well if the U.S. actually went up, what was maybe deteriorating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in the U.S. for the U.S. market, we actually saw an acceleration from Q1 to Q2. I'm not going to specifically say which category, which product, but overall, our U.S. market did go up, both in terms of RIG and organic growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just on your commodities guidance remains sort of unchanged. If anything, if you look at some of those soft commodities, they actually seem to be coming down even quicker than potentially expected. Is it now you're seeing the grain complex and saying that this will offset the soft commodities? Is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly. Because we look at it, like you know our guidance is a basket of input costs. And so you see it's a mix in the U.S., given the drought in the Midwest, so we're going to see an increase in those commodities coming from the corn, soybean. But on the other ones, they're going down. So in overall as a mix, our guidance is not changing, which is the low to mid-single digit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just a last one on sort of coffee generally. But Nespresso, you're talking about the growth remains strong, but you're starting to mention the word, it's getting competitive out there. Can you just give us an idea of where you were in terms of the Nespresso growth? Is it still running at 20% plus or has it dropped into the mid-teen level?</p>
          <p>And then just on Dolce Gusto, maybe just give an idea of the dynamics there, because that obviously is growing super fast as well, and maybe we should be focusing more Dolce Gusto growth dynamics rather that what's happening with Nespresso.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you should be focusing on both Nespresso and Dolce Gusto. Nespresso like I said, the growth is very much in line with our expectation. We have before, we've been giving a lot more details on Nespresso, I don't know if from a competitive standpoint that served us well. So I will say that we are very happy with the growth in Nespresso. It's very much in line with our expectations. And I think it was a few, I can't remember which conference call where we said that our expectation is to grow the Nespresso business by CHF0.5 billion.</p>

In terms of Dolce Gusto, very, very strong performance. It's again, we're not giving specifics, it's obviously double-digit, very strong.

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean-Philippe Bertschy, Vontobel. You were like mentioning China as well several times. You had two acquisitions last year, Hsu Fu Chi and Yinlu. I guess you will give some additional insights in September. But can you share maybe with us the growth for these two companies and how do you see the synergies going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, are those two questions or two parts of one question. Okay, you qualify then. We do not give specific growth numbers for Hsu Fu Chi and Yinlu, but I will tell you that we are very happy with how it's going. It's very much in line with expectations. And in terms of synergies, it's more, the acquisition, when we talk about acquisition, it's interesting, it's not sometimes necessarily on just cost synergies. If you think about the Hsu Fu Chi acquisition, overnight it gave us access to thousands of sales force that now penetrates into the third, fourth tier cities in China. In Yinlu, it gave us entry into the breakfast category in China. So, those are great from a synergy standpoint, the sales force resource. And so but we are just really happy it's very much on track, so those two partnerships are going really well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe the second one on Nutrition. I think infant formula was growing double-digit globally.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Infant formula is growing double-digit in emerging markets. That's more than offset the ones in developed markets.

        <plist>
          <p>Daniel Grueneisen, Vontobel. I'd have a question on the Western world or developed world. I think it's beautiful to see Nestl&#xE9;, what's going on here as emerging market is growing very robust and that we have some weakness in the Western part or in the developed world. What can be a strategy for Nestl&#xE9; to kind of quantify what goes on? Is it PPP that you try and launch more aggressively or put more aggressively a focus on, or is it pricing? That's what you do, I think, be it in the Pizza business, to try and offset maybe a soft market. And could you elaborate a bit on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first of all, thank you, thank you for your question. It's interesting when you're &#x2013; when you see results like the ones that we just released and we just announced. By no means &#x2013; this is no walk in the park. I mean, this is not. These are hard-fought numbers in the developed markets, even in emerging markets, thanks to a very strong team at Nestl&#xE9;.</p>
          <p>In Europe, it's both PPP and Premium that's doing well. And so to be able to get the kind of numbers in developed markets where it's very challenged from a macro perspective, innovation is going to be continued to play &#x2013; to be key. And so whether it's the peelable ice cream or is Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto, those will continue to serve Nestl&#xE9; well.</p>
          <p>We don't &#x2013; people always ask what we do see in terms of the balance of the year for U.S., for Europe. It's &#x2013; I mean, it's hard to tell. But what's very comforting for us is the fact that we do not see a deceleration going from Q1 to Q2. And we are cautiously optimistic, given our product categories and what we've seen in the first half that we will, hence our confidence of reconfirming that we will once again deliver the Nestl&#xE9; model in a &#x2013; for the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael Studer, Bank am Bellevue. One question regarding the Americas again, maybe on Q2. You said the U.S. is growing in RIG and organic growth. So is the conclusion right that you've seen quite some slowdown in Latin America? And maybe you can point out in which countries and maybe also how you see the remainder of the year?</p>
          <p>And my second question, maybe an update on Pfizer and Nutrition business what we should expect there? When to close and consolidation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the Pfizer Nutrition. We will &#x2013; when we announced the transaction back in, gosh, that was April, I think that was week two for me on the job. It's &#x2013; we had said that we anticipate closing probably beginning of next year or, at the earliest, end of this year. We are going through obviously the process of working with Pfizer in terms of how we transition services, but, more importantly, we are working with the regulatory authorities in every jurisdiction to get approval. And I'm happy to report that so far we have already seen a handful, or more than a handful, of countries approving &#x2013; giving us the okay. But that's going to &#x2013; again, no change in timeline. Michael it's going to be beginning of next year likely. So, no change.</p>
          <p>In terms of Americas, like I said earlier, we saw actually from both from a RIG and OG perspective, acceleration for the U.S., or North America in general and for the U.S. specifically. And so that that was again very, very , very nice to see. So we are, again, cautiously optimistic. That does not mean the Latin America is slowing down. We &#x2013; I know in some of the calls with our peer group companies, some people have highlighted Brazil slowing down, or Russia. We're not seeing that. Brazil is keeping &#x2013; for us anyway, we are mainlining our momentum in Brazil. Russia actually is recovering very nicely for us. So that's &#x2013; it's good to see that, so no slowdown.</p>

But needless to say, we're really pleased with how it's doing this year. And ,obviously, our expectation is that we hope that it will continue, but kudos to the Nestl&#xE9; Waters team.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's an interesting question, too, because sometimes we get questions about, do you expect the all categories to sort of like deliver on the Nestl&#xE9; model? We always say that all categories and all regions should contribute to the Nestl&#xE9; model.</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:30). Can you give us a little bit more color on your PPP growth breakdown between the emerging markets and the developed markets? And the targets that you have for these PPP products in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do not give targets in terms of the PPP products. But you know what's really interesting, I know when I first joined Nestl&#xE9; and I heard about PPP, I always &#x2013; the first thing that you go to is PPP is for emerging market. Well, I was wrong. It's actually for the emerging consumer. And so whether the consumer is in the emerging market or in the developed market, it resonates to that consumer who wants to by our PPP products.</p>
          <p>In terms of percentage of, it's overall about 12% today and it's very accretive in terms of growth and profit. And, clearly, as I said in my presentation earlier that it has helped both the emerging markets as well the developed markets. So, it's really fascinating to see that how well PPP is also doing in the developed countries.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just on the &#x2013; what you said about net debt. And I know you sort of moved to a bigger payout ratio and away from doing buybacks. Is that still the way you feel when you've been in the job for six months or so? Is that the way you would continue or do you see that in the future potentially you'd move back doing some buybacks? Or would you rather continue to increase the payout ratio, which is very good already? But is that how you would probably prefer to return cash to shareholders, if you have sufficient?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, John. We do not see the two being mutually exclusive. We have always said that we strive for a sustainable dividend policy. And if you go back, how long have we started tracking dividends? It's been over 50 years. And if you look back in the last 50, I think 56 years, we have never decreased our dividend in absolute terms. So, I would argue that that's pretty sustainable. And so we're not walking away from a sustainable dividend policy.</p>
          <p>We have said since the end of last year that we will not &#x2013; there is no new buyback program and that is more opportunistic to the extent that we have excess cash, absolutely we'll look at that. So I don't look at those as mutually exclusive. Dividend policy, it's going to be sustainable and that doesn't change. And no new buyback now, but we're open to that when the circumstances are right.</p>

          <p>And just a question on the pension changes. I must admit I was quite surprised to see what the impact will be for you guys next year. Of course, it is just an accounting change. But you mentioned that your finance costs will go up by CHF250 million. I guess that will be a cash outflow, because you say there's going to be no cash impacts, but that net finance cost of CHF250 million would that...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That's actually a difficult one to measure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because you add Nespresso, yes that's difficult. So don't have an exact figure. No we don't. But that's an interesting. We should take that question back, Ian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, you should in to account Nespresso, Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto, the rate of growth that they've grown. But then you've also got other categories where the classification of premium is blurred, at best, especially for ice cream and other areas. So it would be a difficult one to give you an exact percentage on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, you could think that Nespresso, Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto, NAN, our sparkling water, San Pellegrino, Perrier, you can tell H&#xE4;agen-Dazs ice cream. So yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's interesting what you say about the dichotomy between in Europe where you've got the low end doing very well and you've got the high end doing well and then, obviously we all think, well, how big is the middle part and what's happening with the middle part? Is that the part of the portfolio that's under some pressure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, but if you see our coffee, I talked about our powdered beverage, our beverages business, it's all markets, all product segments contributing, and that's very much our mainstream line, right. But it's the dichotomy. One of the great strengths, one of the capabilities of an organization like Nestl&#xE9; is the ability to operate on sort of like both ends of the spectrum, to be able to be successful in PPP and to be successful in sort of like the high-end with Nespresso and other product categories. That's speaks to capabilities.</p>
          <p>What you all see are in black and white, the numbers. And obviously the company's capability manifests itself on the numbers. But being on the inside, the other thing that's amazing to me is you know I always say what is the acid test of somebody good or a collection of people if they're good. It's their ability to manage something new without having to master it first.</p>
          <p>If you look at we as a manufacturer, are able to go into Nespresso and 50% of our sales is now through e-com, and a significant chunk of our sales is also through boutiques, over 270 boutiques on a global basis. Having come from a retail background, it's not easy to have a retail footprint that is meaningful to be able to provide great customer experience when you walk into our boutiques. Those are capabilities that even though Nestl&#xE9; was never a retailer, was never involved in e-com, to now be able to do that, that speaks to a great strength of Nestl&#xE9; is the ability to manage something new without having to master it first. So I'm, as a new person, I am just really, really impressed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our first question comes from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (67:53). Ma'am your line is now open. You may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Wan Ling and Ian. This is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (67:56) from Morgan Stanley. Two questions from me. The first one is on Russia. It looks like you've actually had an inflection point in performance there. Is that because of the macro environment or is that because of the restructuring that you've been doing? For example, I think it's quite interesting that in confectionary you did well. We heard some cautious comments from one of your competitors there.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on pet care. I noticed that your growth has been steadily improving and is close to 9% in the second quarter. You mentioned expansion in new channels and positive mix. But could you give us bit more color, specifically in the U.S. market? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. On Russia, I will give credit to the Russia team as well as our zone Europe management. I think we had talked about Russia being the market was bit of a challenge for us in the past. And so internally they've been doing some restructuring. They've been bringing some innovation to the market. And so the recovery really is thanks to the management team's focus on quality, on innovations, so kudos to them.</p>
          <p>Just like we did not blame the macroeconomic environment when we weren't doing well in Russia, I will also not take away the credit that we will give to the management team there when things are going their way. So Russia clearly is really, really nice to see the turnaround in that market, so kudos to that team.</p>
          <p>Pet care growth actually in Russia, was as long as I continue with the team in Russia, pet care, also strong growth in Russia along with Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto. In terms of pet care, the growth is also helped by the fact that we're going into a specialty channel and so in the U.S. So really great to see that we're increasing share as well as the category is growing. But the thing that's really interesting also for pet care is we're doing well in emerging markets, in Latin America as well as Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>And the thing, if you look at pet category, we are actually under indexed in both Latin America and AOA. Which again is what makes it so exciting for us, a very strong category like pet care for us to be under indexed in those two regions or two zones, it's very exciting for us to be able &#x2013; and we're seeing traction now. It used to be when for the pet care category if the U.S. is not doing well, sort of like the whole product segment for us kind of goes with how the U.S. goes, so it goes for the category. But now with us doing well, seeing traction in emerging markets, in Latin America and in Eastern Europe, they are now becoming a meaningful share of our pet care product segment. And that's really a lot of credit to the team for bringing a lot of innovation into that category.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (71:32). Sir, your line is now open. You may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ian and Wan. I have two questions. The first is about the cash flow, net working capital. Would you elaborate a little bit more about the development of net working capital? What were the main drivers that increased the flow in order to get more insight on that?</p>
          <p>The second question is coming back to North America again, could you let us know where you gained market share, in which categories and in which categories you lost market share in U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. I'll take the second part first, North America, specifically in the U.S. We don't obviously give market share by product category, by geography. I will say that it's mixed and I've I think mentioned a few categories earlier on in my presentation. I will say this, however, that when you all look at market share from Nielsen for instance, and we do, we tend to look at it on a more granular, which is more comparable. I'll give you an example, for instance, Water. We don't compare, for instance, our Water to sugared beverages in the U.S. Which, if you don't dive deeper and get the right level of granularity, it could be very, very misleading. So, needless to say, for U.S. it's a mixed bag. And we do track it, obviously, on a monthly basis. And anyway...</p>
          <p>In terms of working capital, it's a combined effect of both efficiency as well as our increased focus on driving down how much we tie-up in terms of working capital to support the kind of growth that we see. But also like I said earlier, it's an easier comp for us versus last year. And but one thing that you all should take away from this meeting &#x2013; this session, is that there is increased focus on cash and working capital in general by all of us at Nestl&#xE9; and it's something that Paul Bulcke has &#x2013; it's a top-down &#x2013; it's top-down driven by all the way from the top from Paul. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just add, I don't want to contradict, but it's always the exception that proves rule. As Wan Ling mentioned in her presentation, we have seen some gains in market share in different categories, pet care for one. And we have also seen them across our Pizza range and Lean Cuisine, due to the innovations we've launched there and amongst others, including confectionary. So I think you can say that it's a mixed picture, but, overall, we are holding our category growth in various key areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a follow-up question about the program, the accounts program. In the past, you gave cost savings of CHF1.5 billion, and do you still give this guidance for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We &#x2013; that's you're referring to Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence, our program. And that's going in line with expectations, and we are staying with the CHF1.5 billion guidance that we have given you at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>It's really interesting if you think about Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence, it's not &#x2013; people, again, as a new person when I first came in, I thought, well, it's some kind of a productivity program that's kind of like a one-time shot, right, it's you do it for a year, you do it for two years, you do it for three years, and it's kind of like all over. But it's not; it's really a change in mindset. And so it's pushing the ownership to the person responsible for doing the specific task, for doing the specific process. And so the way to look at it is we value &#x2013; whatever we do, we value what we do only if it brings value to the consumer.</p>
          <p>So it's a continuous process, it's at all levels and, in fact, NCE has not been rolled out entire &#x2013; to the whole organization. So it's still very much in the process of rolling out. And it's at all levels, it's not just at the COGS line, the cost of goods line, you'll see it in admin, you'll see it in distribution. And so it's across in the whole enterprise affecting all the lines on your P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>So, again, Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence is great. It's a mindset change and it's a really &#x2013; it's, again, another very phenomenal thing that's going on at Nestl&#xE9;.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>And our next question comes from Mr. Warren Ackerman. Sir, your line is now open. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Wan Ling. It's Warren Ackerman here at SocG&#xE9;n. Hope you can hear me. I've got two questions and one clarification. The first question is were you a bit disappointed with confectionery margins down 200 basis points? And then related, six months into the job, just be interested to hear where you think the biggest margin upside is in the Nestl&#xE9; group, either by category or by geography?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, Wan Ling, would you better touch on Japan? Obviously, an important market for Nestl&#xE9;, very attractive margin structure. Just interested in what the growth was, what's driving that. Is it sustainable? And then on the clarification, marketing down 40 bps, but consumer facing marketing up 1.3%. I'm bit confused by that. What marketing are you doing that is not consumer facing. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Warren, it's nice to hear from you. Why are you not here in person? I'm disappointed. But, Warren has four parts to his question even though he's not here in person and we'll attempt to answer that. Okay, let's start with marketing 40 basis points down. When we talk about marketing expenses, Warren, it's not just consumer-facing portion of it, it includes, obviously, what I call infrastructure, such as sales and marketing people, the folks who work with &#x2013; who do a lot of work on digital, so it's the SG&amp;A or it's &#x2013; what I call the infrastructure part of marketing. So, yes, it's &#x2013; when we talk about marketing, it's not just the consumer facing.</p>
          <p>The 40 basis points down, first of all, were &#x2013; in constant currency were up, like I said, 1.3%, and that is on top of last year that increased about 6%. But, more importantly, when we talk about marketing, you have to put it in context, okay. First half of last year, for instance, in Nespresso, we saw the first-ever global launch of PIXIE machine, which was highly successful. And so we had a lot of marketing spend behind that launch. And, obviously, this first half, we will not &#x2013; we did not have a new machine like PIXIE. So marketing spend in that &#x2013; for that specific &#x2013; for Nespresso is down compared to last year. But having said that, we're excited, we have two new machines coming out for &#x2013; or have come out actually, for Nespresso that will be introduced to consumers second half.</p>
          <p>The other thing, too, is if you look at first half of last year, Warren, we had big events. You talk about Brazil had celebrated its 90th anniversary. In Brazil, a lot of marketing spend behind that event. The Philippines, another key market for us, had spent &#x2013; also celebrated 100-year anniversary.</p>
          <p>And also if you look at Dolce Gusto it's sort of like now in critical mass, so we did not give you the growth for Dolce Gusto, but it's double-digit, pick a number, whatever number you want to pick 20, whatever 30. That's not the number, by the way. But you would not expect the same level of marketing spend increased year-on-year to support that kind of an increase. So marketing spend for first year, that's the reason behind the 40 basis points decrease year-on-year. So that's part.</p>

          <p>On that very quickly, so if you look at the whole marketing bucket, I mean, would you be able to give us a rough idea of how much is kind of consumer-facing and how much is kind of the other kind of "infrastructure"? Just to trying to get a feel for whether you think this marketing as a percentage of sales being down, is that going to be long-term secular trend?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And Warren knows that, but Warren is just trying. Nice try. Okay, let me &#x2013; can I move on to your three other parts? Good. Thank you. In terms of confectionary down in terms of trading operating profit margin, that's because of we &#x2013; it's because of in Europe, where we had the credit last year from pension restructuring as well as a decrease in restructuring costs. So actually underlying confectionary margin actually improved if you were to strip that away. So that's obviously, that's confectionary in Europe because those two are related.</p>
          <p>In terms of Japan, we are seeing really, really, again kudos to the Japanese team, we are seeing strong growth. And it's a combination of the introduction of innovations like Dolce Gusto, coffee and also Kit Kat doing well. So, very happy to see that.</p>
          <p>And your last question, which is wanting me to opine on margin upside for the group by category. I will share this with you, when I first came into the organization meeting, whether it's CFOs from our key market, I also had the good fortune in the first month, April, we had the Key Market Conference as well as the Market Manager Conference. So I had the good fortune of meeting a lot of people, also had the good fortune of talking about kind of like my perspective as a new person coming in.</p>
          <p>And I shared an outside in perspective.</p>
          <p>I said Nestl&#xE9; from a top-line perspective, if you were to look at the last 10 years compared to our peer group companies, competitors, we're best-in-class. That's just the last 10 years. If you look at margin, we have been able to improve margin in the last 10 years, meaningful increase in margin. But we're in line with peers. And so, very much to the point that if you look at margin upside, there's still a lot of headroom. There's still a lot of opportunity to improve.</p>
          <p>And the key thing also when I was talking to our folks about that, the interesting thing about those two &#x2013; if you look the last 10 years against a competitive set, we were probably one of two companies that we are able to deliver both top-line and margin improvement.</p>
          <p>You see some companies who are able to drive top-line performance, but not so much in margin or the other way around, margin improvement but not top-line growth. So kudos to the team to be able to do both. But having said that, our margin is very much in line with peers, so a lot of upside because we strive to be again the financial reference for the industry. So a lot of &#x2013; we would continue to drive margin improvement. Warren, I think I answered your four parts to your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In the interest of time, could we just take one more question from the phones, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And our next question comes from Ms. Barbara Ambrus. Ma'am your line is now open. You may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, thank you. This is Barbara Ambrus of LBBW. I have a question, actually a question or a clarification for North America. Would you please maybe tell us if RIG and organic growth, you said they improved versus Q1 in Q2. Would you tell us if they were positive, please?</p>
          <p>And a similar question on organic growth and RIG in Europe in the first quarter. Western Europe seems to have performed better than Eastern Europe, and it sounds as if it was vice versa in the second quarter. Could you maybe elaborate a bit on that?</p>
          <p>And I have a question on Nutrition. The weight management business has been under pressure for years now because of weak economy. I understand that. And you said you were going to take measures. What are those? I mean, scaling down the business or enhancing investment? Maybe you can elaborate a bit. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Barbara, for the questions. Let me, there are three, three parts of that, let me take Nutrition. Yes, we recognize we are not happy with the way the business has performed in the last year and obviously going to this year. It's interesting. The industry in general is not doing well. But having said that, we're not going to hide behind that. There are things that we can be doing and that the team continues to try different things, it's interesting.</p>
          <p>Paul in one of our road shows, Paul Bulcke had said, if you think about mother, the women, and the household, it's sort of like in terms of in the order of priority, takes care of the baby first, then takes care of the pet, then takes care of the other children, it's the husband, if the husband is lucky, and then finally herself. So in tough macroeconomic type environment, the mother, the woman in the household, who is really our target audience, tends to not take care. She is not the priority. So but having said that, like I said, we are not going to hide behind the fact that the consumers are the challenged and that the industry as a whole is difficult.</p>
          <p>We are, the team is looking at different dimensions, everything from celebrities to online marketing to focusing on healthy lifestyle both at work, collaborating with the American Heart Association. So they're trying different things and I will say it's not for lack of trying. It's just unfortunate that we're not seeing the kinds of improvements that we like to see. So hopefully, the next time we get together we will be to tell you that there's some light at the end of tunnel.</p>
          <p>So that's a question on weight management. In terms of North America, in the U.S. specifically, I will stress all businesses had positive, had accelerated in terms of RIG and OG, all businesses in the US. So that's US. And in terms of zone Europe, I think your question was Western Europe versus Eastern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Western versus Eastern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're seeing good growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so across the group, we've seen good growth across all businesses in all categories. But you're right in that there are some key drivers, east or west, and of course some positive turnarounds as we're seeing some better growth in Russia, which is also encouraging. And that's had an influence on the east, west divide as well.</p>

          <p>So I think that was our last question, Ian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>That was the last question. I'm sorry. I have to drag Wan Ling away to some one-on-ones now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for the questions and thank you for those of you who made the effort to come here in person. I would just like to close today by repeating that Nestl&#xE9; has delivered a performance in the first half of 2012 that both is in line with our strategic priorities and really sets us up for further performance improvement in the future.</p>
          <p>And, on a personal note, I am very excited to be part of that future and I look forward to sharing it with you in the years ahead. Thank you again.</p>
