          <p>My name is Marvin <mark type="ph" /> and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marvin <mark type="ph" />, and good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our Q4 and Full Year 2011 Results Conference Call. The objective of this call is to review our solid performance in 2011, focus on our outlook first for 2012 and provide some additional details on the transaction that we announced this morning with Micromet.</p>
          <p>I am joined today by Kevin Sharer, our Chairman and CEO, and several members of our management team, including some who are participating in such calls for the first time. Kevin will provide the introductions today, although we'll still keep our prepared comments brief and focus only on those that provide added color beyond what's in our press release. We'll use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in a summarized form means that through the course of our presentation today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially.</p>
          <p>I would also note that in connection with the U.S. securities laws and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, we will not be discussing the terms of the Micromet transaction on this call. For more information on the terms of the merger, please review our Form 8-K that was filed earlier today to which the merger agreement with Micromet is attached. Shortly, we'll also file the tender offer statement on Schedule TO, including the offer to purchase.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Well, we begin 2012 as a year of transition: transition in leadership and transition to more growth across a variety of fronts, including financial, strategic and organizational areas. You'll hear about all of that today in our more detailed remarks and in the question and answers.</p>
          <p>First, I would like to thank the many and Amgen staff who are listening on this call and who will hear it later for a very strong 2011. I really, really appreciate what we accomplished. It positions the company well for the future and we fulfilled our mission again, so job really well done. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Although 2012 is only 26 days old, we're off to a good start. We're very pleased with our acquisition of Micromet, we'll talk more about that today, but it advances our pipeline and our fundamental R&amp;D capability. We issued guidance today that puts us well on the path to our 2015 goals and beyond. I feel good about that. I also have to note the recent increase in stock price. It's about time.</p>
          <p>I would like to publicly thank Roger for his service these 11 years. Roger is with us today. You know him well. He has transformed R&amp;D at Amgen. He has delivered for millions of patients and has been a superb leader of the business and his function and industry. We will miss him, but we will benefit long after his transition from his many, many contributions. Thank you Roger.</p>
          <p>Sean Harper has big shoes to fill. However, I have total confidence he can do just that and Sean is with us today. We are also joined today for the first time by a new executive team member, Tony Hooper, who joined us a short while ago, but it seems like a long time. He is fully integrated onto the team and we are very, very happy to have him with us. Tony, welcome. And Bob and I are working very closely to have a seamless transition and we are pleased with our progress. The company continues to move ahead and get stronger. I would like to celebrate and acknowledge and say that Bob earned this new job in every way and I look forward to passing the reins to him soon.</p>
          <p>So, Bob, let me turn the floor over to you to talk in more detail about your views of how we did in 2011 and what's on tap for 2012. Bob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you, Kevin.</p>
          <p>As you have seen from our results for the fourth quarter, we ended the year with momentum and we expect 2012 to be even stronger. I will touch on some of the highlights. We entered 2012 with our Neulasta franchise growing, with ENBREL maintaining its market leadership and a more stable outlook for EPOGEN, particularly now that we have long-term contracts in place. Prolia and XGEVA are obviously an important part of our outlook for 2012 and beyond and we will build on the solid foundations that we have established for these brands with launches expected in new countries throughout 2012.</p>
          <p>We are obviously looking forward to the upcoming ODAC review of XGEVA for bone mets prevention. But I think it's important to emphasize the early progress that we have made in the biggest opportunity for XGEVA, which is with patients whose cancers have already spread to bone. In this setting, XGEVA is both driving the growth of the market and taking share, a trend, which we expect to continue.</p>
          <p>Our other products in the growth phase including Sensipar, Vectibix, and Nplate contributed nearly $1.5 billion in revenues last year with healthy double-digit growth rates. And the outlook for them in 2012 is strong. A number of important events this year will help inform our longer-term outlook. In particular the Sensipar EVOLVE outcomes data will be available later this year, as will the interim Phase 3 data for T-VEC in melanoma, as well as important Phase 2 data for AMG 785 and AMG 145.</p>
          <p>We are making progress on executing against the strategy we laid out for you in our business review in April. Our partnership with Watson announced in December to develop and commercialize a portfolio of Oncology biosimilars strengthens our position to capitalize on the growth potential of this new market opportunity.</p>
          <p>And of course today we've announced an important strategic move with Micromet. Advancing innovative medicines for grievously ill patients is central to our strategy and that is what Micromet represents. We are impressed with their lead molecule and the broader potential applicability of their technology and we believe we can add value to what they've created with our clinical capabilities in hematology and oncology, our expertise in developing and manufacturing complex novel biologics and our marketing expertise in this field.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn it over to John, who will walk you through in details our financial results for 2011 and provide clear guidance for 2012. Jon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. I'll focus on providing highlights of our results of the fourth quarter and the full year, discuss our balance sheet, cash flow and recent capital allocation activities and then provide our financial guidance for 2012.</p>
          <p>You can see our fourth quarter results on page 6. Product revenues grew by 4%. Prolia's growth accelerated in the quarter to 60% compared to Q3 and XGEVA continued a strong trajectory, growing 30% over the same period. EPOGEN sales group 2% compared to the third quarter, starting to demonstrate stability following the dosing adjustments on reimbursement and label changes during the year. Our Filgrastim franchise, led by Neulasta, continued its momentum, growing 7% relative to the fourth quarter of 2010 and growth phase products, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate delivered 15% growth versus 2010.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increased 6% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the Puerto Rico excise tax in cost of sales, for which we received a corresponding foreign tax credit against our U.S. federal income taxes, and the U.S. Healthcare Reform excise fee. Excluding Puerto Rico excise taxes, cost of sales improved to 14.4% from 15.1% a year ago due to continued productivity efforts. And adjusted earnings per share on the quarter grew by 3% to $1.21. This benefit is from a 9% year-on-year reduction in average shares outstanding and the lower tax rate due to the foreign tax credits received on Puerto Rico excise taxes.</p>
          <p>A few highlights on the full year, turning to Page 7. Product sales grew 4%. This was delivered by good growth across our portfolio, partially offset by a 19% decline in EPOGEN sales in the U.S. Tony is going to give you more color on the momentum that we're carrying into 2012. Operating expenses on the year grew by 11%. Just over half of this was driven by the Puerto Rico excise taxes, the new healthcare reform excise fee, foreign exchange movements and higher ENBREL profit share payments in line with the higher sales. But the increase in operating expenses was in development costs to support our growing late-stage pipeline, launch costs for XGEVA and Prolia and expansion of our international operations. Adjusted earnings per share on the year grew 2%, benefiting from a lower tax rate and lower average share count.</p>
          <p>Key balance sheet and cash flow data is summarized on page 8. Cash balances grew to $20.6 billion at the end of December and total debt amounted to $21.6 billion. During the year, we raised $10.5 billion in additional debt through public bond offerings with an average fixed rate coupon of 4.1% and an average maturity of 15.3 years. We also repaid $2.5 billion of convertible notes that matured in February.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow for the year, was $4.5 billion compared to $5.2 billion in 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of increased working capital to support the launch of Prolia and XGEVA, higher interest expense and the prepayment of Sensipar royalties that I highlighted on our last call.</p>
          <p>And then during the year, we repurchased 144 million shares, or 15% of our outstanding share capital, at an average price of $57.55, and that's a total cost of $8.3 billion. We currently have $5 billion remaining under our Board-authorized share buyback program and we plan to continue to repurchase shares in the open market. Return on equity for 2011 was 23% compared to 22% in 2010. The full benefit of our recent share repurchases will be reflected in further improvements in return on equity in 2012.</p>
          <p>Finally, we introduced a quarterly dividend in the third quarter of 2011 and in December, we announced a 29% increase in the first quarter 2012 dividend payment to $0.36 a share. As we communicated in April, our plan is to increase the dividend meaningfully over time.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to our financial guidance for 2012 on page 8. First, we expect to deliver revenues of between $16.1 billion and $16.5 billion. And this guidance reflects our confidence in the growth prospects across our portfolio. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $5.90 to $6.15. This reflects our plan to hold growth and operating costs at or below revenue growth and that includes the consolidated cost of Micromet and the effect of further share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures for 2012 will be approximately $700 million. Our guidance on the adjusted tax rate is 14% to 15%, and excluding the foreign tax credits to offset the Puerto Rico excise tax in cost of sales, this would amount to 19% to 20%.</p>
          <p>And so in summary, we're making good progress toward the 2015 financial guidance that we provided to you in April.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'm delighted now to introduce my colleague, Tony Hooper, who is joining our earnings call, as Kevin mentioned, for the first time. Tony?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Let me start by saying I'm delighted to be part of this new management team. And I really look forward to taking Amgen into the next decade. So, on slide 11 and 12, you will find a summary of our global sales performance. Revenue has been characterized by demand trends  delivering record sales for both the quarter and the full year. We expect these trends to continue for 2012.</p>
          <p>Looking now at some of the products in specific. In the U.S., we continue to see unit growth for Neulasta. However, overall Filgrastim growth was fueled primarily by price. The decrease in international Filgrastim sales was due to a unit decline for NEUPOGEN, attributable to biosimilar competition. On the other hand, Neulasta has maintained unit and value share on a year-over-year basis. As we move into 2012, we will continue to focus on first and every cycle treatment as the best way to reduce risk of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:31). Enbrel remains the market leader in both rheumatology and dermatology segments despite share losses that are consistent with recent quarters. We are confident in our strong Enbrel patent and we are reviewing both our strategy and our resource allocations for this exciting asset.</p>
          <p>The EPOGEN sales decline continues to be driven by the implementation of bundling, product label changes and proposed <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:56) sanctions, which were announced at the end of the second quarter. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:00) and sales however grew 2% on a sequential basis. As you know, we signed a seven-year exclusive supply agreement with DaVita and a multi-year non-exclusive agreement with FMC. We believe that these agreements reinforce the value that EPOGEN delivers for patients and practitioners. Importantly, we saw signs of dose stabilization in quarter four.</p>
          <p>As we enter 2012, we expect EPOGEN performance to be driven principally by price as we expect only minor residual dose declines. While the large dialysis centers changed their usage of EPOGEN rapidly in 2012 in response to label and reimbursement dynamics, decreases in the prescribing of Aranesp for renal insufficiency have occurred more slowly. We expect these changes in Aranesp prescribing practice to continue early into 2012, but to stabilize by the middle of the year.</p>
          <p>As Bob said, our growth phase products, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate showed solid growth with combined 2011 sales exceeding $1.4 billion. For each of these products we see potential growth <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:11) Sensipar and expanded European label for first and second line of CRC for Vectibix and the FDA amendment of the Nplate REMS, which will make it easier for physicians to prescribe Nplate for appropriate patients.</p>
          <p>Turning to our global launches of denosumab. Both Prolia and XGEVA delivered a strong fourth quarter. XGEVA grew 30% versus the third quarter. This growth continues to be driven by share gains and overall SRE segment growth. In the U.S., XGEVA ended the quarter with unit share of 28%. The SRE segment grew 12% on a year-over-year basis in units.</p>
          <p>On the international front, XGEVA was launched in Germany and a few smaller countries and is off to a solid start. In 2012 we expect to launch in most European markets and to continue our growth in the US. Prolia grew 60% globally versus the third quarter, reflecting strong performance in Germany and a strong quarter in the U.S. In the U.S., Prolia sales were up 68% versus the third quarter. We have seen new patient growth as well as repeat patient growth. As expected, we've been granted a permanent J-Code, which allows easy access for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:29) customers and we plan to launch our DTC TV Campaign later this year. As we enter 2012, and patients' deductibles reset, we expect we could see some softness in quarter one with a strong resurgence in quarter two.</p>
          <p>Internationally, Prolia sales grew 45% versus the third quarter. During the quarter we launched in Italy and Spain. We have now launched in markets representing in excess of 75% of the sales opportunity. Let me focus on international for a moment. We continue to maintain share against biosimilar competition for Aranesp and Neulasta and have maintained our price premium for both.</p>
          <p>As you know, the macroeconomic challenges in Europe have impacted our marketplace and we continue to keep a close eye on the dynamics. However, in 2011, the price degradation we saw in these markets was consistent with what we observed in recent years, and we expect basically the same trend in 2012. The strength of our recent launches as well as our expansion into new markets puts us in a good position to experience growth in our International business. For the U.S., I'd note that our product portfolio ended the quarter with wholesale inventory in the normal range.</p>
          <p>So in sum, we are pleased that the execution against our commercial strategy in 2011 resulted in underlying trends that have allowed us to continue to grow sales as we absorb the changes in our ESA business. In particular, we believe our ability to deliver solid performances for Enbrel and Neulasta, as well as continue to successfully launch and grow XGEVA, Prolia, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate, will deliver strong growth in 2012.</p>
          <p>Now let me hand it to Roger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tony. This afternoon I will provide an update on regulatory and development activities in the fourth quarter and comment on some of the important events that we expect will occur in 2012. I'll also provide a brief overview of Micromet, a pioneering biotechnology company with a novel therapeutic platform exemplified by a promising development candidate for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other hematologic malignancies. As you are aware and as Kevin mentioned, this morning we announced that Amgen has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Micromet in an all-cash transaction.</p>
          <p>Turning then to slide 14 with respect to XGEVA, as Tony mentioned we've made good progress in gaining approval for XGEVA in all major jurisdictions. In the fourth quarter, working with our partner, Daiichi-Sankyo, we completed discussions with the Japanese regulatory authorities, leading to the approval of denosumab as Ranmark for the reduction of skeletal-related events in patients with metastatic bone disease, which was announced last week.</p>
          <p>We have also been engaged in constructive conversations with the FDA regarding XGEVA in advance of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee or ODAC meeting, which is scheduled for February 8. XGEVA is the first agent to show an improvement in bone metastasis-free survival in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. As such, there is no precedent for regulatory approval in this indication.</p>
          <p>The data that supports our submission were published in significant part in The Lancet in November of last year. An editorial that accompanied this publication posed questions about the clinical significance of the observed four-month delay in the appearance of bony metastases. And this general topic, that is, what constitutes a clinically-meaningful effect in patients with castrate-resistant non-metastatic prostate cancer was discussed at a prior ODAC meeting in September of last year.</p>
          <p>Hence, we certainly expect that the FDA will seek advice regarding the clinical significance of an improvement in bone metastasis-free survival. We look forward to these ODAC discussions as we continue to explore the best way to employ XGEVA, which is, of course, already approved in the United States to reduce skeletal-related events in men with metastatic prostate cancer and relieving the burden of bony involvement by prostatic malignancies.</p>
          <p>As noted on our slide, in the fourth quarter, the European Commission authorized the use of Vectibix as first and second line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Vectibix is our fully human antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor, which has been previously approved in major markets for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in patients who have failed other therapeutic regimens.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, our Regulatory Affairs group filed and an sBLA with the FDA for the use of Prolia to treat osteoporosis in men. The PDUFA date for this indication is September 20, 2012. We had previously announced top-line data indicating that Prolia treatment increases bone mineral density in such patients; in addition, we received approval in the third quarter for the use of Prolia in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. In this population, Prolia treatment was shown to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures.</p>
          <p>During our third quarter earnings call, I noted that severe shortages in the availability of Doxil, a chemotherapeutic agent from Johnson &amp; Johnson, were affecting enrollment in one of our two studies of AMG 386 in ovarian cancer patients. Because of this, we were forced to suspend enrollment in this Phase 3 study in the fourth quarter. However, our pivotal study of AMG 386 in this indication, which employs combination therapy with paclitaxel, continues to enroll ahead of schedule. This study and our study of AMG 479 in pancreatic cancer should complete enrollment by the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>Turning then to key events that we expect during 2012, slide 15 shows that we expect to see data from our Phase 3 outcome study, the EVOLVE trial, by midyear. This is an event-driven study in which we asked whether the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism with cinacalcet reduces all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity as determined using a composite end point.</p>
          <p>Later in 2012 we expect that interim data will become available from our study of talimogene laherparepvec, the oncolytic virus therapy known as T-VEC. These data relate to durable responses as defined in our special protocol assessment with the FDA. You will recall that enrollment in this Phase 3 study was increased to provide more power for observing an overall survival signal. However, we do not expect to be able to examine survival data until sometime in 2013.</p>
          <p>Two important Phase 2 programs will also provide data in 2012. We previously announced top line data for our large Phase 2 study of AMG 785, the sclerostin-binding antibody that increases bone formation in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. These data will be presented in scientific meetings later in the year. And we will also have the opportunity to review primary data from our fracture-healing studies where we ask whether administration of AMG 785 assists in resolution of tibial or hip fractures.</p>
          <p>We also expect to see data by the end of the year from four studies of AMG 145, our fully-human antibody directed against PCSK9 that has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Our studies explore the efficacy of AMG 145 as monotherapy or in combination with statins in statin-intolerant patients and in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.</p>
          <p>Finally, I wish to say a few words about our announced agreement with Micromet. Under the leadership of Patrick Baeuerle, their Chief Scientific Officer, Micromet has pioneered the development of Bispecific T-cell Engaging antibodies called BiTEs. As shown on slide 16, a typical BiTE antibody combines an antibody that activates cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, shown at the top in red, with an antibody that binds an appropriate target on the surface of tumor cells. The resultant chimera, in this case exemplified by Micromet's lead molecule, blinatumomab, binds to tumor cells in the patient and recruits cytotoxic T-cells, a critical part of normal immune defense to eliminate these tumor cells.</p>
          <p>This approach is powerful because cytotoxic T-cells are remarkably active. But as well because stimulation of these cells yields a memory cell population that remains active over time. In the case of blinatumomab these cytotoxic T-cells kill B-lymphocytes, including those cells that expand illegitimately in cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 17, Phase 2 data presented by Micromet scientists late last year at the American Society of Hematology meetings showed that nearly 70% of patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia achieved a complete response or a complete response of partial hematologic recovery. This level of activity in such grievously ill patients is quite remarkable. Indeed in these responding patients, tumor cells became undetectable after treatment. Median survival in this study has not yet been achieved with a median follow-up of 9.7 months. This is far longer than what has typically been achieved with contemporary combination chemotherapy.</p>
          <p>As with all highly active cytotoxic therapies there are adverse effects associated with blinatumomab treatment. However at this early stage and given the impressive efficacy observed to date these adverse effects appear manageable.</p>
          <p>In short we believe that blinatumomab is a rare asset, a therapy that offers enormous promise for patients suffering from an aggressive, grievous malignancy where alternative therapies do not now exist. And not surprisingly, as shown on slide 18, the BiTE platform has attracted great interest from numerous biopharmaceuticals partners, including of course Amgen itself. We feel confident that the ability of BiTE antibodies to activate cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and to trigger a memory response in these cells will prove valuable in a variety of disease settings.</p>
          <p>Hence, I am delighted that our colleagues from Micromet will be joining Amgen and that we, at Amgen, by virtue of our special expertise in the development and manufacture of complex protein therapeutics will be able to provide the resources necessary to develop the BiTE platform for the broader benefit of patients around the world.</p>
          <p>I cannot complete my discussion without noting that the fourth quarter of 2011 will be my last full quarter at Amgen. After 11 years, I am proud to be able to hand over the reins to my Chief Medical Officer, Sean Harper, who is with me here today. Through the work of thousands of very talented Amgen scientist, I have had the privilege of introducing new therapies that have improved the lives of patients suffering from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:00) disease, osteoporosis, autoimmunity and the depredations of malignancy.</p>
          <p>These 11 years have passed in an instant and in many ways I am tempted to continue for another 11 years. But I recognize that there is an appropriate time to let a new generation address these new challenges.</p>
          <p>I am deeply grateful for the opportunity that I have had to serve the cause of biomedical research from this outpost and I look forward to cheering the accomplishments of Sean and the entire Amgen team as they endeavor to bring our deep pipeline of promising new medicines to patients who desperately need better therapies.</p>
          <p>I close by thanking all of those who have helped bring us to this point. I have been inspired every day by your efforts and I will deeply miss working with Amgen employees around the world.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Not sure how I trumped the birthday, but I appreciate it. The question is on EPOGEN. So understanding this may still be a fluid situation, I was struck by your words of stabilization of the business, and some of our checks have indicated that throughout last year, a lot of docs started to see an increase of blood transfusion actually by a significant amount and they directly blame that the label and the QIP for this dynamic. So I guess, number one, are you getting that kind of feedback? And number two, is it possible that this might be a driver of that stabilization? And how do you think things play out with that? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So this is Tony. Let me start with my short bit of knowledge and then some of my team members can help me. There have been discussions around this being an issue and physicians questioning it. We've not seen any real data yet. I understand there have been some trials that have been run or that there's a collection of external data taking place, which could be presented in the next couple months or so. Net-net, however, I think just the overall practice based on the changes in the label and the reimbursement, physicians have now got to a level where they are comfortable with prescribing, but there could be a challenge when we start seeing some of the outcomes of the data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really what I would add to what Tony has said &#x2013; Chris, this is Bob &#x2013; is that we expected the large dialysis clinics would quickly change their protocols following the changes to the label and reimbursement, and we saw that. We think the bulk of the changes were implemented very quickly and we expect that there will be some residual carryover early in 2012, but we think the bulk of the changes in the way patients are being treated has already been made. And the feedback that we're getting from customers and from the clinics is that they would expect to have a rather more stable utilization of EPO this year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. I guess I trumped the birthday boy too. A question actually for Roger and maybe even Sean if he's there: when you think about your business development strategy and obviously you did Micromet today, where do you think the most interest lies as you go forward? Is it early-stage, mid-stage, late-stage stuff? How are you thinking about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Michael, we're quite opportunistic. We're interested in valuable programs that we think can make a real difference to patients suffering from grievous illness. In some cases, that will be because of a new discovery that really isn't quite in early stage. It is unusual, of course, to find very late-stage opportunities available because there are so few of them. That just is a fact. But we look at the totality of programs from extremely early programs, which sometimes we approach through investment or venture activity, to later-stage programs that already have demonstrated as blinatumomab has, clinical efficacy in a Phase 2 or even later program. So we look at the totality of them, there's no special formula.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask your view on operating profit. I think what you were saying is that you don't expect your expenses to grow more than revenues, so is it fair to assume flat operating profit this year? And as a corollary to that, when we think about your R&amp;D budget, is Micromet something that you can really just absorb into your current R&amp;D budget? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rachel, let me take that one. I think what I said was we expect to hold operating expense growth in line with or below revenue growth. So you should expect operating expense growth in the year to be no more than the revenue growth that you see for the business and it's indicated by our guidance.</p>
          <p>And then on R&amp;D, the guidance fully reflects, as I mentioned, the cost that we foresee for Micromet within R&amp;D and in fact for Micromet as a whole. And in the context of the 18% to 20% guidance that we've give previously I would expect that this year we would be towards the top end of that guidance.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Happy Birthday to Ravi, but more importantly, just a question on assumptions for Sensipar in the face of EVOLVE data. Assuming you show an outcomes benefit, how should we think about the incremental opportunity as we head into oral drugs being bundled in 2014? Is this something that would offset the bundling impact? Do you think you could grow in the context of bundling? Just trying to get a sense of what the opportunity could be there.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is for Roger or Sean on AMG 785 in fracture healing. I'm wondering what gives you confidence in this indication after Forteo, I think has failed some trials here and maybe you can discuss the profile you are looking for? Is this accelerated healing in all fractures or improved healing for refractory fractures? And what's the commercial opportunity you're looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Josh, what gives us confidence, to the extent one ever has confidence when you're embarking upon a Phase 2 study is that the pre-clinical data are so strong and these, of course, have been described in various research publications and at ASBMR meetings. So the data for sclerostin inhibition in terms of reducing the frequency of nonunion are very impressive and, in fact, what we've shown pre-clinically is that by inhibiting sclerostin you fill in a very substantial gap in bone that is introduced by an osteotomy. So it's really quite an impressive result.</p>
          <p>Now will that translate into clinical improvement with respect to the frequency of non-union, the ability of patients to bear weight early, reduction in pain etcetera? We don't know. We're testing that both in tibial fracture and also in hip fractures and time will tell, but those are the kinds of things that we would like to see as a result of our clinical trials.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice EPO quarter. The question has to do with EPO and help us understand maybe just a little bit the (36:40) Dobs <mark type="ph" /> database, which is obviously not perfect, did indicate that volume was down maybe as much as 11% in Q4 over Q3. So how much of &#x2013; are you seeing sort of the same volume hit? And the question really is, how much is price playing a factor given the recent new contract with DaVita? Based on our work we do think that the price is going to go up to DaVita this year. So just trying to really put it together. How much of it is volume versus price?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on Micromet. I would agree with Roger. I think that the data on their lead product is as exciting as the platform. I was hoping if you could speak to the platform just in terms of what other indications you would be able to pursue and maybe just give us some sense of timelines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Thanks, Ian. The platform, as you indicate, is extremely interesting because redirected lysis has been something that molecular immunologists have wanted to achieve for a long time to target cytotoxic T-cells to direct the elimination of cell populations in people, but it has not been easy to make work. And Patrick Baeuerle and his team have done a great job of that. That opens up a whole set of solid tumor indications and potentially other indications that could be approached using that platform and that is the basis of our partnership with them, which we announced last July, and also the basis of many other partnerships and arrangements.</p>
          <p>Essentially, it comes down to picking the right targets, what has been shown is that you can harness the power of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes to kill tumor cells. So you have to find the right targets and then demonstrate in the clinic that those targets actually can be destroyed without undue adverse effects. Most of those programs are at a pre-clinical stage, there are some early clinical data that are coming in with respect to another program, the MT110 program, it's in an early Phase 1 situation and a few other things. But I think the opportunity that exists there with respect to that platform is simple. It's a better way to kill tumor cells and now we have to go about showing that we can kill the right cells in patients suffering from malignancy.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I was just wondering on AMG 145, Roger, can you help us understand the differences between that particular antibody and other PCSK9 antibodies in development, if you think there is a notable difference and while it might be scheduled to actually start Phase 3, if I could slip one in, on the tax rate is that tax rate sustainable in the out years?</p>
          <p>[Laughter]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I will have Jon answer the 145 question and I'll answer the &#x2013; no, with respect to 145 and then I will hand it over to Jon, since you slipped it in. Of course there are no head-to-head comparisons amongst the different PCSK9 antagonists and hence we can't really comment on how one compares to another. We are deep in the midst of very large Phase 2 studies, you've seen them on clinicaltrials.gov They will deliver a very large amount of data in 2012, which will provide the basis for end of Phase 2 discussions with FDA that can lead to a phase 3 program. We are excited about we've seen to this point. We believe that this can be a very important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for cholesterol reduction in patients at risk as a result of hypercholesterolemia for adverse cardiovascular events but we need to wait and see the Phase 2 data. Jon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as to the tax question, we are carrying part of our tax burden within cost of sales now as a result of the Puerto Rico excise taxes and as I mentioned we get an offset against that in our income tax line. So the total tax burden that we are carrying on our P&amp;L is 19% to 20% and you see 14% to 15% of that on the income taxes line. So I think the answer to the question is 19% to 20% is broadly a sustainable tax rate, at least for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I can't believe you put me on so late given it's my birthday. Thanks for best wishes. The question is on XGEVA and the prevention indication. Can you just walk us through what you see as the major commercial hurdles and opportunities specifically on the hurdles, how do you maximumally leverage into that new physician group and on the opportunities, where do you see the real world patient population size wise? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first, obviously we don't have a label yet, Ravi, so we look forward to having the opportunity to discuss this with the ODAC. And we will see where we come out. We have a PDUFA date, as you know, in April. But the far and away biggest opportunity for us, of course, is in treating patients whose cancer has already spread to the bone. We are very pleased with the progress we are making there. As I said in my remarks earlier, we are pleased with the growth in the market, which means that we are reaching more patients and patients who weren't previously being treated now have access to medicine, in particular XGEVA, and we are pleased with the share we are taking. But, that is far and away the larger opportunity and so, why don't we wait and see what the FDA review of XGEVA in the setting of metastasis prevention provides us by way of a label and then we'll address it at that time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>That's correct, Eun, we do have molecules in development. We are not going to share details about the specific programs at this point. As you know, in December we announced a partnership with Watson to develop and commercialize several oncology antibodies and I hope you will respect that for competitive reasons we are not going to share details any earlier that we need to about the programs that we are advancing.</p>
          <p>We are excited about the potential for growth from biosimilars, and I would point out that the opportunity for us is not just in the U.S. but obviously globally, and we see an opportunity to leverage the biosimilars as we seek to expand internationally into new markets.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Congrats to the new team, the old team and congrats to Ravi. Though, Rav, I have to say I thought you were at least 50 by the looks of it. A question I guess for Jon, I was looking for a bit more guidance on 2012, specifically what the share count assumption is? Whether you think you can further improve gross margins? And whether XGEVA bone met prevention label is incorporated in the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of share count, I think as we have consistently said, we don't preannounce the amounts and timing of share repurchases. As I mentioned, we do have $5 billion of authorized programs still in place. And we do intend to continue buying in the open market, and I have reflected our expectations for that in the guidance. But what I can't do for you is give you the specifics on pre-announcing our activities. But we have got a $5 billion program to complete still.</p>
          <p>On gross margins, the guidance we gave for 2015 was that we expect cost of sales to be 13% by 2015 or on the order of 13% by 2015. You saw progress over this last year, if I could strip out the Puerto Rico tax effects from that. We've improved from 15% to 14% just over the last year, and I am confident we are on the road to that 13% by 2015. I'm sorry, what was the third one?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>XGEVA, whether guidance included the bone met prevention? Obviously, we're not giving product-specific guidance on this call, and there are puts and takes across the product range. And the guidance we have given you we think reflects our best view of where we are heading into 2012. So as we said at the outset, we're pleased with momentum that we bring to the start of the year, and we are excited about the opportunity to accelerate revenue growth.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to congratulate Roger for your contributions here, and that we will miss you at the UBS Conference. The question is on the revenue guidance, and Bob, I think you may have just answered the question, but I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about what scenarios we need to play out to achieve the higher end of guidance? I think with Street numbers being basically at the bottom end of the guidance, I think we have a sense for what the scenarios look like, but I was hoping that you might be able to give a little color as to what you're thinking is on the top end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we tried to give you a sense for why we feel pretty optimistic at this stage of the year, and the optimism is borne by, underpinned by the strength we see in the core franchises. We are pleased with progress that we are making in growing Neulasta globally. We are pleased with the position we have with Enbrel. Again, we think the ESA franchise will be more stable than it has been in past years.</p>
          <p>The products that we have recently launched, which are our growing, obviously XGEVA, Prolia, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate are all performing well. We have high expectations for growth from those products in 2012 in established and emerging markets. So really across the board while there are puts and takes, we think the guidance we provided reflects our best view of what the likely outcome for the year is.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is following up on the acquisition strategy question, which was asked earlier. Could you give us more color on your thought process, whether you're focused more on U.S. assets or ex-U.S. assets given your cash balance? And if you are able to use the ex-U.S. cash for the Micromet deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Again, I think our acquisition philosophy remains to try to find innovative medicines that can make a difference for patients who are grievously ill. So what you should expect from our licensing and business development activity more generally is that those are the kinds of molecules and opportunities we are going to be looking for.</p>
          <p>Specifically with respect to the ex-U.S. cash, Micromet is a U.S. listed company, so we are using onshore cash to fund that acquisition, but as an ongoing investment, ongoing R&amp;D expenses for Micromet and its team in Munich, obviously we'll be able to use offshore cash for that.</p>
          <p>Last year early in the year, we made an acquisition of a business in Brazil. We're pleased with the early results from that and that would be the other focus in some of our acquisition activity. To the extent we're able to find small opportunities in markets where we're trying to expand and to the extent we believe we can leverage those transactions to launch our own innovative products, we'll continue to look at transactions like that, but I &#x2013; they would &#x2013; I think you should expect that they'll be on the smaller side of things just like the Bergamo transaction that we did last year in Brazil.</p>

          <p>Yeah, sure, Geoff. The &#x2013; we are still in the midst of studies that will help to define dose and schedule for both of those programs. And there are aspects to the programs, particularly for 785, that relate not only to dose and schedule the way you defined it, but also for how long one should treat patients with 785 in order to gain the maximal effect. So those things are all being addressed, but we are optimistic that one can have monthly scheduling with AMG 785. It is possible it could be even less frequent and time will tell as far as that's concerned.</p>
          <p>Over time, one would expect also with AMG 145 that we should be able to get to that kind of schedule, although it may be that early on, one will be working with something that's closer to an every-two-week-dosing. Again, time will tell as we see the results from our Phase 2 studies.</p>
          <p>And no, I won't name my favorite child. We want all our children to go to college and we're going to try and make that happen.</p>

          <p>Hey, guys, and thanks for taking the question. When you look at Aranesp, the trends exiting 2011 don't look that stable, so I just want to get your general sense as to the assumptions for Aranesp in 2012, what the drivers are there. And maybe at a higher level, do your assumptions for this year imply any different rate for biosimilar penetration than we've seen in the past? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Well, as I said earlier, it was clear that the large dialysis centers moved quite rapidly in adjusting the EPOGEN label, but at the same time, the decreases in the prescribing of Aranesp for renal insufficiency continued a bit more slowly. We see that now evolving between now and the middle of next year and then stabilizing as we go forward.</p>
          <p>As it regards biosimilars in Europe, we have continued to project the same type of interaction that we have to date. We've managed to maintain our price premium and we are holding pretty well in terms of the market share.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the Micromet deal. It's a great technology and I think a really smart transaction for Amgen. I'll ask the BD question slightly differently, maybe for Roger. Over the past year, you guys have made significant and I would argue accelerating investment in the area of next-generation antibodies: the solid tumor transaction, the ImmunoGen TAP transaction and now the acquisition, so the question is, I guess I'm trying to get into your strategic thinking behind the investment. Is it target driven? Is it IP driven? Is it capability driven? There just appears to be a broader overarching strategic intent to build critical mass in this broad area. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, thanks for the question. The fact of the matter is that this is a strategy that has evolved over a very long period of time. When I joined the company, Amgen had already had a very strong reputation in supportive care and part of the push was to add to that a therapeutics capability. Which we did by developing drugs that block signal transduction or growth factor signaling in tumors. And what we're doing now is we've said, all right, that is one way of trying to eliminate tumors, to kill them by depriving them of things that they need to grow, but another way of doing this is to actually kill the tumor cells themselves. And if we could harness an immunological reaction, that would be a good thing to do.</p>
          <p>Part of that strategy we revealed by the BioVex acquisition last year around this time, in which a modified herpes simplex virus triggers an immune response that eliminates malignant melanoma. We're in Phase 3 in that. We'll be interested in looking at those data, some of which should become available this year.</p>
          <p>And in addition, we look for opportunities to harness immune killing of tumors in other ways. Of course, I've been interested in Micromet and their BiTE platform for a very long time. We did sign the collaboration agreement with them in July of last year and that in turn led to this most recent transaction. So it's been a very systematic and I think quite thoughtful look at opportunities to eliminate tumor cells in patients suffering from malignant disease.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my question is I guess for the team and congrats, Kevin, on your transformative tenure at Amgen and Roger and I'm sure you're going to be missed as well and that was getting me thinking about transitions, a lot of time in biotech there's a change in management and that's led to a big shift in company strategy. So I was just wondering if you could give us some color on your view on how the teams are going to transition internally over the year and how you're going to communicate that with the Street?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I think that companies have different outcomes from transitions. Some transitions come about because of dissatisfaction with company performance or some external shock, and in those cases large changes in strategy and direction are perhaps completely appropriate.</p>
          <p>Second, the reason that you transition leadership is to get new ideas and new energy, and so you'd expect over time to have changes happen, otherwise you wouldn't make the transition.</p>
          <p>But I think in our case Bob and I have worked together very, very closely. Amgen's mission will remain the same, our dedication to innovation will remain the same, our multi-modality platforms will remain the same but there is lots of room in that &#x2013; and our dedication to being a global company will remain the same. So I think that foundation you can count on. Bob, when he takes the job will have a chance to explain sort of how he wants to take the company and time will tell there.</p>
          <p>In terms of the transition here, I said in the press release that announced the transition that we sought a seamless transition and, in effect, this is a generational change of leadership and that's exactly what's happening. I think that this is the smoothest transition I have ever seen, and I have been through board service, as well as at Amgen, involved in quite a number of them. So I feel really good about that. The company is in a good place and it feels good all around. Having Tony join us from outside brings energy and perspective from another company. Sean has long been in the on deck circle for Roger and Bob has sure as heck earned his spurs here and having Jon come from Novartis and his background some time ago gives us the kind of outside perspective and expertise we need.</p>
          <p>So I think Amgen is in a good spot, and I think you'll be pleased with what you see going forward. And let me turn it over to Bob if you've got anything you'd like to add.</p>

          <p>Robyn, obviously I understand the interest and the question, and we look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to present the new team and for the new team to have a chance to talk to you about the things that we want to do strategically and the things that we're excited about at the company. But I think Kevin summarized very well our expectations for the transition.</p>
