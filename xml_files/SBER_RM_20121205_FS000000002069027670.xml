      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Sberbank 9M 2012 IFRS Results Release and Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Anton Karamzin, Deputy Chairman of the board and CFO. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for joining us on our call for publishing our Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements under IFRS for nine months of 2012. I will start off with mentioning the usual. The presentation for the convenience of your use is placed on our website in the Investors section in both English and Russian sections of our website. And I will start off with few seconds of introductory notes, and then we'll open it up traditionally for your questions.</p>
          <p>Our net profits for nine months of this year have reached RUB262.8 billion, or RUB12.13 per ordinary share, which is a 2.7% increase over RUB255.8 billion for the same period of 2011. Operating income before provisions have grown for the same period 23% up to RUB665.6 billion. We are keeping more or less stable cost/income ratio for this year at 47.3%. Last year that was 44.2% for nine months. Return on equity equally stays at a comfort zone of 25.1% for nine months versus 31.5%, which was, I think, a record last year.</p>
          <p>Net interest margin for nine months for this year came in at 6.1%, which is a stabilization over the previous quarter. We were expecting it a little bit higher, but we see a stable outlook for the fourth quarter. Therefore, referring to our earlier guidance for the margin for the full year of 2012, we would &#x2013; somewhat for rounding purposes, I should say, adjusted and say that it will be somewhere a bit lower than 6.2% rather than 6.2%, 6.4% as we were saying earlier. This was due to the fact that loan growth dynamics were unusually volatile in August, September and October, and have shown not typical seasonality in terms of growth and pricing.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet, our gross retail loan portfolio for nine months is up by 35.4%, and overall Group's assets increased by 27%. That includes 11.9 percentage point out of that is the increase due to the acquisitions of Sberbank Europe, formerly Volksbank International, and DenizBank.</p>
          <p>This is probably everything that I was going to highlight in the opening remarks, and I'm sure we will have a full hour of productive work in covering all aspects of our numbers and color behind them through your intensive Q&amp;A question. So, operator, please, we're ready to open it up for the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question from Sam Goodacre from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks very much for the call. Could we take into a bit more detail on two of the things you've already mentioned, being the capital and the net interest margins. Firstly, on capital, as you say the ratios now include the full suite of acquisitions you've done, and I suppose you could argue they're looking thinner as a result. So what are your thoughts as we go into next year on your capital management more broadly? But also I suppose on the impact of Basel II, and obviously of late we have been seeing headlines as well about potential Basel III implementation too. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And then the second one just on the NIMs. Obviously, sort of funding costs remain tight. You've mitigated that somewhat in the 3Q, like you say perhaps the NIMs of the full year will be a bit lower than your 6.2% to 6.4%. But what about for the next year, for 2013, what do you see particularly on the funding front there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So on capital, as we were mentioning on the earlier calls, the result of the acquisitions may dip us for a short period of time somewhat below 10.5% Tier 1 under IFRS that we would normally consider our kind of safe and comfort zone. So it now stands at 10.2%. But the generation capacity of the net profit and the timing of the recognition after the quarterly reviews done by our auditors allow us to be reasonably comfortable that by the end of this year we should be back to 10.5%. Latest maybe first &#x2013; end of first quarter, but the probability is much more that full year will be 10.5%.</p>
          <p>Basel, there is &#x2013; yes, you are right to mention the publications and the press in terms of how the process of adopting various parts of the ratios is going on. But because a number of things are yet to be decided somewhat last moment, we are at this point in time, only giving very rough expectations, and the expectation is so far if all goes well, that we'll stay stable, maybe even mildly positive, but positive would be kind of close to rounding errors, I'd say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Actually, Anton, can I just follow-on from that particular point. Do you have any view on the timing of implementation? Because, again, there's been sort of conflicting headlines, et cetera, as to which regime will be implemented when.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So far it's a little bit in the air. The target is officially limitation of full blown Basel II has been announced quite a while ago to be January 1, 2014. Then the regulators are starting to get in some mild tweaks to become active, and those already including some parts of kind of Basel III type requirements rather than just clean Basel II. So some of those mild though, not necessarily some mild tweaks are expected to come in both January 1 &#x2013; this coming January 1, 2013, maybe something within 2013, but that nevertheless doesn't remove the risk that some of the proposed implementation that were originally to come in January 2014 may also come a little bit later, like in the middle 2014.</p>
          <p>Most of the variability actually comes from the fact that the regulators not only to calibrate its mind in terms of how and what they want the things to work, but also have to pre-clear it with &#x2013; for sensibility in terms of timing with the banking sector, because a lot of implementation would depend on quite a lot of IT work within the banks to be able to kind of report this and calculate this accurately. So when the regulator gauges the temperature there and senses, okay, reasonable timing is this, then they will come up with a more precise announcement which parts of the regulation become effective when, so that it's reasonable for implementation timing for the banks. We are also playing a voice in there, because, of course, our systems are one of the most complicated and would require a certain work to be done on them. That's first part of your question.</p>
          <p>The second part is NIM. Yes, we still see that although the market and ourselves expect that sometime in 2013 the upward pressure on the rates should subside, we would still see that in the first quarter and then the first half of 2013 the margins would squeeze for us and for the rest of the market still a little bit. So they may dip below 6% somewhat and stay stable there throughout 2013, but it's difficult for everyone now on the street, us included, to see how the liquidity &#x2013; availability of liquidity as a scarce resource would be stacking up throughout 2013. That would depend on a number of external and internal macro factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Alex Kantarovich from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Alex Kantarovich, JPMorgan. Anton, great quarter, great results. Obviously, our eyes are on 2013, and there was a question on that in terms of margin. But more broadly, what can you say about the operating environment? We get mixed signals, some banks talking slowdown in demand. It would be great to get your take. That would be my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We can see why people get confused, because different players have been making statements on the calls in the past few days. We still see somewhat of a slowdown in terms of volumes of growth in the loan book, and we would expect this to continue in 2013. So various outlooks that we voiced for the next year in the earlier weeks still stand for us, where we're looking on average that our loan book is probably going to slow down to about 15% nominal growth next year, which means very low double-digits for corporate and around kind of 25-ish for retail.</p>
          <p>Of course, don't hold me specifically to these numbers, because, as I mentioned, there's quite a number of factors that are a bit unclear. Hence, the sector's mixed forecasts and outlooking. That will impact this and influence this throughout 2013, and the situation is going to remain kind of quite volatile. I'll give you an example, like everyone was expecting normally seasonal slowdown in the growth of loans in July and August, which didn't happen. On our books, for example, we still saw our retail loans growing in the same fashion as they did before those two seasonally low months. And then, when normally September and October peak start after the holidays, on the contrary we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the growth. And then November data has been also slowed down a little bit and December is not yet &#x2013; is only fifth day. We'll see how the seasonal volumes are going to be stacking up.</p>
          <p>So with these kinds of month-on-month unpredictable volatility in the loan growth for everyone, it is going to be quite tricky to give specific forecasts. So we're all kind of in the same boat sitting and observing how the macro situation impacts the loan growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. Thank you. My next question is also rather broad. If you compare your risk-weighted assets to total assets, then the ratio looks very, very high in comparison with the foreign banks, whether we take the emerging market banks or developed market banks. And my question is if in the next several years you will see this ratio declining, which perhaps would help your capital adequacy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is &#x2013; it's really a broad question. That is really a reflection of our structure of the balance sheet overall, because of the very high proportion of just plain vanilla loans on our books, which is 72%, and the rest is as you see securities portfolio, cash and cash equivalents. So, therefore, risk weighting on plain vanilla loans kind of bilateral loans and due to the characteristics of the product if you compare them with other markets would be &#x2013; with banks operating in other markets would be a bit higher. Also, the liquidity of the collateral that we have in comparison with different other jurisdictions where the markets are a little bit more sophisticated and decent volume is somewhat lower that may be impacting that broad comparison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Clear on that. Thank you. And also I noticed that in your security split there was a sharp increase in other securities. The delta is RUB110 billion. The remarks this was due to Deniz, which has debt securities of foreign government. And the obvious question is of which foreign government this debt is related to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's &#x2013; you're absolutely right, that is related to our acquisition of DenizBank, and it's &#x2013; the vast majority of their bond portfolio is Turkish federal paper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Clear on that. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Simon Nellis from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Yeah, I have a question on costs. I noticed that staff costs in Russia were actually down quarter-on-quarter. Just be interested in knowing if that's sustainable. Second question on costs would be usually you have kind of some seasonality to the costs. If you can give us some guidance on how much seasonality we might see in the fourth quarter. And then, again, if you could provide some outlook for us on cost, that would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there is a seasonality pattern, clearly observable on the quarterly periods. Therefore, third quarter is usually showing a little bit of a dip. There will be seasonal spike in the fourth quarter. We are not expecting on the core banking business &#x2013; I am not talking yet the recently required assets and banks, because there it's a bit tricky to predict so far. But on the core banking business, we're not expecting year-end bonus accruals to be kind of materially different from the numbers that we were having last year. However, the process of confirming the results and determining how much we are going to pay in annual compensation to people is not yet complete, because the results of the fourth quarter are yet to be gauged fully. But we're not expecting very big material changes there.</p>
          <p>Cost outlook for this year, full year is going to be stacking up in the following way. We're going to be very close to &#x2013; on the core banking business, again, not excluding the acquisitions that were made this year, we'll be close to the guidance that we have given, around 25% nominal cost growth on the core Sberbank business. And then due to the fact that guidance &#x2013; that consolidation of DenizBank has only come like a few weeks ago and some of the costs that we needed to incur in Volksbank International were changing a little bit against the regional plans, overall Group consolidated nominal cost growth will be higher than 25%. That will be probably getting closer to around the numbers that you see in the report now, which is growth of about 31% I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the outlook for cost growth is around 30% plus next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was me talking about 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>2012, right. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Then 2013 will probably continue within the same guidance that we're giving before, 20%, 25%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And just if you could remind us the seasonality last year, I mean, was there a big difference in bonus accruals last year, or should we kind of expect to see the same kind of seasonality we saw last year this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the same.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>The same?</p>

          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Dmitry Trembovolsky from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Anton, hi. Hi, everyone. Thanks a lot for the call and, yes, third quarter results have actually been better than expected, so thanks for that. Just on &#x2013; following-up to my colleagues, can you just discuss maybe a bit the outlook on profits for next year. I think there have been different messages from your CEO. I saw one when he was speaking on the supervisory board and he said there that he would expect net income to go up year-over-year in 2013. I am not sure if this was including Deniz or excluding. We also saw him speaking about $13 billion recently in Germany. And if you have any comments there, that would be welcome. And I also wanted to ask you, and that will probably be like a second question, 20%, 25% cost growth for next year that you've just mentioned answering to Simon, does that include Deniz or not? Because clearly you have to incur around $800 million of their cost base. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Dmitry. The process, yeah, of course, there is a range of scenarios that we're thinking in terms of for the net profit for next year that clearly are going to be better than this year. And the $13 billion that was voiced back on the European Financial Week in Frankfurt is on the optimistic side of that range, but still relatively doable.</p>
          <p>In terms of costs, yes, we're anticipating that 20%, 25% nominal cost growth guidance is already going to be within &#x2013; including all the acquisitions that we have done. Yes, there are going to be considerable absolute amounts of cost increases just due to the mere fact that the acquired banks have a cost base. But we will &#x2013; by the same token are going to be quite disciplined on the cost in the core business for the next year.</p>
          <p>As you go in a little bit of more detail to the questions that was asked previously, the seasonal increase between third and the fourth quarter cost base last year was about 30%, 31%. So far, the assessment is that this time fourth quarter should be coming at about 28% higher than third quarter this year. But then, again, regardless of the fact that we are already in December, a lot of the cost decisions are yet to be taken in December actually. That's just the specifics of the way how the Russian economy works and pretty much led by the seasonality that's set by the government spending, which is a big part of our macro environment, and determines a lot of business activity in the last month or two in the year. So, therefore, this seasonality expected numbers are currently yet a bit of an assessment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Thank you. But you would definitely think &#x2013; because I am already seeing that the agencies are picking up your quote on the margins. I am actually having calls as we speak. People I guess will be asking you said that margins will be below 6%. Would you still say that definitely net income for next year will be, I would say, sizably ahead of 2012, or that is too early to say? Because I know you haven't yet approved your budget, so didn't &#x2013; I just did not want to get an impression that you are really guiding us down substantially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, again, I am not having the screen in front of me at the moment, but just for clarity in case agencies may have not picked up. Sub-6% margin guidance is something that we've said before and that's 2013, not this year. This year we're still within 6.0%, 6.2% range. And in terms of more specifics, you are right, absolutely, we have to complete our full business planning exercise by the end of December, and then we'll come out with some more specific numbers, as we promised.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; our traditional Analyst Day for the end of the year that we normally have in the middle of December, we've announced and sent invitation to everyone yesterday, to be held on the December 20. Some of the more specific guidance is going to be given there, but full details are probably in January when the full formalized business plan is completed.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Mikhail Shlemov from VTB Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening, Anton. Thanks for the call. A couple of questions from me. The first one actually is coming on the cost of risk. I have been looking through the notes of your financial statements, and it seems like that despite the extraordinary strong growth which you are experiencing in the retail, the provision creation for retail loans specifically is actually non-existent, or even if I look at the nine months numbers, there is actually a provision release. Any color why it is happening and what's underlying trends would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And the second one is actually just a follow-up on the margin side. If we're reading correctly that just like taking your margin, which is basically 6.2% in the third quarter, we should be looking for something like 25 to 30 basis points decrease in margin for next year, over the next three quarters basically? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there is a note that shows that in loans non-due the level of provisions have dropped from 1.2 to 0.1 percentage coverage. This is the result of the constant update in our model for the portfolio. That reflects the fact that our provisioning for non-past due loans in the previous quarters and kind of throughout the crisis has been too conservative. Recalibration of the models works on a regular basis and it looks into how much of NPL plus one day filters down through the bracket into NPL 90, NPL 180, and that how much we recover out of that and how much of it gets back to non-past due. And that aging analysis and filtering analysis has given us the basis to see that our provisioning has been much too conservative, but again, the adjustments are not made top down. We continue to reiterate that we're not managing our provision coverage ratio top down.</p>
          <p>This is bottom up. This is, as the model itself works mathematically from analyzing this filtering down the NPL brackets, it adjusts itself in terms of how much provides for various portfolios. So, hence, quite a lot of recoveries have been recorded in the recent quarters, the model adjusts itself accordingly. And non-past due loans we provide against a bit less. And on the margins, I think we're pretty much set &#x2013; or we're good really. It would be really looking a bit more of a gambling exercise if we started to be bit more specific in guiding on next year's margins. So far it's only directional and it's sub-6%.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Anton. And just like to follow-up on this retail loans actually, because if I look at the provision coverage basically of the retail loan book, it has slipped to something around 2.5 percentage points, which seems to be rather, I would say, very optimistic part of the cycle, of credit cycle which we have been seeing so far. Don't you think that that analysis is a little bit retrospective? And given that the trends which we see in the financial reporting, or let's say consumer finance lending, which is obviously looking a little bit more sub-prime niche and work with a shorter-term portfolio. This should still, however &#x2013; I mean, the higher cost of risk and the higher NPLs should gradually channel into the Sberbank one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but then by the same token, 2.5 percentage points for the overall portfolio is good, and our NPL levels on the retail portfolio are much better than the rest of the industry. And also on that same very loan &#x2013; that very note that you look at, which is Note 7 on page 13 at the top table that splits the level of provision coverage for loans to different brackets of overdue. We agree that our non-past due loans we provide against very little, but look our NPLs are very low there and our recovery process is one of the best in the sector there. And, yes, we're not in the POS and high-risk express lending business. We are in a very classic so far &#x2013; well, Cetelem is only picking up as you know, and it's relatively small.</p>
          <p>We're in a situation of a very well-seasoned retail loan portfolio with over 10 million retail consumer loan portfolio. I'm not talking about margins &#x2013; mortgages there as yet. That one &#x2013; that particular portfolio is over 10 million transactions. Its average duration is one to two years, whilst the portfolio's been underwritten for over four years. And in those brackets where we do have the NPL, like 31 to 60 days overdue, we're at 15.7% provided, 91 to 180 we're 63% provided, over 180 we're 90% provided. These are very respectable numbers in terms of coverage. So we're just being reasonable, and, yes, we incur much lower actual losses and record &#x2013; our model show much lower expected losses than the rest of the sector, and we are recovering so much better than the rest of the sector.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from David Nangle from Renaissance. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, it's Dave Nangle from Renaissance. Hey, Anton.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, couple of questions from my side. I'll go one by one. But just back on the asset quality front, you talked a bit about retail asset quality there. On the corporate side, what are you guys seeing at this point in the cycle? Is there anything you're seeing that worries you in your portfolio or from a sector basis or from new borrowers coming through to the bank and what you've seen in their quality? And also just in the write-back potential, what are net write-backs from current corporate loans or from Sberbank Capital selling off assets? And what do you expect in the next few quarters? Do you expect that write-back trends to continue? So just kind of an outlook for corporate loan quality and write-back trends in the next few quarters, and then I have a second question after that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the core business, again, without subsidiaries so far, we do see slowdown in demand in the loans as we've seen, but there is not that much proportional deterioration in the credit quality. The credit quality remains relatively stable, and with only mild kind of trend in &#x2013; very, very mild trends in deterioration. We see that situation continuing so far. We see that whilst liquidity is a very big &#x2013; liquidity as a scarce resource overall in the economy, is very scarce and expensive resource it is not that much of a potential trigger to any credit quality risks as it might have been in 2007 or 2008, because the system is running &#x2013; both the corporate and the banks are running safer liquidity positions.</p>
          <p>Therefore, coming to the second part of the question, which is what about the provisioning dynamics on the corporate side and are there going to be write-backs trend continuing. We were guiding on all our previous calls that 2010 and 2011 were the peak years for provision releases following the recoveries from the crisis. 2012 has proven to be also quite material in terms how much we recover and write-back. We were expecting that 2013 would be totally immaterial in that respect, but it turns out that we are capable of collecting more than we were planning &#x2013; or recovering more than we were planning from the bad debt loans. So in absolute gross up size, the amount of recoveries and write-backs is still going to be a material number in the business plan for 2013.</p>
          <p>However, as the loan growth is going to be continuing at healthy double-digit numbers through 2013, also new provisions for non-past due loans are going to be healthy &#x2013; sizable, and therefore they will outweigh the write-backs and our provision line for the P&amp;L for 2013 is still going to be a cost charge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But I guess, obviously, this is going to be one of the most difficult ones to forecast both for you guys and for us, but I guess what you're saying is that the asset quality picture is fine, as you see it today. But it will probably have a higher cost of risk charge next year as the trends of write-back falls way, but it's still significant. Is that a fair statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you could put it this way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And just on pricing trends, because I was in Moscow recently and it just seems that most pricing trends are negative for banks right now and retail deposit rates on the up, corporate deposit rates on the up and corporate loan rate's been squeezed a bit, and only retail loan rates being kind of a bastion of safety. Is that a fair picture? Are you seeing that today? Or where does Sberbank sit within these trends with its own pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a fair picture up until today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We see bit of a slowdown in the upward pressure on the rates. And we see that the main reason for this is that the country this past year, unlike many, many years before, is now deep into the positive real rate territory. Inflation running about 6%, 6.1% this year, and rates being where they are, quite high, does make it very difficult for corporate businesses to fund themselves at the high rates where they are.</p>
          <p>And, therefore, the healthy demand for loans is slowing down, and therefore at some point in 2013, we see that there will be an equilibrium which will stop the rates growing further. They will grow a little bit still, but at some point in 2013 we see, and we also read some research in the market that sector specialists are saying that people expect the rates to stabilize, maybe even a possibility that they will turn around and start dropping down a little bit, but as to when this will happen, it is yet difficult to see.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for the call. Just following on from the last question. Is that the rationale behind why you are guiding down? Because clearly if you look at the sort of the slides that you put up on your core business in the presentation for Q3, it actually is quite a positive margin picture, and yet you're painting a relatively negative one. So is it that looking forward that analysis, those concerns, as to why you're being cautious? Because you can't actually see it in the numbers. And I think for the previously you do often insist on the structural shift in terms of the mix of the portfolio actually being quite positive for margin, and I'd just like to understand a bit more what's behind your thinking. And there is also the slide that you show on the average costs and the deposit costs in the context looks a pretty good performance, and I wonder if there's anything specific there or any reason why you think that could potentially get worse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've always been talking about the positive mix change on the asset side from the margin standpoint, not as a standalone driving factor, but as a compensating factor to the fact that the cost of funding has been growing for everyone in the sector and our self too. So, we have been seeing that the cost of funding was still growing somewhat faster than the positive impact on the mix and repricing in the loans on the asset side.</p>
          <p>And therefore, yes, as the inflation remains low, rates remain high-ish, but the demand for loans slows down a little bit, we still see the margin dropping a little bit from where it is now, and then stabilize for a little while. And then we'll see in the longer term which pace will it continue to compress as and when the macro hopefully starts following a bit more positive scenario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But I mean it isn't &#x2013; it's not an incorrect interpretation to look at Q3 and say that you've actually done quite a good job of managing the margin at least in the short term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It will be much more difficult to do so in Q4 and Q1 and 2013, but then again we'll try to do our best and we'll all see the results later on.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a little bit more color please on the retail activity. Would you expect that the consumer lending is going to continue to grow rapidly in the fourth quarter and in next year? And how do you view potential changes in regulations affecting the sector activity positively or negatively, as well as your own activity? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we still see some healthy growth in the sector there, and of course, it's shifted towards higher margin, high yield products due to people trying to compensate for the very high deposit cost growth. We &#x2013; as I mentioned a bit earlier on the call, specifically the growth patterns in the retail loan book have been a bit of a mixed nature for us on our own books. Sector may also have had this, but just focusing on us for now, like July and August didn't have a seasonal slowdown, and September and October, which normally show a good pickup from a seasonal slowdown over the summer, didn't really pick up. They have, on the opposite, dipped down a little bit in terms of the pace of growth or rather slowed down.</p>
          <p>November has been a little bit sluggish for us, still very healthy double-digits, but not peak numbers of applications. And December, due to this country and its seasonal dynamics of July, August, and September, October, November, it's a bit difficult for everyone to say whether there is going to be December traditional peak in retail lending activity or not, or if there is going to be one, is it going to be as sharp one as last year. Also big question is whether there is going to be a big continuation of that peak into the January, which was very unusual in our case last year or &#x2013; well, January this year, 2012, we were expecting a little bit of a slowdown due to the holiday season of the early January, but it didn't happen. In fact, January has grown higher than December volumes, which is the first time that we've seen it.</p>
          <p>But whether that will happen this time it's difficult to see, because also net consumer disposable income was growing pretty healthily up until recently, but it started slowing down only really about a month or two ago. And last year was also subject to quite a bit of government spending due to the political election cycle going on in December and running up to March. But the conditions are a little bit different now. So we can only be directional in our outlook and saying that we would expect some slowdown in the consumer loan growth as well. And on a full year basis for 2013, as I have mentioned, it may go reasonably down to about 25% from the 35%, 40% numbers that we've seen this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the regulations, would you see that as being helpful or harmful at least from Sberbank's perspective? The proposed regulations, I should say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we expect that it will have a significant influence on the sector. There is a particular provision there that helps strong banks that are not in the very aggressive and higher margin part of this market, but rather operate with its traditional client base that is using the payroll services provided to the employers by the banks. And I know Alfa and ourselves are having very big proportions of this type of client. This allows us to risk weight those assets much &#x2013; kind of less prohibitively than the other players in consumer lending sector.</p>
          <p>And therefore, the impact on the banks like yours and ours is going to be relatively modest. And that's, I guess, the whole purpose of all the adjustments that the regulators are proposing. They don't want the smaller banks to run away into the big risk areas on the consumer lending, so without having appropriate risk underwriting machines. And classic players within the top 10 who have very good risk management systems to suffer, but did not suffer. So far, our estimate on &#x2013; of the impact of this particular consumer lending regulation and one capital adequacy Russian regulatory ratio show to be only 1 basis points by same time next year and maybe 2 basis points by January 1, 2014.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Most of my questions have answered. I wanted just to follow-up. First, the rapid growth of overdue in consumer lending in this quarter, could you give some light on the dynamics in the fourth quarter, and how do you transfer to the NPL by the end of the year? And the second question is, why the loss generation from VBI, as I see, accelerated in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a bit more difficult for me to be that specific in terms of how much of the improved consumer lending growth will filter into NPL that's specifically related to the third quarter. I would still ask you to look at the bigger picture and see that we've been showing pretty good NPL ratios being low NPL ratios, really good provisioning cover, and very good recovery rates, and therefore our overall NPLs are quite low. In terms of VBI, if you could repeat the question, I didn't quite understood it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The loss for the full history from the M&amp;A as statement says from VBI is now RUB4.8 billion -</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Most of the impact is related to provisioning against the credit quality, and it is a combination of two things. It's both that the credit quality has turned out to be worse than we assessed at the point of &#x2013; at the first point of consolidation and closing the deal, we have discovered that the quality of the credit portfolio was worse materially. And then &#x2013; and it was represented to us. And also there were continuing negative trends in the macro in the countries where VBI operates, and I think most of the banks in the sector were creating additional provisions and they were also in line with the rest of the region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when do you expect VBI to pass breakeven point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're yet to take some of the decision &#x2013; material decisions that would determine that. This relates to how much more investment and cost we would need to put in there to kind of sort out the integration and cleanup issues over a faster period of time or a longer period of time. We're yet to make that decision. It may get back to profit next year. We may decide that we want to invest and spend a bit more and fast, and therefore postpone that breakeven point into next year.</p>
          <p>The overall guiding principle for us is that whatever is going to be better &#x2013; best and optimal result in terms of them finally becoming accretive to our overall Group results on the three-year horizon, it's spending a bit more in next year and getting higher results the one or two years afterwards is better than we spend a bit more. If we see that we should tread carefully and spend less amounts, and then that would be more accretive on a consolidated Group basis for us, we will slow down the pace a little bit. But so far, it looks like investing into OpEx and CapEx a bit upfront would make a good sense to be done in 2012-2013.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a couple of questions. My first question is on net income outlook for the next year. You tell us that there are several scenarios and the $13 billion is an optimistic scenario and there are other scenarios, which you are not in a position to disclose. What are the main variables for you in your estimate, is this growth, is this cost of risk, or maybe revision of cost budget, so what are the main variables?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination. I would rank them in &#x2013; we expect certain impact from all three areas. If I rank them in terms of materiality that's, of course, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> growth, first. Then probably equal impact from cost analysis and cost of risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. That's clear. Thank you. Another question is about net interest margin outlook. When you say that you expect margins sub-6% for 2013, do you base your estimates on assumption that there will be no rate cuts next year, and as you say then interest rates will stabilize? So in other words, if there will be rate cut by the Central Bank, would impact come on top of the expected decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're actually not making that specific assumption. It's a little bit more touchy-feely, and in the normal time that will be an inappropriate phrase to hear from a CFO of a bank. But, look, we're all in the same boat. No one in the market knows how the liquidity and the rate environment is going to be stacking up three, four months from now, not to say 12 months from now. And also the latest rate hike by the Russian Central Bank was not really that much expected , and as you have read the Russian press, has been highly criticized by the business and banking community. And our CEO was also one of the very vocal critics of that particular latest rate model.</p>
          <p>So it's so unpredictable that you have to be building your assumptions on far less specific outlook, a bit more macro kind of natural equilibrium between supply and demand of the liquidity as opposed to how the regulators are going to be behaving, because in all honesty, look, the margins within which the regulator &#x2013; the monetary authorities have had to act in Russia in the past year or so have been really tight. They have a very narrow corridor between slowing down the growth too much and/or provoking inflation to start creeping back up again. So they with very limited constraints of how much they are going to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, thanks. That's clear. Thank you. And my last question is a small one. Did you think that alignment of the Central Bank requirements, the Central Bank regulation with Basel III will stimulate the bank to move IFRS from Basel I to Basel III? So, do you have plans to move to Basel III in other words?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are &#x2013; for our internal in-house purposes, we're almost entirely on Basel III already. To whatever extent the Russian regulators are going to be implementing parts and features of Basel III before full and ultimate compliance with Basel II is going to be required from 2014. We will be, of course, implementing them. I don't think there is a particular need for us, for our own internal purposes, to all of a sudden jump to full Basel III before that is required by any regulators. So &#x2013; because, look, all these Basel II and Basel III implementations as of what and how much you need to do with your IT systems and processes, are quite costly propositions.</p>
          <p>So I don't think I am going to be appreciated if I was all of a sudden on this call saying, oh yeah, and by the way, on top of all the big tasks that we have, we decided also to jump on to Basel III whilst it's not required a bit earlier than everyone else and spend another RUB100 million or RUB200 million in getting there. So, no, we're fully on Basel II in time, but when it's required and whatever parts of Basel III are going to be required. Officially, we're going to be compliant. That's as far as we're prepared to go.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from Ronny Rehn from KBW. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, Anton. Thanks for taking the time. I have to go back, I think, to the cost question. So you guided to the 20%, 25% in 2013. Could we get a bit more longer-term guidance? When will you be done with most investments? What size we'll be looking at and what's the time we'll be looking at cost growth, kind of closer or in line with the inflation? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question in that context, when I look at your guidance for loan growth and for margins, and sort of take my view of these, it looks like clearly that revenue will be growing slower again next year than costs, no positive operating leverage. What year do you think Sberbank will be able to deliver revenue growth ahead of cost for the first time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are two very related questions indeed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But long term, we still stick to our guidance that most of the investments are going to be done and completed within the coming two years, 2013 and 2014, and after that our nominal cost growth will start gradually reducing to normal non-transformational kind of pace. We are going to see some of the impact from this &#x2013; all this OpEx and CapEx investment that we already made and are making in 2012-2013 to start having some positive impact in cost reduction starting 2013, but it's not going to be full year setting. It will take this trend a year or two to also set in. Therefore, in relative terms, our current, very aggressive plan is to start subsiding our cost/income ratio from just sub-50 to mid-40s starting from 2015.</p>
          <p>In terms of the jaws, there is a cost and income growth pace. It's actually subject to an optimum finding in terms of ROEs and ROAs and these types of parameters. We did not set ourselves a specific month from which the trend is going to be achieved. And again, there is two reasons for that. Firstly, until our cost/income ratio is comfortably below 50, which is pretty respectable, we can afford to be flexible if we see long yielding, very accretive strategic reason for that. And the second is that, again, running so many fundamental projects that is transforming this bank. At the same time, your project operational risk management with a higher cost of errors requires you changing the pace of different projects on the go quite rapidly. You sometimes either speed it up a particular project out of few hundred that we operate. You either speed it up or you slow it down if there is some operational risk that may start crystallizing &#x2013; looming in some stage.</p>
          <p>So we're driving that with a view to complete the strategy broadly on time, broadly all projects in sync, because they're all interlinked with specific months or quarters whether that's 2013, 2014 or 2015 is irrelevant as long as they continue to grow net profits, show good strong respectable ROEs, show very good relative cost efficiency in cost/income ratio being less than 50%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, I mean, it sounds like from the cost trajectory that you're kind of describing that maybe towards the 2014 maybe towards the end could be &#x2013; maybe the first point in time when we see this positive leverage. But looking just in 2013, I mean, it sounds very unlikely. It looks &#x2013; sounds to me more like a 10% operating profit growth putting like all the pieces of the puzzle together. So it sounds like you're also still quite positive on the loan loss charges. I mean, you already alluded to that a bit. But, I mean, are we looking at something like 80 basis points, is that completely off, or is that a reasonable assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's not talk specific basis points, bear with us, please, a few weeks. End of the December, first half of January we'll start communicating some more details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fantastic. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, because with the scale of our operation, 19,000 branches, our business &#x2013; annual business planning process works in two iteration. It goes two times top down and two times bottom up in two cycles, because otherwise you're just not going to get a sensible result. So that takes us from August to December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Natalia Berezina from UralSib Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. My first question is on Basel III actually. So am I right to assume that in case preferred shares are moved from Tier 1 capital, the impact will be too small for it to be a reason for you to consider converting them into commons?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, they are kind of immaterial. Nevertheless, we don't see a strong point in their existence either, and this question has been asked to us for the past five years. We have not taken decision as to when we might consider getting rid of them, because they don't really serve any particular purpose right now. They may have back in the 1990s, but not now. But no specific decisions yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I understood. Thank you. And the second question is on Deniz, and especially the cost of risk. So it was quite high in the third quarter, if I'm not mistaken, almost 3%. And is it more one-off or are there any reasons to be more concerned going forward, so not 1.2% normalized level as we saw in the first half, but something higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. The explanation to that is that the cost of risk in DenizBank for the first three quarters of 2012 has increased because of the overall situation in the banking sector in Turkey. That is not out of line with all the leading &#x2013; other leading top 10 players in the sector. So, yeah, that's the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And some &#x2013; just general view on the situation in Turkey for the fourth quarter, for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Difficult to comment for me now on such a specific issue. I may come back to you with our house view off the line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And just to follow-up very brief. So your net interest margin of 6.2%, is it with or without Deniz?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's without, it's on core business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>We will now take our next question from Svetlana Aslanova from VTB Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening. Thank you very much. I have two small questions. First of all, your current loan-to-deposit ratio is currently well above 100%. What would be your comfortable level in the coming quarters? And also, could you please explain what was the reason behind the quarter-on-quarter decline in the fee and commission income in the third quarter? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we kind of touched upon 109%, 110% area, which is a bit of a border for us at this moment of the comfort zone. We're expecting fourth quarter for this ratio to get back a bit closer to 100% than it is now, and therefore not necessarily require of any radical action from our side. In terms of fees and commission income, again, what particularly did you want to hear on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it declined quarter-on-quarter, so were there any particular reasons for this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the main impact is from fees and commissions that we see from cross-selling third-party insurance products through our branch network. There was a little bit of a slowdown there. Some of it may be related to some of the unclarity in terms of how cross-selling practices are interpreted from the anti-monopoly legislations for people. It is not that we have a problem there. It's just that people are taking bit of a breather to have a look around whether there might be any changes in the regulatory attitude to that. But, hopefully, there shouldn't be, so we don't consider this as something materially trendsetting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So this would be basically a one quarter one-off, would that be correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can you say it again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was this quarter &#x2013; this very quarter one-off event, so -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know how long will that impact manifest itself specifically on insurance, maybe only one quarter one-off, maybe on the space of half year one-off or three quarters one-off. Yes, it is difficult to &#x2013; we'll start monitoring this very close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi gentlemen. Sorry, just one question on cost to follow-up again. You've previously mentioned that you expect most of your projects to be completed on time within the next two years. But what about branch rebranding? I remember your plan was to rebrand about 2,000 branches in this year. So how do you look on the schedule and what's your plan for 2013 and 2014? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you are right, we were mentioning some numbers on branch reformatting. And before I start answering this, we have worked almost an hour and a half already. I kind of start losing my voice a little bit, but nevertheless I know there is always quite a number of questions after the quarterly report, but we will be happy to response to them through our normal Investor Relations channel. So if we may make the next question be our last, but whilst I'm answering &#x2013; our last for today, answering this question.</p>
          <p>Yes we have done 800 branches reformatted in 2011. The plan for 2012 is 1,800. We have done over 70% of the plan, which is by this time December is pretty good. The next year is we are slowing down this pace. We will only do just over 2,200, and then we will come up to a decision as to what would be the pace of reformatting the branches.</p>
          <p>So, yeah, if we may take just last question for today, and then we will wrap up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a quick one on this, would you be able to just say how much of this reformatting expenditure, what's the share of this in your repairs and maintenance expenditure?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is &#x2013; you mean how does it split between CapEx and OpEx or...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, just to gather what portion of your maintenance expenditure relates to this branch reformatting, so we can better in terms of forecast your cost growth going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's mostly &#x2013; maintenance is normally OpEx. It's not really part of reformatting. There is quite &#x2013; most of reformatting effort is CapEx, and then maintenance is not that material part of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Emmy Al-Ghabra from UBS. Just a follow-up question on your capital funding. We've seen over the last few months issuance of some hybrid debt instruments from some other Russian banks. Can we expect to see Sberbank coming to international markets of funding again over the next year, and in particular are you considering the use of this hybrid instrument?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we will remain similar &#x2013; we'll keep similar level of activity on wholesale markets, pricing conditions permitting. That you would have observed throughout 2012. That also envisages probably, similar to this year, one transaction that we would do classic sub-debt, very simple structure like we've done is possible. We may consider some &#x2013; maybe one issue of a bit more kind of hybrid nature, but no decisions that we have taken in a particular space. So far we haven't seen the need for any of these things. Hopefully, we won't see the need next year, but I'm just not ruling it out either.</p>
