        <plist>
          <p>So good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I was just told we are ready to start, because some &#x2013; we had to wait because some colleagues might dial in or join us via the internet. A very warm welcome to you on this afternoon on behalf of the Linde Board for our Analysts Meeting today here in Munich. The program this afternoon will be a presentation of the CEO, Wolfgang Reitzle and the CFO, Georg Denoke, and the highlights of the financial year '07 and our mid-term outlook.</p>
          <p>We will have a Q&amp;A session at the end of presentation. Please be aware that today's event is also streamed online on our website, as I just said. Let me finally remind you that the Board will join you for some refreshments and coffee outside of the audience after the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. I would now like to hand over to Wolfgang Reitzle. Please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentleman. I'm very happy to welcome you today for our annual results conference. 2007 has been the first full year in the new setup of the Linde Group. And we have been very successful, both in our operational performance as well as in the execution of our strategic roadmap.</p>
          <p>I would like to start today with some highlights of our 2007 figures. I will then move on and move over to our outlook on financial targets and present to you some of the key elements of our strategic positioning that make us so confident to deliver on these targets.</p>
          <p>And in the second part of the presentation, Georg Denoke will take you in more detail through the operational performance of the Gases division as well as our balance sheet and other important financial metrics. Together with my colleagues of the Executive Board, I will be very pleased to take then later your feedback and questions at the end of our presentations.</p>
          <p>Now, let me start with some highlights of the 2007 financial year. In the first full year since the integration of BOC, Group sales have increased by 13.9% to 12.306 billion. Operating profit improved by 18.1% to 2.424 billion with double-digit growth in the Gases and Engineering divisions. Based on this strong operating performance, we have achieved our target for ROCE and adjusted EPS one year ahead of our initial schedule.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we have delivered on our integration and deleveraging process. Net debt of around &#x20AC;6.4 billion means that we are substantially down from the acquisition peak. This was achieved ahead of our internal schedule and I think also well ahead of market expectations. Our synergy program is progressing fully on plan with even a positive timing effect in 2007, which we will explain to you in more detail later.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we are completely on track towards our mid-term financial target to achieve an operating profit above 3 billion in 2010. To further increase visibility on the value creation of our growth strategy we today introduced a ROCE target of at least 13% in 2010. This means an increase of at least 260 basis points in the next three years. The stability of our business model supplemented by structural growth opportunities is the key element here, why we can be so confident to give you this outlook.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the operational results with a breakdown of our Group sales in 2007. Our Gases division has posted a sales increase of 9.4% to &#x20AC;9.209 billion, including bolt-on acquisitions growth was actually 11.9%. Volume and price trends were both positive, delivering a growth of 7.2% on a fully comparable basis. And Georg Denoke will show you later how our leading position in emerging markets contributed also to this strong performance.</p>
          <p>The Engineering division realized a step change over 2007. Sales leaped 40% towards 2.750 billion. We're very busy here working through our record order backlog. With Group operating profit increasing more strongly than sales with an increase of 18.1% to &#x20AC;2.424 billion, our Group operating margin is up by 70 basis points year-on-year.</p>
          <p>In the Gases division, operating profit growth was 13.7%. This means that the operating margin climbed 90 basis points compared with last year. Operating profit in the Engineering division is up by 39.5% the margin here remained very strong at around 8.7%.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our financial key indicators, you can see that we are running ahead of the targets we set ourselves with the takeover process. Adjusted EPS increased to &#x20AC;5.05 (sic) [&#x20AC;5.02] meaning that the BOC deal is already accretive one year earlier than projected. And that means in the very first year of the new setup. On the adjusted ROCE we wanted to back into double-digit figures by 2008. With a ROCE of 10.3% in 2007 we have reached this goal also one year ahead of target.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the two bars in the middle I think I should explain something. Here, I have to explain that the real comparable ROCE figure for 2006 without the operational performance of KION and only four months of BOC was as on basis 8.2%. So with a 10.3 for 2007 and that's what we want to say. So we are then by this spec in to the double-digit figures.</p>
          <p>Now these numbers clearly show that we are executing with success on our integration process. The synergy program is actually running well, smoothly and very smoothly. And the bottomline contribution was &#x20AC;75 million in 2007 and even exceeded by this our initial forecast. This is mainly a timing effect as several measures delivered bottomline effects even quicker than we had hoped for. This certainly only strengthens even more our confidence in the &#x20AC;250 million target as a bottomline contribution in 2009, which we announced very early in that takeover process as you know.</p>
          <p>So let's take a look at the individual components of the cost synergies. Among the 2007 projects, G&amp;A measures have definitely been the major contributor, also regarding the mentioned timing effect. This includes the consolidation of Linde and BOC headquarters as well as the restructuring of central functions and regional overheads. We have also had some first effects from economies of scale on the procurement and supply side.</p>
          <p>These are the sort of measures that need some more analysis and planning and will hence contribute more strongly to the bottomline as we go through this year. Based on our strong operating performance and the successful integration process I can today confirm that we are well on track towards all our financial targets. Alongside on operating profits, in excess of 3 billion, our target for the return on capital employed for 2010 is at least 13%.</p>
          <p>For 2008, we expect an increase in sales with an over-proportionate growth of operating profit. In the Gases division, we want again to outgrow the global industrial gases market. Based on further collection of synergies and our ongoing efficiency measures, margins should further expand so that operating profit growth exceeds sales growth. As you know, we reckon with an average CapEx to sales ratio of around 13% over the next years.</p>
          <p>In our Engineering division, the strong order backlog and the ongoing positive market environment point to a mid-term sales growth of around 8 to 10%. Putting our strong confidence in our mid-term targets into the current context of discussions on these financial market crisis and potential macro economic effects and risks, I think it is particularly, important to understand how our stable our business model has become in the new setup.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Gases business to start with, we have a real balance between the economic regions around the world based on our presence in around 100 countries. On top of that we command high market shares in most countries. In the local market structure like the Industrial Gases industry this is a key attribute to drive economies of scale and price leadership. The best way to leverage these leading market positions is a well balanced business mix, as the output of the same plant allows us to supply customers of all sizes and markets.</p>
          <p>Being the global markets leader in the bulk and cylinder market, we have an application portfolio and R&amp;D reach that allows us to fully benefit from the constant flow of new applications driving industrial gases growth above GDP. Let me note here that increasing energy prices do not necessarily act as a brake on industrial gases demand but can even generates sales growth as we help our customers improve their processes with new gases solutions.</p>
          <p>High market shares, rental fees and a strongly diversified customer base will drive a sustainable cash flow contribution from our merchant market businesses. In the tonnage segment, the stability of the business model is more driven by the long-term customer commitment and the contract structures.</p>
          <p>In this important market segment we have in our new setup strongly improved our strategic position. We are the global number two on absolute sales basis. However, you should be aware that a significant share of our tonnage business is actually not topline visible because of our &#x2013; their joint venture structure of the so-called embedded financial lease accounting.</p>
          <p>Together with the competitive advantage of having a first-class engineering activity in-house we are leveraging our leading market position in the emerging market sale regions into a busy pipeline of new plant start-ups. Our current CapEx program foresees 48 major plants start ups in the year 2008 to 2010. The number of projects for 2010 is obviously still provisional here as the pipeline of new potential signings remain very well filled.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at the regional split of these 48 projects, you see that more than half of them will come from the so-called emerging markets. It will be no surprise for you that among the numerous discussions on potential new projects we are currently holding, additional capacities in emerging market regions, as well as new applications in the energy field, are the main drivers here. Our positioning in the engineering segment very often allow us to be involved very early in any project discussions and hence also contributes to the project pipeline of our Gases division.</p>
          <p>I would like to single out one project of our current tonnage pipeline to illustrate, what I just mentioned. We having indeed signed in December 2007, a joint venture agreement with ADNOC so the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, regarding one first tonnage scheme in the Ruwais cluster. But the scope of this arrangement goes far beyond that. To start with ADNOC is a longstanding customer of our Engineering division and the supply scheme mentioned will actually provide nitrogen to an ethylene plant that we are currently building for Borouge, an ADNOC lead consortium.</p>
          <p>In line with our conviction on a balanced product mix additional liquefier capacity will allow us to develop the emerging market on base of the same production plant.</p>
          <p>Finally the joint venture structure is set up to serve follow-up contracts for additional industrial gases needs in the &#x2013; this region. The outlook for additional petrochemical capacities is promising, given the political will, to leverage the financial resources and the availability of quality feedstock. The local oil and gas revenues, controlled to around 90% by ADNOC, are indeed the fourth largest in the world.</p>
          <p>Before moving over to the Engineering division, I would also like to emphasize our limited risk profile on the currency side. You know that the local business model of industrial gases implies a natural cost hedge and a limited transactional risk. The underlying translational risks are balanced by our global footprint, limiting the impact of individual currency movements. For the Engineering segment, just as a reminder, we use full currency hedging, meaning that all currency exposures within our projects are immediately hedged after contract signing.</p>
          <p>Despite the step change in processed orders, order backlog stabilized above the &#x20AC;4 billion mark. This gives us very strong visibility in our project schedule for the years to come. Beyond that we remain close to record levels on order intake as ongoing strong demand is driving further flow of new activity. As you know one reason for the stability in the Engineering business is our diversified product portfolio. The picture on order intake split can vary strongly from year-to-year as a result of bigger orders being booked. Nevertheless, the momentum in all four of our segments is currently strong providing a very stable support to a further extension of our growth path.</p>
          <p>Besides the usual somewhat cyclical drivers within the various end markets demand is currently also supported by the more structural driver on the so-called energy mega-trends. The starting point here is very clear. In the context of rising energy prices and numerous environmental issues, we need new technologies along this, what I call energy value chain to secure a sustainable long-term energy supply for future generations.</p>
          <p>Among the numerous research done all along this value chain, we have mapped our technology solutions on their current state of development in the diagram you see here. First of all, as the gray or white shadings indicate, we provide solutions either as a gas application or a plant engineering or actively through an interaction of both. This clearly shows how, for this energy mega-trend in particular, we can generate synergies between our two core divisions with in practice engineering leading the way towards new gases applications.</p>
          <p>Without going into the detail of each individual technology, so I don't want to make you nervous now by looking at that chart, you can map how our portfolio along four big themes. First, liquefaction of natural gas and the further processing of LNG. Second oxygen assisted technologies, where we supply oxygen capacities to conversion processes like GTL, so gas to liquid, or coal gasification.</p>
          <p>Third, oilfield services and carbon storage and sequestration. And finally fourth, renewable energy generation, where we either supply gases or gasification plants. Let me also remind you that next to these big themes, we have numerous applications within our traditional gases portfolio that help our customers improve the efficiency of their energy use. As such the energy theme is already an important growth driver for both of our divisions.</p>
          <p>Now the structural factors to drive this momentum towards a sustainable mega-trend seem to be in place. The development of every single technology towards a full fledge solution is here an ongoing process making any precise prediction on markets and timings a very difficult call. What we can however be sure of is that with our extensive and diversified range of technologies our Gases and Engineering operations, we are very well equipped to seize the upcoming growth opportunities. This is why, I think that our company is today very well equipped to deliver on our mid-term targets and embrace a sustainable and stable growth path.</p>
          <p>We have shown in 2007 that our new set up is up and running to deliver a strong operational performance. Our transformation process is complete; we are a pure player with a significantly reduced debt level and solid maturity profile. Independently of any economic uncertainties that may exist, our business model is very stable.</p>
          <p>We operate on a very solid set up in attractive stable growing industries. By further developing our performance culture and leveraging our strong market positions and technologies towards the upcoming growth opportunities, which I mentioned, we aim to deliver on our mid-term targets and deliver sustainable, profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention and now I want to hand over to Georg Denoke.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you Wolfgang and welcome everybody also from my side. As mentioned at the beginning I would like to take you in my presentation in more details through the operational performance, mainly of the Gases division, as well as our balance sheet and other important financial metrics.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our Gases division. Here for the first time, we present the division numbers split by our new operating segments. The structure of these segments has been driven by our operating model and reflects our management responsibilities. It also aims to group together regions with similar economic characteristics. The overall sales growth in the Gases division was 7.2% on a comparable basis. This means excluding currency, consolidation and natural gas price effects. Excluding sales type leases the growth stands at 7.7%. Sales type leases are new tonnage projects, which are treated as one-time sales under embedded finance lease.</p>
          <p>On a comparable basis growth in the operating segments South Pacific and Africa was strongest at 13.3% rising from &#x20AC;1.169 billion to &#x20AC;1.284 billion. Here we have fully participated in a strong economy and the basic materials boom. Asia and Eastern Europe, a typical growth region, showed an increase of 9.1% with sales rising to &#x20AC;1.618 billion. As expected the more mature markets within operating segments Americas and Western Europe showed lower but still remarkable strong growth rates. The Americas grew 6.6% from 2.3 billion to 2.348 billion. And Western Europe, our largest operating segment, rose 5.1% to 4.026 billion.</p>
          <p>Key regions within the operating segments remain Continental and Northern Europe with sales of 3.029 billion and a comparable growth of 5.7%. As well as North America with sales of &#x20AC;1.893 billion, on a comparable basis the growth was 6.6%. On a comparable basis region with the strongest growth are Greater China with 19.6%, Africa with 17% and South America with 15.6%.</p>
          <p>Joint ventures form an important part of our ongoing business. The decrease in sales yet an increase in net income must be viewed in the context of the significant changes to our joint venture portfolio during 2007. When considering our ongoing net income contribution from joint ventures a run rate of around &#x20AC;50 million should be indicative.</p>
          <p>This decrease compared to the &#x20AC;77 million in 2007 is driven by two key joint ventures. The Malaysian Oxygen acquisition and the Lien Hwa consolidation, which became fully, consolidated subsidiaries mid ways through 2007, as well as a disposal of a number of other Asian joint ventures. Please note that in the annual report net income in 2006 is &#x20AC;31 million as opposed to the like for like &#x20AC;49 million shown here in this slide.</p>
          <p>Our usual sales bridge leads you from our reported gases growth of 9.4% to the comparable number of 7.2%. The major effects were currency and consolidation related. The main contributors to the consolidation line were the 100% acquisition of Malaysia Oxygen and the consolidation of Lien Hwa. There was negligible impact from the natural gas price over 2007.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that our organic growth figure excluded all bolt-on acquisitions. Not considering the consolidation effect the comparable growth would be 11.9%.</p>
          <p>Moving on to operating profit here, again for the first time we show a detailed breakdown of our operating profit by operating segments. This illustrates our commitment to transparency and comparable breakdowns will be shown quarter-by-quarter throughout 2008. Overall, the operating profit in the gases division grew by 13.7% to &#x20AC;2.314 billion.</p>
          <p>The operating segment with highest growth is Asia and Eastern Europe, a key driver obviously being the strong GDP growth in these markets. Operating profit grew 49.2% from &#x20AC;313 million to &#x20AC;467 million. The Americas, a traditionally strong market, showed solid growth of 10.9%, rising from &#x20AC;403 million to &#x20AC;447 million.</p>
          <p>South Pacific and Africa, our smallest operating segment, in operating profit terms grew 7.4% from &#x20AC;282 million to &#x20AC;303 million. Our largest operating segment, the more mature Western Europe, again showed solid growth with operating profit rising 5.8% from &#x20AC;1.037 billion to &#x20AC;1.097 billion.</p>
          <p>A key driver behind the increased profitability is our synergy and efficiency program. Significant contributions have come from all regions with initiatives in the areas of administration end procurement, as well as numerous supply and distribution optimization projects. We have finalized the restructuring of our head office location well ahead of schedule. This has resulted in notable savings in North America and Western Europe.</p>
          <p>With an operating margin at 25.1%, the profitability of the gases division improved by 90 basis points compared with last year. This positive development was mainly driven by the operating segments Asia and Eastern Europe, and Americas. The emerging markets region, Asia and Eastern Europe, posted the strongest increase with margins up by 280 basis points from 26.1% to 28.9%.</p>
          <p>In the Americas the operating margin gained 150 basis points to 19%. Operating margins in Western Europe were stable at a strong level of 27.2% whereas the South Pacific and Africa segment retreated 50 basis points to 23.6%. Overall, you can also see that we have a quite good balance of profitability across all our regions and operating segments.</p>
          <p>On this slide you can see the product segment view and the gases division. Please bear in mind that the comparable growth numbers are corrected by currency, consolidation and natural gas price effects. Sales in the cylinder business increased by 12.1% to &#x20AC;3.666 billion driven by the high demand in Australia and Africa as well as very solid performance all across Europe. The comparable growth figure was 8.6%.</p>
          <p>The bulk segment improved sales to &#x20AC;2.821 billion, which means a growth of 9.1% compared with last year. The comparable growth was 6.2%. This positive development is based on a good performance in Continental, Northern as well as in Eastern Europe. On the other hand it is diluted by a planned sale in India and high spot volumes in Australia in 2006 driven up by a sequence of mine fires.</p>
          <p>Sales in the tonnage business rose by 5% to &#x20AC;2.111 billion. On a comparable basis the increase was 7.9%. This performance is carried by the ramp up of new facilities in Europe, Asia, the US and South America. Please note that the comparable growth figure for tonnage excludes the one-time effects from new plant sales under embedded finance lease.</p>
          <p>The healthcare segment has shown a strong performance with sales being up by 11.3% to &#x20AC;983 million. The comparable growth was 9.4%, which including acquisition was 11.1%. We had a particularly strong performance in the UK, Scandinavia, North and South America.</p>
          <p>As Wolfgang Reitzle has showed at the beginning we are well on track with our synergy and efficiency program. As we have said all along our effort is geared towards &#x20AC;250 million annual bottomline impact by 2009. The analyses contained in the slide demonstrate in a full transparent manner how, during 2007, our synergy program directly impacted our bottomline.</p>
          <p>The margin improvements are significant. With the exception of the 2006 joint venture impact, which has been adjusted for comparability, all these figures can be found in our annual report. The ramp up is visible in our margins. On the Linde Group level we have achieved a 70 basis points operating margin increase. The number is somewhat diluted by our successful growth in the Engineering division.</p>
          <p>Now please keep in mind that our growth and performance program is mostly aiming at our Gases business and the corporate segments. When you break out these two parts you are looking at an operating profit of &#x20AC;2.163 billion on &#x20AC;9.209 billion of sales. The operating margin is 23.5% or 140 basis points higher than last year.</p>
          <p>Further deducting the operating profit component originating from joint ventures, which have no topline impact, leads to an underlying margin of 22.7%. This improvement of 120 basis points of which 75 million can be traced back to the synergy initiatives with sustainable impact.</p>
          <p>The cash flow from operating activities in the new Group structure was &#x20AC;1.742 billion. This figure is for sure not comparable with the one of the previous year. Anyway, it gives you a good idea of the strong cash flow generation potential in our new Group structure. Regarding the cash flow from operating activities of 2007, you should be aware of one time effects of minus 100 million, netting the pension top up and extraordinary tax impacts.</p>
          <p>The negative impact of the working capital is mainly affected by a lower increase of down payments for the Engineering division compared to 2006. Nevertheless, the down payments remained on a historical high level. The cash flow from investing activities and disposal proceeds represents the transformation process of the Linde Group in 2006 and 2007. Group investments increased by 33.4% to 1.035 billion.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we spent 537 million on acquisitions. The major ones being Malaysian Oxygen, BOS in Turkey, and ENGI in Algeria. This strong increase is mostly caused by the full year impact of the BOC acquisition, which was accounted for starting in September 2006. For the first time, investments in our Gases division exceeded 1 billion for a total of &#x20AC;1.062 billion resulting in a CapEx/sales ratio of 11.5%.</p>
          <p>On the right side of the chart, you'll see the investment spilt by operating segments. As you can see we have significantly increased our investments in the growth regions, but we also have the strong commitment in the more mature markets. In Western Europe, we have invested &#x20AC;377 million, as you know the year 2006 was impacted by significant investment for new tonnage projects in this region.</p>
          <p>Investments in the Americas increased by 10.4% to a total of 230 million or 8.9% of sales. In Asia and Eastern Europe, we more than doubled our investments to &#x20AC;334 million. The CapEx/sales ratio of 20.6% reflects the strong economy and our successful engagement in the market for large tonnage schemes in that geography. South Pacific and Africa are also enjoying a strong economy. In these geographies we are commanding a large cylinder business. Our investment of 138 million or 10.7% of sales shows that we are successfully expanding our market leader position.</p>
          <p>Let me take you now through the major components of our significant net debt reduction in 2007. The main contribution comes from disposal proceeds of &#x20AC;3.557 billion and the operating cash flow of &#x20AC;1.742 billion. Net investment activities amounted to &#x20AC;1.471 billion, while net interest payments were &#x20AC;404 million.</p>
          <p>The other projection mainly includes foreign exchange gain effects resulting from our debt in non-euro currency, mainly US dollar, UK pound, and Australian dollar. The net debt to EBITDA ratio has also improved significantly over the course of the year going down from 4.8 to 2.7. You can expect this figure to decline further going forward given our growth pass in operating profit.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you, that besides reducing the absolute debt level we have also lengthened debt maturity in 2007. After the issuance of the fixed rate bonds for a total amount of around &#x20AC;2.4 billion in April last year, we have indeed no major capital market debt maturing before April 2012.</p>
          <p>Our guidance for pre-tax cost of debt stands unchanged at 5.8% to 6%. Our gearing ratio is down from 120.8% per end of 2006 to 69.8% in 2007. Here we have on top of the net debt reduction also a positive contribution from our increase in Group equity.</p>
          <p>So a significant increase of the Group's equity by around 1 billion, plus 12% is mainly due to the net income of 1 billion. The worldwide currency devaluation resulted in a reduction of equity of 686 million. This effect is partly compensated by net investment hedges, which are included in the other column. The other main impact included in others is a positive impact from actuarial gains and losses from pensions.</p>
          <p>The net amount recorded in our balance sheet relating to pension financing has decreased from 1.014 billion to 403 million. This takes into account pension like obligations and the assets ceiling. The latter are the plan assets resulting from over funded pension plans, which cannot be recovered by Linde and are therefore not recognized on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Of the &#x20AC;403 million on the balance sheet, bear in mind that &#x20AC;747 million are recorded as provisions by the remaining amount of &#x20AC;344 million is recorded as pension asset within our other long-term receivables. Our net pension obligation has decreased significantly in all regions during 2007 from a total of &#x20AC;951 million to 339 million. This is minus 64% mainly affected by funding and positive development of actuarial assumptions.</p>
          <p>I would also like to briefly show you the adjustments for EPS and ROCE. The adjustment take into account for the calculation of earnings per share include, as per our definition, the effects resulting from the purchase price allocation of &#x20AC;446 million, disposal gains of &#x20AC;607 million and the respective tax impacts. After these adjustments of minus 138 million in total the earning after taxes amount to &#x20AC;814 million compared to &#x20AC;644 million in the previous year.</p>
          <p>As such, the adjusted earnings per share have increased by 7.7% to &#x20AC;5.02, which means that the acquisition of BOC is already accretive after the first year. Please note that the EBIT before special items line on top of this slide is a numerator of our ROCE calculation. The capital employed is calculated by adding equity, net debt, net pension obligations and deducting net receivables from financial services. The adjustment of 1.3 billion reflects the respective adjustments recorded in the P&amp;L for PPA and special items.</p>
          <p>Our adjusted average capital employed increased from 12.077 billion to 15.491 billion. This increase results mainly from the recognition of BOC for a full 12 months period. Despite that, we achieved a double-digit ROCE of 10.3% one year ahead of our timetable. As already mentioned, the ROCE target for 2012 is at least 13%.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate in 2007 of the Linde Group was 27.6%. The total tax charge of &#x20AC;379 million comprised a current tax charge of &#x20AC;484 million and the deferred tax credit of &#x20AC;105 million. Different key factors have led to a reduction of the effective tax rate in 2007. On the one hand we had a strong performance in countries with lower tax rates like in Eastern Europe and Asia. On the other hand, Linde benefited from falling income tax rates mainly in Germany, UK, USA and China.</p>
          <p>We also received tax reimbursements for previous years during the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate in 2008 is expected to be around 30%. The dividend for 2007 is proposed to be increased by $0.20 from &#x20AC;1.50 to &#x20AC;1.70 per share. You know that we want the dividend development of Linde Group to adequately reflect operating profit growth.</p>
          <p>Let me summarize, Linde is on a very solid growth track. We have the set up to deliver a strong underlying growth. Our growth momentum does not rely on isolated driver &#x2013; drivers, but is supported by broad base momentum in all regions and product lines. We have a well balanced profitability profile.</p>
          <p>The other key message from me today, is that Linde has a very strong balance sheet to support its growth plans. We have significantly improved net debt, equity and our pension obligations over the last year. This means that our company has a sound financing profile, which proves to be extremely important in the current volatile credit market environment.</p>
          <p>And we also have an improved cash flow profile going forward based on our pure play set up. We have the ability to deliver on our financial ambitions; and therefore, confirm with strong confidence, our targets for operating profit and synergies. Our continued focus on cash flow delivery, ROCE and EPS growth is a best basis for our sustainable and profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention and we're happy to take your questions now.</p>

          <p>So thank you very much for your presentations. I would now like to enter the Q&amp;A session let us have your questions please. Who will be the first, Mr. Schlein please? No, it was &#x2013; yeah you. So you start, Mr. Stott?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Andrew Stott, Merrill Lynch. And couple of questions. Just going back to the net debt, an extremely good outcome. Just wanted to double check on the, the sort of year-end issues in terms of any phasing on tax, I wasn't quite clear in your comments, Georg, on 100 million of tax. And also, if I look at the report in accounts it looks like deferred tax has gone up by 200 million. So just wondering about the cash tax for '08, please? And the second &#x2013; sorry...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question, back to your medium term target on EBITDA, obviously, when you set that, the Euro/Dollar was 1.37 or somewhere around that. What are your thoughts around &#x2013; I mean obviously you're still confident on that target, but what are going to be the offsetting or mitigating factors in the Group? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on, the net debt development I think the first part related to &#x2013; the extraordinary items related to &#x2013; on the one hand currency gains, and the taxation related to disposal proceeds. I think we have here a mixed basket and I think the most important part is that we have around 200 million currency gains in the net debt position. I think that is a very important part. The other important part is, of course that we had reimbursements for Texas, out of the KION disposal, as we always said that this will become visible in the fourth quarter. It was visible and, on the other hand, we had the pension top up payment for the BOC pension scheme. And, I think, going forward that we have still obligations to pay cash inflow for the pension scheme of BOC pensions of around, let's say, 190 million &#x2013; 100 million or 90 million, depending on the currency. So that is an agreement in UK in pounds of course. Therefore it was foreseen as 190 million payment and it was in reality 2007, 170 million. So I think next year it will be significantly lower, but it could be still 90 million.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was 20 million lower. We expected it to be 190 and because of the devaluation of the UK pound it was lower.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your second question related to the mid-term EBITDA target for 2010, 3 billion. Yes. You are perfectly, right. When we made that statement we had a significantly different exchange rate situation not only between euro and pound, but euro and dollar, but also between euro and pound and euro and rand, which is because of our significant business down in South Africa, is also relevant. Eventually it is a good guidance for you. Would we see for the full year of 2008 the currency rates we have this very moment that would cause a dilution of our revenues of around &#x20AC;350 million, reporting all the local currencies into the euro and translating them into the euro balance sheet. And that would then have an equivalent effect of 75 million in EBITDA. Now this is significant. We are from one side, fairly relaxed because, as you know, versus &#x2013; compared with companies which are very much related to exports, we have no margin dilution because no transactional risks, because our cost structure is always in the currency where we generate the sales. But anyway, translating now South African rand, British pound and the dollar into &#x2013; to only mention the three key currencies for us &#x2013; into our euro balance sheet, there is a dilution.</p>
          <p>And now, your question will we reach the 3 billion also by looking at this currency dilution? I would say, for the moment we would say yes. But, will we see a further significant change in currency, then, we have to correct currency. But what we made as a statement already is that should, eventually, by a certain knock-on effect of the financial crisis on, let's say, the real economy, how some people say, should that take place and lead to a certain, let's say, reduced growth rate also in Asia and so on, we still think we can stick to the 3 billion target. But, we can't finally absorb any dilution of currency, that's not possible. So that's I think something I should make as a comment here. On the other hand, for us as a gases company, which is a very local business, for us it's extremely important how do we perform locally? Because one day the currencies will look different and then we have a windfall profit and that's the reason why in principle all gases companies, especially the European ones, always report on a currency adjusted basis because this is the figure which shows you whether a company is well on track or not and, whether they lose market share or not. But, on the other hand, at the end, yes, you have to absorb the currencies and would we see a further slide of the dollar, that clearly has an impact but, fortunately, we are not losing margins. But we have a dilution, reporting in a euro balance sheet.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From UBS. Good afternoon. I've got four questions. The first one is on the energy theme. Could you quantify what your gases sales into the energy end markets are today and, is there any sort of quantitative ambition where you want them to be or can you just talk around what the Board has been discussing? The second question is does the rating &#x2013; the debt &#x2013; the rating agency rating play any role at the moment when you have your Board meetings? I mean, there is no refinancing due. Does it matter in any sense for you? That is the second question. The third question, maybe just a little bit of a feeling on current trading in the United States. You have a significant CO2 business. Could you give us a feeling on how the beverage and food industry is doing and whether you've seen any sign of weakness at the consumer end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the US, yeah. And the last question comes back to the multi-development of the Engineering business. Obviously, sales, order intake, order backlog have gone up substantially. Can you quantify what actually was volume, transaction volume, in terms of projects and what was pass-through of higher Engineering salaries, transaction costs and, how you see that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Incredible detail. Very interesting. Okay. So first, I think because it's the easiest question, I take it. It's the number two question when it comes to rating. I can tell you, after we succeeded in keeping investment grade, which you have to understand, given our situation, when, before we launched the deal with BOC we had been a company with around 7.5 billion market cap going for a 15 billion deal to finance. That's not trivial. And so for us, the permanent question in these days, in preparing the deal and in the first months after we placed the offer, had been around rating. Because we said one thing at the very beginning, a company like ours, going for onsite projects, we want to go for the biggest ones and don't want to see a limitation there. And, with such a substantial Engineering business, we must stay investment grade. Would there had been any indication that we would have run a risk to lose that, we would not have done the deal because I think that would have been just the limit of how far we could go. But we had early indications in involving Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's and so on that there was a good chance to keep the investment grading and finally you saw we succeeded in that. And from then on I can tell you only when Mr. Vale and who is sitting in your row, our finance person, who has to deal with them mainly, for him it's always a certain question. But for us, in the Board, no minute any more. Yes. We had done meetings with Standard &amp; Poor's. They now, last year, earlier than we ever thought, we had been a little bit surprised on our side that they improved our rating that early. So today, we are very relaxed and given our net debt position, from where we come from and where we are now, that was not calculated by Standard &amp; Poor's. They had also been surprised; frankly, we also a little a bit because we executed just fast and more successfully than we could ever plan for. And, frankly, I also have to admit we had a lot of luck executing speedy &#x2013; in a unique window of opportunity, which we grabbed. That was also a lot of luck, but we had it. So since then this is no issue at all. And, earlier than we ever thought we have through our balance sheet structure and especially, when it comes to gearing or, better today, the net debt to EBITDA situation, we have no issue at all in going for high CapEx figures for &#x2013; going for all interesting projects, there is no limitation. So fortunately now, entering a tougher environment when it comes to the financial markets, we are not only quite happy that we came out of that, let's say, restructuring and transformation tunnel so much better than we thought. But, also, as Mr. Denoke already mentioned, we have no issue now in the short-term to renegotiate any debt. So we are very relaxed from this viewpoint. So therefore, clear answer, no. The &#x2013; our rating is no issue at all for us and is not a discussion point within our Board. Now, I would like to ask Mr. Belloni &#x2013; to talk about the energy team and then I think, Kent should take on the CO2 business US question and then, again, Aldo about Engineering order intake. And, I don't know, I just want to give him the right guidance because he knows all the little details. I just don't want to give you too much. I think transparency is fine and I think we are more transparent than ever before. When you look at this year's annual report, I think almost every single question you might have, is answered. But I think there are certain things we don't reveal, but he can give you a certain idea of what is passed through purchase volume like big turbines or so which boosts revenues and what is really added value by our engineers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think that it would require a tremendous data mining exercise to tell you how much of our sales is directly or indirectly related to energy because you could account, also, for oxygen projects, which are invested in order to reduce energy consumption in steel plants or things like that. Probably, your question is more related to direct implications like hydrogen for refineries or nitrogen for enhanced oil recovery. And, of course, we have big schemes in the Gas business in Mexico. We have of course refining hydrogen all over the places. I think these are the two major contributions. My wild guess would be that we are close to 0.5 billion or something like that euro, but as I say, this is with a large degree of uncertainty. And then, you should also attach to that the Engineering sales, which are primarily related to energy issues. I mean, we are selling this huge project, or we are building the huge project for the Pearl GTL investment by Shell. And we have a number of other projects where the customer is an oil or gas company. So I think, if you take up to 50% of our sales, engineering sales, you would find a direct link in energy. The rest is petrochemical in steel and merchant. So this is my, let's say, gross quantification of the energy related business. Now the CO2 in US.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we are going on in the order of questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Go ahead. Okay. I think that, right, first of all, bear in mind that we have improved our margin, so this is part of the increase. Secondly, there is a &#x2013; I would say a &#x2013; if you take the gap in sales between 2006 and 2007, I would say, at least 20% is metal and construction inflation and the rest is volume. The rest is volume &#x2013; the rest is really plant, tonnage, which we have sold and I think this is, if you trace back the order intake of Linde engineering in 2005 and 2006, this order intake must come out sometime and this happened in 2007, with this big jump and this is volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>20% of the sales increase, the sales gap, I would account it for inflation; that we had to increase our sales price because our cost went up. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So 20% not 40% is something different than 20% on the whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, Kent, CO2 and food; US, your country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So the US business had a good year last year and we went through a significant integration there from the acquisitions. The business has gone well. You saw the numbers that we showed there for the US. And the CO2 business specifically, I mean, particularly around food and beverage, we haven't seen weakness there, so &#x2013; I mean that's a very seasonal business. So if there were issues it's really the wrong time of year for it to be showing up. But we haven't seen particular weakness there in the food and beverage of the CO2 business overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim Jones, please. Row two, to my left.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim Jones from Deutsche Bank. Two questions if I may. Firstly, by 2010 your 3 billion EBITDA target implies about 600 million of growth. Of that 600 million, how much is already contracted in the 48 new plants that you're talking about? And, my second question is in respect of cost cutting. Excluding the BOC synergies, can you just remind me where we are with the GAP program, how much we've yet to do with the group and, perhaps comment on cost cutting opportunities '09, '10, i.e. after the BOC synergy program has been completed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>After the synergy program, what's going on then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Its &#x2013; or excluding BOC synergies and after BOC synergies, what's going on in GAP? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we don't want to disclose how much we have already on board. You especially, I think, referred to onsite projects, which are already signed and which will lead to start ups in '08, '09, '10, no? And we gave you the indication that these are 48 plants right now but we think finally it will be more because some are just before signing or far down in the pipeline. So that they will fall into that &#x2013; still fall into that timeframe. So we don't want to disclose that please understand. But, I think it should be a good statement in an business environment, which is definitely slightly different than a year ago that we stick to the 3 billion. Now, when it comes to GAP or, let's say, to improvement programs beyond the synergy project, so that means beyond 2008. And I mean, as you can imagine we don't want to lose the positive momentum we created within our organization in going for the 250 million synergies. And, I think I should also use that to again state that when we talk about 250 synergies we mean bottomline. There are other companies announcing huge numbers of cost down programs but you have usually always some headwinds. And, in these days, when it comes to energy costs, not all we can pass through. Some we have to absorb when it comes to our own plans and to our own molecules we generate. So there is a lot going on.</p>
          <p>So what we still mention and I think that's a significant contrast to other announcements of cost down programs, that when we say 250, we mean bottomline. And that's in these days a little more difficult than it was a year ago because you see incredibly fast racing costs for a lot of stuff, which is also hitting us. So we still think that we are confident to see the 250 bottomline so that we can demonstrate to you, looking at Linde like a black box, you must not be interested what problems we have internally. You are only interested what do you see coming out of the box, bottomline. The other thing is our job and until now we don't complain. But, this is only a difference because we had a few times been, let's say, yeah, questioned. There are other gases companies they announce 600 or more million cost reduction and versus that, your 250 are looking quite small and we always said, what we say we mean bottomline because that's what you can prove. I can give you dream stories about what we saved but then, there had been cost increases we didn't plan for. And permanently explaining the analysts and investors, we had been great in cost reduction but unfortunately there had been this crazy steel price. We &#x2013; you all know and then you adjust for that. I think you should only be interested, do we &#x2013; this 250 we announced when we launched the deal, do this 250 really improve the ongoing profitability level, which means margins. And we told you today because in principle that's a gases game, so related to gases, we already collected now 90 basis points. You can say, roughly, 1 margin point we got and, you should see finally around 2 to 2.5. Will we be north, better than 2? I would say then we can demonstrate to you the 250 had improved our company and we keep them. And I think that's a different quality of statement.</p>
          <p>Now, why I'm mentioning that? This momentum we created has also in the new set up with two companies coming together, two different cultures merging, two different philosophies, how to manage the business. I think we had been very speedy in moving that together. Today, we, in principle, can declare the integration is done. That must now be a fine tuning process with our new operating model and so on and so forth. Clearly, that's eventually something which goes on for two to three years, but today, the integration can't fail anymore. That's what we want to bring across. On the other hand, the synergy program is a two year program '07, '08. And Georg showed you we are well on track or slightly ahead. So we are still confident we deliver that. Now, out of that, we want to keep the momentum in going forward and I just want to make one let say comment what we are doing then. I think to permanently add for your people, you also have to think about their motivation. One cost down program after the other, that's not so thrilling to them.</p>
          <p>So we thought about a broader approach and what we are &#x2013; want to do now is we want to build what we call a high performance organization. So this, we mean in a broader sense that will lead to further improvements in efficiency, effectiveness, in speed, in how we react to movements in the market, how responsive are we versus our customers. That means building a world class organization and I tell you we are in some areas, we would say well established. In some areas we have room for improvement. So what we are doing here, to be a little bit more specific, is that we are doing a rigorous internal benchmarking because, now, there came so many different businesses, with, let's say, business philosophies together. We consist today, not only out of an &#x2013; the traditional Linde business, there is AGA, there is <mark type="inaudible" />, there is now BOC. So to harmonize, standardize this, we want to go for rigorously standardized best practices and best processes. And this will give us a different approach, which also, as a positive side effect, will lead to hopefully, because we measure it then, additional savings but it is more than cost.</p>
          <p>It will make our company more competitive. And we are doing that, not only in looking at our own best practices, we are looking also beyond and, look, whatever we can learn from our competitors, what we know from them. It's a small industry, some people move from one company to the other so I think we also have a fairly good view how Air Liquide, Praxair, how others are managing their business and there is always something you can learn from your competitors, where they are better than you. And we want to go for that. And we want to have an open minded culture in our company, which is not leading to a reaction that our people say, well, we are good enough and look at our results. And I do believe, personally, that we need a culture which says that everything can be improved and this means, in a broader sense, also in administration. Why always only looking at the poor guys who have to execute manufacturing or running around with our 10,000 trucks? Yes. They can run a little bit faster but probably not because of speed limits and, we don't want to see too many being rolled over in the ditch. So and yes you can improve everything that's the philosophy. And here we go even further. We say a big chunk of our assets have nothing to do with gases. We are running, for example, a huge logistics business, as I already mentioned. We have around 10,000 trucks. Must a gases person run our global truck business? Probably, we hire somebody or we already have somebody brought in place who has been highly professionally educated person running successfully a logistics business. So what we try to do is to not only focus on our gases world; that would put the whole scope on &#x2013; with a certain &#x2013; put it on a certain ceiling and limitation. We want to go for best practices internally, best practices in the gases industry, and wherever we can learn something from Generally Electric or DHL. We are now doing a benchmarking with DHL in logistics. So I think there are so many companies out, which are in their area, better than we. But we are using also similar processes, why not learning from them?</p>
          <p>So having said this, that means that will be a project for the next four to five years, carrying us forward; hopefully, in towards the goal of becoming a high performance organization that we can in a few years say, you can never say that we are perfect. But we should strive for, and this creates a certain dynamics inside the company and a motivation for everybody, also, the secretary somewhere in an office, to think about their job, how are they doing previously or today the things? Can they be done differently? And so this is what we thought about, what could be a very thrilling motivating and also, for you then, interesting project, which is not a simple cost down project. It is a company &#x2013; a project, which will make our company a better one. Therefore, we have a huge project going on, since a few years, Six Sigma and you may know that when you talk to the former key leaders of GE when there is one single project, which I think lets GE becoming an unbelievable performing company. It is Six Sigma. So tools like this and I think that's what we have in mind and what's already started, which will carry us beyond the synergy project forward for the next several years.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can I just a very quick follow-up? Your bench mark perspective, where do you think you are underperforming in the gas business, relative to your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know there are in &#x2013; we have now so many &#x2013; we command so many plants around the world. Visiting those plants there are better ones and, not so good ones. So for instance just to take a simple example, how to operate your gas plants? And I can imagine that in a few years we have all relevant plants managed on a remote control basis, for example, to give you one idea of what we are doing. So why do I need, locally, highly competent engineers sitting there in front of a screen, boring, waiting 'til something happens and most likely, and hopefully, for the next two years, nothing happens. On the other hand, when something is happening, then you eventually need better people than you can afford locally. But when you have a remote control center you can install sensors in the plants in today's world and it is just irrelevant where the remote control center sits. We are today running big plants in South Africa out of UK remote control. So you can completely decouple. The only thing is time zones and language you have to pay attention to. So you have on your screens every little detail. You see early on a plant, is there a temperature going out of the normal range? Is there a vibration building up? You can do so many sophisticated things and this is what I mean with, going for global best practices.</p>
          <p>You see in some chemical companies, better practices than in gases companies. So we are in so many areas, let's say, well established with our competent processes but, in some areas, you can really nicely improve. And this is the attitude we want to implement and it's fascinating what you see. And clearly, I mean, I will not &#x2013; I don't have to tell you where we think we are weaker because finally also, here the end result in a black box consideration will show you whether we will be able to improve our margins, then we did something right internally in becoming better. That's the philosophy we go for and that's, by the way, why you see here leading. That was &#x2013; frankly it was my idea a few years ago. That this in a company, should we say we want to be the best gases company or whatever? I think we want to be a leading company and that is broader than only demonstrate good financial performance, which is a must, but that means more. And when you look &#x2013; this is a little bit German, I know, Kent knows that in having this leading the "-ing" is the German shortage for engineer. That also embeds the message. We want to be a leading engineering company and by the way, this translates in Linde AG, these seven letters. You can form Linde AG out of leading. This is what our people around the world, wherever I arrive, I can tell you they have this leading there and that's what we try to bring across.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Tim, your question answered?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So after that, Mr. Barth and then, Mrs. Hauser and then Dr. Schlein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Norbert Barth. Mr. Reitzle, perhaps can you go a little bit more in depth for the outlook 2008? So you make a relative general statement saying you want to increase sales and over proportionally. But, perhaps a little bit that we have a flavor perhaps in the main business areas and also in the main regions, give a little bit flavor where it runs well, where it runs perhaps not so we have a little bit more flavor on that? And, secondly, also on the dividend policy, you said, yeah, we want to make it in line with improvement in operating profit. But, if we see the dividend yield at the moment around about 2%, if you compare also little bit with other companies, it looks relatively low. So is there perhaps sometimes or also if you see now, you are reduced debt, perhaps you go a bigger step to have from the relative part a higher yield? Third question on the CapEx. I think in 2007 you have in the gases division 11.5 CapEx. So you mentioned all times this 13% ratio you want to achieve. So &#x2013; but going also in 2008 if you see the environment, so if you go to that level you have to accelerate even, is that the case, or how it will look in 2008? And perhaps the last question on Fred Butler. Can you elaborate a little bit how this business is developing, because I am &#x2013; I think--?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Who?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fred Butler, the textile cleaning--.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Freddie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because, I think, I have read something that you have increased your budgets there. And perhaps you can share us a little bit what you expect there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. 2008 will not expect a very precise outlook, especially given the environment, especially also with currency. But on the other hand I think we are &#x2013; clearly, we are going for revenue increase and for an over proportional increase in profitability. I think, please accept we leave it with this, and I don't want to give you a very precise specific number. And I think we had being doing the same over the last several years. And yeah, and it had been okay. Now dividend policy, I think we mentioned last time, first time that in principle, we want to raise dividends in line with our profitability. So more or less in the range and that's what we intend to do. Yeah. We know the yield is too and there are other companies in the ducts, which are like Deutsche Telekom around five or so. But I think there is no need for us in the moment to announce a step change in the yield. Still we have 6.4 billion debt. It's nothing to worry about anymore. Our capital structure is giving our cash flow generation very solid. So there is no priority one furthermore on debt reduction because it is more &#x2013; something, which is the natural outcome of our investment policy. And so the dividend policy I think will be, I would say, as I see it from today, for the next five years it will be different than from the four &#x2013; last five years. So we will see step-by-step improvements that's our intention. But there is no idea for a real step change in the yield. CapEx, yes we think that a good figure for this year will be 13%, so it will be up. Yes we are heavily investing and as we already mentioned there is, given our capital structure our net debt position and so on, no limitation at all for going for higher investments and being offensive there. It's only a question how many good opportunities are coming around the corner. What kind of IRR we can generate with the projects. So there is no limitation. But what we see now from what our operations globally plan for that around the 13% is a good figure. It should be up from last year. And now Fred Butler, we think this is a rather interesting innovative new system in dry cleaning, which is completely different from what's used usually around the world. It's not based anymore on that environmentally unfriendly peer. So this is now using C02. This is also not only from the environmental viewpoint, but also from handling fabrics in a very gentle and soft way, a breakthrough technology, in an industry, which is no industry. It's 10,000 of Mom and Pop shops, of family owned shops there are only a few players with 20, 30 or so 50, or 100 max different shops. Usually that's a local small business. We are the only big player now in. This is a &#x20AC;8.5 billion market globally. So this is something which is rather interesting. And we think that we are sitting on a very revolutionizing system. Yes we are still in the ramp up stage. And this will take a while. But our pilot application in Munich already is break even earlier than we though. So it's working fine. The whole thing is based, by the way, on a franchise model as you might eventually be aware &#x2013; aware of and that means sooner or later we will only have in some core areas, owned shops to never lose the direct contact with the customers. But overall it's a franchise system where we have a certain margin, an income, out of the franchise system. And we don't count our own &#x2013; the revenues generated by the end consumer. But, also coming back to our, let's say, culture aspects of that. This is a very positive thing to have start ups out of your core business, which are thrilling where young engineers, young people find a very interesting entrepreneurial like environment, which we want to use in a positive way to inspire our own organization. So therefore, it was also a few side effects going for some creative new set ups.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Mrs. Hauser please, followed by Dr. Schlein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexandra Hauser, LBBW, I have two questions if I may, the first one you mentioned the importance of renewable energies for your gasses business. Did the renewals contribute significant revenues 2007? And can you give us a figure here and a mid term target, because it's important business? The second question is concerning the gasses sales growth in Asia and East Europe. Could you give us organic growth number of both regions separately?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Mr. Aldo Belloni will answer that. The renewable yes we think that's interesting, very interesting. That's especially interesting when you think way ahead of entering a hydrogen society that only makes finally sense when you are producing the hydrogen on a renewable basis. So we are heavily involved in that, we are spending a lot of money for research. We are involved in a lot of interesting pilot projects. But I think Aldo will give you a certain view on that. And the gases sales well the &#x2013; Europe and Asia the growth rates. Clearly in Europe we have to differentiate between Continental Europe our main core mature business, and Eastern Europe where we see definitely interesting growth rates also for the next several years. And you saw the figures, and you have the figures now. We showed it to you, we think that will go on like this and Asia too. But when you &#x2013; when we talk about Asia there was this incredible growth rate of, what did we have, 34?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>34.9%</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>34% &#x2013; yes very high 34.9%. Don't take this in making your forward calculations, because this was driven by one, two special events which Georg already mentioned. But definitely it will be up. And you see Europe still 5.6% last year. And that range we expect a further growth going forward, and definitely Asia and Eastern Europe over proportional good growth. We don't see any reason now to correct that. But the renewables Aldo will give you a few more comments there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I understand your question is related to what we are realizing today in terms of sales. And, of course, we are at the beginning of this wave. What definitely we are succeeding as we speak in terms of sales realization, are two areas. The first is oxygen for biomass gasification. That means second generation biofuels. There are projects in Germany, you have probably heard about the <mark type="inaudible" /> venture, which will be started up very soon, hopefully there we have our oxygen involved in that technology. And the second area is photovoltaic. We have been exceedingly successful not only in Europe, but also in Asia in acquiring a very large number of accounts for thin film photovoltaic factories where we sell of course, spec gases and especially xylene. So these are two areas where renewable energy sources are involved. And we generate sales as we speak. Having said that, of course, we have a long pipeline of additional activities, but they will come to fruition during the second stage. The third generation biofuels with cellulose conversion and novel type of biotech processes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Mr. Schlein please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I have two quick financial questions. Could you indicate roughly the breakdown between volume and price in your comparable Gas sales growth number? And the second one is on cash restructuring cost &#x2013; what has been expensed in '07, and what are we likely to see in the current year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Georg, will answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So your first question was on volume and price for gases. So we have this &#x2013; we have that chart in the --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have that chart &#x2013; it's in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the price volume and you want to have the separation between price and volume. I can understand that. So we stick to the 7.2% and don't give any details on that level. You understand that I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the other question, how much did we spend for restructuring within the synergy program, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So here we have I think as you know we have accrued last year in our, let's say, transformational expenses around 100 million for the restructuring of that business. And from that perspective only I think we have around 50 to 60 million this year. And we do have some other one-time investments, when we look into supply optimization and related project there, which is also, of course, in cash out, but which was not accrued last year. So the G&amp;A number in a way is around 50 to 60 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So now Mr. Gilbert third row please, followed by Tim Jones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I have a question to your Cylinder business. Could you give us an idea again about volumes and prices and especially the situation in the last quarter? And also for 2008 again I understand that you don't want to disclose too much, but do you see actually the volume decline already in Western Europe, or is -what's your idea, current idea about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't see any volume decline. Our operating business, also January, February went very stable as planned, as expected. No sign that something is changing out there. So we only can report that this is going nicely, and we had a good start into this year. Volume and prices in the last quarter, what should we say, fine and according to our plans. I mean the last quarter was, in your reporting what you have here, we just have been showing you all the effects. So overall, we can't see right now anything happening with our gases sales around the world, with our especially big customers that something is going differently than expected. So will there be a knock on effect from the financial crisis into the real, so called, real economy? Eventually, but then with a certain time lag, but right now we don't see anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So next question from Tim Jones first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Tim Jones at Deutsche. Two questions if I look at regions if I may. The first is in respect of China. Could you maybe just comment on the kind of returns that are being offered for on-site contracts in China? And specifically with relation to what you can get within Russia and the Eastern Europe other say key emerging markets? And secondly South Africa, as you said earlier, is a reasonable sized business for you. And there is a lot of problems in the region with energy outages and things like that. So could you just give us an indication of how comfortably, or with how the business is performing at the moment, and whether you see any problems there currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So first Aldo, China, but don't expect him to give you the returns on on-site. It's only a slight hint, and then Kent with South Africa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I will use the second part of your first question in terms of, let's say, comparative assessment or appraisal of Eastern Europe to China. And I think that given our incumbencies in the former countries of the Iron Curtain Block, definitely we have a more profitable business in nature there. But also in China we have a very strict discipline in terms of hurdle rate for a project which we acquire there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean one thing is very simple. You can't declare all projects being, so called, strategic. A lot of your project people being motivated going for the project, want to win against the Air Liquide and I mean all the interesting projects in the clusters in China. You always need to know &#x2013; it's a huge surprise, you always meet Air Liquide air products and Praxair. So &#x2013; and everybody declares that strategic and they want to go for it. Now, I mean when you add up only so called strategic &#x2013; because strategic is usually internally in such a company an excuse for not hitting the IRR hurdle rate, then it is strategic. And you can't improve your overall margins when you are only at strategic projects. So therefore, yes we want to go for these projects but we don't want to win them at any price. So sometimes somebody is doing a crazy offer and then we say, thank you, would have been nice. But sometimes, fortunately also, we win, and usually not on price.</p>
          <p>Usually we win because of other things around in services in competencies in combination with our engineering and so on. So more and more we try to play the game a little bit differently, because we don't want to see an erosion in profitability. And it's clear; everybody wants to be now in China and in future in India. That will also quickly be declared as a strategic country. And then all the gases companies try to grab the nice future clusters. Yes. This is always something you have to make the right judgment. Is it worthwhile to go here for that, and sometimes you can go in with a more attractive offer, because you already know that something is then coming around, which eventually improves then in a few years from now your situation, or where you can link it to something where you already have an interest in the infrastructure. So very often the prerequisites for us in such a game are different for the different players. And therefore, yeah, sometimes Air Liquide is successful, sometimes Linde, sometimes Praxair. But finally, we all want to be nicely represented in long term future growth areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is a profound difference between tonnage projects in China or in Eastern Europe. And this is the merchant business, which you can attach to a tonnage project. This is seldom &#x2013; more seldom, the case in China than in Eastern Europe. In Eastern Europe you have a very attractive Cylinder business for instance. In China this is very much a commoditized business. On the other side in China it is much more likely that you would be able to build up a cluster with pipelines, which is not the case in Eastern Europe, or seldom the case in Eastern Europe. So it's very difficult to give you a generalized question. But comparatively is what I said at the beginning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just specifically on China a more direct question. Is it &#x2013; under your definition of strategic, is it fair to say that the Tianjin basin is too strategic for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The strategic. There are so many, so many basins and clusters in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now Kent about South Africa, where we perform fine. But the currency is --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; and the business is doing well there but there are issues as you pointed out about electricity. And there have been very strong growth in South Africa, and the infrastructure's struggled to keep up with that. So electricity is one of the things that's highlighting that. There is tremendous infrastructure investment projects going on which helps our business, and actually the lower currency hurts us when we translate that back to euro. But it helps the export market in South Africa which helps us in the manufacturing business. So our business is well positioned. There are issues in the country; we have to manage through that. But it's not causing us dramatic issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So next question from Mr. R&#xF6;diger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Martin R&#xF6;diger from Cheuvreux. Three questions. First to the US dollar again or to currency in general, you gave us the indication for &#x2013; saw the impact of 350 million in sales and 75 million on EBITDA, if the dollar remains at the level as it is currently. Can you give us information? And what is your exposure to the US dollar currency, to the Great Britain pound currency and to the South African rand currency? Second question is concerning your hedges in dollars. Do I understand you correctly that you have just natural hedge in your Gas business but no hedges beside that? And the third question is concerning your target for return on capital employed in the year 2010 of 13%. Does this include an assumption of an increase in your capital employed base given your CapEx plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The only thing I think I will do with the hedging. I think first of all to make it very clear we are not hedging the Gases business. That would be currency gambling because we would then have to hedge the revenue in US also. So that's what we are not doing. What we did is, we &#x2013; Georg told you that we had a 200 million positive effect on currencies within our &#x2013; we hedged some debt positions. And there we had a fortunate positive effect, but we are not hedging our ongoing gases business. Why? Because we don't have a transaction risk, which is diluting our margins like an export company. We don't have that. And there is no reason for hedging a business which is naturally hedged in producing your gas where you sell it. So we have the cost in the same currency like the sales. And that means we can be very relaxed. For us there is no need to hedge the gases business, that would be currency gambling, which we are not doing, and I don't think that one gases company is doing that. On the other hand, a different story and I think that we mentioned that because of the different characteristics of the Engineering business, when we are running for &#x2013; in a bidding process we have a certain currency calculated in, because usually these projects are paid in dollars and not in euros. So there is a certain exchange rate which is the basis of the &#x2013; for the calculation. And the moment we get the order &#x2013; in the moment, we fix and freeze this for the execution period. So for all the engineering projects there is no execution risk when it comes to currency. On the other hand, the gases business it would not be wise to hedge, that's our general philosophy. Now to our &#x2013; to the capital employed and so Georg.</p>

          <p>The only &#x2013; if you allow me one additional remark regarding the hedging, what we also did when we made the BOC acquisition that we had from our perspective an asset base in US currency, an asset base in UK currency, asset base in Australia dollar. So from that perspective we had an, let's say, net investment hedge related to these assets at a very attractive price. We stepped into this, this for example with some dollar of $1.33 from that perspective. So this is one of the currencies &#x2013; currency gains you see then in the &#x2013; in a way in an equity relation and in a net debt position when we are talking about, let's say, overall basket team our debt in different currencies. So that is the point, and no operational hedges relating to the profit and loss. So in the end we have, when we talk about the return on capital employed target, of course, a 13% target, which is based on the additional investments mainly in the Gases division. The average 13% is, of course, in growth from today's perspective. And one of you remarked already that the 11.5% CapEx sales ratio of this year was a little bit below what we anticipated. The reason for this is only in time shift in project. So on a continued basis for 2008 and 2009 there is a decent growth because of the project you have seen on the world map here and in the other areas. So I think, if I can make this statement here, we are looking in one of the busiest on-site prospect lists ever we have seen in the Gases business. So that is based here on the return on capital employed target.</p>

          <p>Juergen Reck from Sal Oppenheim. One question regarding chart number 26. When looking on the regional distribution of your operating margins, what do you expect in 2009 when you will have reached the synergy target of 250 million? How will this chart look like in this period? And which are the regions where you to expect your most positive or maybe also negative impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all the main cost savings will naturally take place in Europe and Central. A big piece as we mentioned is G&amp;A, which is a lot, is corporate. So you see then a big chunk in Europe. Yes there are synergy pieces, which have to be executed in US, in Asia. So everybody around the world has a little package on his shoulder. But overall, from the 250 where you already now saw the &#x2013; what we announced today the 75 in these figures there are already now the 75 bottomline. And the rest up to the 250 will structurally be, well, let's say, very much with an over-proportionate emphasis on Europe. But it will be distributed all over the place.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I would like to add here one comment. I think it's very difficult to predict that isolated synergy impact. And we are not prepared to, let's say, communicate that because of also the investment in the different areas. So when you see a very aggressive investment in the tonnage area, then this will have an impact from a marginal perspective compared to let's say in these areas sometimes Eastern Europe, as Aldo said, where you have a very profitable Cylinder business, very high margin Cylinder business. So an isolated mix this year, probably not wise to predict from a synergy perspective. I think what &#x2013; but we are proud of to present to you overall on a Gases level, on a corporate level the progress in synergies. I think to isolate this now down in all the regions and operating segments is a little bit too much. So I think that's fair to comment.</p>

          <p>I promise very quick, quick one for Georg. Just on the interest side the finance side, any pointers for the average coupon and the pension accrual for '08 please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So from an interest perspective I think I have given at least on the pre-tax debt interest rate the 5.8 to 6%. I think that is the point. You can do the math and will end up around 400 million. The pension top up only for the BOC scheme is in the next year around &#x20AC;90 million, but depending on currency evaluations. So I don't know. So that is an extraordinary top up...</p>

          <p>But it's much lower than it was in 2007.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In 2007 it was &#x20AC;170 million.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry my question is in relation to the 285 in the reported accounts. The accrual, not the cash top up, but the accrual in your P&amp;L.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think, no. In these markets today I think forecast is a little bit difficult. Please forgive that I don't you a number here.</p>
