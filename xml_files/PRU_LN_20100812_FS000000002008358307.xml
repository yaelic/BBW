          <p>Welcome to the Prudential Plc 2010 Half Year Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Tidjane Thiam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, everyone, I think we should get underway.</p>
          <p>Welcome to Prudential's 2010 First Half Results Presentation. I think you will have seen that today, the business has, by any measure, produced an outstanding set of results. I think that performance is a consequence of the continued delivery of our strategy, a strategy which is underpinned by a discipline of rigorous capital allocation, of strong risk management and balanced and transparent metrics. I want to give full credits to the management team of the Pru, not only for steering the company so effectively through the financial crisis, but for ensuring that we emerged as one of the clear winners and very well positioned, as you can see, to benefit from the return to more normal market conditions.</p>
          <p>That the strong results announced today have been delivered against the backdrop of a first half dominated as it was by the AIA transaction, I think demonstrates two important things. The first is that despite the real potential here for distraction caused by the transaction, we have remained very, very focused on the business and delivering the results that we reported today.</p>
          <p>Secondly, and in a way more importantly, these results evidence that Prudential is a fast-growing, well capitalized, highly profitable business with excellent growth prospects. This underlines the fact that our desire to acquire AIA was not driven by a need to find a solution to a problem within the group's businesses. Rather, it was a unique opportunity to accelerate our Asian growth. And as such, it was absolutely in line with the group strategy, and as a Board, we believe that the acquisition would have generated significant incremental, long-term and sustainable shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Now in the event, as we all know, we were not in a position to conclude the deal, and as we made it clear at the time, we not only regret the passing of the opportunity, but the costs incurred in the process. We've worked hard to minimize these, and you'll see some of that detail in today's disclosures.</p>
          <p>Now since AIG rejected our revised offer, I, along with a number of other Board members, have met with many of our shareholders to discuss the deal, to discuss the current state of the business and to hear their views directly. These discussions have been thorough, they've been open, they have been frank, they have been constructive and have, of course, been set in the context of the business at large.</p>
          <p>I can say on behalf of every member of the Prudential Board that we are here to serve our shareholders and of course, we recognize that we are fully accountable to them. Our core purpose remains to deliver long-term sustainable shareholder value and to outperform our competitors. And I hope you can see from this morning's results and from the presentation that follows, that this is precisely what we have done and it's what we have every intention of doing as we go forward.</p>
          <p>So, it's now my pleasure to hand over to Tidjane and to Nic to take us through the detail of today's results. Tidjane?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Harvey, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Today I will take you through the highlights of our results for the first half of 2010 and put it into context of our strategy and operating principles. Nic will cover H1 2010 performance in some more detail and I will come back at the end to talk about our outlook for the rest of the year. And as always, we will then take your questions. The Executive team and a number of key people from our operations around the world in Asia and the U.S. are here this morning and we look forward to a dialogue.</p>
          <p>So let me begin with some context for these results. As you know, over the past couple of years, we have been focused on rigorously managing the business for clear and consistent operating principles.</p>
          <p>Our priorities have been to accelerate our growth in Asia, to emphasize growth and sustainable cash generation in the U.S., to focus on strong cash generation ahead of growth in the U.K. And in our management &#x2013; asset management business, the priority has been to generate strong investment performance to underpin our ability to increase assets under management.</p>
          <p>The events over past few months have not diverted us from this strategic and operational focus. As a result of our actions over the last two years, I am pleased to report a very strong set of results across all our businesses. In fact, they are best ever on all measures and across all businesses.</p>
          <p>I am conscious that the main focus of interest for the past few months has been the AIA transaction and following Harvey's comments, I too would like to say a few words. It was an opportunity to accelerate our strategy of focusing on high growth markets and I share Harvey's and the team's disappointment that we could not complete the deal. I recognize the costs of terminating the transaction and I recognize that they are of concern to shareholders. These costs have been reduced from our original estimate of 450 million to 477 pre-tax and 284 million post-tax.</p>
          <p>As a team, we remained energized by the challenge of leading this company, which continues, as today's numbers show, to have great profitable growth potential. So let us now move on to our first half of the year numbers, which as I stated earlier, are the best ever on all measures and across all businesses.</p>
          <p>Starting with new business, life new business APE was up 28% and new business profit increased by 27% to 892 million. The average margin across the group was maintained at 54%, and that's important because it repeats the performance of H1 '09, which marked a step change from our kind of 38, 39 historic to 54. So we've been able to maintain this.</p>
          <p>With this strong new business growth, net inflows in the life business, which are a key driver for IFRS profits, doubled to 4.4 billion. And asset management net inflows over the period were also 4.4 billion. That's a coincidence but those are the numbers.</p>
          <p>Moving to operating earnings. Underlying IFRS operating profit, excluding the 123 million one-off hedge accounting gain in the U.S., is up 19% at 845. As a progression for the statutory earnings, 19%, considering what we've done on EV and cash, is a very satisfactory number and an increasingly important metric for the group. And Nic will cover in more detail later the make-up of 123, and why we feel it should be excluded from the analysis of the underlying.</p>
          <p>And finally looking at the balance sheet, shareholders' funds on an EEV basis increased by 9% to 16.7 billion or 6.57 per share. And as an indicator of our cash and capital generation, which you know we've been using now for two, three years &#x2013; free surplus. Across the life and asset management operations, free surplus increased to 3.2 billion, up from 2.5 at the end of '09 and from 0.9 at the end of '08. So an increase of over 2 billion in 2.5 years.</p>
          <p>Returns on capital are high. The IFRS return on equity is 20% annualized. So in line with our progressive dividend policy and considering these results, the Board has decided to increase the interim dividend by 5%. This reflects our confidence in the business and our intention to make sure the dividend grows at a sustainable pace.</p>
          <p>But these results are just a snapshot of our performance. To take their full meaning, they must be looked at over a longer period, which is what I would like to do now, looking at five years of performance.</p>
          <p>Over five years, we have achieved double-digit growth across all key measures of embedded value, IFRS, and cash. We have grown new business profit, NBP, at 17% per annum compound, with a significant pick-up since 2008 to over 25% compound.</p>
          <p>IFRS profits have grown at 15% compound with a significant acceleration since 2008, particularly in Asia, and we'll come back to that in Nic's presentation. Underlying free surplus from the back-book, net of new business trend, has grown at 40% per annum, and each element of our portfolio has contributed to this progression.</p>
          <p>Asia and the U.S. have generated strong, profitable growth. The U.K. has produced good cash generation, and our asset management businesses in the U.K. and in Asia have contributed also strong, profitable growth.</p>
          <p>So delivering across all these measures over a sustained period is, we believe, a real testament to our strategy and an indication of the value we have created. Another way to look at this is to assess total shareholder return, which we're doing on this slide. Over 10 years, from 2000 onwards, the total shareholder return we have generated has been above that of our European peers. Even if I can't really say that as of the beginning of this year, but over 10 years, it is a fact.</p>
          <p>From June 2000 to July 2010, our total shareholder return was 37%, ahead of the average for our peer group, and it's defined on the slide the Australians and the New Yorkers. And as you can see, most of our performance has come since 2008. So, why? If we try to get the reasons for this.</p>
          <p>Again, our project priority have been clear, so accelerate growth in Asia, building our strengths in the U.S., participate selectively in the U.K. where we clearly balance new business writing with cash and capital, and optimizing our asset management performance. These have remained broadly consistent since 2006. However, since 2008, we insisted and defined some operating principles, which we have been implementing, I believe, with rigor.</p>
          <p>First, we decided to take a more balanced approach to performance management across EV, IFRS, and cash, with an increased emphasis on IFRS and cash, and that happened for us in 2008. Second, we are focused rigorously on allocating capital to the highest return opportunities. And third, we took a much more proactive approach to managing risk and capital across the cycle.</p>
          <p>So let's look at each of these three in turn, starting with the metrics. Our group historically &#x2013; and it wasn't alone in that &#x2013; I think it's fair to say most of the sector &#x2013; was too focused, I believe, on embedded value at the expense of other measures, leading sometimes to growth without real value creation. From 2008 onwards, we were explicit with you that we would manage with a much better balance across EV, IFRS, and cash to ensure value creation over the long-term. And we maintained this stance because &#x2013; although we say there was a noble emphasis on EV &#x2013; we are not saying EV is worthless. That's not at all what we are saying. We think it's important to optimize a few of them.</p>
          <p>Since 2008, we have also realigned our management incentive structures &#x2013; and we haven't talked a lot about that publicly, but we have &#x2013; to reflect this new focus on IFRS and cash, and the specific role we assign to each of our businesses. And this has had an impact on our performance, as we'll see later.</p>
          <p>We have also increased and improved our transparency and disclosure, devoting considerable efforts over the last two years to improving our IFRS and cash disclosures. And I hope you see that instead of moving to MCV. And I expect this emphasis on IFRS and cash to continue.</p>
          <p>Moving on to capital allocation, life insurance companies have in-force books which generate large amounts of cash. The challenge that we all face is to make sure we allocate capital in a disciplined way and in line with our strategy. Central to this is a company's understanding and management of its new business strain. We have been explicitly focused on this since 2008 and have updated the market regularly on the evolution of this important KPI. Our focus on capital efficiency has had a significant impact on the way we run our business and on our results.</p>
          <p>In H1 2010, as we show here, we generated sales that were 40% higher than in 2006. During that same period, we grew our new business profits by 90%, with an absolute new business trend actually lower than H1 2006. So we almost doubled new business profits whilst reducing the new business trend.</p>
          <p>The number of actions taken right across the group allowed us to achieve this step change. So looking at each of our major businesses in turn, starting with Asia. Asia, as you know, is our preferred destination for capital, which does not mean, however, that our discipline there is any less strict. As a result, we have closed Japan to new business early this year, and you will see in our numbers that we have significantly reduced volumes in Korea.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we have restricted gigs and capital intensive fixed annuities and focused on more capital efficient VAs. And in the U.K., we have become increasingly selective in our participation, applying a high hurdle rates to writing bulk annuities, closing our lifetime mortgage business, managing individual annuities for value, and refocusing our corporate pensions business.</p>
          <p>Another way to assess this evolution is to look at how much post-tax new business profit we have generated for each pound invested in new business across the group over time. Here again, you can see a strong progression since 2005, with a clear inflection from 2008, where this ratio increased from 1.2 to 1.9, an increase of more than 50% in two years. Overall, this ratio has more than doubled over five years.</p>
          <p>So let's look more closely at the last three years. During that period, we increased NVP by 59% whilst consuming 1% less capital. Our focus on capital efficiency has had consequences for our geographic allocation of capital as well as on our product allocation.</p>
          <p>If you look at 2008, you can see here that we were investing as much in the U.K. as we were in Asia in absolute terms. In 2010, we invested almost four times more capital in Asia than in the U.K. Clearly, Asia remains our preferred long-term destination for new business capital and its share will only continue to grow in the future.</p>
          <p>During the last two years, we have invested high levels of capital in the U.S. in light of the exceptional returns available to us there at this point in the cycle. But we will not hesitate to lose market share, should conditions there change.</p>
          <p>In term of products, we focused overall the business more explicitly on retail and the de-emphasized wholesale businesses. We are now essentially a retail shop, which is where the risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders are the highest.</p>
          <p>So as you can see, our report to capital allocation has changed significantly and the same can be said about risk and capital management. As you know, we've been proactive in managing our capital position throughout this crisis. We are in a strong absolute and relative position, with a cover of 270% and we are able to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we see across the board, such as UOB in January, which we signed.</p>
          <p>Since the end of 2008, the IGD surplus has increased from 1.5 to 3.4 billion, despite over the period, credit losses of 1.4 billion and after putting aside an additional 1 billion to take credit reserves in the U.K. to 1.7 billion. So, overall, a net increase of almost 2 billion whilst absorbing in excess of 2.4 billion of negative improvements.</p>
          <p>Our prudent approach also applies to the dividend, which we have been able to grow throughout the crisis and not cut. We continued to monitor our key risks and to take action when necessary. For instance, during the first half of this year and we'll talk about it later in more detail, we have taken advantage of the more normalized credit market conditions to further de-risk in the U.S., cutting our exposures to RMBS, to high-yield corporates, to European banks, and increasing our holdings of U.S. treasuries.</p>
          <p>We have also undertaken some de-risking in the U.K. credit portfolio, and we believe that strengthens our position, given the macroeconomic uncertainties we are facing. So I have covered each of our operating principles, use of balanced metrics, disciplined capital allocation, proactive risk management, and I will now move on to make a few comments about each of the businesses in turn.</p>
          <p>Starting with Asia, where as you know, we've built a strong business over a long period. We have a broad presence across the region, a large agency force, and a trusted brand. As a result, APE, NBP, and EEV grew strongly, but the IFRS profile always raised questions about the overall value creation of our Asian businesses.</p>
          <p>Over the past couple of years, Barry and his team have made significant changes in the business, sowing the seeds for future value-creating growth. We have put greater emphasis on the high growth, high return markets of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. It's what we call Southeast Asia plus Hong Kong, seven key markets.</p>
          <p>We have continued to grow the agency force, as well as improve its productivity. We have also increased our bancassurance distribution, renewing and extending our agreement with Standard Chartered and signing an agreement with UOB covering Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia, which have contributed very well to the numbers you've seen this morning. Bancassurance will be increasingly important, as Asian customers become wealthier and therefore, it is a key area of focus for us. I am sure you've seen that our bancassurance sales have grown by 42% in the first half.</p>
          <p>On product, we have moved the mix towards health and protection, supporting overall margins and improving, of course, IFRS earnings and cash. So as you can see here, the business has enjoyed extraordinary growth, being ten times larger in terms of APE than a decade ago. But the changes we've made during the last two years have also had a big impact on IFRS profits. As you can see here, they are now 3.5 times what they were in 2008.</p>
          <p>We've cut a number of places where we were taking negatives, such as India, Korea and Japan. And we have &#x2013; with the growth of the in-force book, generated increasing flows of IFRS profits and that's really transformational. And these earnings are finally becoming commensurate with the scale of our Asian business.</p>
          <p>So, if we go a bit further down in Asia, our focus on the seven countries I've mentioned and Hong Kong has continued to pay off and that's a blue bar here. These markets in blue have achieved 46% growth in aggregate at average margins of 72%, which we believe validates our strategy. And by the way, I believe that there is lot of implicit exposure to China in these markets and in this group. It's a question we often get and that's a fact.</p>
          <p>There are also good performances in Taiwan as we develop our bancassurance relationships there and in India and China. A very important dimension of the Asian insurance landscape, of course, is distribution. In aggregate, both the agency and bancassurance channels continue to make very good progress.</p>
          <p>Average active agents number, that's a fundamental statistic for us across the region, excluding India, grew by 15% compared to H1 '09. So that's as much added to your effective capability to distribute active agent sales or 15% more.</p>
          <p>And the average APE per active agent has increased 28% in the same period. And finally, bancassurance, as I said probably too early, continues to grow very fast with 42% growth of APE, all very encouraging. So simply Asia offers the highest growth and the highest return opportunities in the insurance sector and will do so for a generation or more.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the U.S., Clark and the team there have remained focused on long-term value creation, putting value ahead of volume, maintaining pricing and hedging discipline and delivering excellent service with a low cost platform.</p>
          <p>Over last ten years, we have enjoyed strong growth in VA sales. But as you can see on the bottom left chart, here &#x2013; between H1 '07 and H1 '08, VA sales actually fell by 20%, and that was deliberate. We were willing to accept lower market share in the phase of uneconomic pricing behavior which prevailed in the market at that time. We do not run our businesses for volume or our market share, but for profit.</p>
          <p>We all know that a number of players paid a high price for their actions during that period and we are simply benefiting today from that market dislocation. Clearly, distributors are rewarding VA producers who have maintained a consistent availability of the product and their service throughout the cycle.</p>
          <p>We have always had stringent return criteria when it comes to adding distribution. We have not changed that, but we are adding more reps, more representatives and increasing our penetration. We have had a successful launch, as you know, with Merrill Lynch and we have been building our distribution with Wells Fargo and American Funds.</p>
          <p>What is going on now is exactly what we expected to happen at this point in the cycle. We are simply opportunistically capturing as much of this volume as we can at good margins. The high net flows we have seen over the last 18 months are already resulting in an increase in IFRS profits. However, we will not hesitate to back away if uneconomic behavior returns to the market.</p>
          <p>There has been speculation about the true drivers of our growth in the VA segment in the U.S. So what I've done here is that we show you the consistency of Jackson's pricing for GMWBs in rate, compared to the average of the top 15 competitors across the cycle and it's interesting to see how much the average moves.</p>
          <p>We need some clearer evidence, but the increase, some would say, the surge in our volumes is not a result of changes in our approach to pricing, but rather the result of changes in the behavior of our competitors and of our distributors. We have remained constant. Our variable is not price, it's volume. We will lose market share when the pricing is uneconomic and we will gain market share when people pay the price for having priced uneconomically. It's a very simple story and that's how the cycle unfolds in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So let us now look at the U.K. We have seen very strong sales and IFRS profits growth in Asia and in the U.S. Our approach in the U.K. frankly is different. The U.K. is a relatively mature market with lower growth and lower returns on capital. Therefore, we have been selective in our participation, focusing on a few profitable products. We are also in the unique position that we don't need to chase volume and we are less dependent on third-party distribution than our peers.</p>
          <p>57% of annuity new business and 39% of corporate pension new business in the first half of 2010 came from internal customers. So recognizing the role of the U.K. within the group, we have aligned the incentives for the U.K. management team with our strategic objectives in this market, for generation of stable cash flows and IFRS profits and continued capital strength. Rob and the team continue to deliver against these objectives, and this is sustained by a continuous drive for increased productivity.</p>
          <p>We have already achieved the original &#x2013; well, we are confident that we will achieve the original 195 million expense-saving target set out in 2007 in 2010, a few months early. And we will continue to increase our productivity. So, I want to be clear, let me say this again. We have achieved the original &#xA3;195 million expense saving from 2007 six months early, let me be clear and we will continue to increase our productivity beyond that.</p>
          <p>All these actions together have led us to produce margins and IRRs that are strong in the context of the U.K. market. Equally important, the cash transfer to the group has increased as the shareholder business has gained scale, and through our greater discipline in writing new business, a swing of over 200 million in four years. We're positive 61 million now. So in total, including the REIT profit transfer, the U.K. business is a major contributor to the group's cash generation, capital strength and ratings.</p>
          <p>Moving finally to asset management, M&amp;G has had another strong half year. These are almost &#x2013; they look Asian curve, but they are M&amp;G. When Michael showed me, I said, this looks like Asia. But this is a continuation of a long track record of success over the last decade for Michael and for the M&amp;G team. What this slide shows you is the average monthly gross in blue and net in red retail sales, which have been positive in all periods, with a real step up here again in the last 18 months.</p>
          <p>M&amp;G has been the U.K.'s leading retail fund manager, as measured by net flows, in each of the last six quarters. A key driver of this, of course, is sustained investment returns and the long-term performance of our flagship equity bond and property funds, and the number of emerging funds has been strong.</p>
          <p>Delivering strong performance across all asset classes &#x2013; and that's what we're showing you here, equity in red, fixed income in dark blue, property in light blue &#x2013; is crucial to the M&amp;G model, because it enables us to track flows at all points in the economic cycle, as demand, especially retail demand, naturally moves from one asset class to another.</p>
          <p>And finally, asset management in Asia, where I think there is significant untapped potential and upside for Prudential. In Asia, we have a solid base, with &#xA3;46 billion under management across the life and third-party business, and with broad market coverage. It is a very attractive market, where rising affluence will drive continued growth. It is a high margin, high return business, and as you know, with low capital requirements.</p>
          <p>So we will continue to focus on the retail market, which we have found very attractive. However, in addition, we believe that we can increase our penetration of the fast-growing high net worth segment, which now accounts for around a third of retail funds in the region. There is also potential in the institutional market where we have already a presence. This is one of the most attractive growth opportunities for the group.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the year, I have appointed Graham Mason as head of our funds business in Asia. He has moved across from M&amp;G to lead that business and has been making good progress, with profits increasing by 71% in the first half to &#xA3;46 million, from about 20 last year.</p>
          <p>So before I hand over to Nic, I would like to make a few points. Our strategy is sound, and we have implemented our operating principles with discipline and good results.</p>
          <p>Prudential is a high performing business with IRRs, payback periods and returns on capital that compare favorably to any life insurer globally. We provide excellent exposure to some of the strongest growth markets in the world. We balance this profitable growth with proactive and sound financial management and are realizing the profit promised from the the back-book. We generate a growing and sustainable dividend, and we have grown strongly on all measures over a five-year period, and the momentum is very good.</p>
          <p>So with this, I will hand over to Nic.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Tidjane.</p>
          <p>Now that I've done my usual party piece, when I follow Tidjane, let me say good morning to all of you here this morning. In our sector, sustainable value is created by simultaneously growing new business profits, IFRS earnings, cash and capital. This is exactly what we have done, and as you can see on this slide, we are reporting strong improvements in all of these metrics with all of our businesses reporting higher profits.</p>
          <p>In the first half, our EEV operating profit was up 35% to 1.68 billion, underpinned by 27% growth in new business profit to 892 million, as we continued to build on the powerful momentum we created in 2009. Our headline IFRS operating profit of 968 million includes the benefit of a net equity hedge accounting gain on our VA book of 123 million, which will reverse at the time. I will cover this in more detail later, but it is appropriate to disregard this gain in assessing our underlying IFRS performance, which was up 19% to 845 million.</p>
          <p>Our focus on cash generation from our growing back book, coupled with our disciplined approach to new business strain has delivered an impressive 63% increase in operating free surplus from our life and asset management businesses to 947 million. This more than covers our central interest and dividend outgoings and enhances our capital flexibility going forward.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to focus on the increase in new business value that our franchises have delivered in the first half of 2010. As you can see, our group wide new business profits have grown by 27%, which in absolute terms, is nearly 200 million higher to 892 million. We have maintained our overall margin at 54%, and we're pleased to have achieved a strong 2010 revenues growth without giving up any of the margin gains from 2009.</p>
          <p>We balanced carefully capital consumption and value optimization and we have remained disciplined operationally in our emphasis on geographies and products with the highest IRRs and shortest payback periods.</p>
          <p>As Tidjane has already covered, this has enabled us to achieve the reported uplift in new business profitability, whilst continuing &#x2013; whilst consuming a broadly unchanged amount of capital compared to last year.</p>
          <p>In Asia, new business profits rose by 38% to 396 million, and margins improved to 56%. Health and protection products remained the key source of value, accounting for over half of Asian new business profits, and continue to grow strongly. The one percentage point increase in margin is due to a shift in country mix towards the more profitable countries of Southeast Asia, including Hong Kong. We have included in your packs our normal disclosures on country-specific margins. Movements between periods at a country level are principally due to changes in product mix.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., average margins have declined to 64%, due to the impact of the narrower spread environment on our fixed and fixed-index annuities. Nevertheless, we have grown new business profit by 24% due to the success of our VA strategy, where margins have been maintained.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., our value-based focus on annuities and new profits, and our withdrawal from equity release resulted in an 11% growth in new business profit and a three-point improvement in margins to 35%. What is even more impressive is that the higher profitability was achieved despite the significant reductions in invested capital, a vindication of our U.K. strategy and the execution skills of Rob and the team.</p>
          <p>The internal rates of return and payback periods in all of our markets, which are summarized on the right hand side of the slide, remain, in my view, the best in the sector.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a closer look at the U.S., where there has been the most movement in the year-on-year margin. We held our variable annuity margin at 71% as the impacts of lower spreads on the guaranteed funds was offset by an increase in the proportion of customers electing guaranteed benefit.</p>
          <p>As you can see, VA margins are now 22 percentage points higher than the same period in 2008. The step up in profitability is due to the following three factors, each contributing roughly a third of the increase. One, the greater proportion of customers seeking downside protection at the point of sale by electing more optional VA benefits. To give you an example, the take-up rate of &#x2013; for guaranteed withdrawal benefits in 2010 was 88% compared to 68% in 2008.</p>
          <p>Two, repricing activity in the form of selective reduction, in the level of guaranteed benefits, offered by Jackson. And three, the more favorable policyholder behavior on the utilization of these guaranteed benefits.</p>
          <p>Looking at fixed and fixed-index annuities, margins for these products have declined as a result of the significant contraction in credit spreads that we have seen over the course of the last year or so. The combination of higher capital usage and lower margins has seen us de-emphasize these products in favor of VAs.</p>
          <p>Turning to EEV operating profit, this has increased by 35% to 1.68 billion, equivalent to an annualized ROEV of 16%, up from 12% at this time last year.</p>
          <p>Our life businesses delivered an excellent performance. Earnings were higher by 34%, to 1.75 billion, with strong performance from both new business, which I have already covered, and in-force business, up from 612 million to 858 million, an increase of 40%.</p>
          <p>It was encouraging to see the resilience of our in-force book demonstrated once again, as experienced variances in assumption changes contributed a small profit within the period. Within this, all of our major businesses reported year-on-year improvements in operating performance. Asia in particular grew by an impressive 60% to 633 million, and now accounts for well over a third of the total.</p>
          <p>Profits from asset management and other businesses were up 43% to 217 million. This reflects the significantly higher fund values as market levels rose, but also clearly benefited from the continuation of exceptionally strong net inflows over the previous 18 months, particularly in M&amp;G retail, and the increased sales of the more profitable equity products.</p>
          <p>Turning to other items, net charges have increased to 289 million due to higher net interest costs of 124 million, reflecting the additional debt raised in May and July last year, to manage our IGD position during the crisis. And costs relating to our Solvency II implementation project amounting to 22 million. You can expect to see a similar level of Solvency II spend in the second half of 2010, higher still in 2011, tailing off in 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving on to take a closer look at the in-force profits from each of our life operations and starting with Asia, you can see the increase in the unwind and expected returns from 248 million to 300 million, reflecting the growing maturity of our back book, and lower overall experience losses and assumption changes of 45 million and 14 million, respectively.</p>
          <p>Our focus on customer retention has seen persistency improve. However, it remains negative at 49 million as we continue to incur experience losses in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Korea, ranging individually from 6 million to 12 million. Given the increase in scale of Asia's embedded value at 6.7 billion, these overall experience and assumption changes remain relatively small.</p>
          <p>The improvement in the U.S. in-force profit to 306 million reflects a greater unwind due to the application of higher risk discounts and earn rates in the U.S and includes higher positive experience variances and assumption changes.</p>
          <p>The improvement here is attributed to higher spread profit, which has increased from 38 million to 108 million as the result of actions taken by Jackson to lessen its tactically short asset duration position in the general account. Finally, the higher return in the U.K. is due to refinements in assumptions related to shareholder-backed annuity business.</p>
          <p>I summarize on this next slide the movement in EEV shareholder's funds in the period, which at 30 June, stood at 16.7 billion. This is equivalent to &#xA3;6.57 per share. It is 9% higher than their position at the start of the year and 22% higher than June 2009.</p>
          <p>Going from left to right and picking out key movements, you can see the 1.68 billion of operating profit, a negative short-term investment variance of 2 to 7 million, reflecting the market weakness in the first half of the year, and negative 377 million representing the finalized costs of the AIA transaction.</p>
          <p>This is lower than the 450 million estimate we announced on June 2 and reflects the actual exit cost of the currency hedge, which was lower than we had anticipated, and the final settled amounts relating to bank underwriting fees and other advisor costs. After tax deductions, the final cost to shareholders is 284 million.</p>
          <p>Further along the waterfall, you see the 318 million cash payment of the 2009 final dividend, which had a lower level of scrip take up compared to prior years, and the positive impact of the 8% appreciation of the U.S. dollar, which generated a 798 million foreign exchange gain.</p>
          <p>Before I move on to other metrics, I would like to provide you with a high level geographical analysis of our 30 June, 2010 embedded value. Asia's embedded value of 6.7 billion is the largest contributor to the group and accounts for approximately 40% of shareholders' funds on this basis. The Asian share of embedded value has grown significantly over the last five years, from 1.6 billion to 6.7 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate of 33%. And the 17% annualized ROEV that Asia has delivered in the first six months of 2010 shows that this trend is ongoing and will be the key driver of the group's embedded value growth over the coming years.</p>
          <p>Turning now to IFRS results, we delivered an improved underlying operating performance of 845 million, up 19% on 2009. Our headline figure of 968 million includes the benefit of the net equity hedge gain on our VA business, which I'll explain on this next slide.</p>
          <p>This gain arises due to the differences in accounting between the derivatives held to manage equity risk, which are fair valued, and the associated VA guarantee liabilities, a substantial element of which are not fair valued. It is not our practice to hedge VA guarantees on an accounting basis.</p>
          <p>As Clark explained this time last year, we hedge all VA embedded guarantees together with related fees on an economic basis through a combination of options and futures, after taking into account the natural offset in the book. We regard this as the most appropriate way to manage these risks, which delivers a technical profit over time, and we accept the inevitable accounting volatility that ensues.</p>
          <p>This accounting gain or loss is more pronounced in periods of high equity market volatility, and over the last 18 months, has become more significant due to the large take-up rate of GMDBs and GMWBs four life options, the reserving for which is insensitive to market movements.</p>
          <p>The combination of these two factors has produced a larger than normal IFRS movement of 123 million in the six-month period. I'm happy to take questions on this later, but the key point to note is that this is purely an accounting gain, as opposed to an economic profit, and it will over time unwind through the profit and loss account, with a net cumulative effect being broadly neutral.</p>
          <p>This is illustrated in the table on the slide, which shows that the accumulated impact on operating profits going back 30 months is a 35 million net profit. Given the increase in materiality of this effect, we will be revisiting our accounting treatment in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>So going back to look at the make-up of our IFRS results, excluding this item, the overall performance is underlined by strong profits from our life businesses, which are up 19% to 893 million.</p>
          <p>This healthy increase in profits is more pronounced in our Asian and U.S. businesses, which I will cover in more detail on the next slide. I have already commented on the performance on asset management, and on other expenses. Clearly, both of these also flow through the overall result on this basis.</p>
          <p>So on this next slide, I break out the contribution of each business to the life results from 2008 to 2010. Taken over the last two years, all three regions have reported improved profitability, Asia being the most notable, which now contributes more than a quarter of the total. Asian profits in the first half of 2010 are higher by 25% at 259 million.</p>
          <p>The improvement continues to be driven by the fast growing in-force book, which continues to benefit from strong positive net flows, lower absolute levels of new business strain, despite the sales growth, a richer mix of health and protection business and the actions taken to turn the younger businesses into positive contributors to IFRS profits.</p>
          <p>Turning to the U.S., excluding the effect of the net equity hedge gain, IFRS operating profit is higher by 36% to 327 million. Fee income has increased as the improved equity markets in the latter part of 2009 and early part of 2010 coupled with strong inflows into Vas, have led to a 69% increase in average separate account balances. The U.S. result also benefits from higher spread profits, which arise from the duration &#x2013; from the asset duration lengthening I described earlier and from selective crediting rate reductions implemented this year. The U.K. reported IFRS profit of 307 million is inline with last year, with contributions from both with-profits and shareholder business broadly unchanged.</p>
          <p>Core to the increase in life profit in Asia and the U.S. is the continued growth in the policyholder liability reserves. This next slide shows the roll forward of liability reserves for shareholder-backed business in the first six months of 2010. As you can see, net inflows, which represent premiums received less claims paid, were positive in all of our life operations and amounted to 4.4 billion, double those in the first half of 2009. Asia's continued strong net inflows reflect the heavy bias towards regular premium, new business and high customer retention. This is an important feature of the Asia market and provides a strong underpin to earnings growth.</p>
          <p>Jackson continues to experience minimal outflows on annuities and in the first quarter of 2010, ranked first in the U.S. sector for variable annuity net inflows. This is a result of strong cycle management by Clark and the team and the reserve growth that has resulted has driven our earnings higher in the first half.</p>
          <p>The other feature of our 2010 Life IFRS results is the more balanced mix in the sources of income. This is illustrated on this next slide, which depicts both the absolute growth and the contribution of the various IFRS sources of income to the total. The key point to highlight is the increasing proportion of insurance income shown by the red bars, demonstrating the success of our health and protection rider strategy in Asia. This has improved both the quality and the resilience of our earnings.</p>
          <p>The analysis also demonstrates the versatility of our other sources. Income from these sources will ultimately be determined by consumer demand, which is naturally linked to market conditions. You can see that in the first half of 2009, when equity markets were depressed and fixed income yields were high, we successfully increased our spread income. When the market situation reversed in 2010, we're equally successful in capturing higher fee income on unit-linked funds and separate account balances.</p>
          <p>Turning to the movement in IFRS shareholders funds, at 30 June, 2010, we stood at 7.2 billion, 14% higher than the position at the beginning of the year and 52% higher than June 2009. Again, going from left to right on the chart, you see the 968 million operating profit, the 377 million AIA transaction costs, which I've already commented on, a 419 million positive value movement on Jackson's fixed income securities portfolio, and again, the impact of dividends paid and foreign exchange translation gain on the IFRS balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Moving on to capital and in particular, the evolution of free surplus, you can see how our level of capital has increased in 2010. In the first six months of the year, the free surplus held by the Group's life and asset management operations increased by 28% to 3.2 billion.</p>
          <p>On the left hand side, you can see the free surplus generated by our back-book of almost 1.3 billion, which was higher than the equivalent figure in 2009 and reflects both the growing maturity of our business and the disciplined management of our in-force book, which Tidjane has already covered. The surplus released by the in force covers the investment in new business of 339 million shown in the dark blue bar by 3.8 times.</p>
          <p>During the first half, a total of 460 million was remitted to group by these businesses. Our approach here is to remit sufficient amounts to allow the center to meet its operational obligations, with the balance held within each business, where it can be deployed more profitably.</p>
          <p>This is an important distinction, and it is for this reason that when we look at our ability to cover our central outgoings, including the dividend, we use operational free surplus generated by these businesses rather than actual cash remittances, and this is illustrated on the next slide, where I have combined the operational flows from the previous slide with the central cash costs and the external dividend.</p>
          <p>Our disciplined approach to capital conservation and cash generation has seen free surplus, after investment in new business, rise by 63% from 581 million in the first half of 2009 to 947 million in 2010.</p>
          <p>After making the deductions for central cash costs and dividends, we have generated an underlying free surplus at an operational level in excess of 0.5 billion, illustrated by the gray box on the right hand side, or the first gray box. This remains positive after deducting the AIA costs paid in the first six months of 261 million, and comfortably covers the remaining unpaid element.</p>
          <p>For completeness, I show on this next slide the actual operating holding company cash flows during 2010. In overview and inline with our practice of only remittent-sufficient cash to cover central operating costs, the position is broadly neutral. Net remittances from businesses, shown in the dark blue bars, amounted to 460 million in 2010, and were 85 million higher than last year's 375 million figure.</p>
          <p>This reflects an increased in net remittances from Asia and from our asset management businesses, and includes a positive net contribution of 61 million from the U.K. shareholder business. Dividend paids were higher at 318 million due to the lower scrip take-out.</p>
          <p>Alongside the strong performance in the first half of the year, we have also delivered an improvement in the quality of our balance sheet. Throughout the period, we have maintained a robust capital position and at the end of June, our IGD capital surplus stood at 3.4 billion, equivalent to a coverage ratio of 270%. Our liquidity position at the center remains strong, with over 1 billion of central cash resources and untapped facilities of 2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>We continued to de-risk the balance sheet during the period. We reduced our overall holdings of bank hybrid debt, more specifically, Jackson, reduced their exposure in EU and U.S. regional banks by $850 million and the U.K. shareholder business sold nearly 400 million sterling of financial debt.</p>
          <p>We also improved the quality of Jackson's corporate credit book by targeting a range of securities, including sub-investment grade corporate bonds and non-agency RMBS. The program size was $1 billion and as a result, only 5% of Jackson's securities are now below investment grade, compared to 9% a year ago. Jackson has reinvested these proceeds and has directed a proportion of new inflows into government securities and at 30 June, held approximately $4 billion of U.S. treasury bills.</p>
          <p>Our credit position has also improved. The 1.8 billion of unrealized losses that we had on our U.S. debt securities from 12 months ago has now gone full circle, and is now sitting as a 1.2 billion unrealized gain.</p>
          <p>Impairment levels have slowed dramatically in the last six months, now running at 2007 levels at approximately $50 million per quarter. And we have suffered no defaults in the U.K. We have maintained our practice of rolling up any unused default provisions into our reserves, which at 30 June, stood at 1.7 billion for our shareholder-backed annuity business.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we have delivered broad based profitability improvements across all parts of our business and on all metrics. We have continued our strong focus on value and capital, significantly increasing our new business profits, while consuming broadly the same amount of capital. The good work that has been done over the last few years in this area is now emerging in our EEV and IFRS results, and is improving the balance and the quality of our earnings.</p>
          <p>Our free surplus generation has accelerated in the period and this has enabled us to maintain a robust capital position throughout the first half. I hope you will agree that these results demonstrate that management has safely led the company through the financial crisis and the associated downturn in the markets and is now capitalizing on the opportunities that are emerging.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. I would now like to hand you back to Tidjane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you, Nic.</p>
          <p>In summary, the group has delivered a strong first half 2010. All of our businesses, Asia, the U.S., U.K., M&amp;G, asset management, Asia are performing well and I expect that to continue.</p>
          <p>Our strategy, as I said, is sound and we will continue to pursue it with the operating discipline that has delivered excellent results on all measures over a sustained period. We have significant opportunities for profitable growth and we have the financial strength to take advantage of those opportunities.</p>
          <p>We are cautious about the outlook for the western economies. However, our Asian business gives us a material and powerful presence in the most attractive markets in our industry and one that will continue to underpin our growth.</p>
          <p>So we view the rest of the year with confidence, given the momentum that we have seen in the first half of the year. And as we look further ahead beyond the second half, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong growth and generate strong returns for our shareholders, thanks to our operational focus and strong market positions.</p>
          <p>Finally, and before we get into questions, please update for your diaries, on the 30th of November and the 1st of December, we will hold an investor and analyst event in London for a more detailed look at our businesses across the group, so U.S., U.K., Asia and asset management and we would intend this to become an annual event.</p>
          <p>So, thank you, and over to you now for questions. Okay, great. And I will go from right to left.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Tidjane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg Paterson, KBW, three questions. One is, in the light of more Mark Tucker going to AIA, could you just remind us of the &#x2013; when the Standard Chartered distribution deal comes up for renegotiation?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the U.S. You mentioned a while back that at some point, the VA &#x2013; your margins in the VA will come under pressure, as the competitors get back on their feet. I was wondering if you've seen any evidence of that in the third quarter?</p>
          <p>And the third question is just a sort of &#x2013; you have a pretty low dividend yield. You're growing your dividend at 5% per annum. You've spent 18 months, I suppose, convincing the market that you've actually got very, very strong cash flow.</p>
          <p>I mean, if the dividend carries on growing at 5%, how does one actually suggest that you invest in the stock, if that's going to happen? And furthermore, can we expect some kind of upgrade in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Greg. Yes, the first thing I'd like to say is that we wish Mark well. He has been doing this in my place for many years and we wish him well at AIA.</p>
          <p>Standard Chartered. It was eight years, yes? And we signed it for an extension of two.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't disclose the specific terms, but it does have years to run, and the relationship is obviously very strong and the results are going very well. I think you will have seen in...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hong Kong has recovered very nicely.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hong Kong has recovered very nicely and you'll see in the first half results that bank is up 42%, so it's outpacing the broader regional growth. So SEB obviously is a material part of that. So we wouldn't have any particular concerns about that, Greg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. And you've seen that something that you will be also diversifies our presence. And they did 11 million of AP in five months for an agreement that is just starting. And they are already comparing interestingly with other positions we have in the region. So we are also going to continue to grow that and diversify that.</p>
          <p>Margins in the U.S., Clark, do you want to talk about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as your question was on reemergence of competition in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Six months ago, I'd have said that there was very little competition in U.S. except for a couple of targeted large players. You are starting to see some reemergence now of people coming back into the market. And where pricing had almost over corrected, where it's becoming more competitive now.</p>
          <p>None of it is problematic. None of it is anywhere near the line of what I'd consider to be irrational competition that we saw in the past. But we're seeing people wander back into the market, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the third one was the dividend, which is probably a question we'll get a lot this morning. I have two key points there.</p>
          <p>The first one is really the opportunities we have in the business. We always say that we reinvest with IRRs above 20% and payback around two or three years in Asia. We believe it's very, very attractive, and it's possibly a discussion for November or December when you have that Investor Day. But we can drill down in the IRRs and explain to you why we believe that the first destination of those surpluses should be reinvestment in the business. We have extraordinary investment opportunities, and provided they come back fast and they have short paybacks, they should be rewarding for the shareholders.</p>
          <p>The second one is that we really stress test our dividend. That's something I insisted on when I was CFO, and I think Nic is continuing that. A formula is using a sustainable &#x2013; increase the dividend at a sustainable pace. What that means is that you adopt a pace that doesn't insulate you, but protects you against the volatility of the world economy. And that's what we try to achieve, and that's very important.</p>
          <p>So when you see us putting out an increased rate, it's really robust, okay? The dividend policy is a two times cover, but we really work very hard to ensure that the dividend is progressive and remains so. And so it only goes one way, not the other way. So I think that explains possibly some of the gap between what you were expecting and what we have delivered. It's the desire to make sure that balance between writing new business and making sure that the dividend can continue to progress is right.</p>
          <p>That being said, it's a place where I think there is an upside. But we are cautious and there is still a lack of visibility over the next 12 months. And you've just seen what's been announced yesterday. We all see the news. It's better to be cautious, and that's the stance we've taken.</p>
          <p> Let's go to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Tony Silverman, Standard and Poor's Equity Research. Just a couple of questions on Asia.</p>
          <p>I wonder if you could talk a bit about the background in India and the regulatory changes that have happened in recent months? What the outlook means &#x2013; what that means to the outlook for you and the market?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I'll be interested to hear bit more what you can say, you mentioned that China is in &#x2013; there's a bit of China, if you like, implicitly included in some of the Southeast Asian territories. I haven't heard a lot said about that, other than <mark type="inaudible" />, what more you can say?</p>
          <p>And finally on Slide 55, there's an Others line. Just a small question really. But it seems odd to me that, that appears to include Singapore, which is your second largest market or at least it's not mentioned separately on Slide 55. I don't know if that's just an oddity, but perhaps you could comment? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. India, just one comment is that we're very happy with recovering volumes. I think we're at 56% in volume in India and that's welcome and the regulatory environment effectively is challenging in a market were margins are still relatively low. So with that introduction, Barry, I'll let you talk about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's a lot of regulatory change all at once, so we &#x2013; it's kind of a shock and awe approach to making regulatory change. Normally things like this are sort of drip fed, but the changes that they are proposing certainly will have an impact on all of the players there, particular the multinationals, the foreign JVs.</p>
          <p>In the long-term, I think the changes are right headed in that they are focused on trying to drive a market which has been very, very investment-oriented with very little feature of protection. They're trying to move it towards protection. That's a good thing. That's something we have been trying to do for a couple of years in our singlehandedly in our own way, with some effect, but not dramatic effect. And that ultimately, as Tidjane says, the margins in India are amongst the lowest in the world. And the way you drive up the margins are by changing the product mix and offering people more protection.</p>
          <p>The fact of the matter is, consumers there need the protection as well, because there is not a social safety net. I mean for all of the reasons we write protection in other places, it works in India too. It's just, none of the companies have ever really focused on it significantly.</p>
          <p>So in the long-run, the changes are good, in the short-term, they will be challenging to get them implemented. They will require reengineering in how you distribute the products. You'll tend to see smaller distribution forces, more productive distribution forces. Again, the evolution from point A to point B will be complicated, but once you get to point B, that's a good place to be. So we're actually optimistic, and we're particularly optimistic about it, because we think that given the planning that we've done already to respond to this, and we have a full operational plan in place to deal with these changes when they arise here in the next couple of months, that what's really going to help is scale.</p>
          <p>The largest players will be the most advantaged players in terms of dealing with this. The players like us and we're perhaps the only foreign JV that's actually in a break-even position now. We generated our first stat profit in India for the fiscal year ending March 31. So we're in a much stronger and a much more advantaged position to deal with these changes than our competitors. So I think, it's fair to assume that you will see, within the marketplace, you'll see new business volumes taper off some for a period of time, but in the long run, I think it's good for the market.</p>

          <p>Perhaps the noise around it, do you think influenced the sales profile in recent months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really, because it's &#x2013; there has been some noise around it, but it's really sort of happened rather suddenly and I don't think people had a clear view into what it was actually going to mean. So, I don't think it's had a significant impact over the last few months. Our momentum has been fairly steady over the last 9 to 12 months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is just certain markets where we disclose margins and certain where we historically haven't. And I mean, that's something I guess we could always relook at, but at this point there.</p>

          <p>You can tell, reformer here for the CFO of Asia is a very lively debate on this issue. It's well rehearsed. We've talked about it many times. But I am confident that having some influence on the debate, we'll get to more open communication on this in the future, so. But it was positive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. Well, that's a very interesting point, because you always hear this debate on intra-Asia trade, and the integration of the Asian economies to China. And often, people talk about China and the rest of Asia. It's something that Japanese understand very well.</p>
          <p>Japanese put themselves into the China operations very smartly, and if you look at a country like Vietnam, economically, it operates as an additional Chinese province. And if you look at the degree of integration between a lot of these economies and the work that the Asian has done, the nature of the trade flows is completely different. More than 65% of our trade now is intra-region, if you look at '98 crisis, it was exactly the opposite.</p>
          <p>So and if you run a regression, you will see that the GDP of the other Southeast Asian nation is very highly correlated with the GDP of China. We haven't really understood that. So often we get, well, that you're in the wrong countries, got in China, all that good growth at 72 margins and 46%, frankly, it's the same thing. That's the full term strength to express. But a lot of that is a false debate, and we are in places where we are getting very good growth. We're benefiting from China and we have no problem extracting dividends and capital flows, et cetera. So maybe it's not such a stupid strategy, that's all I was trying to say. <mark type="inaudible" />. Thanks for being patient, over to Gerard.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jon Hocking, Morgan Stanley, I have got three questions, please. Can you explain how you get a two-year payback in the U.S., just in simple terms here? What cash is going out in terms of commission, locked-up CapEx, as lots of fees year on year on the products in two years, because it seems a very, very short payback?</p>
          <p>Secondly on the bancassurance in Asia, long run, is that a threat to margins? How do you see the margins on bancassurance versus the proprietary channels? And then just a final question, I may have this wrong, but I think I remember you have &#xA3;1.6 billion of cash at the hold co at year-end, you've got just over 1 billion. Obviously the AIA fees have come out, et cetera, and the divi's come out. Where do you think that cash position would be at year-end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Very good. Payback of two years, I am going to go to Clark, but how much time do we give you, Clark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll do 30 seconds here and a bit more later. At high level, commission on the products, 7.5%. The initial surrender charge on the products, 8.5%. We get an expense allowance under U.S. regulatory accounting not to exceed the surrender charge on the product and so that and some of the regulatorily required capital in the RBC formula unwinding after the first year of the contract causes the VAs to payback very quickly. The aggregate fee structure is about a 180 basis points on that, so the fee structure is healthy as well. But I'd say the dominant feature is just that the expense allowances that we get is healthy, because the surrender charge is healthy and it's supportable by the fee structure, so we're allowed to take it.</p>

          <p>What do you think VA payback periods were back in '07, '08 for the market? Because that two years just seems very, very short?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For us, they've always been relatively short. I mean, we increased our surrender charges at one point in time to shorten them, in order to have better recoverability of the acquisition costs. But variable annuities have never been that capital intensive. Really what has impacted the capital intensity of the U.S. business is the shift from the general account products, which have much longer paybacks, to the variable annuities, where the variable annuities are now 75% of our writings, that's the &#x2013; that's what you've seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Bancassurance margins, effectively, if you look at margins, so NBP or APE, bancassurance looks lower. But the returns on capital are good, and that's what we look at. So this is a discussion we also have internally and I think we will meet probably again in November to give you a better sense of that. But it's value creating business, there's no doubt about it. Optically, it looks lower margin than the agency, but it's still good business and it is creating value. It's covering its cost of capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's important to remember too that the &#x2013; I mean, the definition of success is absolute NBP, not necessarily margin. I mean, we work very hard to keep margins high, and to drive the business as hard as we can. But it's absolute NBP.</p>
          <p>And the bank business is growing faster, but margins still go up, because it's also important to remember when you look at our bank business, it's a little distinctive compared to what most people do, which is almost purely deposit stripping through banks staff. A huge chunk of our business comes from our own staff embedded in the branches who are selling recurring premium, unit-linked life product with rider. So that supports the margin. That means that while our margins for bank are lower then they are for agency, they're higher than most other competitors' margins are for bank.</p>
          <p>And I would infer from your question, you're assuming that bank will overtake agency as a distribution channel. And while it's coming on very strong in some markets, don't count agency out yet. It's got a long way to run. And it's still also growing very fast. The bank's growing a little faster, but it's not a big difference.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our projection &#x2013; it was 37, 42. The first mark. 37% agency, 42% bancassurance. And it's going to be like that.</p>
          <p>So the 37% in the global world of insurance &#x2013; we'll take that agency growth in Asia. So both will grow, with one growing faster. The agency has a few good years ahead of it.</p>
          <p>Cash, yes. 1.61, yes. We've paid the dividend, we've paid UOB, we've paid the AIA cost. It's going down, but we're confident that it's going to rebuild.</p>

          <p>Yes. The central cash position at the start of the year wasn't quite 1.6. It was just shy of 1.5.</p>
          <p>It had increased last year because of the issuance of hybrid debt, which we said we were agent to support the IGB position during the crisis, having &#x2013; we used central funds to finance the acquisition <mark type="inaudible" />. The full reconciliation is given in your packs.</p>
          <p>It's now sitting at just over 1 billion, as I said in my presentation. We are not uncomfortable with that level. Historically, we've managed it in the range of below 1 billion to around 1.5. But that we are comfortable with our position.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Blair Stewart, B of A-Merrill. Two questions, one for Clark and one for &#x2013; on Asia for Barry.</p>
          <p>On Asia, given AIA's going to be a listed company in all likelihood, under a new CEO, how should we assess the risk of management or agent drift from PCA to AIA, what protections are in place, particularly on the agent side?</p>
          <p>And in the U.S. for Clark, we've seen a couple of your competitors taking charges, because the hedge costs are above what they're able to get in fees. And we have seen some DAC unlocking, as well. Just wonder how you can avoid that? You said that your price more or less stays the same when clearly the price of the hedging is going up. Yes, just if you could talk around that, how you avoid those losses? And what the hedging costs are doing at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what the &#x2013; it's more complicated than what was in the chart, but you've got to boil a lot of information down to one chart.</p>
          <p>Hedge costs are part of it, but the benefits &#x2013; or rather the fees charged for the benefits is part of it. But the benefits that you're providing for those fees is the other part of it. And what we have been doing is we didn't take charges up, because we think when the cost of these benefits goes above 100 basis points, the salability of them goes way down. Instead, what we have done is taken the benefits in, reduced the richness of the benefits, as the hedge costs have gone up.</p>
          <p>And so we have been doing that in order to keep the benefits hedgeable within that cost. So if you charge an adequate fee, you can afford to hedge the economics, and we have always been very focused on charging an adequate fee, so that we are able to hedge those economics.</p>
          <p>The, on the DAC, you know we have the &#x2013; we are outside of our DAC corridor, so DAC moves around with the market. Our current sensitivity is about $9 million worth of DAC per 1% move in the equity market.</p>
          <p>So I think we took a hit yesterday, but we'll stay outside of the corridor for some period of time. So that will be our DAC sensitivity and it's really, it's just as simple as that on the DAC. We are not anywhere near any recoverability issues. Our K-factor on our variable annuities is 63%, so we are nowhere near a recoverability issue or we would actually have to take a DAC charge other than the normal equity market movements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think we'll disclose the number if we eliminated the mean reversion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mean reversion would be the other question, the natural follow-on and if we eliminated it, it's a $160 million charge, so it's just not that materially effective. But it just, it smoothes the &#x2013; has potential to smooth the DAC period to period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Can you give an example of how the benefits have come down in the VA product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can. We've taken our &#x2013; we used to have it for our roll-ups. When people aren't accessing benefits, we used to do a 7% simple interest 10-year roll-up, and we reduced that to a 6% simple interest 10-year roll-up. We had the &#x2013; also, we had our &#x2013; on one of our more popular benefits, although this change really applied across most of the book, where you could access 5% of the money per annum, beginning at age 45. That's now at age 65. These benefits are more expensive at the older issue ages. We reduced commissions at some of the older issue ages to increase margin or make the sale at those ages less attractive. So those would be some of the tangible things that we've done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other question for Barry on AIA and agent retention?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The downside of fast growth and success and so forth is that people are always crawling all over our team. I think our team is widely viewed as being the strongest in the region. So our guys get phone calls all the time. If it wasn't AIA, it would be AXA or Manulife or pick a name. I think AIA's listing doesn't necessarily give them &#x2013; that doesn't transform things and make it easier for them to recruit. I think, again, it's always somebody and it's almost constant.</p>
          <p>And yet, we have always been a net importer certainly of agent talent, and we've not lost any senior people to a competitor, people that we felt were strategically important to the business in years. So it's something that we certainly take seriously. It's &#x2013; again, it's the downside of success and so that's something you have to watch very closely. We have a lot &#x2013; our compensation systems are &#x2013; there's a big element of our compensation systems historically that have been focused on retention. Those remain in place.</p>
          <p>But a lot of it is actually about the environment as opposed to compensation. There's a reason why we've been able to attract the people that we've been able to attract. And it's because of the sort of empowered culture that we have, the success of the organization, the energy and ambition of the organization. I don't see those things fundamentally changing. So we'll certainly watch it and &#x2013; as we always have and we'll watch it even more closely in the future. But it's not something that I think we need to be unduly concerned about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one of our most effective protection is our growth. As long as agents are successful with a company, they are pretty good at NPV calculations, and they understand where their economic interest lies. And then, when you see Hong Kong up 37%, India 56, Indonesia 54, Malaysia 48, Philippines 131, Singapore 45, Thailand 59, that's how we keep our agents. They are successful, successful. They make a lot of money. They are happy. Okay, Andrew?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Andrew Crean of Autonomous Research. Three questions.</p>
          <p>Firstly, could you comment on your relationships with the FSA, and how seriously you might consider a redomicile to Hong Kong, either for an easier capital regime or a better rating?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you talk about, instead of IGD, your internal capital models and how those are faring, particularly in relation to lower interest rates? And as an adjunct to that, could you talk a bit about guaranteed annuity options and lower interest rates on your U.S. variable annuities? What are the key sensitivities? Is it to do with sort of allocations between equity and fixed interest buckets? Or what are the key factors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. The FSA, we have a good relationship. I mean clearly, it was a factor during the AIA transaction. But to be open, the issue there was more, I think, the complexity of transaction and the issues that had to be resolved, rather than a relationship issue between the FSA and us.</p>
          <p>So we have a good relationship operationally. I speak &#x2013; every two weeks we have a call, which is <mark type="inaudible" /> et cetera &#x2013; myself and the lead regulator of the FSA. Actually, we do the same thing with the Hong Kong regulator and others.</p>
          <p>So overall, the relationship is good. And you can imagine the number of issues we discuss at any point in time is very large. And so it's a good dialogue.</p>
          <p>The domicile is an important question from a shareholder value perspective. It's something that the board looks at regularly. We look at the issue very closely, and we invest resources in it.</p>
          <p>So far, that review has always concluded that London was the right location for our group, and it's something that we review regularly.</p>
          <p>IGD, internal capital models. I am looking at the combination &#x2013; and maybe we will take GAU, because that's specific. Clark, if you want to talk about the GAUs and the impact of lower rates, and then we can talk about the internal capital models between Nic and you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You &#x2013; impact of lower rates, and you are asking with regard to the VA book and VA general accounts.</p>
          <p>We've moved the VA general accounts to the NAIC's floating interest rate minimum calculation, which in periods of low interest rates like what we have right now, lets you reduce your guarantees. If you're structured, your products comply with those. That's like around 1.5% or something like that right now. We are crediting at or closer to those guarantees.</p>
          <p>We've got between 10 and 15% of our VA money in the general account right now. So a trade-off between the cost of the money in that general account and the positive impacts it has on the volatility of the accounts due to the reduced equity component. We have got around 20% of the money right now flowing into those accounts, but some of that dollar cost averages out.</p>
          <p>So it's all in there. It impacted our margins because we're making obviously much less margin on that general account business than we were previously, and that was one of the big aggravators in being able to hold our aggregate variable annuity margins where they are at present.</p>

          <p>The point I would though make is that this is &#x2013; this goes back to the point I was making during my presentation. When you look at the improvement in the balance, which is what we have been striving, the balance of our balance sheet, and the much greater now component that comes from pure risk business acts as a diversifier to some of the risks that are associated with low interest rates on our spread business. So we &#x2013; so it's just to bring that into the equation.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks so much. Andy Hughes, Exane BNP Paribas. A couple of questions, if I could.</p>
          <p>The first one on almost the exact point to the U.S. general account spread business. It spent about the some amount of money in U.S. dollar terms for the last sort of five years or something. And it sounds a bit like you're increasing the liquidity in the asset portfolio behind it and reducing the crediting rates.</p>
          <p>So is the idea to shrink the spread business in the U.S., and where are we now with crediting rates on the fixed annuity book, et cetera? And the second question was on new business strain in Asia. Obviously, it was quite a lot lower than possibly you might have expected given the switch towards bancassurance. Is bancassurance in Asia a lower-strain product than the other products that you sell and could you give some background as to why the new business strain is so much lower essentially for you in Asia at this time around? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. You want to take a fixed annuity business in the U.S., Clark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>General account in the U.S. has been flat for quite some time and that was by design. It wasn't an explicit target to keep it flat, but an explicit target to grow our fee-based business at the expense of the general account business. We are not trying to get it into negative cash flow or anything, and if you look at net flows on the general account products, they're about flat. So I think if it stays about where it is, that would be a comfortable range. I wouldn't want it to go into net cash outflow. I &#x2013; despite the gain in the portfolio, so I think we're comfortable.</p>
          <p>You &#x2013; as your balancing the risks in the U.S. business, you want to keep some spread component there, because you're more resilient from a capital standpoint. You're more resilient from a cash flow standpoint. You need the general account to help finance the acquisition cost of the fee-based businesses, so people that have tried to go straight, separate account without general account have run into problems in that regard, because then you have &#x2013; you're dependent on the securitization market for the variable annuity fees and we don't want to get to that.</p>
          <p>So not a target to drive it down really from where it is today, you would like to maintain spread income about where it is, and then grow the fee incomes, so we get a better balance that way.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that's right. And we're always looking for that balance between spread, fee and underwriting, and that absolutely right. New business strain in Asia, do you wan to take that, between Barry and -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me comment, and then Nic can comment as well. I mean, on the bank issue specifically, again, you have to remember what it is we're writing through banks. Most people that are focused heavily on bank business are writing, deposit stripping a two-pay, three-pay five-year endowment with a guarantee, and they're chewing up a lot of capital in doing that kind of business.</p>
          <p>A majority of the business that we write through banks is not deposit stripping product. It is regular premium, recurring premium, unit-linked with riders. And that's why our margins are higher, and that's why our strain is lower in the bank channel. So there is &#x2013; there is bank and then there's bank, and we just do it a little differently than most, and that's why our numbers look a little different than most.</p>
          <p>I don't know if -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just to expand on that, there will be differences in strain to reflect, if you like, the size and the shape of the commission payment. But to Barry's point, that is more &#x2013; the biggest driver or the biggest influence to the total amount is mix, which tends to be a higher mix of the underlying business.</p>
          <p>But in terms of the reduction in the absolute amount of new business strain, some of that has to do literally with stopping writing business in Japan that was consuming a lot of our capital, and slowing down the business that we've been writing in Korea, which was also a large drain on that particular metric. And it just goes back to being absolutely clear about where we can deliver the most profit using the least capital in Asia. It's linked to that philosophy and the operating principles that Tidjane described earlier in his presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there some way of working out where the underlying new business strain is moved from last year excluding the fact that it's in Korea and Japan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we can help you with that, I think, offline. But I think the point is really important.</p>
          <p>For me, this whole thing about discipline, it's really binary. Okay? An issue like discipline, where in some places, where it hurts you very much. And all we've done on the IFRS &#x2013; I was shocked when I saw first your India minus 40, but 72 we showed for whole continent.</p>
          <p>That was a minus 40 deteriorated just from India. So working that down. Stopping Japan. I think absolutely vital. Korea is IFRS positive, I believe, for the first time this half year. That's the discipline we are enforcing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As was China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as China. And when you do that, you can see the impact.</p>
          <p>We always focus on the big things, but often it's the small things, if you don't get right &#x2013; get them right and if you let them go, who really kill you and hurt your numbers. So it's really about discipline across the board that produces these results.</p>
          <p>And again, strain is product before channel. We don't fundamentally sell different products in Asia in banks, because as Barry said, we put agent in banks. We don't sell like an agent. So we end up selling a product that's very similar to what we have in agents.</p>
          <p>Oliver, here in the front. He has been trying for awhile, so thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to sit near the front to get noticed. Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank.</p>
          <p>It's really a question about fungibility of cash flows and capital. I know that you remit to the center only as much as you need to cover the central costs and dividend. But I mean to what extent would you able to raise that remittance, and what changes have you seen over the last, say, 6 or 12 months in local restrictions on capital and cash transfers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very important question. I think in the short-term, the way we run the group is the way you described it. So you bring at the center just what you need to cover your costs, central cash cost, dividend, et cetera. And that's not difficult. There are no real impediments to that.</p>
          <p>When you try to move more capital, our experience frankly is that it's doable, but it takes more time. So my personal belief is that, over time, medium-term capital is very fungible. In the very short-term, frankly, it's not, because you need to get into conversations with the regulators to pay a dividend from here or there. But generally those conversations are sensible and get resolved.</p>
          <p>We've got a 400 million dividend out of Singapore &#x2013; special dividend last year. Pounds. It's a big amount. So that's just what we do.</p>
          <p>You also have to have a good relationship with the regulator, explain what you want to do, and if you are not weakening the business and if you are not threatening the solvency of the business, generally you can move the capital. But it's not automatic, it's not like pressing a button.</p>
          <p>But overall, I think that free surplus generation, that underlying free surplus generation will give you a good sense of the true capital generation. And that capital is mobile. Over a horizon of 12 to 18 months, it is mobile. Over a horizon of 3 to 6 months, no, it's not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no regulatory restrictions in the same way as there were in place when we talked to you about the AIA transaction, beyond ensuring that we have an appropriate risk capital for the business that you are writing. And that hard capital is what we're reflecting in the determination of our embedded value and the cost of capital associated with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's fascinating. When we talk about Asia, what we found in '08 and '09 at the worst times of the crisis is that we had no tension and no issue of repayment or dividend. We've always been able to upstream the dividends with no real threat or difficulty. So that's not a major concern, I think.</p>
          <p>Yes, we can go over there, yes?</p>

          <p>Duncan Russell from JP Morgan. Just coming back on to the VA margins, you said that about third of it was driven by higher take-up of guarantees, and a third is driven by lower use of these guarantees. I was just wondering how comfortable you were with that assumption, which seems slightly contradictory, that people are buying more of the product and using less of it? So could you talk about policyholder behavior and that assumption you embedded in your pricing, I guess, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we have done, which doesn't appear to have been the predominant practice in the U.S. when these things were new, was we set our accounting assumptions for utilization very conservatively and because we hadn't seen experience and the tails and now we've seen and been accumulating experience in what we hope are the tails of tails. And what you get it is relatively inefficient utilization of the benefit on a economic standpoint.</p>
          <p>From a customer standpoint, they're trying to provide for their retirement income and provide some stability. So the patterns you see are reasonable from a customer standpoint, but as far as maximizing the value of the options, it doesn't tend to maximize the value of the options. They don't start taking the withdrawal benefits as soon as the value is maximized. They take it when they start to need the money. They don't necessarily, if they have a 5% benefit, they don't take a 5% benefit, they take the money that they need. A lot of them at this point in time aren't taking anything at all.</p>
          <p>And so what we did in our assumptions was start to reflect some of that. We didn't reflect all of it, but we moved the &#x2013; from what we assume was quite efficient utilization of the benefits to something that was between what we were seeing and where we had been before. So we're quite comfortable with those assumptions and look at that experience pretty carefully.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Raghu Hariharan from Citi. Just three questions and two on the U.S. really. The first one was on, could you could give us a simple kind of benchmark that your U.S. peers, for example, tell us what S&amp;P levels do they think when the market reaches, then they have either dark unlocking or guarantee costs economically being much higher? And that starts affecting either your earnings or your capital. So if you can give us a benchmark as to what level of S&amp;P &#x2013; or what levels S&amp;P need to reach when you start seeing losses?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just trying to go bit deeper on the VA guarantees. You said you charge about 180 bps of AMC. How much of that would be for the guarantees, how much of that would be for the assets, and how &#x2013; so say if you charge 80 bps, how have the guarantees performed against the charges that you've taken for guarantees since you have seen higher take up, but lower utilization?</p>
          <p>The last one was really on Asia. You're seeing a lot of regulatory risk coming through in Asia. I was just wondering, even in the IFRS numbers, you're seeing drawing changes coming through Malaysia, an economic capital model coming through. You saw benefit in India. You saw negative impact in China. I was just wondering how well prepared are you for regulatory risk changes or regulatory changes across Southeast Asia, and in terms of product mix, in terms of agent retention and just in terms of how scalable your products are as well?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as &#x2013; what point drop in &#x2013; I know we put some IGD sensitivities out there and so I would refer to those in terms of the impact of the guarantees on IGD capital. The &#x2013; from a DAC recoverability standpoint, you've got two DAC things going on and one is the 9 million for 1%. So the second part of that question would really be, what is the point where you hit recoverability issues? There we've got a 63% K-factor, so we're nowhere near it. Chad, do you have any sense of that?</p>

That would be about 55 basis points for our share of the asset management fees. That wouldn't include anything for the cost of the guaranteed benefits, that's the cost of the wrapper.</p>

          <p>For those who don't know him is, Chad is in charge of our hedging and risk-management team in U.S., so if you want to talk to him after this meeting, I am sure you will benefit from that. Regulatory change in Asia, I think maybe I will make an opening comment and let Barry continue. We actually really have a very, very solid, very good relationships with the regulators in Asia, and that got verified during the AIA transactions at various points, where they actually agreed to speed up the process work for us, be extremely cooperative. So that's an asset for us.</p>
          <p>As you said, yes, sometimes it's positive, sometimes it's negative, diversification. So we got 63 million &#x2013; we've seen in Malaysia last year, negative in India. Yes, I mean, it varies, but overall, we find the environment in Asia reasonably benign, particularly vis-&#xE0;-vis our industry.</p>
          <p>We are seen favorably, because we contribute to collect savings. What we do is something every average Minister of Finance likes, which is really go into the society and collect all the savings and then transform them into productive investment in the economy, because we go and buy corporate bonds or equity or investment bonds. We deepen their financial market. We're long-term investors, we're talking &#x2013; when you think about NDI, you're going to track for investment in foreign country, people who actually raise capital domestically and reinvest it are seen very favorably.</p>
          <p>So we never really perceived any fundamental tension and most issues we find are resolved. On the agent front, they're helpful because really most of them don't like poaching, so they contribute to professionalize the industry and this is something we support. And overall, it's worth what its worth, but when we were driving every they said that we were &#x2013; the situation we were was good news. We were seen as a good player who was easy to regulate and plays by the rules. But, Barry, you're closer to that so you should comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean I think Tidjane's covered most of the important points on the &#x2013; the diversity's important. We don't see anything on the horizon that we think is really punitive towards us. In fact, we actually &#x2013; a lot of this stuff, while sometimes there is some complexity in dealing with regulatory changes, it tends to be far less complex for us and far less impactful for us then it is for our local competitors, who don't operate to the same standard we do.</p>
          <p>So if they come out and say, well, agents now have to complete total needs analysis forms before &#x2013; and that has to be turned with the application before they can sell a policy and so on so forth, well, we already do that. So that's not difficult for us, but that's a hurdle that local companies tend not to place on their agents. So it actually works to our benefit, because it slows our competitors down. So we operate, generally speaking, to a standard that's higher than what is required or what is considered locally accepted practice. So regulatory changes tend actually in the long run to help us, not to hurt us.</p>

The impact of changes can be both ways, negative and positive, but the general trend has been one of releasing excessive prudence into reserving , clearly, and we saw that very clearly last year with a release in profits in Malaysia from the RBC change. That tends to be the general trend from a financial impact perspective, but it can be positive and negative.</p>

          <p>Greg Brick from MF Global. A couple of questions. Just on the step change down and the transfer from the wis profit fund, I know you had the bonus cut at the &#x2013; in 2009, is there anything else going on that we should be looking at, change in mix or change in volumes, maturities coming off there that we should look at on that?</p>
          <p>Secondly on the persistency in Asia, I know the persistency now is fairly modest, but it does come after a series of downgrades on the assumptions, operating assumptions before that. What are we looking at now? Are we looking at customer behavior or sales retention issues there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with Asia and then we'll go to U.K. As you see, the numbers compared to the embedded values are relatively modest. But they exist, they're real. One of the things that happened clearly, something we've seen in the U.K. earlier, especially unique, often when the market drops, they don't sell and it's something once you get a recovery that you see the lapses. So a part of it is just customer behavior, the classical thing, other spoken had the loss. They hold on to their shares and often those products, when you recovered in equity market levels, and people are back where they were, the retail market tends then to sell and get out.</p>
          <p>So I think that's been a large part of what you have seen there, an underlying issue. So it is manageable. It would concern us, if it was really localized at one country. You saw Korea last year, recently you saw a mixture of Indonesia and Malaysia and a bit of Korea, et cetera. So it's something that will happen in a large portfolio over time, but it's not a source of concern today. The U.K., Rob, you want to &#x2013; with-profit transfer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I pick up on the with-profits transfer. It's entirely driven by the bonus changes in 2009. So it's nothing on the underlying flows or size of the portfolio. And indeed, the with-profits transfer was slightly higher than we planned for this year because of our performance in 2009 reflected in 2010 bonuses, very strong performance in terms of the underlying investment returns on the with-profits from '09, led to higher bonuses than we were expecting. So actually, it's recovering in terms of the long term trend faster than we anticipated.</p>
