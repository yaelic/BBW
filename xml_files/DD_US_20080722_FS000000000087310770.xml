          <p>Good morning. My name is <mark type="inaudible" /> and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DuPont Second Quarter 2008 Investor Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. To listen to the webcast please go to www.dupont.com.</p>
          <p>Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Carl Lukach, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, <mark type="inaudible" /> and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's webcast covering DuPont's second quarter 2008 financial results and outlook. We apologize for the 10-minute delayed start this morning due to some <mark type="inaudible" /> on our phone lines. I'll remind you that a replay of today's call is available afterwards on our website. So let's get started.</p>
          <p>With me today are Chad Holliday, Chairman and CEO of DuPont; Jeff Keefer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Borel, Group Vice President of DuPont's Production Agriculture Businesses. Since growth in agriculture was a key factor in our second quarter results and there's lots of news this time of year in production agriculture that we've asked Jim to join the call and share with you his insights on his businesses and their performance in the quarter and outlook.</p>
          <p>But first the administrative items. For those of you accessing this call through our website, dupont.com, we will be using slides today; please turn to slide two. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements. All statements that are just expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements; although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.</p>
          <p>We also will refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you please refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, our GAAP statements are provided with our earnings news release and on our website. We have also posted on our website supplemental information that we hope is helpful to your understanding of our company's performance.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Chad Holliday.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Carl. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. DuPont had a solid second quarter with record underlying earnings per share and our second half outlook projects a record underlying earnings year. Our agricultural businesses were very strong. All of our businesses in emerging markets had another great quarter. Our pricing actions produced the highest quarterly gains in the past four years and we had excellent fixed cost productivity results from our ongoing projects we described to you in the past. The combination of these positive factors plus excellent execution of our teams was more than enough to offset the weak demand in US markets and the accelerated increases in the price of natural gas and petroleum feedstocks that we buy as raw materials. We also had some help this quarter from currency and a few items we could not project in our guidance three months ago.</p>
          <p>Jeff will cover all the details next, but the bottom line is our earnings per share for the quarter ended up 13% higher than last year and for the first half we grew earnings per share 18% versus last year. Five years ago we could not have delivered these results in this environment. We are a very different company today and I hope you see that in our results.</p>
          <p>Let me turn it over to Jeff who will take you through the quarter and the outlook and I will come back at the end to share closing thoughts. Jeff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chad. Before covering the details for the quarter let me frame for you how we view the results. In short we had strong performance in the second quarter with earnings per share up 13% versus last year. The $1.18 earnings per share in the second quarter had about $0.07 of benefits from items we could not predict when we gave you our guidance. The $0.07 is comprised of a litigation settlement and one-time tax settlement. We had resources working diligently on these items for some time and their efforts resulted in successful resolutions in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And after accounting for those items our strong performance was the result of better than expected agriculture and nutrition results as well as strong performance across all our businesses. We are executing very effectively to meet our commitments in a challenging macroeconomic environment.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 3, which summarizes earnings per share and sales results. Second quarter reported earnings per share grew 13% to $1.18 versus prior-year quarter. For the first half reported earnings per share grew 18%. Second quarter consolidated net sales increased 12%. Positive 7% local price, 5% currency benefit, 1% increase in volume and a negative 1% due to portfolio changes.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 4. All segments increased sales by 8% or better. The standout in the quarter was agricultural and nutrition posting 23% sales growth. These results were underpinned by strong global agriculture markets, price gains in crop protection products and seed, holding corn share in North America and gaining share at other seed markets. While the agriculture and nutrition results were outstanding, all of our businesses turned in solid results reflecting global positions, diversified end markets, brand strength and technology advantages. Carl and Jim will cover the segments in detail, but I want to highlight a few businesses' performance.</p>
          <p>The Coatings business grew sales and earnings due to the value of our industry leading water-based paint technology and the strength of our brands. The TiO2 business grew sales and earnings as the global team relentlessly drilled down costs, moved higher raw material cost down the value chain, grew in emerging markets and benefited from customers seeking a reliable supply partner.</p>
          <p>The Chemicals businesses and safety and protection platform benefited from cost productivity, strong pricing and value-enhanced offerings such as environmental solutions.</p>
          <p>Electronics businesses in the E&amp;CT platform delivered double-digit top and bottom line growth reflecting strong demand for Solamet and Tedlar, going into the photovoltaics market. There are headwinds, but this quarter again showed the value of the diversified -- of the diversity of our product portfolio by end market and geography.</p>
          <p>Taking a different cut at our sales results, the global sales distribution on slide 5 shows that 60% of our sales were generated outside the US. US sales were up 5% reflecting 9% price and 4% lower volume. The US volume decline reflects lower volumes in all segments except Ag and Nutrition. To add further color to our US volumes, we estimate that about two-thirds of the US volume decline was associated with the auto and housing markets. The remaining decline in the quarter can be attributed to other situations, such as being supply limited due to an extended plant outage at our ethylene facility due to a scheduled major maintenance shutdown. Our earnings outlook, which we will discuss in a few minutes, anticipates weak demand from North America auto and housing markets continues in the second half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Sales in emerging markets continued strong and overall grew 23%. Sales in Latin America grew 19%, emerging Asia grew 23% and emerging Europe grew 27%. Our growth in Latin America continues to be broad-based, as all segments delivered solid growth in the quarter. Looking forward, our third quarter outlook for Latin America is favorable as we start the summer agriculture season, which Jim will cover in a minute. We also anticipate continued growth across all other businesses.</p>
          <p>China sales grew 22% in the quarter. All segments posted solid results and our outlook does not show slowing. Emerging Europe continues strong and the growth is broad-based. We had double-digit growth in Poland, Russia and Turkey. Our emerging market teams led by Ellen Kullman are organized and executing well.</p>
          <p>Moving now to earnings and the EPS variance analysis on slide 6. You can see clearly that the largest variance for the quarter was our variable cost followed by price. We achieved our 18th consecutive quarter of local price increases, which boosted earnings per share $0.42 over last year, but not enough to cover the $0.51 impact from higher variable cost. This was the largest quarterly gain from our pricing actions in the past four years as well as the largest quarterly increase in ingredient cost.</p>
          <p>All segments achieved local price improvements. Our teams have been doing a great job working with our customers to implement price changes quickly and with the experience we've gained in adapting to the economic environment during the first half we'll be even more vigilant on pricing actions in the second half. The variable cost increase this quarter, adjusted for volume and currency, was $0.51 earnings per share.</p>
          <p>Let me elaborate just a bit. Raw material, energy and transportation cost increased about $550 million, or about 15% in the quarter, which compares to 9% in the first quarter versus about 5% increase in all of 2007. The raw material increases are the result of historic high oil and gas prices but also reflect agricultural commodity cost increases, as well as tight supply for chemicals such as sulfur, ammonia, caustic soda, coke, ore, and methanol, just to name a few.</p>
          <p>In addition, variable cost and margins this quarter also included a $52 million pre-tax charge on open soybean contracts. Let me give you some background on this. We utilize financial contracts to help manage the commodity price risk on our purchases. We have being using financial contracts for over 10 years and usually these gains or losses are fairly small in any given quarter. In the second quarter we took a mark-to-market charge on open soybean contracts due to the recent run-up in soybean commodity prices.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we have put in place financial instruments to minimize the negative earnings volatility. In our full-year earnings guidance, we're assuming that our variable cost excluding volume and currency impacts will continue to increase at about the rate we incurred in the second quarter, meaning we are anticipating full-year variable cost increases of about $2 billion pre-tax.</p>
          <p>Our base tax rate in the quarter was 22.7% versus 24.6% prior-year quarter, generating a $0.03 earnings per share benefit as shown on the waterfall. The lower base tax rate primarily reflects one-time tax benefits, and to a lesser extent favorable geographic mix of earnings. We expect the full-year base tax rate to be about 25%, creating about an $0.08 per share of headwind in the second half versus last year.</p>
          <p>Closing out the EPS variance analysis, the increase in fixed costs was $0.04 in the quarter, excluding the impacts of currency and volume. This equates to about a $50 million pre-tax increase on a $3 billion base of fixed cost in the quarter. Fixed costs as a percent of sales improved by 200 basis points to 36.6%. Our productivity programs again delivered savings that largely offset inflation and growth investment. We are on track to deliver $400 million of productivity programs in 2008 as one component of our commitment to deliver $1.7 billion in fixed and variable savings between 2008 and 10.</p>
          <p>Moving to cash and debt, our strong sales performance increased accounts receivable levels versus prior-year, resulting in higher net working capital at quarter-end. Our capital spending is on track to be about $2 billion in 2008. This plan includes growth investments in our higher margin, high return businesses. In general, our cash performance is following typical seasonal patterns.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 7, we are raising the lower end and narrowing our full-year earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.45 to $3.55, or 5 to 8% growth in 2008. Having earned $2.49 a share in the first half, this equates with a second-half guidance range of $0.96 to $1.06 per share, compared to $1.16 per share in last year's second half. After adjusting for the absence of asset sales of last year's second half of $0.04 and about an $0.08 headwind from the higher tax rate, we expect second-half segment pre-tax operating income will be about equal to last year. This assumes slightly lower volumes, higher ingredient costs, and continued pricing and productivity gains.</p>
          <p>We also expect the split between third and fourth quarter EPS to be about equal. The assumptions embedded in our guidance are firmly rooted in the new reality of our challenging environment: slightly lower volumes and higher raw material costs. They are also rooted in our proven capability to achieve continued pricing and productivity gains.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it over to Jim.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Jeff. Let's move to our Ag &amp; Nutrition platform on slide 8. You know, as I reflect on where we are as a company and in this platform, it underscores how uniquely positioned we are to combine seed, breeding and trait technologies, quality inputs, and sound farming practices to increase both the quantity and quality of food supply globally, and to really make a difference for economies around the world, and that we can deliver strong results along the way.</p>
          <p>We had a strong quarter. Our revenue for the platform increased $467 million, up 23% to 2.5 billion. The growth was across all units, with corn seed sales up 16%, soybean seed sales up 26%, crop protection sales up 21% and our nutrition and health sales up 34%.</p>
          <p>We now expect that for the full year 2008, Pioneer seed sales will exceed 4 billion compared to 3.3 billion last year, and our platform sales will exceed $8 billion compared to 6.8 billion last year.  Both will be sales records.</p>
          <p>Earnings for the platform grew 18% to $504 million.  This reflects strong sales growth across all products and regions, including both price and volume gains, partially offset by our ongoing seed investments in R&amp;D and sales and marketing, as well as significantly higher commodity prices. Marketplace fundamentals for growth are outstanding. Growers are investing more in technology to protect their crops and maximize yields.</p>
          <p>For the first half, we delivered 20% revenue and 20% earnings growth, well ahead of the 15% per year commitment that Tom outlined in March, and I'm pleased to say we now expect to deliver 20% PTOI growth for the full year 2008.</p>
          <p>I'm really proud of our team and the results they delivered. Let me share some of the details. Crop Protection delivered another impressive quarter and closed out the first half with record sales. High commodity prices supported demand globally and our growth was led by strong demand for fungicides in Europe, insecticide volumes globally and favorable currency exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Earnings were up substantially with pricing gains, volume growth, and solid fixed cost productivity gains all driving increased margins in pre-tax earnings. First half sulfur and urea herbicides sales were just over $600 million: that's up 17% from last year with more than half of the sales in new blends.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 9, Carl told you last quarter that Rynaxypyr sales were off to a strong start in 2008. That momentum has continued and we now expect to end the year at more than twice our original plan. Today, I'm also pleased to announce three key increases in our outlook for Rynaxypyr beyond this year. First, we're doubling our sales outlook next year to $100 million; second, we're increasing our peak revenue outlook by about $100 million to 300 million; and, third, we expect to hit that the peak revenue target by 2011, which is a year earlier than previously communicated.</p>
          <p>We were also pleased to learn recently that Rynaxypyr has been named one of the winners of the R&amp;D 100 award by R&amp;D Magazine, which is an award given to the top 100 new technology products for 2008 across industries. So clearly this is a very exciting product.</p>
          <p>Moving to our Seed business, 2008 the pivotal year for our Pioneer team with record sales in the quarter of $1.4 billion, up 21% from last year, driven by both volume and pricing. In North America we held market share in corn. That was a key milestone that we committed to over two years ago, and we grew soybean share about a percentage point to 24%. Overall, our seed earnings for the quarter were down modestly with our growth investments and higher commodity costs offsetting the earnings benefit of our revenue growth. However, to help make sure that you have the right perspective on the underlying business, without the $52 million mark-to-market charge that Jeff mentioned earlier, pre-tax operating income would have been up double-digits including our growth investments for the future.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some more context behind our results. Even with the shift of acres from corn into beans in North America, we achieved record seed revenue with strong market share, and double digit pricing increases for corn. Our biotech trade mix grew as we expected and help drive the net seed price increases. We hit all of our goals, total trade sales in corn were about 90%, soybean acreage and volumes were up as was price. Margin percentages were a bit lower primarily reflecting the significant and rapid run-up in commodity prices. The key takeaway, though, is that we hit all of our business goals.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 10. Earlier this month, we announced with the Y Series soybean launch that we will deliver a step change improvement in soybean yields and unprecedented volumes for the 2009 growing season. The entire line has demonstrated a 5% yield advantage against key competitor varieties with some of the Y Series varieties yielding 6 to 10% better yields than competitors. And what's really exciting is the increased value these products will deliver to our customers could be realized on up to 9 million acres next year. This is the largest product launch in the 82-year history of Pioneer.</p>
          <p>With the Y Series yield advantage, the projected volume and the potential acreage impact of these products will likely add about 19 million bushels of soybeans to US production next year. We've been saying for some time that we have the science to help address the incredible demand for agricultural commodities. No one else in the industry is bringing this kind of soybean yield improvement to the number of acres that Pioneer will this coming year. We fully expect the yield advantage and the large volumes of Y series soybeans will extend our industry leading soybean position and further expand the Pioneer share in North America soybean acres in 2009.</p>
          <p>These top performing new varieties were developed with our exclusive accelerated yield technology and they'll serve as a strong platform for the Optimum GAT trait. Which brings me to another exciting soy announcement we made last week, that the USDA regulatory approval of our Optimum GAT trait in soybeans. This milestone brings an innovative technology another step closer to farmers' fields.</p>
          <p>The Optimum GAT trait combined with our industry leading genetics and other complementary technologies will help soybean farmers maximize yields and give them a new level of weed control flexibility. In parallel with the Optimum GAT trait for soy we have four new exciting herbicide blend products under development, Freestyle, Traverse, Instigate and Diligent, designed to complement our Optimum GAT seed offering to deliver even higher value to a grower.</p>
          <p>I just got back from spending time with Paul Schickler, the President of Pioneer, and his North America sales team and I can tell you, they're fired up about the new line up for '09 based on having ample supply of leading technology, high yielding seed that farmers want.</p>
          <p>By the way some of you may be wondering whether the flooding this spring will impact our seed supply for next year. Actually our production acres were largely unaffected; in addition, we had already ramped up our production acres to ensure that we had full supply for '09. So we are in good shape for seed supply for 2009.</p>
          <p>Outside North America, we continue to extend our leadership position in our growing profitable business. In the quarter seed sales grew 23% and we closed out the first half of 38%, our key driver was our corn and market share gain in Europe. We grew share in competitive high-value markets. We were up two to three points in Italy, two to three points in Hungary, one point in France. We also captured strong pricing gains in Europe.</p>
          <p>For the remainder of 2008, we expect to see strong demand for our corn and soybean products in the southern hemisphere, continued strong oil seed performance in Europe, as well as a strong start to the '09 early-season sales in North America, Europe and China.</p>
          <p>So for the platform outlook, for the remainder of this year we expect double-digit top line growth at attractive gross margins. At the same time we will continue our growth investment plans in R&amp;D and sales in the second half to further strengthen our capabilities. We also will not have the $25 million gain that we disclosed to you in the third quarter last year from a contract termination payment. Bottom line then is we expect pre-tax operating income in the second half to be about equal to last year, which as I shared earlier will bring full-year pre-tax operating income growth for the platform to at least 20%, with all businesses expected to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth.</p>
          <p>I want to repeat what I said at the outset. We are uniquely positioned to combine high-performance seed, breeding and trait technologies, quality inputs and sound farming practices to increase both the quantity and quality of the food supply and to make a real difference for economies around the world. I look forward to sharing more good news with you at the Farm Progress Show in August. We are planning a half-day event for investors the afternoon of Tuesday, August 26 at our Johnston, Iowa offices, which are close to the show. So please look for further details from Carl and the IR team. I look forward to seeing you there. Carl?</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you, Jim. I will now cover our remaining businesses and then turn things back to Chad. Moving now to slide 11. Coatings and Color Technology segment sales increased 10% and earnings increased 9%. Platform margins were essentially flat with last year through good cost control, pricing gains, favorable currency and successful sales efforts. Titanium DiOxide sales were up modestly on flat global volumes and improved US dollar price. Volumes in North America were weak for architectural paint but, importantly, we achieved a third quarter of sequential price increases as well as achieved a price increase versus the prior-year quarter.</p>
          <p>Sales grew outside of North America driven by strong demand, particularly in Latin America, and higher US dollar prices. Due to these actions and aggressive cost controls, earnings grew modestly despite the weak domestic markets and higher raw material and transportation costs.</p>
          <p>Our performance coatings businesses delivered moderate sales growth and significant earnings growth. The results reflect the diversity of our coatings franchise and our ability to execute in these market conditions.</p>
          <p>Our industry-leading refinished paint growth with industrial paint growth coupled with OEM paint businesses' tight control on cost more than offset the pressure created by the weak auto market in the United States.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead for Coatings and Color Technologies, we expect modest second-half sales and earnings growth based on the favorable impact of pricing actions, continued growth in emerging markets and cost control efforts mitigating continued weakness in North American markets.</p>
          <p>From a product perspective. Our TiO2 business is operating at high utilization rates. As end users seek a reliable supply source, we expect coatings growth will be tempered by continued weak OEM markets.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 12 for Electronic and Communications Technologies. Sales grew 10% to 1.1 billion on higher prices and continued market strength. Earnings were 170 million in the quarter compared to 176 million last year. 2007 PTOI included a one-time $25 million pre-tax inventory evaluation benefit that we discussed with you in that quarter. Excluding this item, PTOI increased 13%, reflecting strong sales and good cost discipline.</p>
          <p>Photovoltaic markets were especially strong, along with continued demand in Asia for electronic components partially offset by weakness in US automotive electronics. For the second half we expect moderate sales growth, with continued strength in photovoltaics, <mark type="inaudible" /> packaging and refrigeration coupled with seasonally strong demand in the second half for electronics, but tempered by a potential slowdown in consumer discretionary spending. We expect earnings growth to be moderate excluding $28 million from a land sale in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 13 for Performance Materials. Sales grew 8% to 1.8 billion on stronger price, currency benefits and growth in Asia. Earnings declined 2% to 223 million. This platform faced some of the largest increases in raw material cost in the company this quarter and was able to offset them with pricing gains and benefits from currency.</p>
          <p>Volume declined 5% reflecting scheduled production outages and some softening in developed markets. The earnings decline reflects lower volume and currency-related fixed cost inflation. Given the recent dramatic run-up in raw material costs, we are pleased with this business unit's solid performance in a much tougher environment.</p>
          <p>For the second half, our expectation is for continued significant increases in ingredient and energy costs and continued softening in developed markets. We're responding to these conditions. Sales are expected to increase modestly driven by pricing actions. Earnings will be flat to down slightly on the lower volumes and a weaker regional sales mix.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 14 and looking at our Safety &amp; Protection segment. Sales increased to 1.6 billion, up 8%. Our pricing actions, particularly in chemicals, along with volume growth in emerging markets more than offset the moderate volume declines in North America. Earnings were 302 million, down 5% from the prior-year quarter and PTOI margin was 19.1%, lower than last year.</p>
          <p>The segment earnings and margin decline reflect a change in business mix versus last year. Significant earnings growth in the chemicals business was more than offset by the housing impact on volumes, less favorable product mix in Nomex Kevlar, higher raw material costs and growth investments. All businesses posted sales increases in the quarter, with the exception of Surfaces product lines. From a regional perspective the businesses delivered higher local prices and double-digit volume growth in Latin America and Asia. North American volumes were down.</p>
          <p>The outlook for second half anticipates moderate sales growth and moderate earnings growth. The half will benefit from 25% Nomex capacity expansion coming online in the later part of the third quarter, contract awards in Nomex and Kevlar, continued mix enrichment in our chemicals business as well as pricing actions associated with the recent raw material increases. Earnings will be tempered, however, by continued negative comps in the housing market, higher raw materials and Kevlar expansion-related growth investments.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our Applied Biosciences technology platform on slide 15. I'd like to provide a brief update on some key milestones in our efforts to address the pressing need for products and technologies from renewable resources. First, our biofuels programs. DuPont has two major initiatives, one in cellulosic ethanol and one in biobutanol. Two months ago we announced a joint venture with Danisco/Genencor to develop and commercialize an integrated cellulosic ethanol technology package. At that time we said this first pilot plant would be operational in 2009, a larger scale facility to produce commercial volumes by 2012. We are now in the final stages of siting our US pilot plant for this venture.</p>
          <p>As for biobutanol our technology development is progressing very well, and we have surpassed the incumbent ABE process in terms of conversion efficiency, a combination of rate, titer and yield. This is a major milestone for us on the way towards attractive process economics and a more efficient and sustainable process. Second in the area of biomaterials, we are nearing completion of expansion plants for Sorona polymer for Asia and the US and are on schedule for initial Ceranol commercial capacity this year. Additionally, our Sorona product continues to gain momentum in a variety of applications, for example with major apparel brands and retailers.</p>
          <p>Finally, in the area of biospecialties, our Omega-3 project has moved into the pilot plant phase and we remain committed to the timeline where we begin to realize revenues starting late next year. This will be the first time that Omega-3s have been commercially produced from an organism using the tools of applied biosciences and we are pleased that the manufacturing process is meeting the initial commercialization target that we set out. Recognize this is a small business opportunity for us but a major proof point in demonstrating more sustainable, highly differentiated offerings from renewable resources.</p>
          <p>That completes our segment review; I'll now turn things back to Chad.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carl. To conclude our presentation today. I would like to put our company's current performance and future growth in the context of four major changes we are seeing today. Please turn to slide 16.</p>
          <p>Specifically, there are three industries that over time and with adjustments will recover and revert to the norm. More importantly we see one that won't. We think of this as the new reality ahead and view the change as a catalyst for growth for our company that we've been planning for.</p>
          <p>First, the US housing market. While currently in a depressed condition, it will correct over time. We don't see the volume of new residential homes getting back to the 2005 peak of 2.1 million, new homes, anytime soon. But what is important to DuPont, however, is that new homes will be much more energy efficient and will focus more on protection for families. We think that demand for energy saving material and solutions for the construction industry is going to rise dramatically and therefore the value of the future market for DuPont is greater than today.</p>
          <p>This is the perfect position for DuPont and a suite of new and distinct products we are introducing for this market. Let me give you a few examples. First, DuPont stormrooms, the only in-home shelter reinforced with DuPont Kevlar to protect people in a tornado; our new <mark type="inaudible" /> system for the interior walls and ceilings of homes and buildings to store heat during the day and release it at night to reduce energy use; our expanding offering of barrier products such as the sealed attic system with DuPont Tyvek AtticWrap and increasing the installed R-value of the wall system with DuPont Tyvek ThermaWrap and DuPont Tyvek Silver; and future products to improve the lifetime and efficiency of <mark type="inaudible" /> silicon thin-film products. We see a terrific opportunity to have all these products become an integral part of new homes and also for remodeling existing homes.</p>
          <p>Let me go to the second industry, the US auto industry. While volumes are down in North America and there are variable impacts of this throughout the value chain, an auto industry will stabilize and start to grow. However, new vehicles will be smaller and much more energy efficient. At the same time, people will place more value on a safe vehicle. We are adjusting our capacity for current materials to this new reality, but more importantly, we are rapidly expanding our products to meet the new needs of this market.</p>
          <p>Our new Kevlar plants, which will increase our capacity by about of 25%, will start production in 2010, and we'll bring new Kevlar applications to automakers. In the past six months we've announced expansion of several lighter weight polymers, which will bring additional material options. Sorona, our new bio-based polymer, is being designed into multiple vehicles for the 2009, 2011 launch years. Internally, we've converted 22% of our DuPont US vehicle to hybrids on the way to 100% of the very best technology commercial available.</p>
          <p>The third area, the banking system, the current dislocations are underway and we at DuPont are not feeling any direct impact in terms of our ability to raise funds or our ability for our customers to pay us. We believe the banking system will recover and banks will place even greater value on doing business with companies that have a strong balance sheet and good cash discipline like DuPont. We'll continue to use the period of tighter credit as a time to perhaps an opportunity for acquisitions or otherwise opportunities that might not be available because of the environment.</p>
          <p>Now, finally, let me turn to the one trend which will not turn to the norm and that's everything that comes from the earth. For those resources that we did pump from or grow in the earth, we have reached a new norm, and will not revert to the past in terms of price and availability. Of course there will be short-term swings in the price, and that will be hard to predict. But over time, we see higher-priced natural resource are here to stay, reflecting increased global demand from these resources.</p>
          <p>This is another area where we had been focused for over five years with commercial payoffs. Jim Borel described our suite of new agriculture products that will make a step change improvement in agricultural productivity. Our cellulosic ethanol and biobutanol offer great promise, and we're <mark type="inaudible" /> with Danisco and BP respectively. I described earlier our photovoltaics and what a difference they're going to make in overall energy security.</p>
          <p>In 2006, we announced our 2015 goals that included doubling revenues from non-depletable resources to at least $8 billion and doubling our R&amp;D investment to produce new products that will reduce the load on the earth. I'm glad we started both those programs two years ago.</p>
          <p>So what does this really mean for your investment in DuPont? Turn to slide 17. Our 2010 accelerated growth plan to achieve a higher revenue and earnings growth rate is on track. We are not allowing the current conditions to offset our plans for at least 1.7 billion in additional costs productivity improvement, a major increase in growth rate of our agriculture and nutrition platforms, and significant step-up in revenue growth for emerging markets in our Safety and Protection platform.</p>
          <p>Our base programs are priced for value and <mark type="inaudible" /> have been in place since 2003 and they are building momentum every month. We now measure not just results from decisions our leaders make but the speed to implementation and delivery of those results. This paid off for us in the second quarter as you can see. We're even better positioned with the right suite of products to grow and return value in the next five years. We will continue to deliver performance that cannot be ignored.</p>
          <p>In closing, I would like to reiterate what Jeff said about the outlook for the second half. Slide 18: we're raising the lower end of our guidance to a narrowed range of $3.45 to $3.55 for the full year. This equates to 5 to 8% earnings growth in a much tougher economic environment. The exact pace of play for the economy and input costs are still highly dynamic and this raised guidance is a prudent step during this period.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. We expect share to increase on corn in North America, we think -- we've hit the inflexion point and we feel great about the line-up. So we expect it to start increasing, and as I mentioned earlier, we increased soybean share this year and we thought we're going to do with the Y series, next year we expect share to go up again.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. How do you see a flowthrough of the energy cost, crude and natural gas for you, given that typically DuPont has a little bit of a delay? What is used to happen historically?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sergey, thanks, this is Jeff. If you look at the first half, we have covered our raw material and energy cost increase with pricing and so we really got out in front of the curve there on our pricing and it's standing us in good stead. And as I said earlier we are going to be very vigilant on pricing as we go forward to make sure that we're keeping up with the raw material flowthrough.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Chad, the chemical industry has seen two large multibillion-dollar deals so far this month. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that the credit market dislocations may provide some opportunity. I just wonder if you could comment on the activity industrywide, and elaborate on DuPont's latest thoughts with regard to external growth over the next year or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. As we outlined in March, we believe bolt-on  acquisitions, particularly in Agricultural and Nutrition, Safety and Protection, and other selected places across the company, including in these fast-growing markets of China and India and undeveloped parts of the world, that we think are going to be very much available to us as this year plays out. And again with our good cash position, we're looking for those that are on-target with our goals. Look at our 2010 forecast where we're trying to accomplish, we'll be looking for acquisitions to add to that. We've been more of a net divestor over the last several years as we've cleaned up our portfolio and focused on higher-growth businesses. And so now we think the right time is to adjust for that. But again, we are not talking about some big massive acquisition, we think that would be very disruptive to delivering the consistent earnings power I think we show.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. All things being equal, energy prices are probably higher than you expected for the second half, and -- although and housing demand is probably lower; but you raised your guidance. So in general, in the second half what do you expect to be much better that's offsetting those weaknesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, we continue to expect some strong emerging market growth, continued pricing gains, and we will continue our productivity efforts. Those have stood us in good stead and we are going to continue those in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And for my follow-up, how many triples, domestic triple-stack acres in corn did you achieve, and what's the size of the rollout in Optimum GAT and soy in 2011, and why is it late?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the triples, we were about 30% this year as we've said, and we expect that to be, no issues going forward. I'm sorry, your other question was on Optimum GAT and soy? And that, we've just got the USDA approval. If I go back to the Y Series launch, first thing is, we've got great technology in this &#x2013; in that product line already. But we're going to bring out the Y Series and we intend to bring Optimum GAT in and integrate it into that line, so that we've got the best yielding, best performing varieties going forward from where we are. We're timing that to make sure that we continue to have leading soybean position overall.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just one big-picture question. When you talk about reversion to the mean in some of your, in some core businesses like housing and auto, how does that play out in practical terms with the management incentive changes that you have made recently to try to accelerate growth in earnings? I'm just curious, if we do experience a couple of years of subdued growth, how do you manage the <mark type="inaudible" /> incentive program through that period of the slump?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Mark, it's Chad. Great question. One of the things and the changes that we described for you back in March, <mark type="inaudible" /> of this year, is something we call a dynamic planning factor. We think that's kind of unique <mark type="inaudible" /> businesses. So we can uniquely incent people based on changing economic conditions. So if we do see a change, we don't find that people either get a windfall or necessarily lose all hope because there is no way to do it, we have that adjustment. We think we've got that balance across our units where it's very much in line with the shareholder now, because our performance stock shares are how we compare to our new frame of reference company on total shareholder return. So we believe we have management incented better to perform for the shareholder than I've ever seen in the company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Jeff, I was wondering, given the $2 <mark type="inaudible" /> on soybeans, will there be a favorable mark-to-market in the third quarter? And then for Jim, you mentioned the Y Series has some pretty nice yield improvement. Can you talk generally about what your pricing strategy is in the seed business going into '09, given the escalation in commodity prices over the last couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, this is Jeff. On your question on the hedge, you know we have put into place instruments to impact the negative volatility, I don't what, as we look forward, exactly what that hedge is going to do, but that's what we have done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, on pricing, couple of key things. First of all, we're bringing a lot of technology to the market and this is a market where farmers are really looking to protect and maximize yield and they're willing to pay for that. We price per value, so we're expecting prices to go up on the product line to reflect that value that we're going to be delivering. And so, in general we could anticipate important price increases, we're a price leader in soybeans and in corn I'd anticipate double-digit prices again in '09, based on where we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question is from Don Carson with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jim, a question on Optimum GAT. You just got your approval for soybeans, you're going to have relatively modest introductions over the next years. My question is on Optimum GAT in corn, I mean, do you feel more confident about regulatory approval, now that you got it in soybeans? And more importantly, is that going to be an elite germplasm from your initial launch in 2010? And maybe you could just describe with what scale that launch will be on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Don, we are on track for commercial introduction in 2010, we'll ramp up aggressively beyond that and, as we've said before, we expect to be largely converted by 2015. And the intent here is to bring Optimum GAT into corn with our &#x2013; as we bring out new leading hybrids. And so I can't size the acres for 2010 exactly, but it'll be commercial introduction and leading hybrids there, and it will be ramped up aggressively over the next several years beyond that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a follow-up on Optimum GAT, you described some of the new SU mixes you'll have for Optimum GAT beans. I know you've recently signed an agreement with Syngenta to get access to <mark type="inaudible" /> active ingredients for corn. What benefit do you see to the SU franchise from (a) these new mixtures, and (b) the introduction of Optimum GAT in both corn and soy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a real opportunity, Don, because first of all you know there are weed shifts and other things, you know, shoot, mother nature is at work, and Optimum GAT gives us the ability to put a range of sulfur and urea herbicide products in combination with other things that may be useful for the farmers, so we can really make sure we're getting the right products on the right acre. So it just opens up an important opportunity for us to make sure we're giving the farmer what they need, when they need it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks for the opportunity. I just had a question about the mark-to-market loss. You said that you are pretty much hedged for the rest of the year. Could you just talk &#x2013; provide a little bit more detail on that <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again we have used in our seed business for many, many years hedging tools. They are primarily used to help us manage the price risk on the commodities we purchase. Normally the gains and losses on those are small, but with the run-up in soybeans we had the negative 50 million that you saw. Going forward, to minimize that volatility we have put into place instruments that will minimize that negative earnings volatility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up to that, it appears that corn and soybean seed prices have come down fairly sharply in the last couple of weeks or so. Could there be a potential benefit, or just is it too early to tell?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Hi. Good morning, question for Jeff. The cash conversion of earnings lagged a little bit, cash flow from operations was negative in the first half. Can you just talk about that? And did you finance any purchases for the farmers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me take your first question. P. J., yes, cash flow from operations was negative, that's primarily due to the increase in working capital, which was primarily accounts receivable. You have seen the large increase in our sales and the success we've had on pricing. Obviously currency is a positive there too. So I can assure you that our days sales outstanding and our inventory days supply are under control and in line with where we would expect them to be. And as we make those collections, and as you know we're at the seasonal high here in terms of accounts receivable because we do not collect the ag collections until the end of the year. So we expect to be on target for our cash for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and just a follow-up on bio platform. What is your latest timeline on EPS impacts from your bio platform, your biofuels and biomaterials? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess the first one, P.J., that we mentioned today was late next year, the omega-3 program, we expect to bring revenues to the income statement late next year. All of the other timelines that we outlined for you at the November bio day here in Wilmington remain the same, on track. Significant income statement impact out about after 2010, out about 2012. And that's for the fuels program and the materials program. Materials program, though, as you know, is commercial today with Sorona and is in the capacity increase phase.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>P.J., it's Chad. As I said in my comments, this partner with Danisco around cellulosic ethanol, <mark type="inaudible" /> about to get to market. I have no question we have the best team, we've got the right pieces of technology, we are moving very rapidly towards the power plant to work. So, yeah. We see nothing in the environment except great demand for the cellulosic technology <mark type="inaudible" /> through from government <mark type="inaudible" /> consumers we're on our way. And I've worked with BP on biobutanol, I just could not be more pleased with the progress we're making. So we are not in a position to update the numbers we gave you in March, but we are seeing everything as kind of falling into place like we hoped.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I'm sorry, if we said we are in a divestiture mode, that was a mis-statement, that is not where we are. We are in an acquisition mode and we have no currently planned divestitures. I like this portfolio. We had a chance when we divested our fibers business, if there was anything we didn't see that was good long-term, I'd have thrown it in that mess and given it to Coke. So we are very happy with the portfolio. We will always be making small ups and downs, if we are not doing that every year, we'll not be doing the right thing for shareholders, but we like this mix of businesses.</p>

          <p>Steve, I would add to that, you know if you look back at the March 14th investor day we had in New York, we had a specific slide on key areas of interest that we might &#x2013; we hope to find some opportunities for in the acquisition area.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a couple of questions. First of all, Chad, with respect to biobutanol in Europe, recently there has been some pushback in Europe with respect to the economics of that area. You see that affecting your joint venture with BP?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have been to Europe in the last three weeks and met with a series of government officials from multiple countries. I think we have a very good fix on that situation and I know there is lot of politics around there, there's a lot of stuff in the press, but the government officials I have met with clearly see the value and particularly like the biobutanol piece. And my guess is there will be a lot of press back and forth until we have commercial products, but we still remain quite encouraged.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As a follow-up, with your pricing actions across the board, I would imagine you're perhaps doing a little more walking away from business. Is the weak volume growth of just 1% reflect DuPont's increased willingness to walk away from low margin business, and if so, do you see that continuing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That, Mark, and that's the primary driver. <mark type="inaudible" /> we'll continue to do that, that's primarily how we're getting our pricing up. I think the only place that that's occurring is frankly a little bit in our performance materials platform. And I would caution you that that volume decline you saw in performance materials is more related to this quarter. It's more related to the ethylene plant shutdown which was a planned scheduled maintenance shutdown.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I thought the majority of the cellulosic ethanol income was going to come in through royalties and maybe small minority interest in projects. So do you think we need to have profitability improve materially in the existing biofuels industry for those companies that want to either license your technology or take you in as a small partner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, as you've seen there's been a lot of press particularly in the last 90 days kind of entire ethanol via corn grain. We thing that's probably a bit overdone but remember ethanol is the commodity. And so what we're shooting for is a lower cost position, absolute, than could be achieved by the <mark type="inaudible" /> that's what we only described for you previously. Then we avoid that food versus fuel debate and we focus on a lower cost position and that's our goal. We haven't seen anything that we can't get to that goal today and of course we've described before a very logical step will be to take any of these grained ethanol plants that are out there today and convert them to the cellulosic feedstock. So we see this is the win-win-win position and we're getting a lot of encouragement from multiple governments including the one in the United States.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where do you think that capital for that investment will come from? Because if I remember right, I don't think DuPont was going to put a lot of its own capital into this growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if we are as successful as we could be, and I'm not predicting that today, we're going to need such rapid phase-up of this it just would not be smart for any one company to do it, capital and just capacity to handle that. So we must be operators of some plant, we've got to keep perfecting the technology and bring it out. But I think our step would be to license the technology as we've described before exact details of how to do that. We're just premature to get into it. But we're not looking for gigantic cash hole here from DuPont, where you've got to wait multiple years to get the cash back.</p>
