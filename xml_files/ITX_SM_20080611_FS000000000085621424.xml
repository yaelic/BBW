        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all the participants in this Webcast Conference Call regarding Inditex Results for the Interim Three Months of 2008. I am Pablo Isla and here with me are Antonio Rubio, our CFO, and Marcos Lopez, Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>The results for our first quarter 2008 represent a satisfactory start to the year against highly demanding comparables and in a challenging commercial environment in some markets. I would like to cover a few of the highlights. Inditex store sales have grown by 12%. Our expansion plans are on track. We have opened 145 stores in the first quarter of 2008. Operating expenses are tightly under control. Net income has increased by 10% year-on-year reaching &#x20AC;219 million or $0.35 per share. Additionally, let me note that the store sales in local currencies have increased 14% from the 1st of February to the 8th of June of 2008.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Antonio Rubio, who will provide some of the details behind the headline numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. To start, let me point out that against highly demanding comparables all the key lines of the profit and loss account show growth over the period. As we have mentioned sales in local currencies and constant perimeter have grown by 12% in the first quarter of 2008 against a comparable of 21% in the same period of last year. The quarterly reported figure is affected by a number of factors. The translation of sales in currency different to the euro has deducted two percentage points from reported sales growth due to lower exchange rates versus our reporting currency.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the agreement to franchise our operations in Venezuela at the end of the fiscal of 2007 has deducted 1% from reported sales growth in the quarter. The perimeter effect we'll annualize at the end of fiscal 2008. Thirdly, an early Easter period in March in 2008 versus the April in 2007. And finally, we have experienced significantly adverse weather conditions in Europe over April.</p>
          <p>In terms of gross profits in the first quarter, this line has increased by 11% to &#x20AC;1.3 billion. Gross margin on sales has reached 57.8%, 158 basis points higher than in the same period last year. Under current circumstances, the Group targets a gross margin for fiscal 2008 probably similar to that of 2007. Operating expenses have grown at 14% and include all the start-up costs for new openings. Let me remind you that the store openings over the fourth quarter '07 and first quarter '08, 294 have been higher than the 227 in the same period of the previous years.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are tightly under control as we continue to make progress in the implementation of our efficiency plans. Our working capital position at the end of the first quarter 2008 shows the effects of an early Easter in March in 2008, versus in April in 2007 and adverse weather conditions in April.</p>
          <p>Net working capital has reached &#x20AC;116 million of cost free financing in the period. From the end of the first quarter, the net working capital position is returning to normal levels. On the other hand, our cash generation capacity remains strong and our net cash position in the first quarter has increased by 16%.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Marcos Lopez, who will provide some of the details behind the performance of the Inditex concepts</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. In terms of the store openings, we are on plan, as we have opened 145 net stores in the quarter to reach a total of 3,836. Regarding the performance by concepts in the interim three months of 2008, let me tell you that Zara has outperformed the goals. The performance of the younger concepts has been consistent over the quarter with minor differences.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcos. As we announced to you last March, we expect space growth of 15% over 2008. 90% of total space added will be in international markets. Our plan is to invest around &#x20AC;1 billion over the period. Regarding the outlook for the risks of the first half, let me tell you that in the first six weeks of the second quarter comparable sales growth is according to management's expectations. Store sales in local currencies are growing by 14% from the 1st of February to the 8th of June of 2008.</p>
          <p>Inditex Board of Directors is proposing a total dividend of &#x20AC;1.05 per share for fiscal 2007, to be paid from the 1st of August. This dividend proposal increases shareholder remuneration by 25%. I would like to point out that since the introduction of our new dividend policy in 2005, the dividend has more than doubled.</p>
          <p>Before closing, let me elaborate briefly on a number of initiatives carried out by our concepts over the quarter and some selected store openings of recent months. Over the first quarter, Zara has expanded its ranges of organic cotton in all its sections, women's wear, men's wear and children's wear. This is the case in women's wear, where Zara is incorporating new collections of floral dresses to its summer ranges. Women's wear has also expanded its swimming costume collections in all its stores.</p>
          <p>In men's wear, Zara sport collections now include watches, leathers, trousers in bold colors and shirts in linen and organic cotton. Zara children's wear has expanded the space allocated in its store to its 0 to 24 months old collections with a new store layout. Pull and Bear's recent design and layout is now present in all the new stores worldwide, and will be seen in emblematic stores such as London's Oxford Street.</p>
          <p>Massimo Dutti Personal Tailoring now accounts for 15% of formal wear sales in the stores where it is present. Massimo Dutti is also opening its first store in Beijing over the coming months, being present already in Hong Kong and Macau. Further store openings for Massimo Dutti in China are already planned. Bershka has recently launched a new summer collection of Brazilian themes, Bershka in Rio. A Stradivarius new internally designed store image has now been rolled out to 60% of all its stores.</p>
          <p>Oysho has recently launched a new website that reflects its latest passions and personality into the web world. Zara Home has launched two new collections in white and ethnic lines to all its stores worldwide. Our plans to launch a new accessories format named Uterq&#xFC;e are on track. The first block of stores will be open in the second half of July.</p>
          <p>We see substantial growth potential for Uterq&#xFC;e in a highly fragmented market. We aim to open twenty to 30 stores over 2008. In terms of store openings Moscow's Manezh is a key retail hub at the heart of the city in the Red Square. A Zara store is now located in the main gallery. Khreshchatik is Kiev's most popular shopping area. A new Zara store has adopted its look to that of the imposing traditional architecture of the area. Our largest space of 1,900 square meters was chosen to house the first Zara in Ukraine.</p>
          <p>London's Canary Wharf has seen the opening of Zara, Massimo Dutti stores in covered place shopping mall. We are expanding our presence in Beijing with two additional Zara stores, Zara Xidan mall has opened already. Zara at Solana shopping center will open tomorrow and will be our third store in Beijing. It has more than 1,500 square meters of retail space over two floors, direct, straight access to the stores to the store opens in an impressive fa&#xE7;ade. We have also opened two very relevant stores in Japan, Tokyo Bay and Kobe Cosmopolitan.</p>
          <p>Inditex started operations in Korea last April, with two stores in Seoul's key locations Coex Mall and Young Plaza. We are opening five Zara stores in key locations of Seoul over the year. We see potential to expand Zara significantly in Korea over the coming years.</p>
          <p>We have recently expanded our presence in Boston, with two additional Zara stores. The first one is located as the heart of Newbury Street in a listed building in which all period details have been maintained. We have also opened another Zara store in the high traffic Burlington Mall.</p>
          <p>And this is all from us. We are now ready for your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. The first question comes from Mr. Robert Miller from Redburn Partners. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I ask about cost first of all. Can you tell us what the underlying cost increase was year-on-year in the quarter if we strip out the different impact of the pre-opening costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding costs globally what we can say is, what we have always said, non-regarding costs that. It's better to look at cost evolution on a yearly basis. But to look on a quarterly basis is not particularly relevant. What we can say about costs is that if you have in mind, first of all, that the number of openings as we were saying during the presentation, in the last two quarters has been significantly higher than in the comparable period of the last year, but also having in mind that globally space growth is 15%, I mean with 15% of space growth, cost growth to be 14% within that shows that we are managing very -- in a very significant way cost evolution.</p>
          <p>So, I think to try to disclose in one isolated quarter what is the impact of a start-up cost? I think the relevant figure regarding costs, in this case, is that space growth has been 15%, cost growth in the quarter is 14%. Adding to that -- that the space growth in the last two quarters has been above this 15% rate. Now so, -- but even considering the average space growth for the year, we think it's a very good cost evolution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But presumably the cost number did benefit from a negative translation effect as in the sales line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're extremely limited, nothing to do with the impact on sales. If you think about cost it's extremely limited.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It clearly means that like-for-like cost evolution is clearly below inflation and that we're managing carefully our growth regarding startup costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. And can I just ask also on the inventory position. I noted that last year in Q1 your inventory was up 21%. So it's not as though you are against a very tight inventory position last year. So there clearly is a bit more stock in the system. How much of that gross margin gain of Q1 do you expect to give up in Q2 in increased clearance activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Robert. As you know our inventory position in any concrete moment is a purely accounting figure and does not reflect properly the commitment of the company at some point in time. And therefore the quality of inventory management, our commitment is not changing significantly over the last year. And the concrete accounting, accounting data at the closing of this quarter is effectively to the earliest period in March, 1st of April and the best weather conditions being April. So, in this moment what we can tell you is that our inventory position and the working capital as a whole in May is returning to a normal position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So again, sorry, do you-- are you saying that you do not see a material markdown risk in Q2, or are you saying you've already cleared any excess stock in this first part of the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, we are not forecasting any significant change in the gross margin in the markdowns about the inventory position. No, no, not at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Pablo Molina from BBVA. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Pablo Molina. In a climate in which small independent retailers in Spain are closing and other medium sized ones are hurting like <mark type="inaudible" /> I think it's probably too soon for these, whether. Have you got any data about how markets are performing in Spain? And what level do you consider reasonable for the coming years? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I have understood well your question because you were speaking very, very fast. It was...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...Spain, now what is the consumption environment in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but actually what I am more concerned about is what -- how the market shares could react because obviously, all the other independent retailers in Spain are closing. And many medium sized ones are having lower like-for-like than yours. And I think that obviously this should have a positive effect in the medium-term in terms of market share. How do you quantify at what range could that market share go in the coming years? You are now close to 11%, at what level could that rate should be 15, 16?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have not quantified that at all. What we can say is what you were saying in your question, that the market in Spain remains very fragmented, that independent retailers continue representing 40% of the market. Our market share today is 11%. And we are sure that we can continue gaining market share in the Spanish market, particularly considering that when you think about our market share is a market share that is made through a combination of many different brands. So, Zara market share is high and a possibility of Zara continuing gaining market share for us is very clear. But we do not have any quantification as what could be this market share gain in the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Fraser Ramzan from Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just really a question, I'm sure you would expect to be asked this, but how did Spain perform overall in the quarter. I think you indicated at the six weeks stage that it was positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can say about Spain is that Spain's performance is slightly below the average of the Group. This is something that we were expecting, I could say. And this has been the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, because I think you said at the results that large chains were outperforming small chains et cetera. And I think the last caller indicated that do you still see that to be the case. I mean, it's obviously quite hard to tell from the industry data for Spain whether or not that is the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It continues being the case in the market that large retailers as we are performing better than independent retailers, now that we are gaining market share. But globally, we talk about our performance -- our performance in Spain from the point of view of sales evolution, this is slightly below the average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just coming back to the gross margin point, I appreciate you look at things on a full year basis and you expect, broadly flat gross margin. But if you don't have any real or you don't expect to have an inventory issue at the end of the second quarter and we consider where the currency is, why do you stick with such a conservative target for gross margin over the course of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because what is important for us is to manage the business on a yearly basis, and again we have provided guidance at the beginning of the year. But a broadly stable gross margin for the year and as of today nothing makes us change our view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I appreciate that but when you reported your full year results, I guess you already had a very strong view of where the first quarter would finish as a business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what do you expect to happen in the reminder of the year that will lead to a negative impact to the gross margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't expect anything different to what we expected when we talked to the market in April. The gross margin combination is made up of many different effects. You have to think in terms of currencies, in terms of mark-ups, mark-downs, seasonality. And in general you know that our view is to try to sustain a broadly stable gross margin for the year. Quarterly gross margins we believe may provide an erroneous look to the way we run our business. This is why we expect this broadly stable gross margin for the year as we were expecting it a couple of months ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally you did say in an answer to an earlier question that your commitment is not measured by your inventory level, which I think is a very good point. Where is your commitment, I guess, on a like-for-like basis relative to last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are anticipating overall, you're not anticipating much like-for-like growth then this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It -- this is, I mean, when we talk about the commitment and when we talk about our purchasing budget I think we were talking about this in the last conference call. We always have in mind for the purchasing budget and for the commitment, we always have in mind this year, but every year, every season purchasing commitment zero like-for-like sales growth because we'll have then flexibility and ability to react during the season. And also its part of our business model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Okay, that's great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have much more to do with our business model now than we say what we are expecting from the point of view because we want to have always this flexibility, this ability to react during the season. So we've been different. We think about, for example, today regarding our level of commitment for the autumn/winter season compared to the previous year it's very similar. Having in mind the assumptions, I mean, it's very similar as a percentage of the total purchasing budget for the Autumn/Winter season. But it is the normal way we manage the commitment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you would expect to be flexible over the year with your inventory in the face of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's the way we try to manage always our business, no, to have a low level of commitment at any particular point in time and to have the ability to react during the season month-after-month, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You look to our stores today, they are completely different than what they were one month ago or two months ago, no? Because we are permanently reacting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you're being -- or if your best estimate for the full year is 25.3%, why is it so much higher than last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One, we expect -- and the way we expect the tax rate to move that a number of corporate tax rates in different countries in Europe are falling. At the same time, a number of tax rebates are disappearing. So if the tax rate that we publish at the first quarter is the best estimate for the year probably over time you will see a slight upwards progression towards 28%. But many progressions over many years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then just a supplementary question on the gross margin. Could you split out the impact from currency, the benefit from the weak dollar that you saw in that 140 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In a quarter to disclose the different effects over 140 basis points is impossible. There are many effects and we never do that. I mean, again, what is important is for you to keep in mind that our estimate of gross margin for the full year remains to be broadly stable similar to that of 2007.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, you were mentioning a number of challenging markets in -- commercially challenging markets in your introduction. Could you comment on those other than Spain, which I assume to be one of those? And the other point, you were also mentioning that Zara has been performing better than the average of the other non-Zara formats. Are there any specific issues or any specific areas you would like to improve in any of those specific formats?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And lastly, in light of the results you have achieved so far in the current trading year-to-date, would you be reconfirming the guidance of plus 4% like-for-like growth for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, regarding a challenging trading environment, well I must note that this is something that we tend always to say no, because all the markets are very challenging because there is a lot of competition everywhere. So I mean, it's nothing new. What we can say about our global performance in the different countries in the different markets is what I was saying before that Spain is slightly below the average.</p>
          <p>Apart from that, we can talk about normal performance -- I mean normal performance in the different geographies. And this has to do with your second question, no? Because when we talk about that Zara is performing -- is outperforming inside the Group, of course, it has to do with the strength of Zara and how will Zara is performing and the success of the different collections that have been presented in the stores. But it also has to do because we are a very internationalized group. All our growth is -- most of our growth is international. We must note that 90% of our growth is international. But today, if we talk about the formats different from Zara, for those formats Spain is more relevant than for Zara. It also has to do with that.</p>
          <p>So it's not thinking about a specific issue in any of the format. It has to do more with the fact that as far as Spain is performing below the average and the weight of Spain is bigger in the format different from Zara then it has -- Zara is outperforming the rest of the formats. And regarding like-for-like sales growth, evolution for the year, what we can say is what we were saying during the presentation, that at this stage we do not see any reason to think about something different than our previous target, our 4% like-for-like sales growth target for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Richard Edwards from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. It was just a quick question coming back to that gross margin in the first quarter. I know you don't want to break it down sort of into each small component. But in general terms, was that gross margin increase driven by bought in gains or the changing clearance activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination of many things which I would like to disclose on a gross margin or a quarterly is impossible. There is bought in margin, there is markdown, there is currency, there are many things. But again, what is important over this short period of time is that we sustain in full our target to achieve a broadly stable gross margin for the year, which is the key target for the Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. What I was trying to understand was the gross margin up so much because you had a lot of stock, you just hadn't started clearing any of it in the quarter? That's why you stock -- I know you said April was difficult, but that's why your inventory was up so much at the end of the quarter. Was it a sense that it was just a deferral of clearance activity that's driven the gross up or were there more underlying matters behind it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. What I can tell you very clearly is that we have sustained in full our commercial policies. You know that we prefer to sustain the business model in full. Again, inventory does not reflect the commitment, which is something that we have discussed before. And what, I would say, is that on that field the company has remained trading as usual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. My questions have been generally answered, just one remaining. How much space expansion would you say you had in Q1 roughly inline with the number of stores or the 18% number of stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, the expansion in the quarter is going to be very much inline with the target we have for the year, the 15%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. It's Warwick Okines from Deutsche. Just referring to inventory, can I just confirm what you are saying? You're saying you don't have any more inventory at this stage of the year than you planned to have? Can I just confirm that's what you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. What we mentioned is that the commitment at this point in time is inline with what the company expected. The inventory as we have discussed before does not fully reflect the commitment of the company. So what I would say is that, on that field we are very much where we were last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you also just tell us if you're seeing any unusual levels of discounting in the Spanish markets at this stage of year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, what is important for the company is to sustain its commercial policies and this is what we are doing. You know that our model is based more on renewing the ranges frequently. And obviously, in terms of pricing you know that we prefer to operate within our pricing stability framework.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sure. I was asking more about the competitive landscape. Do you think any of your competitors discount more this time in Spain -- this point in Spain than last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we prefer to talk about what we're doing. And what we're doing is just to sustain our commercial policies in the current environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with the risk of you giving me the same answer again, could I just ask on gross margins? Are you expecting stable gross margins in H1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are expecting stable gross margins for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much, Marcos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Matthew Taylor from UBS. Mr. Taylor, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I have a question about the evolution of the sales so far this year. I mean, there's clearly been quite a volatile trend. It's about 17% after seven weeks, and I think we can deduce following seven weeks of about 5%. And then, most recently, in the last five weeks up sort of 18 to 20%. I appreciate your giving us a bit more information about the evolution of the trend this year. But is this a more volatile pattern than you've seen in previous years? And if that is the case, is that primarily related to the weather? Is it something to do with your comparatives? Or is it something to do with the timing of your space evolution? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it has, I think -- that the first comment would be that the shorter the period you take the higher the volatility could be, no?  If you look to sales on a daily basis then you see even there you can always see volatility. So, currently what we can say is that now we are talking about 4.5 months. So, when we think about total sales evolution in our 4.5 months period, it becomes -- it begins to be much more consistent. And thinking about what has been going on this year, it has to do of course with the weather, as you were saying, in April and we were saying during the presentation. It has to do with Easter. This year it has been more than one month before than it was the previous year. So, particularly at the beginning of the year taking short periods of time there could be differing elements that could have -- say volatility impact. Now, what we think is that currently we are talking about more than four months into the year and then the figure begins to be more consistent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the volatility this year is actually not really different from prior years? It's just that you've given us more information so we can track it a little bit more closely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you begin to talk about this, you -- you have probably in mind a very short period of time there could be this volatility. And particularly at the beginning of the season we based, which is very relevant -- they expect to take place in one month in April or to take place in March. I mean, it's very difficult to compare probably until you have of a 4 or 5 or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...even better, as we always say, the full season, no, to see really how things are going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And can I just clarify on the gross margin in terms of -- I know you've been very clear, but just a further clarification, in terms of your guidance for the year of stable gross margins that is on the basis of the stable currency backdrop, isn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, it's combining all the different effects in the gross margin, because it's not only currency what is in the gross margin. We're talking about also markups, markdowns, discounts, fashion mix et cetera, et cetera. So for us the gross margin, and you know this is our general rule, is our pricing policy tends to be stable, is to try to achieve a broadly stable gross margin. The main focus of the company is to provide like-for-like growth and also to expand space, but around 15%. So in this taking into account all these features you see why we are talking about the broadly stable gross margin for the year as the main target for management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are putting a lot of emphasis on this yearly gross margin that, as Marcos was saying, right now you must have in mind that this is, I would say, the target of the company or the expectation of the company for this year but also for the medium-term, long as it has been the case in the last years, no? So, I mean, what we are meaning with this is that our target remains the same, but for this year, for the next year, so to maintain the stability of our gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, I understand that. It's just that when you indicated as you did at the last set of preliminary results, you did say should currencies remain at the current level -- consider this a stable gross margin. Obviously, there have been significant currency movements. So when you're talking about a stable gross margin for this current year, I'm assuming that there could be some movements based on currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we always think about currencies remaining at the level in which we measure...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. That's fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We also must have in mind that what we always say, that 50 basis points above or below for us is a stable gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood, yeah. Thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentleman. I've got a couple of questions. First of all, can you confirm whether operating cost OpEx will grow at the same or slower rate than sales this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's our target and it has not changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that's your target. And given what's happened in the first quarter where you're a bit behind target you still think you are going to be able to achieve that, do you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's our target and we are not changing the target, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, second question on this debate about inventory and commitment, et cetera. I note from looking at your historic stock cover, you have gone up from 75 days of stock to 95 days, year-on-year. Just a couple of things. First of all, you sort of say that you shouldn't look at just the inventory because that's not the full extent of what you are doing. I understand that. But actually 95 days of stock is quite a lot of stock. And it justifies some explanation. I just wondered how much of that extra twenty days is down to the seasonal effects you are talking about? And on that sort of basis how many days are you running with at the moment? That's the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we don't run the company on an inventory basis as we have discussed. We do it on a commitment basis. Because as you mentioned the inventory figure maybe in part impacted by the, let's say, the moment you take -- you make the photograph of that. And this is why for us what is important is to manage the commitment. The commitment at the point in time is broadly similar as it was last year. So to look at the flexibility of the company in terms of inventory days is not the right way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But twenty days extra of inventory is a lot of extra inventory. And the absolute figure 95 days is pretty big for company that purports to have a high stock turn. In fact, it doesn't look like a high stock turn to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But again, inventory numbers can vary substantially. If you look at inventory over the first quarter of two years ago again the growth was quite a strong as well. And at the end of the day inventory is not the important figure to look at. It's the commitment, and this is what we have mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much for that answer.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning. First question is just wondered if I could drill down on a few of your markets apart from Spain. Wondered if you could comment on the performance in Italy and France in the first quarter and whether you managed to achieve a positive like-for-like sales figure for both of those markets, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, the general impression that I can give you is that the trading in these markets has been according to management expectations, no big change. We do not provide like-for-likes on a geographical basis. But I would say that trading has been normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so you are happy with your like-for-like sales performance in Italy, for instance, in recent months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are -- I would say that we are satisfied with the fact that from the 1st of February to the 8th of June, our sales in local currencies are growing by 14%. Yes, I'll say that. And that the second quarter has started according to management expectations, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Thank you. Just on that, Marcos, or some sort of following on from that. You have obviously given some more information on sales trends on a cumulative basis which is very helpful. But I just wondered on the basis of comparison in the second quarter, I'm just trying to get more of a sense of the underlying sales trend. In the second quarter, I think the last year you were running with a like-for-like around 7%, something like that. And I just wondered if in the second quarter last year was the base of comparison much easier in the first part of the quarter or was it roughly stable during the second quarter last year?</p>

          <p>Well, you know Richard, that we prefer to look at the season and it's true that over of the whole of the first half we have a very demanding comparable 21% growth in local currencies. This is why we believe that this 14% growth as of today is quite remarkable taking into account the comparable, the calendar, especially the Easter, early Easter this year, and also a situation in some markets. So, we prefer to have a look at the global picture. And within the global picture, I would say that the season so far is according to management expectations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But obviously apart from probably some pent up demand coming through in May, there's no other effects that are giving you a sort of boost in the first half of the second quarter this year?</p>

          <p>In fact, in this business, you need to have the right product for the right customer at the right time. So, to think that the customers are going to wait for your product to arrive, I believe, is not the way you said --</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right. For the sun to come out. But -- okay. That's fair enough. And just finally then on one of the other formats &#x2013; Stradivarius. I mean, that's obviously your highest margin, highest return on capital format and the number of openings in the first quarter is down on last year. I presume that's a sort of timing issue, is it, rather than sort of a conscious decision to open fewer Stradivarius stores?</p>

          <p>And the next question comes from Mr. Warwick Okines from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. It's actually Rod Whitehead from Deutsche. There is obviously a lot concern about the outlook for Spain and Spanish consumer spending and so forth. If things get tougher over the next year or two, how would you respond to that? I mean, I imagine you'll keep a broadly stable gross margin. But would you reduce openings? Would you reduce costs? Or would you -- is there really nothing you could do, and you just accept lower profits in Spain for period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say that regarding openings, as I was saying before, 90% of our space growth is taking place internationally. This is something and it was the case last year. So our strategy has always been to grow internationally and it remains the same. Regarding costs, we are always trying to manage costs at every level inside the company in all the different geographies, in all the different countries. And then thinking about, regarding Spain, I would answer the same as regarding any other market &#x2013; to have the best product at the right time, at the right price, to continue with our business model, the flexibilities in the new environment, price per week  to all our stores. I mean, I think the strength of our business model makes a big difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you are saying you wouldn't change the amount of space you're opening in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Spain, we are opening -- the amount of space we are opening in Spain is very low compared to our total space growth. It's -- this year it will be 10% of total space growth. I mean, it has to do with a few new shopping mall developments. It has to do with very specific situations. So, most of our space growth is taking place internationally.</p>
