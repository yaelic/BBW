          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the ASML 2007 Fourth Quarter and Annual Results Conference Call on January 16, 2008.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig DeYoung.  Go ahead, please, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator.  Good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  This is Craig DeYoung, Investor Relations at ASML.  Welcome to our investor call and webcast.  The subject of today's call is ASML's 2007 fourth quarter and annual results.  Hosting this call today are ASML's CEO Eric Meurice, and CFO Peter Wennink.</p>
          <p>I'd like to draw your attention to the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation, and you can find our press release and presentation on our website at www.asml.com. The length of the call today will be 60 minutes. Now, at this point, I would like to turn over the call to Eric Meurice for a brief introduction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Craig.  Good afternoon and good morning.  Thank you for attending our results conference call.  As it is now our habit, in our quarterly conference calls, we will split the introduction in two parts.  Peter will start with a review of our Q4 financial performance, with added comments on our short-term outlook.  I will complete the introduction with a longer-term view.  And following the introduction, we will open up to &#x2013; the call for questions. Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone.  First of all, I would like to review our annual and Q4 results highlights. As such I am pleased to report that the quarter developed as we had anticipated.  Q4 revenues were 973 million, nicely within the band of sales that we achieved in the past six quarters. The strong fourth quarter results leads us to a record high net sales of euro 3.1 &#x2013; sorry, 3.8 billion for 2007, which is up 6% versus 2006 net sales, being in line with the revenue growth guidance given by us in the earnings call this time last year.</p>
          <p>A 40% gross margin and operating expense of 186 million resulted in the operating margin on the quarter of 21.6% versus 22.4% in Q3, and that reflects our increased R&amp;D spend in Q4 which is <mark type="inaudible" /> total amount of 129 million.</p>
          <p>Cash from operations was 72 million in Q4 and 670 million for the total year. We ended 2007 with around 1.3 billion in cash. Some of the significant events impacting our cash balance during the year were the inflow of 600 million euros resulting from our inaugural euro bond and an outflow of 200 million euros for acquisitions, and distributions to our shareholders in total of about 1.4 billion euros.</p>
          <p>Through 2007 the number of outstanding ASML shares decreased from 477 to 436 million, that's a reduction of 41 million shares.  And consistent with our policy, we will maintain a target for cash reserves of between 1 and 1.5 billion.  We will complete the existing share buyback program for 14 million shares, 9 million of which were already acquired in 2007.  And we will continue with our commitment to return to shareholders cash generated above our cash balance target.</p>
          <p>ASML's order backlog as of the end of the year remained essentially flat at around 1.7 billion, which included 89 systems with an average selling price of 19.1 million.  For comparison, the ASML backlog at the end of September 2007 was valued at around 1.8 billion, which included 90 systems with an average selling price of 19.7 million.</p>
          <p>Orders booked in the fourth quarter: they served in large part the intent of our memory customers to move to new process nodes in NAND flash and in DRAM production. Twelve new orders for immersion tools were placed by customers leaving the year-end immersion backlog at 54 systems.  Interestingly, near equal numbers of ArF and KrF based systems were ordered in Q4, that is to support the expansion of leading-edge production.</p>
          <p>Next to the memory segment, that I think again will have to weigh in the ordering in Q4, was that we booked a significant number of tools by our IDM customers.  As in the previous quarter, we saw again a low level of orders from our foundry customers, while we continued to see that factories run at the highest overall utilization in the last 15 months, and the 8% foundry level in our order book is the lowest percentage with -- on record at ASML.</p>
          <p>We expect to ship 50 units in Q1 2008 with an average selling price of 16.3 million.  And although the market has recently been nervous, we still expect very healthy sales level for Q1 of above 900 million euros, that's on the back of the strength of technology transitions by flash memory and DRAM customers, making this by the way, the first quarter of 2008, the eighth consecutive quarter with sales above this 900 million euro level.</p>
          <p>Regarding Q1 bookings expectations, we acknowledge the potential weakness due to the global economic sentiment and that this indeed will cause our customers to take a prudent view on capital expenditures for the time being. They will likely await more positive market signs before confirming significant numbers of new orders.</p>
          <p>However, I think ASML's backlog at the end of 2007 reflects some of the current market trends and supports a strong first half.  Number one is the backlog at 89 units of close to 1.7 billion euros, 80% of which is deliverable in the first half.  Secondly, immersion technology represents 60% of the euro 1.7 billion backlog, being 1 billion of expected immersion shipments in the first half -- sorry, there is 1 billion of total immersion in the backlog.  And thirdly, we have &#x2013; we see solid IDM demand of approximately 440 million, that is 26% of the backlog, which we think underpins the non-memory portion of the backlog.  And fourth, there is &#x2013; we have a fairly limited exposure to the second tier DRAM customers, that being only approximately 200 million euros in the backlog, most of which are technology-driven.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we still remain positive about our market opportunities this year in view of the large immersion technology needs, the high level of capacity utilizations specifically at our foundry customers, and the relatively low level of semiconductor inventory and based on the independent IC unit growth forecasts.</p>
          <p>So now, I would like to turn back to Eric to the longer-term view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter.  Peter has highlighted ASML's record revenues and net profit for 2007.  Indeed, we ended 2007 with a 6% increase in revenues and finished the year with a net profit of 18.1% of sales, which is a record profit on record sales.  We also marked a return on invested capital of about 50% &#x2013; 49.7% for the year which is also a fairly commendable performance.  This has been no small achievement in the environment of accelerated technology demands and fierce competition.  We've been able to increase our market share further to our estimate of about 65% for the year 2007 from 63% in 2006.</p>
          <p>However proud we might be of our accomplishments this past year, we must now look obviously to 2008 and beyond.  For 2008, and as Peter discussed, we are currently operating in an environment of overall global economic uncertainty, which has led to significant adjustments over the past few weeks in different industries.</p>
          <p>In these uncertain times, I would like to emphasize, however, ASML's privileged position.  First, ASML operates as a pure player in semiconductor lithography, which is a market which has become much less market cycle dependant as two mechanism compensates for each other.  In boom times, demand for lithography is fed by the need for trailing-edge technology capacity, and in slower times demand for lithography is dominated by leading-edge technology needed to achieve the cost levels and the access to new markets required by customers.</p>
          <p>We again confirm that this mechanism is currently in action as 60% of our large backlog is covered by leading-edge immersion product, which compensate for the slower trailing-edge capacity orders.  This is point number one of our privileged position.</p>
          <p>Point number two regards growth capability.  ASML's privileged position in this case is related to the overall lithography market's significant long-term growth potential supported by technology evolution roadmap of the semiconductor manufacturers and the accelerating need for and cost of leading-edge technology.</p>
          <p>Competition, first of all competition in the DRAM market has caused dramatic falling of DRAM prices.  In response, leading manufacturers are acting with urgency in choosing to pursue device shrink for lower cost to the 5x nanometer litho node and ramping months before their original plans while retiring -- this is an important point -- while retiring older 200-millimeter capacity. So that is one of the drivers of growth.</p>
          <p>Second driver of growth is the NAND manufacturers who are continuing on their aggressive pursuit for higher density to lower the cost of the device, but also to address their expansion into markets with increased bit density.  It involves adding production capacity at the 5x nanometer litho node, but also in parallel ramping production volume at the 4x litho node.  That is the second engine of growth.</p>
          <p>Third engine, the foundry manufacturers, which haven't been pursuing a lot of capital expenditure in the past two years are starting to see volume increase in their leading edge 65-nanometer nodes and are starting to enjoy very good utilization rates.</p>
          <p>And the fourth point which drives growth is that we believe that the new technologies required for the future already in 2008, but significantly in 2009, will require a significant use of lithography as double patterning the technology of choice will increase the number of processing steps.</p>
          <p>So as I said, one, privileged situation because of the fact that the market is becoming less cycle dependent.  Two, that the market is overall sitting on a growth trajectory.  And three, ASML operates a winning business model enabling further growth.  By leveraging its size, in particular its R&amp;D budget potential and its enormous know-how accumulated for now seven years on a differentiated product platform, the TWINSCAN, ASML is able to achieve above-average market share in the leading edge lithography market segment, which I said currently is the one growing very fast.</p>
          <p>Indeed, we expect to potentially double our sales of immersion technology in 2008 in comparison with 2007.  Our immersion products are the industry standards now.  After having shipped 35 immersion systems in 2007, we now carry 34 XT:1900i products unit backlog in 2008.</p>
          <p>We have now had more than 8 million wafers processed on our immersion platform, up from 3.5 million in the last quarter.  These systems are running consistently at production levels, about 2,100 wafers per day and per tool. This is creating a significant experience base for the customers transitioning into production.  We have 20 customers with active immersion manufacturing or process development programs in place.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, as we consider ASML long-term trajectory for growth and its cycle robustness, we confirm our optimism for the development of our market position in 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Now, Peter and I will be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&amp;A session. But beforehand I'd like to ask you that you kindly limit your question to one with one short follow-up, if necessary.  This will allow us to get in as many callers as possible.  And operator, if we could have your instructions and the first question, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Of course. Thank you, sir.  Ladies and gentlemen, we will start the question-and-answer session now.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Today's first question is from Simon Sch&#xE4;fer.  Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, that's Goldman Sachs.  My first question would be, you talked about the 200-millimeter capacity retirement in the DRAM industry.  I was wondering whether you could share with us how many facilities you thought were being retired and what type of timeframe you are looking at there.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is a very precise question.  To this precise question I may be forced to go for a precise answer unfortunately.  So at this moment, these are projects and they are being discussed with different customers and we are at this very moment working on four major 200-millimeter DRAM retirements, four fabs, not four...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood.  Thanks for that detail.  My second question would be, what percentage of your order book is with your top three customers now and how does that compare to let's say six months ago or so or nine months ago or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do we have the data easily?  We are looking for the exact data.  I am going to try to answer you with the trend at this moment.  As usual in the first half of the year the flash activity will be higher than normal because this is when flash over invests in the full year, they, how do you call this, they frontload their investment and therefore you would have a significant portion of the flash vendors of the world.  Now, because there are more flash vendors in which we participate, if you feel my drift, that probably reduces the percentage of business that we used to have on our top customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it still, is there any way we can quantify the percentage number or should I call in later?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think Simon if you call in later we can get that for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Nicolas Gaudois.  Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>UBS, and apologies for a pretty bad voice today.  Just a first question on your degree of uncertainty on orders in Q1, and you not confirming anything.  Should we attribute this pretty much solely to the some of the upper one DRAM makers and maybe a couple of others being still very cautious in the ordering pattern, or if anything having stopped ordering activity for capacity or is there anything else as well contributing to your degree of uncertainty in the near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, obviously a good question. First point is that I want to repeat and I will repeat, and I will repeat again, we have said 10 times that we are trying to avoid to guide on bookings because of the complication of the timings of bookings and sometimes, we will give you a hint about up, down or etcetera depending on whether it is obvious that we have enough data to document these things. Today, as we have done two or three times, we don't have enough data and we clearly have an uncertainty. The uncertainty is based on the fact that we've had the first batch of, I would say, flash orders, which are the obvious ones, as I said at the beginning which force us to prepare deliveries for Q1 and Q2, which is one of the reasons why we said H1 is going to be robust. And therefore, in Q1 timeframe that's when we receive the orders of the next batch of customers, which includes the DRAM large ones, the foundries, IDMs and DRAM of, I would say, second tier.</p>
          <p>I would say at this moment we are fairly comfortable about Logic segments, where we think we know as usual what's happening and so there is a run-rate of some sort. But on the other side of the equations, the other segments, three segments that I mentioned, you do have a question mark about which technology, how fast and what is the impact of the overall economy on my decision for CapEx.</p>
          <p>You see in this obviously yesterday with the announcement of Samsung, which sometime ago, in I think in December timeframe, they mentioned that they may go down in CapEx. And you've heard them yesterday say that they would be stable or a bit high &#x2013; higher. This is obviously a decision made and I think they underlined this, DRAM, which requires a bit more thinking about which DRAM you are making in terms of designs, which DRAM you are making in terms of integration, and therefore, which DRAM you make in terms of technology. So there is significant amount of technology question and significant amount of how much CapEx you can really afford and when.</p>
          <p>Obviously, I repeat, the reason why we said we are uncertain is because the world is uncertain about exactly how those numbers will pan out. But what we've correlated as we usually do is, notwithstanding when they take decisions, is what are their needs and this is where our optimistic &#x2013; our optimism comes back. We are confirming the needs, that is, we know that there is an acceleration of DRAM towards the 5x or 6x technologies, that requires a lot of machines. We know that foundry reaching their level of utilization that is not sustainable any longer and we know the second tier DRAM vendors, who obviously are worried about price and things, still have to go and make some technology transition, of course laggard, but we will call them capacity, but for them it is technology transition. So we know these things are happening. And if they are sustained by a simple growth of 10% or so unit &#x2013; unit of semiconductor, then there is growth in 2008, which will force those bookings decision to be taken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And a quick follow-up. If I look at your indication on the immersion revenues, which could nearly double, I get to about 1.8, 1.9 billion euros of immersion revenues for '08 potentially. What will this do to ASPs of all in '08 trend-wise versus 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do expect &#x2013; you know, where we have been good and the reason why we have been, I would not say recession-proof, because this is a too strong word, but pretty stable at managing different situation is, we do manage different scenarios, Nicolas. So we have a scenario where a lot of people will start double patterning a bit earlier than the first quarter of 2009; that will require major immersion. We have other scenarios where spacing comes in and then we are going to go for much more what we call trailing edge. So answering your question is significantly difficult at this moment.</p>
          <p>We are comfortable that there is square meters of silicon. We are comfortable that the square meters of silicon will be handled by an ASML machine for good reasons. But it is difficult to know if it will be 1 1900 or 1 ArF and 1 KrF at this very moment. I'm talking by the way about second half of the year. The first half of the year is very clear because we know the technology that is being required and which is being ramped at this moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is going to be up, so ASPs are going to be up in that <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on average it's going up, but how much is like difficult.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, it's Merrill Lynch. Thanks for taking the question. My first question would be on the leasing arrangements for tools given the financial constraints we seem to be seeing from the second tier DRAM players. Are you seeing any acceleration in a move towards leasing tools to those sorts of vendors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and I am going to be very short on that. That's the case and that's because leasing companies are trying to engage with us to see how residual values in the end can be effectively managed. So, we are aware of many opportunities for leasing companies to get engaged with semiconductor companies and I think we've seen a quite significant increase in the activity clearly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. And then just as a follow-up: you've talked in the past about the flexibility of your OpEx and given the sort of uncertainty we are now facing at least through the first half order levels, what sort of criteria do you sort of look out to discern whether you scale back OpEx, because I see you are guiding to maintaining very high levels of R&amp;D into at least the early part of '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the early part of '08 is we say also covered by what we call a robust level of sales and that is basically covered by the order backlog situation. So, in that sense that's perfectly in line with what we have said in earlier quarters. We have about 30% flexibility in R&amp;D and about 10 to 12% flexibility in SG&amp;A, which we can call basically within a quarter. And we would be calling that and we've said also that in the past where we cannot sustain our sales levels. Now, as Eric pointed out earlier, when we look at 2008 and even at the modest IC unit growth looking at the utilization rates of especially our foundry customers' relatively low inventory levels, the need for advanced technology transitions, we do not believe that 2008 is going &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> going to be a year where we will significantly call upon that flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Okay, that's great. Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, JPMorgan. Good afternoon. Could you guys expand a little bit on your thoughts on the foundries; you said something about the 65-nanometer utilization finally coming up. And with seemingly every IDM in the US and Europe going fab light, at some point you can &#x2013; you would expect that the foundries have to do something for Logic capacity expansion. And then the second question is, did your market share in i-Line and KrF up or down in calendar '07 and when do you expect your high-throughput KrF tool, and please reiterate the model name of that if you could, start to ramp significantly? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Jay, regarding the foundries, yes, obviously they are becoming more important. SGI, Freescale, ST and HP are now going to use them more and more often. At this moment, however, as you noticed, we still haven't received significant orders in foundry and they only represent about 10% of our backlog or something and have been fairly slow for, I would probably guess two years. So obviously something has got to happen and you know that significant numbers of analysts now and colleagues in the industry are saying that they are reaching a level of good utilizations and need for capacity, which as I have mentioned as being an upside.</p>
          <p>But they are managing their business very well and they will move only at the moment where they clearly see that the top line is moving. And as long as they can still squeeze efficiency out of their fab, they will be doing and this is what they do. Now, obviously we have started to see some requests for short-term orders and that is being processed at the very &#x2013; currently, in the quarter. So, we start seeing the first signs.</p>
          <p>Regarding our market share in i-Line and KrF. I think in i-Line, the numbers are big enough that I could say yes, we have increased the market share significantly and I guess we would be able to give you the numbers in one of the -- three weeks from now they will be public, I guess.  So, three, four weeks. KrF, I am not 100% sure, because I don't have the data, but I think it has been improved and the machine called the XT:1000 which is high-throughput and high NA machine is as planned due for July, I guess it is, and that has not changed.</p>

          <p>Okay, we go to &#x2013; the next question is from Timothy Arcuri. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Sreeni calling for Timothy Arcuri from Citigroup. My question is, basically on the overcapacity that you had talked about last year, you were saying that the overcapacity would end in the fourth quarter. But if you listen to the Samsung conference call, they were saying that the overcapacity in DRAM might last till the first half of this year. So have you done any adjustments to your model and when do you think overcapacity in DRAM and NAND would be alleviated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This is a very good question and which leads me to explain a bit more the terms that is being used in the industry. I think we are very compatible with what Samsung says, it's just the terms. In business of memory, DRAM, or flash, in fact there is no overcapacity per se because every players having fab of memory would run it 100% and then would be able to find places to sell. So, quote unquote, it is not an overcapacity per se because they don't stay in inventories anywhere, they are being dumped and the machines are being working on and people are developing those chips. So there is never an overcapacity.</p>
          <p>Now what we all call overcapacity is whether you have too much capacity or not enough capacity at a given price level. So whenever somebody talks to you about his model, you would have to ask which price level are you talking about. And when we put our simulation tool here in ASML, we put the price level of the beginning of the year: so we say imagine that the price level stay as it is, days overcapacity or under-capacity to it, which in other terms means if you have overcapacity that means you are going to have a price reduction. If you have an under-capacity you have &#x2013; going to have a price hike.</p>
          <p>So Samsung's message is very similar. They basically think that the price will be remaining under pressure for another six months, which is their point and I think we agree with this. And we also agree that &#x2013; from what we have seen a significant, in fact, under-capacity or a possibility for price to go up in the second half, in particular, in view of the technologies it is being moved. I can't give you much more detail but there is a mix activity at this moment in DRAM which will favor value to volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have just one other question. When you said you have some percentage of uncertainty, could you quantify like the percentage of uncertainty in your bookings in the first half and perhaps the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The percentage of uncertainty. It has two facets, one is mix and one is volume. As I said to Nicolas at the beginning of the call, we are a bit unsure about which technology some customers are going to go for high volume on and some others and this is still being discussed. So, there is a significant risk of the ASP range and the numbers of units. We may come up with much more, say a trailing edge and less immersion or vice versa, doesn't change too much about the whole picture because the margin is not that significantly different. So that there is &#x2013; part of the uncertainty is here.</p>
          <p>The other part of the uncertainty is a unit but it's really based on the timing issue. What my worry is all about is, if the type of activities as we see today in Wall Street and everybody discuss about whether there is a recession or not, etcetera, you can always &#x2013; in any business, you can always decide to delay the decision by one, two or three months, it's not going to impact anything. So, PO is very much delayed. Now, in our industry we usually know these things, and I'm going to be very clear, even if we don't have a PO, there is definite working together with customers about preparing things because the lead times are so long. So, yes, we're concerned about which &#x2013; situation where a purchasing agent would say, well, I haven't received the go ahead by the big guys, we will receive in a very short lead time and we know you guys have nine months lead times, so, we will have to find a way to deal.</p>
          <p>So, these are the type of activities that can happen and as regularly happen by the way in the foundry business. And it's happening any time in the business as it is today where everybody says all the Americans consumer going to buy more or less etcetera, and obviously every foundry who, by the way have lost more and more of the visibility of the customers because they are now doing business for TIs etcetera, etcetera, who have also a set of customers. You've got so much uncertainty in the line, but as I say, at the end of the day it's only the needs that count. And if you plug into your program that you would expect about 10% PCs gross, you're going to discover that you need a lot of lithography tools, no matter when the booking comes in, we have to be ready and we don't intend to lose market share, if you know what I mean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What Eric basically said is, there is a weaker correlation between the time that we get an order and the time that we ship the tool, and that has do with the fact that we anticipate, because of very narrow agreements we have with customers on that technology road map when they need certain tools. And you could say, well, is ASML then going to take a particular risk by ordering less, the answer is yes. So and &#x2013; because we know at a certain moment in time the customer actually needs that tool. Now, is that risk going to turn into extra inventory, no, because we have agreements with our supply base. So that particular correlation between the time we get an order, times the standard lead time into a shipment -- that is not there.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Morgan Stanley. Thank you for taking my call. Is it a fair comparison to think back to Q2 of last year, we did see a pause in orders after a pretty strong revenue spend in the first half of last year. Is that a good way to think about the pocket of uncertainty you're seeing right now here in the first half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Potentially, yes. I think I would also like to add to that, to your question, because it's very relevant. I mean, think about Q2 of last year, which was a year of just over 30 orders, so --  it was a quarter of just over 30 orders, which, if you add to the average six months lead time, we'd say, well, then your fourth quarter is going to be 30. Well, the fourth quarter was 55. Yes? So, I think that is, to my point of what I just said, it is a weak correlation between when we get an order and when we know customers need the tools.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it is again &#x2013; it is difficult for us and I don't know how much you trust the depths of the analysis we are making here. The fundamental point for us is to understand the needs, the economics. And today our message is bullish. From whatever we hear, with/without this recession discussions and things, we haven't seen any customers or any statistics that tells us that we will not need those machines and we can correlate them with numbers. It's not like we trust people, we just go and count and see them. And we had the discussion at the beginning of the call, where we discussed 200-millimeter fab retirement, well these are big deals.</p>
          <p>That means, you know what that means, that means you've got X fabs going out of business because they are not cost-effective, not because you don't need the chips. So those chips have to be replaced by high-technology machines which come from us. So these type of activities are happening now. So if you add up those opportunities and you put this into a normal economic environment of about this 10% unit growth of semiconductor, which is not high, clearly not, then we show this growths potential. But it is true the bookings is a disaster for us too because it is, as Peter says, not correlative. But if you can try to make trend on the bookings you will be wrong. There is no &#x2013; it doesn't represent the business trend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, okay. And then a follow-up question. The team did a great job of bringing down cycle times for products in 2007. Maybe you can just give us an update on the progress of bringing down the manufacturing cycle times for the immersion products, where is it now and where does the team expect them to be six to nine months from now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this moment we improve cycle time of immersion machines by about 25% last year. This year, we probably will become, we'll get towards under a quarter on the three months lead time. I should not say this to a customer because they would put the orders now within the quarter, I made a mistake, sorry.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the follow-up actually, I understand why Samsung is increasing CapEx, but I got a hard time to understand why the rate of the industry should accelerate my version to the 50 or whatever. Because, simply if you look at the cash situation now it's becoming very tough. So, I can understand that the top three could put into the race but for the other &#x2013; aren't you afraid that at one point you simply cannot cope with the price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all the very good news which is a circle of this is said when you go and shrink like this, you go to the next technology. In fact you build less chips in the end. Either you put more integration to it or the machines are not as effective as the trailing edge in throughput. So you reduce in fact a numbers of units and you create more value. So at the end just by the fact that there is not so many units you raise the price. At the moment you raise the price it happens that the trailing-edge guys, the second tier may get a bit of life by staying in the lower end of the business for a little longer. And that's probably what we expect before they also jump to a leading edge. So if your point was, do we believe that the second tier are going to run as fast as the other guys to shrink, I think the answer is no. But they will benefit from the other guys ramping a year to two years ahead of them on the next generation. And that's very nice for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then also &#x2013; I think one of the question was about leasing. I think our estimate is in talk to the leasing companies that the addressable market for leasing companies in the semiconductor space will double this year. I think that they will find other ways of financing, I think we see clear evidence of that and there is a lot of activity in that space, especially when it comes to like you say very expensive tools like 1900.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It is Andrew Gardiner from Lehman Brothers. I have a question on the competitive environment. You have highlighted in your presentation and the press release some of the gains you have been making recently in Japan. I was just wondering if you could provide a bit more detail in that given some of the noise that was coming out of the market late last year and it is quite clear that earlier on the 1900i had a clear advantage over your competition, but that was being drawn into question in certain camps around the end of last year. Just wondering whether from your perspective you think that's true and whether &#x2013; or whether feedback from your customers in that market accounted to that and perhaps any further light you can shed on incremental gains in the Japanese market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all we have got two competitors, Canon and Nikon. Canon has not yet introduced their immersion machine and it is being prototyped and the prototype hasn't yet delivered a wafer. So clearly this is not the one you are talking about. You are probably talking about Nikon, who has a valid machine, that machine is based on this single stage platform. So it has between 30 and 40% throughput disadvantage compared to ours and this is not new, and this is the definition of the two products. And they are still on the lens, which has an NA of 1.3, ours is 1.35, and we have an overlay capability which is better than theirs. So our machine is still the only machine in the world capable of exposing below 45, say, and Nikon's machine is capable of doing above 45. That leads us to still being able to grow our market share first, because again, we have capability they don't have and secondly, the cost of ownership is not bad because our throughput is much better. That translate and this is now difficult for me to be specific customer wise.</p>
          <p>But what can I say, we are growing obviously, significantly our immersion market share on the customers we've already won. I don't know how &#x2013; I'm sure you'll have the official data soon from the different analysts. So you will see that this is clear. And there is now one more customer who has been, and I think is now public, who has been interested to evaluate one of our 1900s and this is being &#x2013; this is in process. So one more customer is being at this very moment worked with or evaluating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On top of that, just to talk little a bit about the 1900, the 1900 introduction has been the smoothest and the fastest introduction of new technology that the company has ever seen. The 1900s are all built within the targeted manufacturing cycle time. They are being installed in the targeted time. They are producing wafers very fast after decided by the customer above 2,000 wafers, and which is basically the result of all the cumulative learning we have had on the 1700. So, as you see the 1900 has a very successful introduction of an ASML product. And also if we look at the first six, I would even say nine months of the year, we cannot make enough 1900s. I mean we are shipping lower than the customer demand and that's simply because of the ramp-up of the lenses. So I think all in all the 1900 has been a very successful introduction and it still is, and I think it will reflect in our customer market share.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim Fontanelli, Arete Research. Just circling back to the kind of question of lack of correlation between orders and revenue. Your guidance for near doubling immersion sales in '08 obviously implies that you will be taking orders, immersion orders over the next three to four months of maybe circa 7 to 800 million euros given a eight to nine-month lead-time in immersion currently. Given all the provisos and the lack of visibility that you've been talking about so far in this call, what's the degree of confidence you have that that 7 to 800 million is real and is not going to fade away in part over the next quarter or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah what &#x2013; the bigger driver is, and I think Eric talked about that, is that our memory customers, largely memory customers of flash and DRAM, but also I think to a lesser extent found in our IDM customers. They have a roadmap that in time differs quite significantly when they need the first new leading-edge tool. So, we have seen the most aggressive customers in that sense come into the backlog over last two quarters. But we haven't seen everything yet and that means that either those customers decide that they're going to give up on their technology roadmap and they shrink or they are going to execute. And they will execute on road maps like I said that in time will differ. So, going back to the discussions that we have with those customers, we just don't walk in and we get an order, those are discussions that takes quarters, months. Just to make clear when they need a specific tool to serve their road maps. So that gives us the confidence, those kind of discussions, the inclusion of a 1900 in their roadmap at that particular point in time gives us the confidence to make that statement that we think we will close to double the immersion sales in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in other terms if I could give slight amount of details, more in the second half of the year, it's going to be a usual, it has always happened, the tail end of the first year, because they buy a lot in the first half and they always forget 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so. Then you are going to have the second tier, but I shouldn't &#x2013; it's in the second tier and there are third tier. And so there is a complete new rank of, call it second tier customers, but I &#x2013; they will be annoyed if I made that so clear. So it's not the first, the top three basically...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the next ones. That will come up in Q3 and then in addition to that, you are going to have the immersion starting from &#x2013; for the Logic guys, because, again, Logic hasn't started, by the way, in production, and so in that we have some orders. So yes there is new activities coming up in this environment and I didn't want to confuse anybody. The immersion for the third tier DRAM, that is not even a 2008. So I am sorry to confuse people with second tier, third tier, etcetera, but I don't want to put names to it. So there is clearly a necessity for what I call the second tier DRAM makers to be there because you cannot be absolutely leaders to the top two or three.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's pretty clear. And just a follow-up on the DRAM front, I guess it is all the sub-60 nanometer capacity that's coming on this year that is going to drive your specific DRAM immersion demand. Do you have an idea of what proportion of global DRAM capacity, do you think it's going to be sub-60 this year?</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you. If you look at the DRAM market, it's been probably at the highest risk at this point. Can you give us an idea of what you are thinking about the DRAM business is going to adopt immersion in 2008 in terms of units and then how many of those units go into top three customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I think yes, like you we thought that it was at risk because it's so &#x2013; it's a very large business and they have such a price problem that at some point everybody was worried that they would disappear or stop, or try to reassess, but today clearly they have come up with a solution which is ramping much faster their 5x or 5x equivalent. So this is where I would say the enthusiasm is, they are building up this plan where immersion is getting them out of a price problem. And they have discovered also by doing this, they &#x2013; only the big guys can be first, so there is significant hope for them. So you see this as a risk, in fact, we saw this as a fairly big &#x2013; I would say dynamic that saved everything. Now, in terms of unit that we would create for next year would we be wrong by saying about half? If we said the business of the immersion is about in the 1.9 niche billion as Nicolas said, in the 1.9 to 2, 1 billion of it may be DRAM.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Of the top &#x2013; of the 30 units, how much of that would be the top three?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>70, 75%. About three-quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's big. We are hesitating because we are ramping somebody new but to be honest it's difficult. But let's not try to answer your question because we don't understand, so you may want to have a little technical discussion with Craig or Franki about exactly what you're asking because we may give you wrong impression.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But definitely our top three customers are significant at this moment in time in the order backlog of top three primary customers. So the rest also before, for the immersion tools, I don't have the exact data here but they are significant. If you want an exact percentage, I can't give you that but they are very, very significant.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Weston Twigg, Pacific Crest. Just wondering, if maybe you could help explain the jump in service revenue and maybe tell us whether or not the number should carry forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The jump was largely in the field options. Like I said, that's a lumpy business. Sometimes we have big upgrades of fabs where we do productivity enhancement packages for the whole fab and then you suddenly have a big jump. So, on average the service revenue is about 100 million, but it can vary between 85 and 110-120. So, it's really when we have these bigger projects which are focused on system enhancements and system upgrades, and that happened in the fourth quarter, it's difficult to predict. Those are really orders that come in and then we need to deliver within the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it will be at that level of 120. No, it's on an average is about 100.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. From JPMorgan. Just a quick question on &#x2013; I mean there has been quite a lot of discussion on this, but in terms of your FIC, I mean you talk about Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 DRAM customers but there are Tier 2 NAND customers as well. Have all the Tier 2 NAND customers placed orders already or are we all completely relying on DRAM to be the next wave in the immersion orders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the smaller NAND haven't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you do expect that some of the smaller NAND customers will be placing 1900i orders at some point of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally I mean regarding your options program, I mean we have talked about this in the past, I mean we talked a lot about the foundries, I mean do these options still exist and I mean could they be exercised at short notice, in the second quarter for instance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I give you the truth, Sandeep? In fact they &#x2013; we're doing this with a, as you say a commercial system, but in addition we have to do it also with I would say aggressive lead time programs which sometimes are not options. So we have two sets of programs in place. A commercial program that says you accept to 100% guarantee that we will be ready to ship within two months. And then there's another program which is you accept to be getting those units but your probability is not 100%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And those numbers are limited.  The number of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One is cheaper than the other and &#x2013; but to be honest, one which is popular at this moment, extremely popular is the cheap one. But &#x2013; so, it puts us into difficult logistic situations but let's see...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, as answer to your question exactly, yes, I mean that is still out there. So those options have not been pulled and like Eric says, we have the second program which is for a limited number where you know customers try to get an ultra short lead time but we can do it only for a very, very few number of tools. And both are there and as a matter of fact we have seen, like Eric said earlier, especially in the foundry area in leading-edge, 65-nanometer capable tools. We have seen those spurred demands coming over the last week or so.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Janardan from Dresdner Kleinwort. I just want to go back to the immersion question asked earlier. When you're saying you're getting about 1.9 billion or so of revenue in the year, you're talking about 62, or thereabouts, a little bit higher maybe at about 30 million euros a piece. You have 34 in your backlog. So does that guidance imply that you have some visibility on taking in orders of about 10, 11 a quarter over the next two quarters or is that visibility not really there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be natural to do so, and we are working on those, that's why we are declaring that we can do this tools. But as I said, if I am going to give you a story, we booked, I think, three 1900 on the last week of December for delivery in April. So, that give you a feeling about things, so I &#x2013; what you say is, in fact, the logical answer, was a bit of a stretched lead time, but I think that's would be okay. But it is not obvious, the three deals on the 1900 were in fact significant activity for us to discuss, I would say terms for good reasons, so there was no give away or whatever, but it took a bit of time, but obviously the machines were already started.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  And just a last follow-up if I can. On your Q1 orders, can I assume that if things were &#x2013; are good or if things are bad let us say as different order levels will go, that in your mind the biggest delta between what is good or bad is whether the foundries will order or not, or is it &#x2013; can that delta come from something else as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be honest, at this moment, we do not need the foundries to have a robust year. We may need the foundry to have a growth year &#x2013; but we haven't put into our scenario in order to give you an optimistic view of the year, a surprise booking by the foundries in Q1 or in Q2 even, but not &#x2013; I mean just a very small amount, as they have been doing. So we are not dreaming &#x2013; I think it's a good conclusion.</p>
          <p>The message we try to give to everybody is we are not dreaming, we know that there is a potential recessions or etcetera out there. We are working our CapEx and OpEx accordingly, obviously, but we also understand that there are economics that requires our customers to ramp their production in certain way, particular in order for them to cost save and etcetera or introduce new products. So we have to do them. We know about the level of units that they want and we are optimistic about it, but we're not saying or great we are going to have all of them come in and the Taiwanese are going to have a lot of money and etcetera and therefore, thanks to all these, we are going to have year 2008. In fact, we do not at all simulate any of that.  We simulate on a very normal behavior by the very large players, we who are doing two things, technology transitions and retirement of some 200-millimeter fab. And on this notion, we finish the call with a fairly optimistic message of 2008.</p>
