          <p>[Call starts at 1:56] Thank you for standing by. Good day and welcome to the AMX First Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Mauricio Fernandes. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Matt. Good morning or good afternoon to everyone. My name is Mauricio Fernandez, and I'm the Latin America Telecom and Media analyst for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. We are honored to host this quarter's conference call to discuss America Movil's first quarter 2011 results. I'm in Sao Paulo, Brazil and from America Movil, Mexico City, we have Daniel Hajj, CEO; Carlos Jose Garcia Moreno, CFO; and Daniela Lecuona, Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Daniel, Carlos and Daniela, thank you very much for the opportunity. Daniel and Carlos, you may now go ahead with your initial remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mauricio. Thank you everybody for being on the call. As always Carlos is going to make a summary of the first quarter 2011 financial and operating results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thank you Mauricio for hosting the call. Well within this March, we had 284 million accesses, that's 12% more than a year before. Wireless subscribers totaled 231 million and fixed line RGUs, Revenue Generating Units, 53 million. <mark type="ph" /> Satellite (3:20) increased 12% and 15% respectively from March 2010. We opened up broadband access, I mean the RGUs what we have is broadband accesses rose 17% and PayTV accesses 34%. We added 6 million subscribers in the first quarter of the year, 1.8 million came from Brazil, 1.5 million from Mexico and approximately 750,000 from each of Colombia and the U.S. Our Brazilian <mark type="indiscernible" /> (3:53) were 52% higher than the prior year and both in Mexico 38%. The increase in RGU's that took place in the quarter was of 1.5 million accesses. This increase exceeded by 45% that seen the prior year.</p>
          <p>First quarter revenues were up 6.3% from a year before, that is 7.3% at constant exchange rates to 158.6 billion pesos with nearly two thirds of them originating the wireless platform. Here I want to remind everyone that the Mexican peso appreciated vis-a-vis practically all of the currencies and that's why at constant exchange rates the rate of growth of our operations, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (4:40) operations is in excess of 7%.</p>
          <p>Mobile data revenues continue to be a major source of service revenue growth, expanding by approximately 28% in Latin America and the Caribbean followed by fixed data revenues that increased 7.5%. Voice revenue rose 4.3% on the wireless platform that declined at the same rate on the fixed-line one. PayTV services continued to perform well with 67% service revenue growth. Our South American operations registered a 9.1% increase in gross service revenues. South America was the only region where our operations <mark type="ph" /> service revenue growth in our product line. (5:24)</p>
          <p>In Mexico, revenues were up 1.7%, with those coming from wireless climbing 5% and those coming from fixed-line declining 4.9%. While in the U.S. TracFone registered a 43% revenue increase and remained our strongest operation in terms of top line growth. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:49) traffic in Latam rose 14% year-on-year, with the exception of Chile and Peru that show <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:55) traffic growth 15% and 28%. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:59) between 10% and 18% with Mexico at the high end of the range.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (6:06) came down by an average of 11% in the region with Mexico, Peru and Chile leading the way with declines of approximately 15%. Third quarter EBITDA came in at 62 billion pesos, practically flat with respect to a year-on-year quarter, the 10% reduction in Telmex's EBITDA countered the 8.8% increase in EBITDA of our other operations.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA, that is the EBITDA before subscriber acquisition costs, increased in all operations relative to service revenues with two exceptions. TracFone in the U.S., which has been moving to a higher volume, lower-margin product mix, and Brazil on account of payment <mark type="indiscernible" /> (6:52) for the purchase of content because of the very rapid growth in PayTV accesses. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:00) taxes because we are having to pay more for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:05) on infrastructure and clients and the cost of material. Our net financing costs came down by half from a year before, even though our net debt paid almost <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:20) helping drive a 12% <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:22) company net income to 23.5 billion pesos. Our cash flow allowed us to fully fund our capital expenditures of 17 billion pesos, acquire stock of Telmex International <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:33) billion pesos, and pay distributions to shareholders in the amount of 12 billion pesos and reduce our net debt in flow terms by 7 billion pesos.</p>
          <p>More than half of our EBITDA, which is 53% more than half of our EBITDA, was consumed by items with a very strong seasonality, namely taxes and working capital. At the end of March our net debt totaled 211 billion pesos, about US$17.7 billion, and was equivalent to $0.35 EBITDA <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:09). We're currently closing two medium terms indicated bank facilities for US$4 billion. That will be closed today.</p>
          <p>Another topic, we were notified a few weeks ago by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:20) in Mexico of a fine to be levied on Telcel in the amount of 12 billion pesos. This fine is appealable before <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:28) itself. Telcel has 30 business days to present its case. Eventually, the fine <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:34). The company believes the fine is illegal and arbitrary. Well, thank you very much. This is the summary, I will pass the floor back to you Mauricio.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Carlos, as participants line up for Q&amp;A I'll kick off just asking two questions. First, how do you see the competitive environment in Mexico going forward on the back of the acquisition of the stake in Iusacell by Televisa? And secondly on the AMX results, how do you see the year-on-year declining margins and whether you see upsides in current levels, and possibly by when? That would be great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Mauricio, the first question, I think in Mexico has a lot of competition with our four competitors in the market is Telcel, Nextel, Telefonica and then Iusacell and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:35). What you're going to see with the acquisition of Televisa in Iusacell is that one of these four competitors is going to have more money to invest, is going to be stronger and there is going to be other &#x2013; more competition in the market. So I think that's that the way we're seeing things. We have a lot of competition in Mexico, prices are down around 15% year-on-year, we have a very competitive price when you compare it outside Mexico, when you compare it with Europe, when you compare it with Asia or with Latin America, Mexico has a very competitive price and what we still have &#x2013; not a very high penetration, we still are in the 85% penetration in Mexico. So with this acquisition, I think Iusacell is going to have a lot more money to invest and we're going to have more competition, that's the way I see this acquisition.</p>
          <p>In terms of the margins what &#x2013; I'm going to repeat a little bit what Carlos said. First, all except TracFone in Brazil, I think all the companies has a better margin are increasing revenues and increasing margin. The core EBITDA of all the companies has been growing, I think we feel very comfortable on the operation in each country. We have been growing not only in wireless, we have been growing also in TV and in broadband in almost all the countries. We have been growing more on postpaid, as the postpaid has been accelerated, it's more costly. And except TracFone, because in TracFone what we are seeing is that we're moving to a <mark type="ph" /> trade-up plan (11:41) and we're seeing more volume instead of more margins. But at the end I thing that's a good model for us and we feel very comfortable with that model.</p>
          <p>And then to see Brazil, still in Brazil I think the growth is very important, we're looking for the growth in Brazil and the main focus as we have been seeing is for the last year we're going to still grow a lot in Brazil and we want to prepare the growth in Brazil.</p>
          <p>What we're &#x2013; where we're investing in Brazil? We're investing in distribution, we're still investing a lot in advertising, we're trying to position our brand Claro as the best there and we're going to still invest in the position of our brand. We're investing more on the customer care centers, call centers and all related to the customer care services. And also what Carlos is saying, in Brazil we're growing a lot in TV and the cost of content has been very important. So those are the segments where we're having an increase in the cost in Brazil. Otherwise I think we feel very happy on the operation in Brazil, I think we're coming on track in the wireless business, we're starting to gain market share, we're gaining market share in post-paid, we're getting good customers, on TV we feel very comfortable, we are developing our business in TV and in broadband also. So I think that's mainly what is happening. Otherwise all the other operations they are doing very good, Mauricio.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you very much Daniel, <mark type="ph" /> Matt, (13:44) we may now open the call to Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir. <mark type="Operator instructions" />. We'll take our first question from Tom&#xE1;s Lajous with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you very much for the call. I guess, one thing if you could clarify, or, at least, two things. The first one is in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:22) fine, and how this relates to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:25) rulings on termination, what do you expect of this and operations and any interplay with Pay television permits for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:35) be related, and if you could comment on all of them that would be fantastic. And the other thing is that you seem to be having some issues with mobile data services in Brazil and Mexico and in Mexico with voice as well. Can you offload mobile data <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:50) to release capacity and if so when would you expect to start, when should we expect to start seeing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tom&#xE1;s. The first question on the interconnection rates, I think the position that we have on the interconnection rates is, we have been lowering the interconnection rates for the last five or six years. Every year we have been reducing the price of the interconnection rates. We're not against reduce the interconnection, I think it's clearly that &#x2013; it's clear that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:29) wants to reduce the interconnection at a faster pace. What we think here is that if we reduce it at a faster pace maybe what is going to happen is that we're going to have a lack of investment in the sector. We hope we don't have that, but we're not against the reduction of the interconnection. Today the interconnection, if you review the interconnection in Mexico, the interconnection is really competitive to other countries. So that's the way we see that and that's the way we deliver that. Carlos is going to talk a little bit about the timing of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:12) and how we feel about that also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom&#xE1;s, just to have a good understanding of that business. The <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:22) is based on the premise that Mexican interconnection rates are substantially higher than those prevailing in other countries. And that these rates were somehow forced by Telcel and our competitors and that following that Telcel <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:38) practice by charging its clients much less than it charged other clients for the use of its network. Well for one thing, Telcel does not set interconnection rates, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:51) substantially all the operators, including all mobile operators. As regards interconnection rates, we have been reviewing the available information, and this is public information, so all of you can verify it independently. Looking at rates in Western Europe comprising 17 countries, it appears that in dollar terms, highest in Mexico, with the low to medium prevailing in Western Europe in each of the years 2006 through 2009, and we're only marginally higher in 2010. Throughout this period, the Mexican peso has at times strong and at times weak, but this is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:35) Mexico and in Western Europe, which constitutes the core of the OECD countries. In the U.S. and Canada you do not have interconnection rates <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:48).</p>
          <p>Finally, what we have been able to determine from public information is that the average price <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:55) an almost identical relationship in Mexico and interconnection rates in Mexico as in Western Europe, that is to say the average price a minute of voice for real traffic is 10 percentage of interconnection rates in Mexico as has been the median in Western Europe. So at least looking at all this information, that again it's public information, some of it is contained in Merrill Lynch's Wireless Metrics, because a lot of the companies in this region give this information and if you look at information interconnection rates, again this can be obtained, everybody can verify that the same things that we have said. So from our perspective, these arguments led by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:50) are completely baseless.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one more thing finally what <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:55) is saying is that we're killing competition. So what you could see is that a lot of these companies has more revenue, increasing market share and better margin. So I don't think in that case we are killing the competition. At the end of the day, we're going to use all legal actions and all remedies to challenge this. And your other question Tom&#xE1;s is on the mobile, I think what you need is we are growing a lot on data traffic in Mexico, in Brazil and all around Latin America and the way to do that is to invest, no? We need to invest in, to do fiber to the node, to have a good backbone, to of course use in mostly all of the countries, we have the fixed network, so we're doing one network. That's really one of the big synergies that we have with the fixed &#x2013; with Telmex International, to use all the backbone and all their fiber that they have to upload all the data that we have. So it's very important what we're using, but at the end of day what unique to do is to invest because there is going to &#x2013; we have a lot of data traffic and I think we're going to have more data traffic in the future. So that's the reason why we're going to invest more than $8 billion in CapEx in all the countries to use that for all the data that we're putting &#x2013; that all our subscribers are using. So that's mainly a lot of these CapEx is going to put more data capacity.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to Andrew Campbell with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just going back to Brazil and the margin level that we saw in the first quarter. Was there anything non-recurring that we should consider in that margin level? And also looking at the Embratel numbers it seemed that most of the margin decline was on the wireless side of the business rather than the fixed-line side of the business. And so my question was just whether or not in light of the investments that you're making in distribution brand, customer care as you described, whether or not we should be looking at this as somewhat of a baseline margin now going forward or has there been any change really on the medium and long-term outlook for margins in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I can tell you in Brazil and really that our main focus in Brazil today is growth, okay? We're having a very good growth on postpaid, we're gaining market share on postpaid and we're growing a lot in prepaid, I think we have 1.8 million subscribers. So a lot of that is acquisition cost, a lot of the costs related is acquisition cost. We have around 52% net tax increase year-on-year. So and in terms of postpaid we have seven times more net tax postpaid year-on-year. So it's a lot what we're growing, you know that the postpaid is a lot more costly the growth than prepaid. And as I am saying, we have other costs related on that.</p>
          <p>So we're having a customer care call centers, it's very important, we are giving and we are trying to give I think that for us to give a better service to our customers, it's going to be very important. In the future, you have to take care of your customer differently. When you have a lot of prepaid, it's very easy, it is a lot of voice and you don't have to do a lot. But when you are starting to use smartphones and you're starting to use data then you have to take care more about &#x2013; there is a lot more questions in the customer care centers, in the call centers, so we're investing in that.</p>
          <p>The other thing too, really important, is related to our brand, okay? Brand, it's been &#x2013; we're investing a lot, I think the Claro brand is very good, but we want to still invest and to position very good our Claro brand in Brazil. So we're investing a lot more than what we have been invest last year. So there's another place where we have increased in our cost &#x2013; it's in our advertising <mark type="ph" /> brand (24:14). So those are more or less &#x2013; the other thing is you are saying not in the mobile, but more in the TV is the content, we used to have &#x2013; I think we grow in Brazil, in Brazil in one year maybe 700,000 customers in PayTV. When in PayTV the business, as you reach more and more customers then you are allowed to have better price on the content. And we hope that at the end of this year, we can reach some levels that we can have better pricing on the content.</p>
          <p>So I think more or less is what we're having. But for me, the most important thing is that we are growing seven times the postpaid customers, the net add postpaid customers year-on-year and postpaid is much more costly than the prepaid customers and that's where we are having the biggest increase in cost that we are having last year.</p>
          <p>And as I told you, Brazil we're looking for growth, I think the economies in Brazil are doing very well, the market is growing a lot. So that's something that we're looking for growth in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you have to have &#x2013; what Daniel saying in the case of Brazil on the fixed-line platform, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:02) linked to a very rapid growth of the TV business and just to put in perspective the Embratel which is the product that is &#x2013; it's a DTH product and it has been sold by Embratel has moved from 400,000 clients a year ago to 1.4 million clients today. And it's growing very, very rapidly, we expect it to continue to grow very, very rapidly. And obviously it also brings a lot of synergy with what we have been doing with net services. So it's something that you need to keep in mind, the old America Movil -- the old America Movil TV was not important, but these days in Brazil certainly it has been growing very, very rapidly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And all overall it's &#x2013; we have Claro that I think is developing good, I'm feeling very comfortable on the operations, we have Embratel that is a company also doing excellent, we have the capitalized business, we have net services. So the group in Brazil, I think America Movil in Brazil is really well supported, it's in a very good position to compete against any competition, any competitors that we have there. So I'm feeling really comfortable on our operations in Brazil. Still we have a lot of work to do, still we have to take advantage of the growth of the market and we have a lot of things to do but the position that <mark type="ph" /> American Mobile (27:31) has in Brazil, I think it's in a very good terms, no?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just wanted to clarify one thing on this recent decision to lower interconnection rates, this decision was taken by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:55) and you can appeal to the Supreme Court, is this correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the interconnection rates, the way it works is if you have an agreement then when the agreement is finished you negotiate the agreement with your counterpart, okay? If you don't get an agreement with your counterpart then Cofeco gets in &#x2013; Cofetel, sorry, Cofetel gets in and decides for interconnection rates but you can appeal that if you are not, if you decide that the way Cofetel decides the cost of the interconnection rate was right. And that's the way it works in Mexico. It doesn't have to do anything with the Cofeco.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So now you can appeal to the courts, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have an appeal for maybe at 2006 with <mark type="ph" /> Alcatel (29:01) we don't get an agreement on that and we have been having a dispute in the courts since 2006.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is two different things Andre. On the one hand is defined as Cofeco, that I mentioned, and the other is a solution by Cofetel of a dispute on interconnection rates that I think it was <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:25) which basically said interconnection rates <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:36) And I think yesterday we were notified of a similar resolution on the part of Cofetel, okay? So it's two separate things, one is the definition of interconnection rates and disputes by Cofetel and they have been &#x2013; they have ruled in two or three cases recently <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:57) that's what we should have. And then separate from this is the fine by Cofeco on the grounds that supposedly the interconnection rates were too high in Mexico.</p>

The first one is, regarding these interconnection fees, while you are on trial or in courts, which is the fee that's actually being paid? And the second one, it seems like you're being a really successful on Via Embratel. Are you considering expanding this solution through Latin America? Thank you.</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:39) I think we have been very successful on Via Embratel in Brazil and we're doing the satellite business, we're doing that also in other countries. So <mark type="ph" /> Oscar (30:56) can talk a little bit about that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, we are operating satellite TV services in 11 countries of the 18 countries that we have. And as you see the figures as well in Chile we are really successful in PayTV and as well in Peru. And in Central America, we already have 2.3 million PayTV customers under the satellite technology. As you know as well we're offering PayTV through HFC Networks, we have like 9 million customers through HFC Network. So we're using the same model that we're doing in Brazil and the other countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the fee, I think with Axtel they have been paying us a lot of different interconnection rates and they're been paying us $0.60 and then $0.40 and then $0.80. So in these four or five years that we have fighting for this interconnection, they have been paying a lot of different rates.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I just had a couple of quick ones. Can you quantify the impact that increased selling and marketing in handset promotions had on margin trends in Mexico? And then just how should we think of margin trends in Mexico going forward, should they sort of remain in this low 50% range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think we think that in Telcel in the wireless side of America Movil, we think that we can maintain for this year over 50% margins that we have. Unless there is a big reduction on the interconnection rate or something like that, I think there is no problem to maintain our 50% margins in Mexico. Even that we should spend more on advertising or even that we grow more on the postpaid side, I think or even that we have to invest a lot in data, I think, the other thing that will happen is that we have been growing a lot with the smartphones, the smartphones you need to give more subsidies, more costly, but we can maintain our 50% margin.</p>

            <mark type="audio gap" /> (33:48) question, can you talk a little bit about ARPU in Mexico and what you're seeing as far as elasticity? And then a second question in the United States, there has been a lot of discussions about fourth-generation LTE, a lot of networks being rolled out in 2011 and 2012, a major competitor today was talking about, they think there will be an explosion of LTE handsets in the United States in 2013 or 2014. As you look at Latin America a lot of growth potential just on 3G, but when do you think 4G will come down to your markets and when do you need spectrum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, we have spectrum in some markets, in Mexico, we have a spectrum for 4G, in Brazil we have a spectrum for 4G, and we are evaluating the 4G technology, deciding <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:37) where we're going to invest, but I think in 2012, we could be ready to launch 4G technology in some countries, depending on the availability of the spectrum that we have in each of the countries. I think in some countries, there is still we're going to see some auctions of the spectrum. Let's say, I think in Colombia we're going to see some auctions at the end of this year. And in Brazil, we have, in Mexico we also have.</p>
          <p>In terms of the ARPU, I think we have a reduction of ARPU because we have a reduction of 2.7%, because we have a reduction of price per minute of 15%, and our month only grow 8%. So it's why you are seeing that the ARPU reduce a little bit.</p>
          <p>And in the other side also in Mexico, we have very good net adds that it's 38% more than what we have last year. So with the increase of net adds plus the reduction on prices, that's what we are not compensating totally the ARPU and also we have a little bit the compensation that we have in Mexico City, the minutes that we gave to our customers, because the interference problems that we have in Mexico. But I think ARPU should maintain that, we're growing a lot on data, but the price per minute has been reduced by 15%, so that's really the reason of the reduction of the ARPU.</p>

          <p>I'm going to answer the question about net services bundle. As you know in net services, we really been really successful on the triple play, that is voice, data and video through just one single offering. Around 50% of the customer already have triple play. So now we're working with Claro which kind of offering we could do together but to be honest we see the markets not ready to go ahead with these proposal and we will see this maybe on the second half of the year or something like that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the &#x2013; the question is if the interconnection goes to $0.39, what's going to happen with our agreement between Telefonica and Telmex, I think is what you're asking. I don't know exactly what does Telmex is going to decide because if the reduction goes to the end customer then I think all the rates are going down and maybe Telmex wants to reduce to be competitive. If the reductions don't go directly to them customer may be we're not going to move that. It's an agreement of most favored nations, not Telmex, can decide if they want to have the same price as the other ones but that's a decision of Telmex.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Hey, Daniel. At your investor meetings, I think probably for the past two years at least when you've talked about smartphones, you've always profiled Blackberrys and talked about their low usage and how that was good for your network. I think RIM has &#x2013; spoke last week about how sales of Blackberrys were maybe disappointing in Latin America, can you talk about the type of products in smartphones the people are adopting in Latin America?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they are moving really fast to smartphones, really fast and they are going to move faster as we have better prices in Latin America for smartphones. So I think you're going to see a big switch from a normal phone to a smartphone, in all Latin America they are starting to use more data. Not only moving to a smartphone, they are starting to use more Internet, they are using more content in the phone, they're using also e-mail. So there's a lot of things that people is adopting and you're going to be surprised the speed to switch from a normal phone to a smartphone.</p>

So that's very important, and if they have a good operating system then they are going to use more and more data. So that's the way the market is moving.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry to keep coming back to this Brazil question. I wonder when you could give us some sort of timeline, you've seen fantastic subscriber growth over the last sort of two quarters, but your revenue growth in that market in mobile is still lagging behind your competitors. When do you think we'd see this pick up to sort of the level that your competitors are at, sort of 10% plus? Are we thinking, is it one quarter, is it three quarters, sort of give us some sort of help there. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean it's been ramping up and I don't know, remember that number one not everybody have the same thing on the wireless revenues. So you can see that different competitors are working different things under revenue.</p>
          <p>And secondly you have to consider and we have said it often enough that we are doing IFRS and that means that, in our IFRS at least, we're netting out the commissions paid to distributors from these revenues okay, which is not what has been done by the competitors. So let's try and see if we can compare apples to apples. I think that we're growing not only in line with the market, I think that we are growing more importantly better than the market. And as Daniel pointed out, I think that we have been having a lot of success in expanding our postpaid base. And that obviously comes with a bonus in terms of our revenue growth down the road. So that's something for you to determine or you are going to be seeing that.</p>
          <p>But I think what I would like here to highlight again is what has already been said before. Brazil, its margin reduction came about because of two things: one, which was obviously the cost of growing, it's subscriber acquisition cost essentially, that's number one. And then number two, on the structural part, what we would call core EBITDA, it had two significant effects, one which was the procurement of content, which we have already explained why PayTV is not something that was all that important <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:15) James, it's something that you need to take more into account down the road. So if you have the procurement of content that's a structural thing. And then on the other hand we have what Daniel was saying about publicity. We are now spending a bit more on the brand and we &#x2013; that is the single most important thing that had an impact in the first quarter <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:41). So those are not things that concern us. I think in the end, as Daniel said before, I think what we're comfortable with the actual state of the operations in Brazil. I think they are doing very well, they are going according to plan and I don't think that we need to add anything more to that.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Thanks for all your color on your EBITDA. When you talk of Mexico and you talk EBITDA of about 50%, are you being a little bit conservative or does it just trend down there, to the 50% level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think 50% levels are not conservative, I think they're good levels that &#x2013; and what we said is depending how aggressive we could be on pricing, how aggressive we could be on advertising &#x2013; growth, growth is very important on postpaid growth. So it depends a lot on that, that's mainly what I think on the 50%. We have been having from 51%, 53%, 54% that's more or less what we are having quarter-on-quarter depending on the growth of the subscriber base.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I just wanted to ask another question on strategy in Brazil, the postpaid growth has been strong for a couple of quarters now, and I think postpaid is now about 20% of total subscribers. Is the aim to grow that mix even further towards postpaid or should we expect the mix to remain at the current kind of levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of the growth in the market share in Brazil in postpaid, we're gaining market share in postpaid, we're a very important player in the postpaid market in Brazil. If the balance change a little bit is because we are growing more on that, we want to grow more on the prepaid. We are not only on the postpaid side, we want to be also on the prepaid side, both markets are important for us. So the balance is that we are not moving postpaid and do prepaid or do prepaid and less on postpaid. I think what we want this we're really well positioned in the postpaid market and we want to be better positioned in the good prepaid market. When I'm saying the good prepaid market is not selling only SIM cards that they are not going to have good revenue in the future. So you don't have big cost, but you don't have good revenue. So we're also focusing in the good part of that prepaid &#x2013; in the good subscribers on the prepaid market. So that's where we're focusing and also in the data plans in Brazil we're really interested to sell more data plans in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because I do understand that there's a cost associated with the type of goods we've seen over the last two quarters, but it has sort of struck me that the usage trends have been weaker than I would have expected given the increase in postpaid users on the base. So we've seen MOUs fall 2% this quarter and fairly weak growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Is that simply a function of users coming onto the network and taking a while to really ramp up their usage, or what's happening there in terms of the type of users that you are bringing onto the network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at MOUs, they are down 2% year-on-year, but the number of subscribers in Brazil if I remember correctly, it's about 15% greater than last year &#x2013; 17% greater to be exact. So I think these levels are perfectly well and this change into postpaid is more recent and will have more of an impact down the road.</p>

You could see that the big content in mobile phones is all the applications that we're selling, it's going to Internet, it's games, a lot of gaming, a lot of music. So I think that the content is different what the people is using in the mobile phones than what they are seeing in the TV. I don't think there's exactly the same content.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think I got cut off last time, just on Brazil, I think in the last month or so you might have reduced your rates specifically with regard to long distance on the wireless side of things. I'm just curious whether you plan to make more aggressive rate cuts in Brazil going forward in order to stimulate growth. And then just a bigger, broader question, I mean your EBITDA growth on a consolidated basis was basically there was no growth this quarter. When you look to returning to growth in future quarters and years, is it really PayTV that's going to drive that growth, or do you expect some additional margin improvement to occur in wireless across your markets? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Almost 9 &#x2013; 8.8% of EBITDA growth. So we're still growing EBITDA, what we have this big reduction is because the Telmex Mexico but ex-Telmex, we're still growing a lot. We think that the PayTV business is going to be very profitable in the future, that's why we're investing a lot of money there. And the PayTV is more like, you need to reach a volume of subscribers and then once you have that then the cost would be reduced, paying the content by an example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Telmex is something that we need to focus on and it's something that we will be looking at down the road. But we think that the trend &#x2013; the downward trend in revenues is not going to continue forever and that's going to allow the company to come back in terms of EBITDA at a later point probably year.</p>

So there is some other places where you could see that we're going to have growth in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry about that. Can you just go back to the Brazil question please? I mean I know it's a little bit more specific but Brazil is obviously a large market, any comment on your pricing strategy there? I believe over the past month or so you've gotten a little bit more aggressive on the long distance pricing for the wireless customers there, so is that going to continue? Do you anticipate that getting more aggressive? I think you were charging a fixed rate for a certain number of minutes for long distance. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have been a little bit more aggressive on the long distance that we're giving some customers the long distance as a local call. And there is a trend that we have been seeing in the Brazilian market and I think it's &#x2013; we're getting more traffic doing that. So that trend are happening in Brazil and I think there is still &#x2013; you are going to see more reduction on prices and in a market like Brazil that is so big and so dynamic, you're going to see new promotions and new things in the next couple of months. Most in Brazil are still low 90 minutes, so there is good room for improvement on that, no?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning and thank you. I have two questions please. First quickly on Brazil, besides you and have you seen other players being a bit more competitive during the Q1 and up-to-date?</p>
          <p>And second just a more broad question, when you think about your businesses and your targets, do you generally try to focus on market share subscribers, or do you look at market share of revenues overall? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in Brazil, on your first question, we have very good competition in Brazil, all of them are good competitors and they are big companies with a lot of money. So there are &#x2013; we have good competition in Brazil. And we're looking for growth on subscribers. Of course revenue is more important than subscribers, but revenue are not going to grow if you don't grow the subscriber base or you don't sell something else to your customers. So both are very important for us, the growth in subscribers and the growth on revenues. And I think we can get the last question, Matt?</p>

          <p>Yes sir, we'll go to our last question from <mark type="ph" /> Jeff Fann with Scotia Capital (57:46).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking my question. My question is your view on the U.S. market. I guess in the past couple of months ago, AT&amp;T announced that they are interested in T-Mobile, so there may be some consolidation down the road, which may provide you guys with a bigger opportunity perhaps in the prepaid and lower-end market. I'm wondering if you can comment a little bit on the U.S. market now and what criteria you are looking at and whether or not to further invest in that market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we're really happy how TracFone is developing in the U.S. Still the merger between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, if that's going to happen I don't know exactly what's going to be the benefits for TracFone. What I see is that today we have a very good product, we're really focused on the prepaid market, our revenues are growing, the margins have been reduced because we're having more subscribers, higher cost on those subscribers. But we're really happy the way we are doing things in the U.S. So we don't have any other plans other than really growing the prepaid market on the U.S. with TracFone at this moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see a need to own the network to continue to execute on the strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, our strategy's been being an MVNO and we still want to be an MVNO. We don't want to have &#x2013; to have a network in the U.S. you need to invest billions and billions of dollars and I don't think we're in the position today doing that. The way we're moving on U.S through TracFone is the strategy that we want to take.</p>
