        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Alisa and good morning, good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to discuss our 2008 first quarter results. As usual I would like to start the call by sharing a brief overview of the quarter and then Luiz Fernando, Jo&#xE3;o and Bernardo will provide you with an overview of our results in Brazil, HILA-ex, Quinsa and North America. I will close by providing more specifics regarding the first quarter financials.</p>
          <p>Before I start, I would just like to remind you that all the numbers are in Brazilian GAAP and that the percentage changes used in this call are on an organic basis. So let's turn straight away to the results.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, our consolidated EBITDA reached almost 2.1 billion reais which represents a 4.9% growth when compared to the first quarter of 2007 driven by strong results in Quinsa and North America and good EBITDA performance in our Brazil CSD &amp; NANC business but offset by weak volumes in Brazil beer following a general slowdown in the Brazilian beverage industry during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The Brazilian business had a challenging first quarter compared to 2007 with beer volumes declining by 1.9% and CSD &amp; NANC volumes declining by 1.4%. Luiz Fernando will be providing you with more detail of the key drivers in a few moments. Lower than expected volumes resulted in a less favorable fixed cost absorption which together with malt and corn costs and the timing of beer marketing investments resulted in a marginal Brazil EBITDA decline of 0.7% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our Quinsa operations continued to deliver strong operational and financial results, as EBITDA grew 29.3% on the back of beer volume growth of 10.7% and CSD &amp; NANC volume growth of 8.5%. In Canada despite a tough competitive environment, domestic volumes grew by 1.5%, leading to market share gains and resulting in an EBITDA growth of 9.7%. Net income grew by 15.2% reaching 744 million reais and earnings per share excluding goodwill amortization grew by 22.1%.</p>
          <p>I will comment further on net income at the end of this presentation.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Luiz Fernando as we start to look a little deeper into the results of each of the operations. Luiz?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Graham and hello everyone. I will now provide you with details regarding the Brazilian and HILA-ex operations. And I will start with beer Brazil. Our first quarter results were below expectations as we faced beverage industry slowdown due to three main factors. Firstly, unexpected and unusually cold and wet weather; secondly, an early Carnival; and finally, higher core food prices which have put pressure on consumer disposable income. The slowdown was not visible until well into the quarter since the early Carnival led to strong volumes in the first 45 days.</p>
          <p>Our beer net revenues per hectoliter in Brazil reached 151.7 reais, a growth of 5.9% when compared to the 144.7 reais last year, reported in the first quarter of 2007. This increase probably reflects our price increase in December as well as an increase in our direct distribution network and the consumer excellent performance of our premium brands, which grew around 9% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We completed the implementation of our price increases for cans and longnecks after Carnival and due to strong and focused execution we were able to deliver market share growth of 20 basis points year-over-year reaching an average of 67.8% in the quarter. We're very pleased with this result in such a difficult first quarter for the industry.</p>
          <p>Our beer COGS per hectoliter grew 13.1%. In addition to the anticipated increase in the cost of malt and corn, salary inflation and the benefits of currency, Q1 COGS were impacted by the purchase of third party malt and a less favorable fixed cost absorption due to lower volumes. As the year progress , we expect to see considerable improvement in beer COGS per hectoliter from both more favorable hedging gains and our planned productivity and efficiency initiatives already in place.</p>
          <p>Beer SG&amp;A excluding depreciation and amortization grew by 17.4% due principally to the timing of certain marketing programs and investments. For example, Skol <mark type="inaudible" /> event in Rio de Janeiro where we sold our giant branded Ferris wheel for a month during Carnival. It was very successful in bringing the consumers even closer to the brand. The launch of our new 630 ml proprietary bottle in real for Skol, which is pursued by consumers as the most relevant innovation in returnable packaging ever in Brazilian market. The Bermuda campaign which reinforced the brand proposition to its consumers and the rollout of Brahma fresh into additional five states in the northeast region.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A was also impacted by inflation and the growth of direct distribution. Although there will be some quarterly variations in the timing of marketing spend during 2008, we expect full year SG&amp;A excluding depreciation and amortization for both beer and soft drinks to continue to grow in line with volume growth, the increase in direct distribution and inflation.</p>
          <p>Beer EBITDA finished the quarter 4.7% below Q1 2007 with EBITDA margin contracting 430 basis points, but it's still reaching 47.5%. 2008 will remain a challenging year but we believe there will be a return to industry growth as the year progresses. In fact we saw an early sign of this in April with beer volumes growing 3.1%. We are confident we have the right people and commercial plans in place market share during the year.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, a more favorable phasing of our selling and marketing investments towards our currency hedge will improve profitability as the year progresses. Last but not least, the market in the remaining of the year should perform better than the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Brazil CSD net revenue per hectoliter grew 5.8% in the period, the cold and wet weather impacted volumes, particularly for Gatorade and H2o with an overall decline of 1.4%. However, we are pleased to see that the average market share grew to 17.7% for the quarter, 40 basis points higher than last year. We continue to invest in soft drinks innovations for the launch of new products and packages, and the first quarter saw the launch of our new H2o Apple Flavor and the Sukita Grape</p>
          <p>Soft drinks COGS per hectoliter declined by 7% in the quarter as a result of our anticipated hedge gains in sugar and currency, partly offset by fixed cost absorption. As the year progresses, the benefits from our hedges and our plant productivity and efficiency initiatives will help to improve the soft drinks COGS results even further.</p>
          <p>Soft drinks SG&amp;A expenses in Q1 grew by only 1.7% when compared to last year as a result of the favorable timing of investment. This has helped to deliver a very strong EBITDA result, 22% higher than last year with an improvement in EBITDA margin of 44%.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, despite some short term slowdown in the industry we continue to see good opportunity in the soft drinks business in terms of market share and profitability and we will continue to invest in this segment. We are well positioned for the future.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to HILA-ex. The region generated an EBITDA loss of 15.5 million reais for the quarter. The beer business continued to show good volume growth of 7% principally due to double digit growth in Peru, Ecuador and Dominican Republic which was partly offset by the market challenge we continued to face in Venezuela. The HILA-ex CSD business delivered a low positive EBITDA as we repositioned our brands to better address local market conditions.</p>
          <p>Our strategy in the region remains unchanged. Beer volumes and share are both progressing. We are reducing the fixed costs in the business and are nearing EBITDA and cash flow neutrality, giving us the confidence and flexibility to pursue our long term goals.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, Q1 was certainly a very difficult quarter and the challenge will remain for the rest of 2008. However, we have confidence in the long term health of the Brazilian economy and the beverage industry. With this in mind, we will continue to invest behind our business in terms of both brands and people. We will rely upon the strength of our portfolio and our core competencies of precise execution in the market, pricing discipline and cost management. Our people are ready for the challenge and I have confidence in our ability to deliver as we have done in the past.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call to Jo&#xE3;o who will talk about the Quinsa business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Luiz and good morning everyone. Our Beer and Soft Drinks operation maintained the growth trends observed in 2007 during the first quarter of 2008, achieving higher volumes in every country where we operate. The consolidated volume increased 9.7 organically in the quarter based on the excellent performance of both, the Beer and the Soft Drink business.</p>
          <p>Our volume growth was 10.4% in the case of Beer and 8.5% in Soft Drinks. Our double digit growth in Bolivia and Paraguay, the continuous growth of Argentina and Uruguay and the recovery of Chile results in an impressive quarter in terms of volume.</p>
          <p>Net revenue per hectoliter grew organically, both in Beer and Soft Drinks as a result of higher price throughout the region and strong performance of our premium brands. The company performed particularly well in the premium segment in Argentina with Stella Artois and Iguana posting outstanding growth ratios. Stella Artois has also performed above the rest of the portfolio in Chile and Uruguay.</p>
          <p>In the case of Paraguay, it is the Brahma brand the one that over performed the rest accounting for the important volume growth of our business.</p>
          <p>On the rising of individual beer markets, Argentina posted its all time high record in the quarter in terms of volume, even exceeding the volumes reached before the venture of the three brands due to the antitrust requirements. The company performed very well all over the country, gaining market share in a growing and competitive market.</p>
          <p>The Bolivian business continued to post a strong growth rate in an uncertain operating environment. Performance has been particularly well in the main cities of La Paz and Cochabamba. We took advantage of industry volume records with our market share remaining stable. We focused on some product innovation like Basinger red lager and Takina Ice, strategically strengthening our core brands and increasing the per capita.</p>
          <p>Chile showed an important recovery in the quarter, mainly based in a growing industry. Our premium brands are performing very well in a country where the premium segment continues to grow.</p>
          <p>The beer market in Paraguay posted solid growth, which allowed us to show a strong recovery in terms of volume in comparison to last year. This is particularly due to better weather conditions, the epidemic disease that was spread out last year, and increasing activity related to elections.</p>
          <p>We kept implementing actions to defend our market share from imported beers. The Brahma brand had excellent performance in the quarter, gaining market share and becoming the most significant penetration of our global brand within the region.</p>
          <p>Our Beer business in Uruguay has also performed very well, reflecting volume growth and stable market share and strong performance by our premium brand, Patricia.</p>
          <p>In Soft Drinks, we had an excellent quarter in terms of volume of volume with market share gains in both markets of Argentina and Uruguay. In Argentina, the Pepsi brand grew within the A segment of the business, while the H2OH! and Gatorade brands delivered very important growth rate as well. H2OH! gained market share when compared to the excellent performance of its citrus flavor.</p>
          <p>Regarding our costs in SG&amp;A expenses, the initiatives to mitigate the negative effects of higher cost of raw materials for the metal in Soft Drinks, price quotation and labor are focused in achieving industrial and procurement efficiency as well as consolidating our <mark type="inaudible" /> efforts. Solid growth rates in all the markets where we operate, together with focused revenue management and cost initiatives have resulted in an EBITDA organic growth of 29.2% in the quarter with a 46.7% EBITDA margin.</p>
          <p>I'd like to end my comments by congratulating my team for sending a tough challenge and delivering again. We have been able to show high growth rate despite the tough comparison to a very successful 2007. I am confident we will continue on this path based on the strength of our brands and excellence of our people, products and market execution.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn over to Bernardo.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jo&#xE3;o. Hello everyone. Look at the first quarter and I am happy to say that Labatt delivered results consistent to our goal of growing EBITDA with no cost for our market share.</p>
          <p>On EBITDA, we grew 9.5% in the quarter on an organic basis. That growth came from top line driven by share growth, pricing line with the industry, and from seizing on our marketing sales investments. I fully expect to use this marketing money in the coming three quarters to support our top line initiatives.</p>
          <p>On market share grew by 0.4 share points in the quarter on a pro forma basis and 0.3 share points on organic basis for the first time in the first quarter '04. I'm happy to say that consistent with our strategy, all of our key brands &#x2013; Budweiser, Keith's, Lakeport, Bud Light and Stella, grew share in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, I know that '08 will be a tough year, so we continue to focus on few and big things. I'm confident that our top line strategy of focused investments in key brands, of effective choice for <mark type="inaudible" /> deliver market share, better sales and execution and disciplined revenue management is paying off.</p>
          <p>Look at market share. Canada is a very competitive market and you can be sure that the other companies we've tried to recover share during the high volume summer months. However, we are ready to fight the fight.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, the cost of imports continued to be a concern. In the first quarter, they drove up our cost per hectoliter. In the rest of '08, you can take a higher hit from import price in line with industry trends. We pushed higher costs in order to partially offset it. I am more and more confident in the execution, in the will of our team to deliver EBITDA growth with no cost of our market share.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to go back to Graham.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Bernardo. In this final section, I would like to guide you through the main lines between the reported EBIT of 1.7 billion reais and the net income of 744 million reais as disclosed on page 16 of our release.</p>
          <p>Other operational income and expense was a net expense of 295 million reais in the quarter, compared to an expense of 370 million reais in the same period last year. This decrease in expense is primarily due to translation gains on foreign investments recorded by Quinsa resulting from the depreciation of the Argentinean peso against other Latin American currencies.</p>
          <p>Higher goodwill amortization from the acquisitions of Lakeport and Cintra in 2007, a change in the amortization curve for Labatt and the acquisition of an increase stake in Quinsa in 2008 partly offset these gains. Our net debt at the end of the quarter stood at 8.2 billion reais compared to 7.4 billion reais at the end of 2007 Q1. The drivers of this increase was the acquisition of the increased stake in Quinsa for around 670 million reais, and our share buyback which amount to around to 515 million in the period.</p>
          <p>Our net financial result was an expense of 272 million reais compared to 296 million reais in Q1 last year. Marginally lower interest rates and the ending of CPMS in Brazil drove this improvement. The provision for income tax and social contribution was an expense of 341 million reais versus 423 million last year. This increase is mainly the result of improved earnings before taxes, higher interest on capital and certain one time charges recorded in Q1 2007.</p>
          <p>Net profit per thousand shares in the quarter amounting to 1.22 reais compared 1.03 reais in Q1 2007. When we exclude goodwill amortization, earnings per share rose 22.1% in the first quarter to 2.02 reais. Regarding our payout strategy, our policy of distributing all excess cash generated if we cannot identify value enhancing alternative uses within the business, remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, during the first quarter we returned to shareholders approximately 515 million reais in share buybacks. We will continue to review the balance between dividends and share buybacks on an ongoing basis, taking into account markets and industry norms and the impact on shareholder value</p>
          <p>In closing, AmBev once again reported EBITDA growth in the first quarter with strong performances in Quinsa and North America helping to offset the challenges we faced in Brazil. We have robust business plans in place for the rest of the year addressing both top line growth and costs, and we will be leaning heavily on our strong execution capabilities as the year progresses.</p>
          <p>I will now hand back to Alisa as we open up for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. Just wanted to have you give us a sense of how, given that this is the second most important quarter of the year, how you're looking for &#x2013; and I understand from your prepared comments that you have a plan and looking for the SG&amp;A increases in Brazil &#x2013; how you see the effectiveness of these marketing campaigns so that you can recover the volumes for the year. I also understand that you're facing the second most important quarter in the fourth quarter, you're facing tough comparisons, how you're going to be in looking &#x2013; how we should be looking in terms of volumes for beer in 2008, and in terms of competition as well, pricing. Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Andrea, this is Luiz. Let me first say something in the volume pieces. Of course, I think we made it very clear during the speeches and in our press releases that this is not a regular quarter, first Q was disappointing for us in terms of industry volume. But we have to accept the fact that the weather didn't help. I mean the weather is basically the biggest negative effect that we have. I think for those that are Brazilians and live here in the country, you have the opportunity to see, to read and to live in such a very bad weather. And of course Carnival is not something unexpected, we knew the carnival, but the fact is the early that Carnival happens, the earlier the year starts for everyone. So school starts before, then you have all the expenses for the school, people get back to their regular routine. So when you have such a bad weather that impacted mostly &#x2013; most of the regions, but it's specifically Southeast and South even more. And you have early Carnival in the year, its clear that the first Q does not represent our expectations for the year, though it's disappointing for us of course.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the pricing, Luiz, thank you so much for your comment, but in terms of the pricing we saw that some of your competitors delayed even more. I mean, your second trench of the price increase and in March. Can you comment if they are read following that and if you're seeing the price gap reducing? Hello?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. So I was just following up of what Luiz was saying in terms of the pricing, I mean the volumes. Just on his comment, I would like to know more about the pricing strategy. I understand that the company has placed two price increases the last couple of months, one in December and another one in March, and if competitors seems to have delayed their price increase, so there's some positive momentum if they do increase prices now, which I believe they are doing. So if you can comment on the pricing environment, I would appreciate, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andrea. The price environment, I think, didn't change from more or less growth. We increased prices in internals during December in different moments for the brand. Most of our competitors followed that price increase during January and February. Not all of them, but most of them, then we waited until Carnival to increase can prices this year. We did that, but unfortunately, most of our competitors didn't follow the price. So, the gap opened a little bit in can prices.</p>
          <p>We don't know if you ask what's going to happen. We heard some of them in their results announcements say that they did &#x2013; they did increase pressure at the end of March, we haven't seen that so far in the market. We have to wait and see if they are under pressure, not in terms of cost and how they are going to react to the can prices. But even though our share in the first Q was higher that last year, and it's not only the comparison against last year but it is also the comparison in the moment before the price increase and the moment after the price increase. So when you compare how much we lost during this period, we lost only 60% of the losses we had from '06 to '07.</p>
          <p>So we think we did a good implementation of the price and we put several, and are still putting on several initiatives in the market to recover the same level of the end of last year. So the environment for beer is pretty much the same that we had last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Luiz. And if you can comment, I understand that you had market share, it's about to be released, the market share for April. Can you give us an idea of what that was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wish I could, but I don't have the number so it's probably going be issued in the next couple of days, and you'll know as soon as we have it. Of course, we have our own numbers we track, that we monitor, but its very difficult to predict. But I would say we continue positive that we will recover share during the year as we've done last year, in 2006, in 2005. So we have the skills, we have the people and the programs in place to recover the share.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to start with looking at the comps per hectoliter, the increase that you saw in the quarter of 13%. In the invest call earlier they mentioned that you had bought some malt at the end of the year because of the strong fourth quarter that you didn't end up needing because of the volume trends, but that caused your cost to be higher. I guess I'd love to understand, have you used up all that higher cost malt, and if you could help us understand what your cost inflation would have been had you not had that higher malt cost in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Lore, it's Graham Staley. Yes, the 13.1% was driven by a combination of things. We knew about the cost of malt in general terms. We knew we got a higher cost of corn, salary inflation, all of that being offset by the benefits of currency that we also anticipated. We are not self sufficient in malt in Brazil, as you well know, so we did have to buy some malt at some point during the year. We took the decision to buy that early in the year. That's basically a procurement decision based on what we think the trends are going to be.</p>
          <p>It happened to coincide with that soft volume performance, so it meant we were basically using higher priced third party malt during the first quarter. Substantially used up, I couldn't give you a percentage, but substantially used and maybe a little bit less. We have a small amount to buy for the rest of the year, but it's small so therefore our barley and malt costs are now very predictable for the balance of the year, because we won't have this further purchase of third party malt impacting. Also, as the year progresses, of course, we're hoping for better volumes and that will obviously help on the fixed cost absorption as well.</p>
          <p>So if we look forward at the COGS, as I say, most of our commodity costs we now know, and coupled with the productivity and efficiency initiatives that Luiz mentioned, we have very good visibility on this COGS as the year progresses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I guess I'd love to understand, and maybe it's hard for you to break out what the cost of that third party malt is, but it seemed like its awfully early in the year for you to be feeling lots of inflation from malt and barley if you're hedging one year forward, given that a lot of the grains pressure we see, at least in the publicly traded quotes, was in the second half of the year. So can you just explain to us, was it just that malt barley effect from the third party malt or is there something else that's causing the commodity inflation to be so much disproportionally felt in the early part of the years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me make it very clear, we're not self-sufficient on malt. So we do have to buy some malt, it's a small percentage between 10 to 20% that we have to purchase. We have to purchase that at some point during the year, we purchased it in the first quarter. So that cost is obviously higher than our own produced malt, because there's no profit margin for the third parties with our own produced malt. That cost is now in the books, out of the way, there is a tiny bit of it to use up, but substantially the malt we will use in the future is based on our barley hedges that are already in place, and that's our unmarked malt production. So we know what those costs are going to be. So you shouldn't be seeing a third party malt impact in the remaining quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one more question on this if I could, and then I want to ask another question. What I am understanding is that you have a good sense of what your costs are for the grains, and if we strip out the malt and barley effect of this third party in the first quarter, you would see a more stable environment for COGS per hectoliter for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The three drivers, and then I'll summarize it, the three drivers with a third party malt &#x2013; not barley, third party malt &#x2013; that cost will go away as we now go to the remaining three quarters. There was some increased corn cost which we can't hedge, there isn't sufficient market to hedge corn. We're seeing corn costs coming down, which is positive for us, and the third driver in the first quarter was fixed cost absorption, obviously we expect volumes to improve. We've crunched our numbers, as you well know, and we still keep our guidance that AmBev as a whole will keep its cost of goods per hectoliter below the weighted average inflation rate, and Brazil obviously clearly will be well below the low inflation in order to offset some of the challenges in other parts of the group.</p>
          <p>I might as well deal here with sugar, while we're on the line, I mean sugar you will see continued good performance from the CSD and NANC business because sugar is favorable as we look forward with our hedges, and indeed so is currency with the CSD and NANC business. So, cost of goods per hectoliter on the CSD and NANC will certainly improve as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect, that's helpful. And just in terms of what are you using as your target, or your estimate rather, for weighted average inflation in your franchises for '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All that is, is simply look at our cost of goods by market. And then we take the CPI in those market and we do a weighted average calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm just asking, what is the number for '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That comes up to around 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>5%, okay. And just if I could ask quickly to Luiz Fernando, you mentioned that competitors lagged the price increase in the civil markets and I know that some have. But it seems like the market share in March was lost to Schincariol &#x2013; maybe it's anecdotal but I didn't see that when I was recently in Brazil, that their prices look like they lagged. So can you comment specifically on why you think Schincariol took as much share in March. Is it national wide they lag pricing, do you see them moving pricing? That would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of returnables Schincariol followed our prices. In cans, not really. So as to our price increase &#x2013; since our price increase mid-February and to now, we haven't seen any competitor, most of the volume from our competitors increasing can prices, all right. So what is different here is that FEMSA did not follow any price increase, both in cans &#x2013; nor in cans nor in returnables compared to last year, according to the news and data we have and according to what we see in the market so far.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good day, everybody. Luiz Fernando, I had a question with respect to &#x2013; any evidence, anecdotal or otherwise of a stepped up environment of tax evasion among some of the less formal brewers in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat the question, Bob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Luiz, I'm hearing that there could stepped up kind of evasion activity amongst the less formal brewers of Brazil and there is &#x2013; there is even talk in the trade with respect too complete breweries that are off low monitors. Is there any evidence for that, anecdotal or otherwise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know exactly what you're mentioning, but I think the environment in Brazil improved a lot since the four meters implementation. You'll look at the tax collection from the federal government and that improved a lot since 2004-2005, ahead of industry growth. That's what we see so far. Of course, we don't have any guarantee that the system is perfect and all the tax collection is being made from all the competitors. So we still have reasons to believe that it hasn't been solved completely in the beer side and the CSD side we haven't seen implementation of the four meters yet. That's what I can mention to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then the next question was really with respect to the opportunity set that you can see in Argentina. And I was wondering as well &#x2013; very impressed with the revenue management activity in Argentine CSDs. What other opportunities of that magnitude continue to be out there for you in Quinsa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bob. Well basically, as I was saying before, I think in Argentina we have been taking an advantage of somewhat good economic condition. Basically, economic condition is giving much more purchasing power to middle class and low income classes, which is giving <mark type="inaudible" /> for trading up. So what you're seeing the top line, you're seeing two things. One is, in one side, affordable products, a lot of people that needs to have much of potential, they need to have much higher costs because then it's affecting their volumes. We have prices in line with inflation, and just for having in line with inflation it's having a very good impact on volume, so that's the one possible effect.</p>
          <p>The second possible effect, because people also have more purchasing power, they are trading up. So you are seeing volume growth rates of premium brands about 50-60%, and from here the segment is doubling its percentage in terms of the mix participation. So that's also a boost in volume and also a boost in net sales for auxiliary. Looking forward a little bit and we have, so far, we have good economic conditions as well as good weather and last year we had good economic conditions and bad weather. So it's a good comparison; looks like it's going to stay for some time, so I think we will continue to benefit from the same things.</p>
          <p>The results of Asia <mark type="inaudible" /> capturing margin from trade and from distribution so we are also benefiting from some of that slightly increase in terms of the distribution participation. So I think those are the good news.</p>
          <p>If you ask what do I worry about, I mean, I think the worry is whether those conditions change which we don't foresee for the moment. But it's a bit of a rollercoaster situation. Right now I think the company is structured to take full advantage. I think we should continue to see this going forward as long as the marketplace remains the same.</p>
          <p>What we are also doing, which I think is very interesting, is the launch of new products, we launched it last year <mark type="inaudible" /> which very quickly became almost the third most important project we have. We just launched it now last week red lager with some other innovation and I mean, the last few weeks were very exciting.</p>
          <p>And the same thing is happening in CSD. CSD we have also launched new higher margin products. We launched it last year Cocktail, with the concept of non-sugarized tonic, which also particularly took a 10% of the mix with a higher price. New products in the H2OH! line with also higher margins &#x2013; so very healthy pipeline, healthy product and innovation pipeline, and new products. So I think those are the main points that we have going on right now and going forward in the short-term.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi everybody. I wanted just to go back to the cash SG&amp;A in Brazil Beer. I mean, I guess in prior calls, you've given a sense of how to kind of model this going in line with inflation and volume growth curves. But, I mean, I have to say that in the last couple of quarters there seems to be a pretty important disconnect. I mean cash SG&amp;A fourth quarter fell flat and very good volumes and in this past quarter, seasonally strong quarter, you've had a surge in this cash SG&amp;A and fall in volume.</p>
          <p>And I guess trying to get a handle on what's really going on with your spend. If you could give us some color, I mean are you basically trying to put more money behind brand equity initiatives, in other words, rather than volume activation efforts, is it really just behind maybe some of your premium brands? Just if you could give us some sense of really why are we seeing such a disconnect here between volume and the cash SG&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning Alex. It's Graham Staley. I will take a shot of this and hand over to Luiz who will talk about the brand volume side. It is very difficult to use that algorithm on a quarterly basis. If you recall from the Q4 call I did stress it was annual algorithm.</p>
          <p>So that basically, if you take the full year, both in soft drinks and beer, you will see SG&amp;A growing in line with about 30% of the volume growth, in line with inflation and plus a small amount for direct distribution expansion. As you know we have very detailed funds, very detailed forecasting models, we know exactly what we are going to spend for the rest of the year. And that algorithm holds true, as far as we are concerned.</p>
          <p>Now individual in quarters the commercial guys clearly take decisions based on opportunities that they see for the brands in the particular marketplaces. And so it's very difficult for me to model it on a quarterly basis, but annually the algorithm holds. I will hand over to Luiz who may have some specific comments on timing and such.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi Alex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First it's important that you understand that we are competing in such a very, very competitive market today. So we cannot become very predictable because if we are very predictable for you, we are predictable also for our competitors. So we are competing with some companies that are learning how to compete, they learn from our practice, so they are very active in the market. So this is first learning.</p>
          <p>Then if you &#x2013; you are right that if you go back last year for the first quarter we spent more than you could imagine, then in the fourth quarter we came down again because we decided to anticipate some of the initiatives for the pre-summer initiatives and to prepare our market to the summer. This year we decided to anticipate a little bit because we had the price increase not in the same way of last year.</p>
          <p>We had a carnival &#x2013; earlier carnival this year, so we knew our competitors would concentrate a lot of money in the first Q. So it's also how our competition concentrates or not their investment during the year. So it didn't have to do with higher level of investments, of course we continue to increase investments as our volume progresses, and of course, as the profitability of the business becomes more attractive and for our competitors is the same.</p>
          <p>We have to maintain our brands performing well, we have to maintain our market programs and we have to increase our share of the market. So it has noting to do with the long-term shift in terms of how we're supporting the commercial initiatives, but has to do with moving the initiatives back and forth and sometimes postponing, sometimes anticipating but looking at the market how it's going and the best way to impact the money in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it would be fair then to look at the full year '08, cash, SG&amp;A, for beer and soft drinks, you mentioned earlier, to be in line with &#x2013; roughly in line with volume growth plus inflation, is that algorithm as you are going to discuss it for '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me clarify this again; roughly 30% of the volume growth translates into growth in SG&amp;A, so if volume growth is 3% or 5% then the SG&amp;A would grow by 1% or 1.5%. We then add on inflation, 4, 5%, plus small amount in &#x2013; between 1 and 2% for the expansion of direct distribution. That algorithm has been reliable over the last two or three years and we see no reason to deviate from that in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and just the second and last question; Graham I know you've kind of have had a chance to take a look at some of your beer &#x2013; your raw material costs into, at least the future prices, for the first part of '09. And could you give us a sense of roughly how that might be looking if you take, let's say, the first three or four months of the prices that you have seen in that future market for your inputs in '09 versus where you've kind of just finished here in the first three or four months of '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'd prefer not to at this point in time, I think it's a little bit early to do that, I don't want to flag it too much for competition, either. We do have an understanding of this, as you say, for the first four months, but I think that I'd prefer to wait until later in the year to give you some insight into that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi my first question actually, sorry to go back to the barley issue but just so I understand the mechanics behind that third party purchase. I understand that you &#x2013; you said you purchased that back in the third quarter, if I understood you correctly and if that's the case, did that therefore effectively weigh on margins in some way? I think you said it was a higher part of the mix in '07 for the fourth quarter and that, given the volume and revenue performance you had, it diluted it that much more. Is that the right way to think about it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Celso, good morning. No, I don't think we said it was Q3. It was the end of 2007, beginning of 2008 when we purchased it, revising the effect of the average costs that we incurred for the quarter and that's why you've seen that increase in cost of goods for the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify, the function we use, we've only got a small amount more <mark type="inaudible" /> volume.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, about last year you presumed also by third party you bought at the different time of the year and obviously...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on availability, it depends on pricing...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the second question is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me explain you something. We were &#x2013; in the fourth quarter last year, volumes were growing very fast, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have to make a decision because if first you have performance in the same way as first Q, then we needed the malts to complement or to &#x2013; adding on top of our own malts that we produced. Of course when you take the balance of the year we don't need as much more malt, right? But in the first Q we had imported malts to guarantee that we could produce the volume according to our expectations; that didn't happen but we used them up anyway, right? That is exactly what happened. So we already used the imported malts, we don't need the same amount for the rest of the year</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don't forget everyone, there are other ways you could add on the imported malt, but another factors, of course, is that not only the timing of the purchase of that third party malt, the price of malt this year is higher anyway because of the cost of barley over the last nine months or so. So that's an extra impact, as well, in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's clear; I think just the more we understand the mechanics a bit better. And also, another mechanics question, unfortunately &#x2013; on the bottle rollout of 630 mls, we understand that you are rolling out in Rio, I think you said if I understood correctly, there were reports that they were in another state as well. Is that something you anticipate to be rolled out much more fully across the country and also within the mechanics side, is that expense incurred in the COGS line or is it an SG&amp;A number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we launched the bottle last year as a pilot in the south of Brazil, in <mark type="inaudible" /> too, using Bolivia as a pilot, just to pass the mechanics. In Rio, we had a great opportunity; in fact it has been performing very well and Skol was not in the same place. So given the analysis we have for the Rio market, we saw that as a huge opportunity to change the way we are doing business in returnables.</p>
          <p>So we decided to bring in a much more relevant fashion than the pilot, there was a premium brand, a small volume, in the south. And consumers reacted very well to the proposition because they could acquire more beer for the same price, so they get an additional 30 ml at the same price, which doesn't cost the same for us, because of course you dilute all of your costs, the logistic cost and the production costs. So we could offer a better proposition to our consumers.</p>
          <p>They loved the bottle, it's more beautiful, it's younger, it's more sophisticated, than the traditional and old 6 ml bottle. And we had the opportunity to solve other problems, too, related to the old bottle. So far, the decision is to implement that only with Skol in Rio. We are analyzing the results. We are happy with the results but not still confident &#x2013; not yet confident that we can roll out in other regions. Of course if that goes very well and that proves to be a great alternative we are going to roll out but it's still too early to say.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow up though on the mechanics side in the terms of the accounting; should we see that rollout expense which I imagine is a one-off for the time that it's phased in, in the COGS line as a &#x2013; or in the SG&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically we are replacing bottles, so we bring 600 ml bottles back in exchange for the 630. So, you don't have any additional cost. If you have as CapEx anticipation, that's what we did &#x2013; we usually buy bottles to replace breakage during the year, so we anticipate the acquisition of the bottles. And then we place that into the market, bringing back the 600 ml. So during the year we're going to use this 600 ml bottles that we brought back, too, for <mark type="inaudible" />, for Burma, and of course for the regions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is &#x2013; I thought I understood it as a partially an explanation for SG&amp;A spike but that sounds like it wouldn't be because it's just a <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah you are right. There's nothing to do with the bottle, it has to do with the campaign to launch the bottle in Rio, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we &#x2013; of course we not only implemented bottle but we provide consumers with the new so that we share with them, of course, to motivate them to go first call.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In that campaign we should take them as a one quarter rollout in Rio rather than a fourth quarter rollout?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">

          <p>Thank you, our next question is coming from Trevor Stirling with Sanford Bernstein, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, good afternoon gentlemen. Couple of questions for you &#x2013; first thing focusing in on the consumer issue, or the beer volume issues, in Brazil, you mentioned that April is looking much more positive with volumes coming back about 3.1%. Is that applied for CSDs as well &#x2013; are you seeing a similar recovery in CSD volumes?</p>
          <p>And I guess partly linked to that, in many other Latin American countries we are seeing similar levels of high food inflation, which should be impacting the levels of the C&amp;D consumers in those countries. But we don't seem to quite have the same volume weakness. Does that imply maybe more a weather related thing in Brazil rather than the consumer income?</p>
          <p>And the third question, specifically about HILA-ex, the price mix for revenue per hectoliter in HILA-ex seems to have dropped by almost 5% in the period and I was wondering is that a mix effect or does that reflect increased pricing or price competition in one of the HILA-ex countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all on the soft drink side, you are right, the performance in April in soft drinks was better than in the first Q but maybe not as good as beer. We are still seeing more in soft drinks, in gateway and H2O &#x2013; these products have proven to be much more related to the weather &#x2013; that's why in beer we don't see the same effects of the weather.</p>
          <p>On average, you have soft drinks less depend on weather but when it's too cool, that's what will happen in the short term. We suffered more because Asia became very relevant and CSD was really weak at the beginning of the year and continued to be incremental. Its improving but not in the same case of beer, this could just say what is market, what is the market share. Of course when you look at soft drinks they are above last year on average until March, let's see the April numbers. But of course we have to accelerate some of the initiatives.</p>
          <p>Well we have the beer fresh &#x2013; you know that after price increase we mobilized our sales force because we know there will be other pressure in the market share of beer. Of course, that brings some <mark type="inaudible" /> from the CSD side in the beer side to guarantee that we don't lose more than is planned and to recover faster. And this means that beer will recover during the next few months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well and &#x2013; but inflation, you're probably right. There are differences among countries that effect the food inflation among countries. But consider the fact that in Brazil you have the carnival on top of the weather. So the weather was very negative and the early carnival makes people spend money at the very beginning of the year. Then they have to pay their taxes, they are &#x2013; they have to put their children into school. And on top of that you have an acceleration of food installation that is partly, of course, for the international demand and partly for the internal demand compared to the crops we had in some specific products. So it's really difficult to compare because we don't have all the drivers in all the countries and we have all of these facts that brought us &#x2013; our quarter down.  So I think in the next few months, so in the second and third quarter, will be easier to compare and to see if these facts are right or wrong.</p>
          <p>One thing that I could add is that when you look at premium brand we grow around 9% and premium brands, of course, they are consumed by the classes A&amp;D compared to the mainstream brands more consumed by the classes C&amp;D. So, yes there was an effect on the food inflation in the short-term, but of course less than the impact of the weather and the early carnival.</p>

          <p>Very helpful thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you had question in HILA with regards to price &#x2013; is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right, it appears revenue per hectoliter dropped about 5% in the quarter for beer and HILA-ex?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. When you compare quarter-on-quarter, we asses comp because volumes were much better than last year, but this volume increase, it's in the back of the share increase. There, of course, we implemented several initiatives this March, <mark type="inaudible" /> initiatives into Dominican Republic, that the bottom line they are positive, all right, compared to the historical that we had but when you look at net revenues, they brought our prices down. And on top of that we had some tax increases in Dominican Republic, in Venezuela, at the very end of last year that we haven't recovered with price increase there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, thank you for your patience. I have just a very quick question. Regard taxes, I would like to know if possible how much is the IPI or all your fixed tax per hectoliter represents of your average price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would have to check -I don't' know if I have the exact number, but it's broken by the taxes we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could be an average or &#x2013; just to figure out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me check if I have the numbers available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question means &#x2013; I am a bit concerned with the potential impact of the change to taxations on the margin system instead of a fixed price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, of course every tax increase will have an impact on our prices or, depending on the decision to increase prices on top of the inflation to compensate for that demand, and of course depending on the level of the increase.</p>
          <p>We know there are rumors of a possible change in the IPI, but it's too early to comment on that. We haven't been informed by anyone that there will be a tax increase, a federal tax increase. Or at least we haven't discussed that with any authorities so far. If it comes, depending on the size of it, we'll have to make a decision as we did for example in Venezuela not to pass to prices in the short-term. We're probably doing in the future, but of course we have to make a decision of that.</p>
          <p>On an average, it should take a longer term. It's natural that we try to compensate tax increases with price increases. We see government concerned with inflation. So they know increasing taxes would have an effect on the inflation, on the overall inflation. So, and we see the tax collection at the federal level increasing given volume performance, given the industry performance, last year. So it's too early to say anything about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I agree with you in terms of the inflation that's a very good argument for the government. But the price &#x2013; at least on the newspapers they said about something 40% in terms of tax rate. But that's &#x2013; I would like to know how it compares today for AmBev. Because my understanding, that's much higher than paid given your brands which are much better and have much higher price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think we will need a lot of time to discuss the tax system in Brazil and how it really effects the &#x2013; because you have for the IPI, you have the discontinued, you have the <mark type="inaudible" />, the legislation is one thing, the way it is applied in pricing in a different calculation from the theory to the practice. So maybe we could treat that off line. It's a long, long answer and I'm not sure I'm prepared to share all the discussions with you guys now.</p>
