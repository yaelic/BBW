          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Please note that this conference call Web cast will be recorded and will consist of copywrited materials. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I would now turn the call over to Mr. Andy Clark. Mr. Clark, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Bob Kelly, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as several members of our executive management team.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement on Page 12 of the press release and those identified in the documents filed with the SEC that are available on our Web site, bnymellon.com.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, April 19, 2011, and we will not update forward-looking statements. This morning's press release provides the highlights of our results. We also have the quarterly earnings review document available on our Web site, which provides a quarterly review of the total company and individual businesses. We will be using the quarterly earnings review document to discuss our results.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone. EPS was $0.50 or $625 million in the first quarter. Given the seasonality of our business model, it's probably most useful to focus on year-over-year comparisons. That's because we're coming off the fourth quarter, when performance fees from investment management and corporate action fees and DRs are seasonally at their absolute peek, so sequential comparisons are less valuable, frankly.</p>
          <p>Total revenue grew 9% year-over-year, primarily due to acquisitions, but not entirely, and we'll come back to that. We continue to grow faster outside the U.S. Non-US revenue was 37% in the first quarter. That's up 200 basis points from a year ago. We're continuing to see good growth in investment management fees. They're up 12% year-over-year and AUM was up 11% in Q1 to a new high of $1.2 trillion. Fee growth in our Investment Management &#x2013; or our Investment Services businesses was 27%. And even excluding the impact of acquisitions last year, it was still up a good 9%. Clearing had perhaps our strongest quarter, up 27% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Asset Servicing continued to benefit from new business and acquisitions. Assets Under Custody was $25.5 trillion, a new record, up 14% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Net interest revenue does indeed remain constrained, due to short, very low short-term interest rates and, and our hope is, we may have seen the low point of the year in Q1. And despite 25% higher volumes in FX and other trading, this category was negatively impacted by very, very low volatility this quarter. It was down 22% from the previous quarter and down about -- and it's currently, I think, at the lowest rates since 2007 and that is the primary driver of our FX revenue.</p>
          <p>On the new business front, we had six &#x2013; or this'll be our sixth consecutive quarter of positive long-term asset inflows for investment management. We actually had $31 billion for the quarter, almost double what we saw in the first quarter of 2010. Wealth Management had a record level of client assets and has a strong pipeline. And the Depository Receipts business continues to have a very strong win rate.</p>
          <p>You may have noticed that our provision was $0. So this will be the third quarter in a row it was $0 or negative. Expenses were up sharply, but roughly half of that was due to acquisitions, and litigation expenses increased, as well. Expenses actually declined 2% sequentially, which includes the impact of litigation expenses, as well. We're viewing litigation as core at the moment and a reflection of the environment we're operating in. I see this as the last phase of the financial crisis, with plaintiffs seeking to recover losses. It's a sad reality of the U.S. legal system and, it's a fact that the entire industry is facing, including us, and it will continue to be somewhat of a risk. In the end, we'll navigate through it.</p>
          <p>The fundamental strength of our business model is our ability to rapidly grow capital and generate a high return on it. This quarter, we generated almost $800 million of Tier 1 common, up 7% from last quarter or 28% annualized. Tier 1 common equity is really our key regulatory capital and are constrained until Basel III is implemented. So we really focus on our return on Tier 1 common. In Q1, we earned a 21% return on it. And we did so with a top quartile capital ratio, versus the top 10 banks. And after the most recent regulatory review and approval process, we've begun executing on our plans to return capital to shareholders.</p>
          <p>We increased our quarterly dividend by 44% to $0.13 per quarter, and you may have noted that during the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock. And we expect to continue that program in the second quarter. So to sum up, I would view revenue growth, at this point, in the mid-single-digit range, when you strip away everything in terms of acquisitions and unusual items.</p>
          <p>New business trends and pipelines are in good shape. We continue to deliver revenue growth in this environment, although, of course, we have to remember it is constrained by the low interest rates and low FX volatility. If volatility picks up, so will revenues in those categories. We're focused on keeping expense growth down and we're going to do more to mute it, but we do have somewhat higher costs in the first quarter, for reasons that Todd will spend a little bit more detail on. We are generating lots of capital and we make a very strong return on it and we are returning capital to shareholders.</p>
          <p>So with that, why don't I turn it over to Todd to go through the numbers in more detail and then we'll open it up for questions. Todd?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. Before getting into the numbers, I'd like to highlight the changes that we've made to our business line reporting. I think you'll find that this adds focus to our principle businesses.</p>
          <p>Investment Management now includes the former Asset Management and Wealth Management businesses. Investment Services includes the former Asset Servicing, Issuer and Clearing Services, as well as the Cash Management business previously included in Treasury Services. The credit-related activities previously included in Treasury Services are now included in Other. And we've reclassified all of our prior periods accordingly. These changes are consistent with our internal reporting structure. They're consistent with how we evaluate performance and decide on resource allocations, and they should make it easier to understand our company and how it's performing.</p>
          <p>With that said, let's go through the numbers and we'll begin with page 3 of the quarterly earnings review, where we present some of the highlights of the quarter. I will focus primarily on year-over-year comparisons, given the seasonality in our business model that Bob just mentioned.</p>
          <p>On a year-over-year basis, earnings for the quarter of $0.50 were up 2% versus the year-ago quarter. Total revenue of $3.6 billion was up 9%. Fee revenue was up 12%, principally reflecting the acquisitions in Investment Services, as well as higher market values and net new business in our Investment Management and Investment Services business. FX and other trading results were down, primarily due to lower fixed income and derivatives trading revenue. Net interest revenue was down 9%, due to the continued impact of the low rate environment. Non-interest expenses increased 11%, primarily driven by the acquisitions, and was down 2% sequentially, and that includes the $47 million in litigation expenses during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 5, you'll see a new page we've added to the earnings review to call out some of the business metrics that will help you understand our underlying performance. Assets Under Management and Assets Under Custody reached record levels in the quarter, reflecting higher market values and net new business. Assets Under Management were up 11% year-over-year, 5% sequentially to a record level of $1.2 trillion.</p>
          <p>First quarter long-term inflows were $31 billion. This is the highest level of inflows since our merger and it more than offsets the short-term outflows of $5 billion. For perspective here, consider that for all of 2010, we had a $48 billion in long-term flows, which itself was a record. Long-term inflows benefited from strength in fixed income and equity indexed products.</p>
          <p>Assets Under Custody was up 14% year-over-year to a record level of $25.5 trillion, benefiting from the acquisitions, higher market values and new business. The other Investment Service metrics continued to show positive trends, with the exception of corporate trust, where the environment continues to be challenging. DR programs increased, all clearing metrics improved and the Broker-Dealer tri-party book continues to grow.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 7 of the earnings review, which shows fee growth, on a year-over-year basis, our fee revenue was up 12%, which would be about 2% if you excluded the acquisitions. That increase also reflects very high Other Trading Income in the first quarter of last year, as well as gains on the disposition of leases and a large translation gain in the first quarter of last year; if you adjust for these, our core underlying fee revenue growth grew at about 8%.</p>
          <p>Investment Service fees were up 20% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisitions, as well as new business, improved market values and seasonality. We continue to benefit from the acquisitions made last year. During the first quarter, Asset Servicing picked up a large piece of transfer agency business from an existing client because of the new GIS capabilities. Pershing also had some nice revenue synergy wins from GIS. The BHF acquisition helped us win new asset management, asset servicing, Pershing and broker-dealer services businesses in Germany, as we now have a meaningful presence there. These are all pieces of business we would have never won without the acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Asset Servicing fees year-over-year benefited from the acquisitions, as well as higher market values and net new business. During the quarter, we won an incremental $500 billion in new Asset Servicing Custody business, our strongest new business quarter in a year. And we have approximately $740 billion in new assets to be converted.</p>
          <p>Issuer Service fees were up 5% year-over-year, due to higher DR revenue, reflecting higher corporate action in issuance and cancellation fees. Fees were down 14% sequentially, primarily reflecting seasonally lower DR revenue. Corporate Trust fees were relatively flat to both periods, as new business was offset by a continuing decline in revenue from structured products. Clearing fees were up 27% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially, due to strong growth in mutual fund assets and positions, increased daily average revenue trades, higher market values and new business. As we mentioned in January, we've been converting some significant clearing business and expect to see a positive impact from those wins in the second quarter. The year-over-year increase also reflects the impact of the GIS acquisition.</p>
          <p>Investment Management had a strong quarter, reflecting the benefit of new business, higher equity values, improved investor performance, but was also impacted by performance fee seasonality. Adjusting for performance fees, Investment Management fees were up 11% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially, reflecting higher period end-market values and the impact of net new business, driven by strong investment performance. Also reflecting our strong investment performance was the 31% year-over-year increase in performance fees.</p>
          <p>FX and other trading was down 24% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. FX revenue totaled $173 million. That's a decrease of 1% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, with both decreases primarily due to a decline in volatility. I should add that volumes were up each period, so our clients are doing more trading with us. We measure volatility quarterly based on the profile of currencies that we trade and volatility in the first quarter of 2011 was at the lowest level since 2007. Other trading revenue for the quarter was $25 million, and that compares to $52 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower fixed income and derivatives trading.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 8 of the earnings review, NIR and the related margin continue to be impacted by low short-term interest rates globally and our risk reduction strategy, the latter negatively affecting NII but also lowering credit charges. NIR was down 9% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. On a sequential basis, NII was down approximately $15 million, due primarily to timing difference on hedges and day count in the first quarter. It is also being impacted by our defensive position on duration and credit.</p>
          <p>However, at the end of the first quarter, we started putting some of our excess liquidity to work in a secured loan program and the purchase of high-quality asset-backed securities. These actions, along with the recent rate increase announced by the ECB, will allow us to maintain NII closer to fourth quarter levels going forward until we see a movement in U.S. interest rates.</p>
          <p>Net interest margin was 1.49%, compared with 1.54% in the prior quarter, reflecting the same factors that I just mentioned and a much larger than expected balance sheet. The balance sheet was larger for most of the quarter and actually spiked at quarter-end in a flight to quality, given the events in North Africa and Japan.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 9, on expenses, non-interest expense increased 11% year-over-year and decreased 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects higher expenses associated with the acquisitions, our revenue mix, and higher employee benefits expense. Adjusting for the acquisitions and litigation, core expenses are up about 8% and, if you recall, that's in line with our core fee revenue growth rate of about 8%. The sequential decrease reflects seasonality, which was offset somewhat by higher litigation, pension and healthcare expenses.</p>
          <p>On page 10, which shows the distribution of our investment securities portfolio, you can see that the pre-tax net unrealized gain in our securities portfolio increased by $216 million to $569 million, reflecting a continued trend of tighter spreads on residential mortgage-backed securities. I would also point out that our economic decision to hold the securities in the grantor trust has paid off, as these securities have now got an unrealized gain of $823 million, up almost $250 million over the quarter.</p>
          <p>Also, on page 10, you can see that we continued to generate significant capital during the quarter. Tier 1 common was up approximately $800 million or 7% over the fourth quarter, and we generated a 21% return on Tier 1 common. As a result of capital growth and lower risk-weighted assets, our key regulatory capital ratios increased significantly. Tier 1 was up 60 basis points to 14%, and Tier 1 common also increased 60 basis points to 12.4%. As Bob noted, we're now able to return capital to our shareholders and we've increased the dividend 44% to $0.13 per share, and we've also started to buy back our shares.</p>
          <p>We continue to expect to exceed the Tier 1 common Basel III 2013 requirement by the end of this year and we won't be constrained in terms of pursuing any opportunities for growth, though we expect significantly less M&amp;A activity as we focus on our integrations and cost reductions.</p>
          <p>Looking at our loan portfolio, there was no provision for credit losses in the quarter, compared to a credit of $22 million in the fourth quarter and a charge of $35 million in the first quarter of 2010. NPAs, which were already low at $399 million at the end of 2010, declined to $386 million. The allowance for credit losses decreased $17 million as a result of net charge-offs of $17 million.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 29.3%. That's up 200 basis points compared to 27.3% last quarter and was relatively flat to the year-ago quarter. We continue to expect our tax rate for the full year to be approximately 30%.</p>
          <p>Before I comment on the outlook, I'd like to bring your attention to page 14. Here we have provided a new metric that you can see in the middle of the page. As you can see, Investment Services fees as a percentage of non-interest expense grew from 91% a year-ago to 94% this quarter and it would have been 97%, except for the litigation expenses. Our goal is to increase this ratio as we get more efficient and we rely less on capital markets income to drive our performance in this business and more on trust fees.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic that the revenue momentum will continue in the coming quarters, based on our investment performance and the strength in our Asset Servicing and Clearing businesses. We also continue to benefit from the acquisitions, both in terms of increased revenue, as well as cross selling our other capabilities to new clients and selling our new capabilities to the rest of our clients.</p>
          <p>DRs should benefit from seasonality in the second quarter. FX will fluctuate based on volumes, volatility and competition. The outlook on volumes is a reflection of the continuing growth of our Investment Services business. Volatility is obviously market-based and we expect that the business will be increasingly competitive. Both NIR and fees continue to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment, but should benefit from our investment program and improve to the fourth quarter levels.</p>
          <p>On the expense front, we're continuing to work on bringing down the cost of delivering our services, while keeping quality high, including through process re-engineering and automation, rationalizing systems and our technology infrastructure, reducing occupancy costs, maximizing our purchasing power through supplier consolidation and continuing to shift positions to lower cost growth centers.</p>
          <p>As you're looking ahead to the second quarter, note that we awarded our annual company-wide merit increase of approximately 2% on April 1st so that will come into our numbers.</p>
          <p>Litigation will continue to be a risk, and finally, we expect to continue to benefit from our risk management strategies, as the quarterly provision should be in the range of $0 to $20 million.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it back to Bob.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today is from Glenn Schorr with Nomura. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. So you keep putting up good business wins and let's just focus on assets under custody right now or asset servicing. Can you tell us what's won but not yet funded? I appreciate the line that shows us what's won on the quarter, but sometimes it's hard to know what's in the funded base.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Glenn. It's Tim Keaney.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Tim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've won in the last four quarters about $1.5 trillion and about $740 billion has yet to convert and that's probably over the next two plus quarters or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I know this is going to be a massive generalization, but what type of -- it's been pretty consistent in the $300 billion to $500 billion a quarter. What type of business is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you see a pretty good mix, Glenn. It's mostly bundled business; although, I would say if you looked over the last four quarters, we've seen a notable uptick in outsourcing generally, mostly in the Asset Management segment and the Insurance segment, which we think plays to a real strength for us. And one of the questions, I guess, was asked the last time we were together was, how much of this is new flow? About 63% of the $500 billion we won during the quarter, we took from competition and 37% is what I would characterize as new flow for our industry, like outsourcing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Uh huh. And then, you were, Todd, you were kind enough to give us a comment on half the expense rise was related to acquisitions. Would you be able to tell us how much it contributed on the Revenue line and/or the Assets Under Custody line -- the GIS and BAS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, let me start with the revenue side of it. If you adjust for about $270 million on a year-over-year basis, that would bring us down, after acquisitions, total revenues, to about 2.3% year-over-year. And, Glenn, before &#x2013; what I'd like to add to that is, in the first quarter of last year, we had very high investment income, so we had a -- we had a translation adjustment that went in our favor and we also had -- we had the benefit of disposal of a number of leases. And we also had unusually high trading income in our derivatives book. So if you adjust for those two things, the core underlying fee revenue is at about 8%. And you had a follow-up question, Glenn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I got it, yeah, no. Thank you. Yeah, last one. Sorry. So FX has gotten a lot of attention lately. I know it's just one quarter. You're down 16% sequentially and I think that the press release attributed it to just decline in volatility. Can you just give us a blanket statement on what's going on in terms of the existing suits, the other inquiries from customers, and what you see the outlook for how that business is both priced and executed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glenn, why don't I talk to that for a minute and then maybe Jim Palermo can talk to it because it reports up to him, but frankly, the reporting on this issue just isn't accurate and in many ways, it's actually misleading. We continue to enjoy very strong use of our Standing Instruction program, which really, everyone does in our industry. And why do they do it? Why do we still have very strong usage? It's because it's very valuable to clients. The facts are, volumes were way up in the quarter. It's actually 25% up year-over-year. Volatility, which is the biggest driver of FX revenue, traders can't make money unless there's volatility, it was down 22% linked quarter and the lowest level since 2007. When volatility's low, it's really hard to make money. Pricing has always been really competitive and, I would say, due to this recent attention, it's even more so today. We're being really responsive to the needs of our clients and -- and we're going to continue to be.</p>
          <p>What I'd also say, though, is we're only capturing a small percentage of our clients' FX flow because it is so competitive. And we actually view this as a fantastic opportunity, over time, to gain a lot more business. So that's the big picture. This is actually a good business and we think we can grow it over time. Jim? What would you add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob. All good points and clearly, it is a competitive environment, but we're doing a number of things in discussions with clients that we've had. In fact, just last week, we met with our Client Advisory Board, which is the top clients from all around the globe, and they're very supportive of the program that we have in place. Matter of fact, we began to introduce some of our enhanced technology that we're applying to the FX execution world. And that will enable us to offer a broader array of options for clients and their investment managers to execute their activities. And our anticipation is that we'll capture some of that flow that Bob just described.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I just want to follow-up on expenses one more time. So it seems like your business, new business momentum continues to be fairly strong, both asset management and asset servicing. Can you give us a little more color on how you can leverage that a little bit better and specifically, as you're going through your expense management, what -- how much can you actually take out from the run rate here for us to start to see some margin impression aside from rates going up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to take that Todd?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. If you look at our expenses on a &#x2013; and we'll look at it on a year-over-year basis, Alex, I would say we're pretty much in line, adjusting for inflation and &#x2013; excuse me, not inflation &#x2013; the acquisitions and the litigation. It increased at about the same level of -- that we saw the increase in our core fee revenues, probably around 8%. Our benefits expenses were quite a bit higher in the first quarter, as we had indicated previously that they would be. And that's largely medical and pension and now that's &#x2013; now that that's embedded into our run rate. If you back that off, there's probably about 100 basis points of positive operating leverage that we're seeing in our core business.</p>
          <p>And if you look at that number that we described on page 14, you can see that we continue to get more and more efficient because our expenses are decreasing as a function of our core revenues. In a very soft, what we call our capital markets environment, that is the low volatility that we saw in the first quarter, relatively low interest rates and softer SEC lending, our growth rate when we're not growing in those areas, but we are growing our core fees, we would estimate our core growth rate probably to be in the mid-single-digits and we're not going to generate a whole lot of positive operating leverage. We think we can generate a modest amount of positive operating leverage at that kind of expense run.</p>
          <p>However, we do have a number of longer-term programs that we think will continue to help. We have a number of systems that we need to sunset and take that expense run rate out. We do have a number of programs to reduce our technology infrastructure costs. We're starting to see some of the early benefits of the consolidation of our consulting expenses and you can see that in our run rate as we've negotiated better terms and we're doing more of our activity with fewer providers as we continue to improve our procurement activities.</p>
          <p>In a little longer run, we don't have any anticipation of taking any significant charges. We're doing this all through our P&amp;L today, but we also see opportunities to reduce occupancy expense, as we consolidate into fewer locations around the globe. So I think we will generate, in this kind of weak type of revenue environment for the capital market stuff, we'll generate moderate operating leverage where we'll really see it come, once we see a little more &#x2013; a little more on the capital markets side and some of the benefits from our long-term expense reductions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one more follow-up on FX. Is there a way for us to -- for you guys to size for us how much of your FX business comes from really standing instructions versus negotiated trades, just to get to -- help us size that bucket that obviously has been a lot in the press?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Why don't I give you a bigger picture around it? This is Todd. In our total transactions that we do with our clients, 75% of that business is done away from us and 25% of it's done with us. Of that 25%, we have not disclosed the split between standing instruction versus negotiated activity that we perform. But standing instruction is just a part of the total. And it is a pretty small percentage of the total transactions that are done with us. And if you &#x2013; to look even more broadly, you're talking about 6% of our total revenues. So standing instructions are just a part of that 6% of the total revenues for the company.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, thanks. Hi. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Betsy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Todd, when you were talking about modest positive operating leverage, could you just comment on what do you mean by modest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For us, we'd say 50 to 100 basis points is pretty modest, Betsy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that's on an annual basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a little more seasonality than a number of our competitors, as you know, so from a quarter-to-quarter basis, you're going to see some noise one way or the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And then, within that, you're expecting that some of the reinvestments and cost saves that you're going to be getting will drop to the bottom-line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we've been doing and what we've been running through the P&amp;L is we've been reinvesting those cost savings into other things. For example, our global growth strategies have prevented &#x2013; have presented quite a bit to us this year, which we've been reinvesting in the re-engineering efforts that we're doing around the globe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the positive operating leverage is coming from more increased top-line efficiencies or effectiveness, as opposed to dropping any of that to the bottom-line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Ideally, we would like to be able to reinvest the savings probably for a year or two that these efforts are creating, without taking any &#x2013; without taking any single charge related to them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Betsy, it's Bob. One of the things, one of the realities of consolidating premises in different geographies and sunsetting systems, is some of those plans take three to four years to execute. So we have short-term plans and we have medium-term plans, and this isn't a short-term program. This is a long-term program. And to date, as Todd said, we've been reinvesting all our savings. And it's going to make, over the medium-term, it's going to make for a much stronger franchise, and with better client service and a lower cost base, but it's going to take time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but to the degree you're not getting the operating leverage that you wanted, would you consider dropping it to the bottom-line or not for another couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we certainly would. But I think we're going to give you a metric now, Betsy, on page 14, when you look at the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Investment services. You're going to be able to follow how we're doing there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly on capital and buybacks, you indicated what the plan was and you were approved for &#x2013; to up dividend hike, obviously plus the buybacks. Can you give us any sense as to when you would start that buyback program and is it all related to pre or post the SIFI buffer designation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I'd love to take this one, Betsy. We actually started the buybacks last month before we got too close to the earnings release. So in terms of the share buybacks, we will continue as soon as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that's, what, after the next couple of days?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Betsy, we just don't know what the SIFI buffer is going to be at this point, whereas six months ago, we were hearing it could be 25 to 100 basis points. We're also hearing other stories, Basel, where it could be three buckets of 100 basis points to 200 basis points. We just don't know the rules yet. And I understand we're not going to know the rules for some months to come yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but your capital plan wasn't approved with any expectation for a SIFI buffer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the capital plan really was not a Basel III capital plan. They did want to see our roadmap, if you will, to complying with Basel III, but it was really a Tier 1, common Basel I capital ratio. And we do, obviously, we do well just because of the nature of our business and the low-risk balance sheet that we have. I think the other good news is we generated an awful lot, as you could see in this first quarter, an awful lot of both Basel I and even more Basel III capital in the first quarter, so ahead of what our estimates had been.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Hopson with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot. Just a question on pricing, if there's more, I guess, scrutiny of FX rates, et cetera, it's maybe limited your ability to get full pricing. So in terms of the pricing environment with rates low, how do we know, I guess, that you're getting the appropriate &#x2013; how are you getting the appropriate pricing for the new business that's coming in the door?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jeff, it's Tim Keaney here. I think it's really very straightforward, much more of the goal for pricing new business, and frankly, when current clients renew pricing, we're seeing more of our total revenues in fees. And we're being very, very, very conservative, the new reality in terms of what we expect over the term of a contract for NII, FX and securities lending. And I think over a cycle, whether that's three or four years, we're going to see a larger percentage of our revenues coming in the form of fees. And so the good news is, Todd mentioned the win rates. We're not seeing that impact our new business win rates because we're talking very openly about these issues with our clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And other competitors, obviously, face the same issues. Is there a sense that they are moving in this same direction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. And certainly for about a year now, I haven't seen anyone doing what I would have characterized as silly pricing. So I think all of our competitors are doing the same thing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the recent clearing wins and the healthy pipeline you spoke to, is that new business or are you winning it from others and who are you winning it from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Howard, it's Brian Shea. The most -- as you know, we've been talking in the last of couple quarters about the investment we've been making in a large global wealth management firm that was self-clearing. And we converted that client and other new business in the first quarter. So we will see the full, the first full quarter impact of that new revenue in the second quarter. And it's been a successful transition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe, Brian, on my side, in Asset Servicing, we have the best new business pipeline we've had in six quarters. Pipeline's gone up almost 60% year-on-year, largely driven by outsourcing. And one of the things we are looking at is the give-away, take-away ratio for the $500 billion in new business wins in Asset Servicing for the quarter, we won 5.5 times more than we lost in assets, and we won seven times more than we lost in revenue terms. So at least for this quarter, we've been a clear net winner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. That's really helpful color. And then switching gears, Bob, I was hoping to get your thoughts on litigation costs going forward. In your annual letter, you touch on dealing with post-crisis litigation as a priority for the year. I mean, does what happened today largely take care of that or should we anticipate some more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the way I'd think about it is, I've been very open about just talking about the U.S. environment and how unique it is in the Western world, sadly. It's not a good thing for American business. And it's not a good thing for, you know, it's the number one problem in the Healthcare industry, and it's certainly a big problem for the Financial Services industry. And we're going to see it, I would expect for our industry going forward, that it's going to continue to be a risk. Certainly, we -- we record it as soon as we feel that it's probable and estimatable. And that's, that's how we do it. And we try to be conservative in how we account for things. Todd, is there anything you'd add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, I just &#x2013; you -- it continues to be a risk for us and for the industry. And as soon as we can figure out that there is a probability of something going to happen, we'll do something about it, and we think that we've put ourselves -- we're adequately reserved for what we know at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then final one from me, just follow-up on Basel III, realizing we don't know the final rule set yet, but any updated thoughts from either of you on leverage and the liquidity proposals that are out there as it impacts the business model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think the long-term liquidity ratio that we really haven't spent that much time with yet, so I think that's still more in the developmental phase. But it looks like the liquidity coverage ratio, the LCR, is starting to hone in on what we would expect to see with a couple of elements of uncertainty. Given our business model and the huge amount of excess liquidity we maintain, I don't see that as a particular constraining issue for us, Howard.</p>
          <p>In terms of the leverage ratio, I really haven't been overly focused on it at this point. I don't think it will be the constraining ratio for us. There's some question on how you would treat a number of different asset types, but we think the more &#x2013; the ratio that we're going to be more focused on, that the world will be more focused on, is the Tier 1 common. I don't think it's going to change business behavior at this point as I look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just add to that, Howard, that I have the impression in speaking to regulators that they're being very careful on liquidity ratios. They want to study it and understand it better. And they're feeling much more comfortable with the whole capital side, but, of course, liquidity was just as important, in fact, more important than capital during the actual crisis, the financial crisis back in the fourth quarter of '08. So we have to get that one right.</p>
          <p>I am a little surprised, just on the capital side, when we only set the global Basel III capital ratio in November, to be talking about very different buffers over and above the 7% and not surprisingly, that would be a pretty high number in Europe because their financial system in many of those countries is so much bigger than the size of their economies.</p>
          <p>It'll be interesting to see how this plays out in the coming six months, but my worry would be not so much for us, but just generally, if everyone, if all the regulators in the world put together their list of all the things that they want to solve and ensure never happens again, there has to be impacts in terms of customer product pricing, availability of credit, returns on the products. And my worry would be that it would actually decrease availability of credit and, perhaps even worse, increase the pricing of it. There would have to be impacts from this, if it ends up being excessive. And so the key to it is to say what is an appropriate buffer and let's go with it.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Hi, Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, I just wanted to ask you to expand a little bit. You mentioned that obviously with the focus this year on getting the capital ratios back above the Basel levels, and then also making room for the dividend increase and some buybacks, that M&amp;A would be a much lower priority. How much of that is just an internal decision to just work on some of the expense stuff and just get the house in order versus what you see as being available in the marketplace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question, Ken. I guess I would say it pretty simplistically. I think '09 was an incredibly unusual year, in that a number of our peers decided to &#x2013; who are in our business lines, decided to exit businesses in 0'10 that we were interested in. So I view 0'10 as being a very unusual year, in that over the course of 18 months, i.e., the second half of '09 and through 0'10, we had four transactions. That was largely driven by people wanting to exit the businesses because it was either non-core or they wanted to raise capital.</p>
          <p>I don't -- I'm not seeing that now in the U.S. and frankly, last year, we didn't have the opportunity to buy back stock or to raise the dividend, either. So I just think it's a natural transition of both things. That there's less availability, plus we did things that we have to integrate and we have a very effective way of returning capital to shareholders and ensuring a good return for our shareholders over time. So that's what we're focused on. So I just -- for both reasons, I see acquisitions being a pretty low priority.</p>
          <p>The only thing I would probably put a caveat to that is that we continue to invest in our Wealth Management business and Larry's getting very good returns on the business and seeing nice growth in revenues and AUM and there's still a number of states that we want to build out. And we're encouraging Larry to do that, but anything like that would be pretty small prices, quite frankly, $10 million here or there or maybe a small multiple of that, so nothing really material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And my second question is understanding well that you had great business momentum both in the quarter and yet good business still to come on board in Asset Servicing, just wondering, that revenue line was only up about $9 million on the income statement sequentially. So with the good comps, with the new business wins, what's holding that line back from growing faster? And, I guess, should we eventually see an acceleration in revenue growth on the Asset Servicing line specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ken. It's Tim here. I think what you don't see is we converted actually a very low amount for the quarter. We only converted about $273 billion so I think it's a really a story about what's left to convert. That's probably about a third lower than we've converted the last few quarters. So I think that's really what you're seeing, is the pace with which the new business is going from being won to actually showing up in the run rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we should naturally see a better revenue growth rate in the next two quarters if we presume better conversion activity and decent markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the fact that about half of what we've won over the last 12 months is still left to convert and we just did a couple of very big conversions in April, I think that's a fair statement to make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then the last question, just maybe this is for Todd. Todd, just in speaking about the FX business, you mentioned that volatility was down meaningfully on average over the course of the quarter. I was just wondering, how much, if at all, did the Japan spike actually help revenues this quarter because it seemed -- typically in the past, when you've had a couple of really good days of volatility spikes, you can make a lot of money. I'm just wondering how concentrated the revenue was within that week or so time where volatility really spiked, to your point that volatility is the key driver?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we did see a little modest impact there for a couple of days, Ken, but it was relatively short lived. Risk premiums in the first &#x2013; and I think of volatility as another form of a risk premium, and it affects our SEC lending as well. Risk premiums in the first quarter have gone all the way back to predate the crisis itself. The more impactful thing from the crisis events, both in the Middle East and in Asia, was we just saw a lot more securities converted to cash and stick on our balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and hence the larger balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we saw...</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Bedell with ISI Group. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just maybe we could start off with a question for Tim on the asset servicing business. You converted the $273 billion in the quarter and the assets under servicing went up by about just $500 million -- or $500 billion rather. To what extent is the outflow of business &#x2013; or maybe you could talk about the business that you're passing on in terms of a fee realization rate and whether we should expect an increase in the basic fee realization rate for assets under custody going forward in terms of winning business that you view as more lucrative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, at the risk maybe of repeating myself a little bit here, I do think it's a very much a good news story looking forward about the business left to convert. The win rate's high. We're winning very good business. When we lose business, it's not for quality or for price. We had one of our largest losses over the quarter. A competitor, insourcing what they had outsourced to us for their own asset management business would be an example of that. So I think it is very much a story about getting these wins converted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Uh huh. So do you think you'll see a better fee realization rate on the new business or on the overall business going forward versus prior -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do and I go back -- I go back to the point about the new pricing paradigm and making sure that when we price business now, it reflects an extremely conservative view on capital markets-related revenue and of the deals we won in the quarter, I think it would be absolutely fair to suggest you'd see a larger proportion of total revenue showing up in hard dollar fees. And even with that new pricing discipline, we continue to have a very, very, very high win rate. So I think clients get the fact that the world's changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. That's great. A quick comment on the long-term flows, what portion of that was equity versus fixed income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In asset management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in the asset management. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, in the asset management, long-term flows, the $31 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of it was in equity indexing. We had about $13 billion but we had significant fixed income flows as well. We had about $6 billion in active and we had another $12 billion in LDI type of activity. So what you see is indexing LDI, active fixed and a little bit in active equity is the way that the long-term flows came in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then just on the comments before on the expenses in terms of sun-setting the systems and changing some of the infrastructure, I think, Bob, you mentioned this is a long-term plan. Do you expect, or should we expect as we model this out over the next couple of years, that you'll reinvest most of those savings? Or do you think there's a possibility of dropping some of that to the bottom-line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't you go ahead, Todd?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Right now, I would say for the next year or two as we plan our forecast and budgeting, we would expect to be reinvesting the savings because we do see some pretty good low-lying fruit out there that we'd like to grasp. I think beyond that two to three years, then you'll really start seeing some of it to fall to the bottom line. But as Betsy had asked, had mentioned earlier, we always have the option to do a little less and let a little more fall to the bottom-line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and, Bob, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You guys are definitely going to like what we're doing. It's just that it's not visible yet because we keep investing. And we have to think short-term and we have to think long-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Right. And, Bob, you mentioned Wealth Management is one area where you're re-investing. Can you talk about a couple other areas of major focus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. That is, Wealth is definitely one. We're always looking at Asset Management, as well, not in terms of new acquisitions per se, but making sure we have the right mix of products. Our performance is very good. Clearing, we're definitely, in Pershing, we're definitely investing in that because we're seeing more and more clients that want to outsource middle and back office activity and make it so that they can focus on their clients, rather than focusing on things where they don't really add value. And we are, by far, the biggest player in that.</p>
          <p>And we continue to invest in overseas markets, non-U.S. markets, and you think back if our firms had been together 10 years ago, we would have had only 19% of our earnings coming from outside of the U.S. At the time of the merger, it was 32%. Now, we're at 37%. It's not at all impossible to imagine us having over half of our revenue coming outside of the U.S. by the end of this decade. And a key on that is being very, very focused on which countries and which products we want to grow in and we spend a lot of time thinking about that because geography is just as important as the products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Great. That's very helpful. Thanks so much.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Rutschow with CLSA. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I wanted to ask first, on the custody, U.S. assets under custody appeared to be down about 1% sequentially, so is that a mix issue? And is the takeaway there that most of the new business is coming from outside the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Rob, it's Tim here. Yeah, I would say for this, maybe the last couple of quarters, more of the new business is coming from outside. I think it would also be reflective of the fact that the fixed income markets have been a bit soft. And, as we've talked about before, we tend to have a little bit more fixed income assets under custody. And also the third component would be a mix. I think Todd mentioned very well, the contribution of the acquisitions that we've done and about 25% to 27% of the new business wins for the quarter are related to the acquisitions we've done. Transfer agency would be an example of a couple very good wins.</p>
          <p>They just take a little bit of time to convert and aren't measured in assets under custody, the same thing with middle office outsourcing. So you just got to be careful that there's a mix there and, of course, we also saw for the Asset Servicing business, cash balances up significantly, up about 11% because of the wins that we had in the quarter. So I think it's a combination of those things, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, and the other reality is that we should bear in mind that if you think about our various regions around the world, U.S. is probably one of our lowest growth markets now. And the other major geographies we continue to invest in, just because we see longer term, much better opportunities in other geographies and we have in &#x2013; let's face it, our main competitors are U.S. based and that &#x2013; is U.S. based and those markets are already largely dominated here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I could follow-up with a question on FX, historically that's been one of your highest margin businesses. With what's going on, should we expect the pre-tax margin on that business to come down towards the level of the rest of the firm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, I would say it's probably early to tell. Right now, our behaviors and the revenues are consistent with the drivers that we've seen historically. Given the increased attention, we would expect the competitiveness of FX to &#x2013; it's been competitive. It will continue to be competitive. And there is some potential there for margin compression. It's unfortunate. I can't deny that, but I think we are in the process of taking a number of actions to increase, for example, the volumes that is done with us to mitigate that. Right now, 75% of the transactions, FX transactions, that our clients execute are done away from us. So there's a real opportunity for us to capture more of that business that's done away.</p>
          <p>In terms of the operating margin on FX, the actual standing instructions have higher costs associated with them, so the -- I don't think the margin implication is going to be that high. I don't know. Jim, do you have anything to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I completely agree with you there, Todd, that likely going forward, the heightened awareness will add to the competitive nature that we're seeing, but there's a lot of opportunity there. And in our discussions, as I said, that we had just last week with our clients, they're very supportive of the approach that we've taken, and they're even more supportive of some of the technology enhancements that we're about to embark upon. And so, our expectation is, is that we will catch more of that flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess a lot more activity is going electronic, as opposed to voice-brokered. Can you give us an idea of what your overall dollar volumes are and how much of that is electronics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think that we have, and nor do I have it at my fingertips, Rob, that we've disclosed that. But the volumes continue to increase just about every quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our final question today is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, Bob, and good morning, Todd.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Gerard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On your comments about secured lending, Todd, can you share with us what types of loans you guys are making and what the yields are that you're seeing and how large could this portfolio grow to? And then, Bob, is this a shift in strategy, moving more into lending, or is it more just a temporary &#x2013; to carry you through this low interest rate environment, and we shouldn't really see it as a change in strategy? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, why don't I start with the second one, and then Todd can finish on the first one. We've been pretty focused for about three years in taking out risks where we thought they were excessive in terms of credit risk. And we had a program internally called Tall Trees, where we had single-name exposures that we just thought were too large or they really didn't support our Investment Management and our Investment Services businesses. They were outliers from the past from previous activity where we're no longer in those type &#x2013; type of -- they were no longer supporting businesses that we were in. And so we worked pretty hard on that and frankly, we finished it in about the fall, summer to fall of last year.</p>
          <p>At the margin, we want to help our clients be more profitable and more successful over time, so these servicing businesses, and these services businesses, are really important, as is Asset Management. And for certain clients, we will help them, from a credit perspective, as long as the risk is pretty low for us. And we're starting to see more opportunities to create liquidity lines and to term out some of their &#x2013; term out some of their liabilities, and we'll support them on it. And we -- it is one of the new realities of -- under Basel III, that certain of our clients are looking for more term liquidity, and I think we can provide that at very low risk to our shareholders. Todd?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What I'd add to that, this is part of the fallout, if you will, Gerard, from the -- from Basel III and liquidity management. I mean, we're a winner there because we have a lot of excess liquidity, which we've traditionally kept a fair amount of that in the inter-bank placement market. There are a number of counterparties that need to extend the duration. They're on the other side of this equation. So we can do, for example, term repo, where you get daily margining, very low risk. You get good &#x2013; you get good margin. You control the margin on a daily basis. And since it's a term, so they're guaranteed to have the cash for an extended period. And what I mean by that is, maybe a year or as far out as two years. That really hits our sweet spot for the excess liquidity that we've got. And it fulfills the need for a client. So we're pretty excited about that program. We could probably see as much as $10 billion or more of that. We're only about 20% of the way to funding that fully.</p>
          <p>And the other thing here is, we actually think it's a favorable risk strategy to inter-bank placements. So we would like to decrease our exposure to inter-bank placements and find alternatives for this. So this is, I would say, a natural progression and one of the benefits, if you will, of the fallout from the liquidity management required under Basel III?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just add to that, that, Gerard, is that's also a sweet spot for us, because no one understands this business better than us in the world because we dominate it here in the U.S.</p>
