          <p>And welcome to Eni 2012 Second Quarter Results Conference Call hosted by Paolo Scaroni, Chief Executive Officer and Alessandro Bernini, Chief Financial Officer. For the duration of the call, you will be listen-only mode. However, at the end of the call, you have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>
          <p>I'm now handing you over to your host to begin today's conference. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our interim update and second quarter results conference call. Looking at the first half of 2012, there are three main highlights that I would like to draw your attention to, two of these are positive strategic developments and one is a negative business trend.</p>
          <p>First, we have made a good start on our non-core asset disposal program, our lock-in value for shareholders reducing debt and refocusing the business. Secondly, we have further built up the organic growth prospects of our E&amp;P through a stream of truly exceptional exploration successes.</p>
          <p>And third, we are facing challenging market conditions in our Italian European businesses with Gas &amp; Power, Refining &amp; Marketing and Chemical buffeted by euro area headwinds. I will now take you through each of these points in a little more depth. Sandro will then present the financial performance in Q2.</p>
          <p>Let's look at Snam and Galp. As for Snam the disposal process is well underway. Following the signing of the sale of 30% to Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, we have placed a further 5% in the market, desterilizing value for our investors, reducing overhang on Snam, and confirming the market's appetite for this asset.</p>
          <p>For our remaining 20%, we are talking to potential investors. Depending on the evolution of these stocks and market conditions, we will evaluate how best to progress on the disposal. Any transaction will take place following the closing of the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti deal expected in the autumn.</p>
          <p>With regards to Galp, we have recently executed the first step of our disposal process, completing the sale of 5% to Amorim Energia for &#x20AC;14.25 per share, and exited the company's shareholder pact. We are now free to evaluate different options to extract value from our stake with flexibility and no time constraint.</p>
          <p>As a result of these two disposals, by next year, Eni's business portfolio will look like that of its peers and net debt will fall by around &#x20AC;20 billion, bringing our gearing below industry average. As a consequence, we will adjust the way we return cash to shareholders in line with industry practices, accompanying our dividend with the recently approved share buyback program.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to the second highlight, exploration. For many years now, we have discovered around 1 billion BOE of new resources a year, well in excess of our average production of about 600 million, 700 million BOE a year, providing fuel for future growth. In the first six months of this year through our discoveries and appraisals in the Barents Sea, Egypt and West Africa, we have discovered over 400 million BOE, and on top of that, we have an extraordinary game-changing success in Mozambique, which brings total new resources discovered by June 30 to 2.2 billion BOE.</p>
          <p>This number does not include the results of the fifth well in Mozambique announced today, which increases in gas in place to 60 Tcf. Of these, 40 Tcf are to be unitized with Area 1 and 20 Tcf in structures which are fully in our block. Following this success, we now estimate the overall potential of the discoveries in Area 4 is 70 Tcf for gas in place.</p>
          <p>We have also been working on our long-term exploration prospects, securing new and promising acreage in the Norwegian and Russian Barents Sea, in the Black Sea, in East Africa and in the Far-East.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our operating performance, while in E&amp;P we see the benefit of rapid recovery of Libyan volumes, our Italian and European businesses faced strong economic headwinds. In Gas &amp; Power, gas demand continued to fall, driven by the weak economy and the competitiveness of coal and renewables in power generation.</p>
          <p>For an idea of the impact this is having, normalized demand in the first six months of the year was 5% lower in Italy and 7% lower in key European countries year-on-year, and as much as 13% and 18% lower compared to the pre-crisis first half of 2008. This has prevented European over-supply from being absorbed and spot prices from closing the gap with oil-linked prices.</p>
          <p>In this context, we have leveraged on recent supply renegotiations to remain competitive and profitable. In the first half, our merchant business delivered the positive result even excluding one-offs of which the main one is the Gazprom extraordinary benefit.</p>
          <p>R&amp;M is also suffering from unprecedented demand decline. Italian consumption of refined products were down by around 10% in the first half of the year, adding further pressure to Europe structural refining overcapacity. We are working to offset the negative market environment through cost cuts and temporary capacity reduction such as the partial closer of our Gela refinery.</p>
          <p>Lastly our chemicals Versalis almost breakeven in Q2, but volumes had been suffering from low demand and the rest of the year will remain challenging. In this context, we are making steady progress on our turnaround strategy with the closure of our Porto Torres cracker benefiting Versalis' result by around &#x20AC;20 million in the first half.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And we will now hand it over to Sandro for an overview of Q2 financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paolo, and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter of 2012, the market environment was broadly positive. Decline in the Brent price which averaged $108 a barrel in the quarter, down 8% year-on-year was more than offset by the 11% appreciation of the dollar versus the euro compared to one year ago. The European refining scenario was also supported with an average Brent/Ural margin of $6.30 barrel almost a three-fourth increase from the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our results, you should note that following the unknowns of the divestment of Snam their regulated businesses in Italy have been reconsolidated from Gas &amp; Power results and represented in accordance with the applicable reporting standard precisely, the IFRS 5.</p>
          <p>Consequentially margins generated by transaction between Snam and any Group companies are considered as a part of the EBIT adjusted and net income adjusted from continued operations. While the margin generated by transaction between Snam and third parties have been classified as discontinued operations.</p>
          <p>The same reporting standard has been applied also to Q2, 2011 results in order to facilitate the year-on-year comparison. In the second quarter of 2012 adjusted operating profit from continuing operation was &#x20AC;4.24 billion, up 14.2% from the second quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>These results reflected a better operating performance by the exploration and production division due to the ongoing production recovery in Libya and organic growth.</p>
          <p>In spite of continuing demand weakness and rising competitive pressure, the merchant business of the Gas &amp; Power division reported operating losses in line with the second quarter of 2011, leveraging for an improved cost position due to the benefits of renegotiated supply contracts.</p>
          <p>Well, assume that note, Refining &amp; Marketing and Chemicals reported stable losses in the face of a deteriorating trading environment. Adjusted net profit from continuing operation was &#x20AC;1.38 billion, in line with a year ago.</p>
          <p>The better operating performance was offset by higher consolidated tax rate from continuing operation of approximately 4 percentage points. This was mainly due to the increase contribution of  E&amp;P, which has an higher than average tax rate.</p>
          <p>Looking more closely at the E&amp;P, in the second quarter of 2012, Eni grew liquid and gas production by 10.6% to 1.647 million BOE per day. This performance was mainly driven by the ongoing recovery in Libyan production and the start-ups and ramp-ups of the new fields in Russia, Australia, and Egypt. These positives were partially offset by the shutdown of the Elgin/Franklin field, the increase in bunker in the Nigeria and mature field declines.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter of 2012, E&amp;P reported an adjusted operating profit of &#x20AC;4.23 billion, up by 10.8%, driven by increased daily production and the appreciation of the dollar versus the euro.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Gas &amp; Power, in the second quarter of 2012, Eni's worldwide natural gas sales declined by 3% to 19.6 bcm. This decrease was mainly due to weak demand and the ongoing competitive pressure.</p>
          <p>In Italy, volumes also declined 8.3% in the quarter with the power generation segment showing double-digit decline owing to the increasing competitiveness of coal and growing use of renewables.</p>
          <p>International sales excluding volumes sold to shippers increased by around 1%, benefiting from higher sales to retail, growing in excess of 18% and the stronger L&amp;G sales in premium forester markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of results, the Gas &amp; Power division, which from this quarter includes just gas merchant, power and international transport reported an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;369 million compared to a loss of &#x20AC;314 million in the second quarter of 2011. The decline is mainly attributable to the lower results of international transport after the sale of assets in the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Gas &amp; Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA, while overall losses winding slightly the impact was entirely attributable to assets sales in international transport. Marketing profitability improved from the year earlier period with losses narrowing by&#x20AC; 60 million to&#x20AC; 231 million owing to improved results from associates.</p>
          <p>The refining and marketing business reported an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;144 million, &#x20AC;20 million higher than in the previous period. In refining, margins were impacted by shrinking differential between light and heavy crudes as well as higher expenses for oil fuel utilities.</p>
          <p>The negative trading environment and volatile margins were partially offset by efficiency enhancements, the optimization of plant set-up and lower throughputs at the weakest refineries. The overall utilization of index of our refineries is in line with the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>The marketing results improved slightly thanks to higher margin in wholesales as compared to the lows of the second quarter of 2011. This was partly offset by lower sales volumes in the retail market due to decline in fuel demand.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter of 2012, the chemical division reported an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;26 million, an improvement versus the second quarter of 2011 and more remarkably compared to the result achieved in the first quarter in spite of weaker commodity demand, but supported by higher benchmark margin of cracking.</p>
          <p>The Engineering &amp; Construction business reported a steady operating result at &#x20AC;388 million, up 2.6%. This trend reflected higher revenues and better margins on the work executed mainly in the Engineering &amp; Construction business unit. Other activities in corporate showed an aggregate loss of &#x20AC;157 million versus &#x20AC;129 million in the previous year, mainly due to higher insurance cost.</p>
          <p>Net cash generated by operating activities amount to &#x20AC;4.2 billion in the quarter. Cash outflows in the quarter included dividend payments of &#x20AC;2.3 billion, which reflected the payment of their final 2011 dividend as well as dividends paid to Snam and certain minorities.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure, including Snam, amounted to &#x20AC;3.3 billion and mainly relates to the continuing development of oil and gas reserves and the upgrading of rigs and offshore vessels in Engineering &amp; Construction. We also completed the divestment for &#x20AC;729 million, including the backing of the Republic of Kazakhstan in Karachaganak and the disposal of Oyo in Nigeria.</p>
          <p>The change in net debt was positively impacted by other items, including the initial refinancing of an inter-company loan due by Snam for around &#x20AC;1.5 billion. As a result, net financial debt as of 30 June 2012 was down by &#x20AC;100 million from March 31.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And I now will hand you over to Paolo for his final remarks.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sandro.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to the rest of the year, in E&amp;P production levels will continue to suffer from two unexpected events, mainly the closure of Elgin/Franklin and the sharp increase in bunkering in Nigeria, which together reduced Q-Q entitlements by over 30,000 BOE per day year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Net of this impact, we confirm previous guidance of approximately 10% production growth before price effects, the better performance offsetting the shift of expected startups in Angola, Nigeria to the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, by which we now mean our gas merchant, power and international transport businesses we confirm previous guidance of an improvement in operating profits compared to 2011.</p>
          <p>On reported figures much of this improvement will come from one-off items of which the largest is the retroactive impact of the Gazprom renegotiation.</p>
          <p>In R&amp;M we expect weak market conditions to continue offsetting the benefit of increasing efficiency and operating improvements.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, Eni is entering into a new era. Our balance sheet will be transformed by divestments securing our capacity to finance long-term project in any market environment. We will continue to leverage on our exploration success to deliver organic production growth and we will reward the shareholders with a remuneration policy, which guarantees a sustainable dividend and provides for further upside through buybacks.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention, Sandro and I plus the heads of our main business units will now be pleased to take your questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator instructions" /> Thank you. This question come from Mr. Sharma Nitin from JP Morgan. Mr. Nitin, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions from my side, first one on gas and power. You've highlighted in detail the sort of challenging conditions you faced for gas marketing business, but I was wondering despite the renegotiated contract with North African's Gazprom, the results are quite similar to Q2 in that business, obviously, impacted by the trading environment.</p>
          <p>But how should we be thinking about the outlook for this business the second half? And second one on Iraq, please update us on the pace of developments, how are you progressing on Zubair? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe on the first question, I will ask Roberto to answer to you, while on the second Claudio will tell you something about Zubair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the gas and power business, first of all, we &#x2013; let's talk about the tariff we expect to see in the second half of the year, where also we expect to see a recovery mainly in Europe, than in Italy in the second half that will actually per day overall figure in line with 2011.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we are confident of the activity that we are going to perform on our commercial businesses, where we are certain we'll improve our performance both in Italy and also in Europe in the retail as well as in the business market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let's go back, that we are projecting and in line with project we are producing about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:50) equity. At $110 per barrel, it's about 17,000, 18,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>We are working towards a full field development, and we are confident that by the end of the year and early next year, we can have the attributes for the full field. So we are seeing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:08).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, let me just complete, because maybe the answer that Roberto gave you was not really complete. Now, as for the full year 2012, the guidance we give on our gas and power business, defined as I defined before, is a number reported better than last year, but a number, excluding one-offs, worse than previous year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'm not going to disclose you the one-offs, and particularly the benefits we get from the Gazprom retroactive activity. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Can I just ask one follow-up on dividend? So I think you made it amply clear that you want to keep your dividends competitive, and they will be backed by buybacks. But is there any plan post-SRG Snam stake sale, either to revisit the dividend policy or the base dividend &#x2013; i.e. in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, let's say we certainly will revisit our dividend policy with our strategy presentation, which we will be holding sometime end of February, beginning of March. There we will redefine our dividend policy. What I think I can tell you from now that we are not planning any special dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Very clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question come from Mr. Clint Oswald from Sanford Bernstein. Mr. Oswald, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. Thank you very much. First question just on Galp. You talked about evaluating various options from this point onwards now that the shareholder agreement has finished. Can you just remind us what those are from your perspective?</p>
          <p>Secondly on the gas business, again, given your sort of comments on the macro within that division &#x2013; and I think you've spoken about having greater &#x2013; or the ability to talk more frequently with Russia, with Norway on supply. Do you &#x2013; would you expect to enact any further discussions with those suppliers through the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>And then just a small one on &#x2013; it was small. But impairments in the U.S. and some reserve downward revisions, I wonder if you could just say which assets those were? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first and the third question, I think it will be Sandro, and on the second one <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:50). You start, Sandro, with Galp.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, basically, we reference to 18% of the residual stake that we own in Galp. We have no limitation at all. We can have access to that wider range of disposal option, including market transactions, <mark type="ph" /> structure at the market transaction, as well as bilateral (25:27) transaction with interested parties.</p>
          <p>And by the way, we have already ongoing discussions with some interested parties interested to buy quite a significant stake of our participation in Galp.</p>
          <p>It is still too early to predict when those discussions will arrive again. But we are confident that before the closing of the third quarter results, the announcement of the third quarter result will be &#x2013; we will be more precise about the timing and the strategy with respect to the residual portion we have in Galp.</p>
          <p>But basically we have no limitation at all. We maintain only 5% &#x2013; for 5%, Amorim maintains the right of first refusal. But for the rest, we are free to do whatever we want.</p>
          <p>Than as far as the impairment we have booked on &#x2013; as far as some E&amp;P assets based in U.S. are concerned, that figure relating to those asset is really negligible because we are talking about something close to &#x20AC;90 million. So more or less nothing. And the impairment was the result of some increased development cost, as well as the deterioration in the gas market prices prevailing in the U.S. market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your relation to the long-term contract renegotiation, we are currently involved in several discussion with some of our suppliers in order to guarantee continuously cost competitiveness in our portfolio. More precisely, in 2012, these renegotiation were related to a significant portion of our portfolio that is equivalent to 30% of its total volume. Beside 2011 and 2013, we are planning to reopen the renegotiation with other major supplier, like Gazprom and Sonatrach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. I just wanted to get an update with regards to &#x2013; following the success of the Mozambique exploration program. I just wanted to see where you've gotten to in terms of unitization? And how you're thinking about your stake going forward from here. Would you be comfortable selling down to 40%? 30%? Or is 70% how you want to take this development forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will leave Claudio to give you some hints about what we think.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unitization first. We are continuously &#x2013; we are continuing to talk, and we are working with another <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:59) as we said previously, <mark type="ph" /> we exchange the entire ending formation (29:05) and we are working on the future model of the unitization and also on the plan of development. So there is no big news. The work is in progress.</p>
          <p>For the future, as we said, the first objective is to finalize the <mark type="ph" /> exploration pace (29:27). So have a clear view about our resources and about our <mark type="ph" /> developed fee for services (29:33) with our partners and then first with the government. And we are thinking about possible future strategic alliance <mark type="ph" /> on the area. That too. (29:47) Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. I've got a few questions. The first is on the upstream. I noticed that this &#x2013; as I think you mentioned, and certainly you said in the release, there's been couple of splits in the project that are affecting this year. And I just wonder whether we can take the chance for, Claudio just to run through where you are on the key startups that run through maybe in the next 12 month &#x2013; i.e. for 2012 and 2013. So versus the sort of visibility you provided for us at the start of the year.</p>
          <p>The second one is just going back to Mozambique, once you finished the exploration phase that you referenced, when you talk about strategic alliances, would that potentially involve some sort of monetization of what is a very large stake that you have in your block 70%, which I guess to show value for what you've got on this stage.</p>
          <p>The last one I think is for Sandro is there's obviously a program in place for Snam to raise money externally and repay you back the cash that you've lent them. In terms of the next six months to nine months, are you able to give some visibility on when you'd expect to be receiving that cash and reflecting it on your balance sheet? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Claudio, will give you an update on the start-ups.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, start-ups, as we said, this area is doing some delay in some start ups, especially in Angola and in Nigeria, and Via Emilia and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:51) and also project in Italy, Africa. So that is a delay. And we think that we'll be able to start up this project by the end of this year. And that is the main delay.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the year, looking forward, I think that talking about Russia <mark type="ph" /> becomes (32:15) a big contributor in the next couple of years. We don't think that we have any delay on the first project that obviously has been started <mark type="ph" /> in months before the station, so that is a (32:30) good news coming from Russia.</p>
          <p>The other project at Kashagan we &#x2013; our expectation definitely is always to start production by the end of this year <mark type="ph" /> (32:44) is finished, and they are in progress with the commissioning.</p>
          <p>And also we are obviously handing over operatorship to Shell, so there is a huge process of checking and crosschecking all the procedural <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:10). And again we think that Angola is on <mark type="ph" /> track. Can't go yet (33:12) as we said, it confirm first &#x2013; by the first &#x2013; by June, sorry. By the first half of 2014. So there is no bad news for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:29). And the rest is on track.</p>
          <p>So the main issue <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:37).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Mozambique, let me add something on that. Now as you might have seen from our press release of today, we expect to have in total in our block for something in the region of 70 Bcf <mark type="ph" /> divide by 45 (34:00) to be unitized with block one. <mark type="ph" /> 20 Bcf, 25 Bcf (34:07) would be totally under our control. <mark type="ph" /> At our ending, we will have 70% of this development partner. (34:10)</p>
          <p>Now when we look at the strategic alliance there, that the first thing we are looking at that is the wish list of the Mozambique government. Because whatever we will do has to be approved by the government &#x2013; has to be approved, let's say, really part of a formal approval. It has to be really something that the government want us to do. It is such a changing thing for Mozambique, the discovery that this is the first thing we have in mind.</p>
          <p>Now, the second one is, of course, gas utilization. There will be a lot of gas produced there. It would be nice to have as partner the clients for discuss, at least partial. We have already KOGAS with us. So KOGAS is already the potential client. We might be interested in looking for other client.</p>
          <p>Now, the third point will be potential monetization, even if this is not really our priority. Of course, we know that these resources have a huge value, and we will try extract the maximum value, doing our activity. If there will be a partner, which fulfills the first of two conditions, which is <mark type="ph" /> really, A, they (35:45) certainly be acceptable.</p>
          <p>Now, on Snam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jon, as you know, we have already mentioned that Snam already started repaying their loans to Eni before the closing of the 30 of June, since they have already repaid &#x20AC;1.5 billion within the end of June.</p>
          <p>Then in July, thanks to the proceeds generated by the placement of bonds on the institutional market, Snam has repaid an additional &#x20AC;1 billion, totaling in aggregate so far &#x20AC;2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Then last Tuesday, Snam has secured proper financing with a club of banks, which have granted their support for an amount comparable to repay entirely the outstanding loan. And now we are meeting with our former colleagues, but still friends, obviously. And we are defining with them appropriate schedule.</p>
          <p>And I am confident that very soon, within the end &#x2013; probably within the end of September, early October &#x2013; the repayment of the entire outstanding position will take place.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Thanks. Just one remaining question please, I just wondered if in the context of sort of the success in the first half at the yearend, resource addition etcetera that you talked to earlier on if you could talk about some of the primary exploration prospects outside of Mozambique in the portfolio for the second half through the year and into next year, in particular which of those you are most excited about? Thanks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. So first exploration was &#x2013; apart from Mozambique, we got a very good result in Nordic, in Nigeria, the U.S. and Angola but that &#x2013; and they are the main countries, where we continue to drill wells also in the next six years. We have two other also in Indonesia, because we have in July drilled successful well in Indonesia. And we drill until now, 38 wells we have to reach 1090, so in that it's been a recheck. The target excluding Mozambique of about 1 billion &#x2013; more than 1 billion resources for exploration except Mozambique. And Indonesia, Angola, again, and Norway will be the main target.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I had two questions, please. First in the first half of the year your DD&amp;A charges were up quite substantially 22% year-on-year. I wonder if you can give us some guidance for full year depreciation and also for the tax rate.</p>
          <p>And secondly, as you mentioned Paolo, with a Snam and Galp disposals, Eni clearly becomes a pure play, completely different risk profile. What sort of balance sheet gearing? What leverage do you think is appropriate to this new portfolio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I think that Sandro will answer the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. More or less the DD&amp;A charges that they've increased we have experienced over the first half of the year. You can maintain the same trend for the entire 2012, the entire &#x2013; all over the 2012 year. So more or less we do not expect any major fluctuations in the second half of the year. As far as the leverage, we expect to maintain after the disposal of Snam and Galp will be completed. And so far we expect it is reasonable to expect to get a completion of those two extraordinary transaction will be placed only in the 2013.</p>
          <p>Then after the completion of those transaction, we believe we have not yet defined the precise leverage target, but our idea is to maintain leverage in line with the average of our peers group which means something between 15% and the 20% in terms of debt to equity ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. 15% and 20%, but even if we go down to 10% we'll feel perfectly at ease.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple of questions if I may. The first was just around the impact that you are seeing in terms of the downstream from the pricing discounts in the offering in Italy and whether we should be looking out for anything in the course of the summer from that in the downstream?</p>
          <p>And the second question was just in terms of Venezuela, it wasn't among the countries that you've talked about in the upstream about medium term growth, I was just wondering, if there was any changes there that we should be looking out for in terms of your perception of risk in that country, especially ahead of the elections later this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me just touch on the first issue. Yes, you are right. We launched a major advertizing campaign for a special discount we are offering during weekends to the Italian drivers.</p>
          <p>Let me just start by saying that this has been a great success. We had &#x2013; our market share are growing, lots of new client coming to our service stations, good publicity, certainly the &#x2013; our reputation in the country has been enhanced quite a lot.</p>
          <p>Its early days to tell you the total cost of this, but it will be a number, let's say, between &#x20AC;100 million and &#x20AC;200 million depending upon how much the petroleum products we sell during the period.</p>
          <p>We will be &#x2013; the campaign started on the 16 of June and will last until September the 2nd, and then the campaign will stop. It is a kind of corporate investments, not just a refining and marketing division investment. Of course, it will improve the market share. It will improve the visibility of our service stations.</p>
          <p>You might be aware that we are changing the name of our service station from Agip into Eni and this will help us on that. But in total we expect to have a reputation reward for the company as a whole.</p>
          <p>Now as far as Venezuela is concerned, well, of course, Venezuela you're quite correct, you mentioned the fact there will be election later this year. We continue on our path to make out of Venezuela, one of our major countries. If I were to remember the level we expect by 2020 to produce in Venezuela 200,000 barrels a day. And, therefore, it will be a major country for us. But, of course, the big investments are in 2014. So let's say we will have time to see how the situation will develop in that country before taking major investment decisions.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. Just two questions if I could, actually two for Claudio. First one is on the Gulf of Mexico. I think you and your partner, Exxon, have two rigs operating at the moment on Hadrian, and I was just wondering if you could talk about your expectations in terms of recoverable resources and the development timeline there?</p>
          <p>And secondly in terms of your latest developments on your global share portfolio, whether you have any recent drilling results in Ukraine or Poland that you are happy to share with us? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, starting from the last question, because we operate in Poland and Ukraine, so I think I feel more comfortable talking about and also on the asset that I operate. We are drilling the second well in Poland and we are analyzing the data, we'll drill a third well in September and we do start restructuring and real production, best production by the end of the year. So we are still in a inspirational phase some nine blocks, very good blocks in terms of shale gas. So that we are in early stage, we have to start from as we can then start immediately drilling. So that we're definitely not tracking and we're trying to be optimistic about that.</p>
          <p>In Hadrian honestly, I think that we are sharing the following operatorship. We are quite optimistic about the region, we draw additional resources. And I think that current development, future operational well leaded by &#x2013; led by Exxon. I think that is one of the major discovery, one of the major project in Gulf of Mexico, perhaps.</p>

Can I just clarify exactly what you are saying on the dividend, is the &#x20AC;0.54 considered to be the last dividend of Eni as it stands today and into next year, you kind of you're going to set a new policy for a new company or is the &#x20AC;0.54 a reference point that how you look at the dividend going forward?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. We are not &#x2013; listen we are not going to start with a clean piece of paper at all. We know exactly, what is the dividend we pay today. We know what have &#x2013; what have been our promises in the past and as usual when we make the next presentation of our strategy we want to ensure the market, the dividend is sustainable during the plan. This will remain a point from $0.54 promises.</p>
          <p>I am going to bring to Board in September which make me think quite likely the dividend for the full year will be in the region of one common rate.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not raising the dividend. We are fulfilling on our promises. Because we said that our dividend will follow the OECD inflation. The OECD inflation will bring that to &#x20AC;1.07 but we didn't like the idea of paying dividend. We have in the &#x20AC;0.535. So we brought it to &#x20AC;0.54.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, hello. Good afternoon and I don't know what question was asked already but I have a question for Mr. Scaroni, at the OpEx seminar, sort of one month or two ago you made a presentation where you said about global gas prices that they were a riddle wrapped in a mystery within an enigma or something along those lines and from that perspective it's actually not that easy to formulate a gas price to put in the sort of Mozambique model, when you're going to discuss it with your partners out of the FID.</p>
          <p>And I was wondering if over the two months out there whether you've formulated your thoughts on the right gas prices sanctioned for the investments planning of that particularly project, what do you &#x2013; formulate your thoughts on that perhaps a little bit more clearly and whether you're going to share that with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen I can see that you remember quite well the speech I gave in Houston a few months ago. Now, those points I was making was at that time, gas price in the U.S. were $2.50 per million BTU, in euro that we have $10 in the Far East were $18.</p>
          <p>And that this situation was not sustainable in particularly considering that the calories in the U.S. the cal when you buy gas at $2.50 per million BTU, you're buying the calories at 15% price what you pay the calories coming from oil. This was the whole point I was making.</p>
          <p>Now we said that you're right that this is a big enigma for our future not for what happens next year but for what happens in 2020, 2022, 2024 for every investment in gas, including Mozambique, the variable what will be the price in 2020, '22, '24, '25 is going to be the most difficult to define.</p>
          <p>Now, luckily in the case of Mozambique, we have to say that the upstream cost of the gas is so low that almost in every scenario Mozambique will be competitive, and therefore, we do not feel pressure from that point of view, and we are sure that every potential partner will be very much interested entering into this venture due to the fact that the cost of gas in Mozambique is particularly low.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. A couple of questions from me. The first one is on South Stream.  According to the Russian government it seems that the project should apply in October, November this year. Are you comfortable with these indication, and second point what is the state of CapEx from your side devoted to this project?</p>
          <p>And the second one, just a pure technical question on your accounting system. Should we see the split of continuing operation and discontinued operation also for the next couple of quarters?</p>
          <p>And the third question, could you please repeat again what is your guidance on the tax rate for the full year 2012 for the continuing operations? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Okay. Sandro will answer the two accounting questions and then &#x2013; we might &#x2013; either me or Roberto will answer one on the South Stream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, you are right. We will maintain, let me say unfortunately the same accounting criteria also for the third quarter and as well as for the entire 2012 results.</p>
          <p>So also by the end of September and by the end of the year you will examine our numbers, our figures divided between continuing and discontinuing of operation. Then effective from the first quarter 2013 Snam will definitively disappear from our consolidated figures and so, I believe it will be more clear to understand our results.</p>

          <p>Sorry, the consolidation of the debt I suppose?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right, correct, but you know, that the consolidation of the debt more than in accounting effect it will be a substantial effect because we expect to recover our own money within the end of the year. So it is not a matter of the consolidation, but it is real reimbursement of the outstanding loan.</p>

          <p>Related to your question on South Stream we can confirm what other South Stream partners had announced that there is an FID target by the end of this year. This, of course, is also depending on European authorization that for partner like us, is quite important. However, this FID will confirm the commitment of the parties to continue in the development of the project in order to guarantee to start with subsequent execution.</p>

          <p>Let's say, then there will be financing, okay. On total it will be &#x20AC;10 billion. We expect to have roughly &#x20AC;3 billion of equity, which will have roughly 20%.</p>
