          <p>Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. With us are Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer; Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President of Product Management; and Omid Kordestani, Senior Advisor to the Office of the CEO and Founders. Eric, Patrick and Jonathan will provide us with their thoughts on the quarter and then Omid will join us for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Please note that this call is being webcast from our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. Please refer to our website for important information including our press release issued a few minutes ago along with slides that accompany today's prepared remarks. A replay of this call will also be available on our website in a few hours. Please note that we routinely post important information on our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com and we encourage you to make use of that resource.</p>
          <p>As a reminder we're continuing with the two call structure this quarter. First we will host our traditional strategic overview and Q&amp;A with the usual format followed by a second call which is effectively an extended Q&amp;A session giving the opportunity for participants to ask more detailed and financial and product questions in an efficient and regulatory compliant manner. The second call will begin at 3 p.m. and will also be webcast from our Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding investments in our core business and growth agenda, expected performance of aspects of our business, operational efficiency and costs and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.</p>
          <p>Please note that these forward looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publically release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.</p>
          <p>Please refer to our SEC filings including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2008 as well as our earnings press release for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.  Copies can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the investor relations section of our website.</p>
          <p>Also please note that certain financial measures we use on this call such as EPS, net income, operating margin and operating income and expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock based compensation.  We have also adjusted our net cash providing by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow.  Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.</p>
          <p>With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Eric.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Krista, and good afternoon to everybody.  Welcome to our first quarter earnings call.  I'm going to talk obviously about the big picture, Patrick will then run through all the financials, Jonathan will put together not just products but also a whole bunch of insights about advertising.</p>
          <p>Now despite the tough economic climate we think Google had a good quarter. In the context of GPD falling over 6% in Q4 U.S. consumer confidence falling a third in February, retail sales falling 9.5% year-over-year in March, Google revenues were up 6% year-over-year on the back of continued strong traffic growth down only three percent quarter-over-quarter on a revenue basis.</p>
          <p>If you look at the economic situation, we're still basically in an uncharted territory.  I think that's the frank statement everybody wants to talk about in the business world today. And the current economic environment, which everybody on the call is very, very familiar with, remains tough.  No company is recession proof.  Google is absolutely feeling the impact.</p>
          <p>Users are still searching, but they're buying less. Ultimately what that really means is the ads are converting less; more window and comparison shopping, purchasing lower priced goods. In other words, users are doing the right thing. They're doing what you would expect them to do given the enormous economic changes around us.</p>
          <p>So advertisers are still spending but they're lower their bids to manage their ROI, behaving correctly, in our view.  So one way to say that is our advertising model is working.  The user and advertising behavior that we're seeing is entirely rational, and the auction we base our whole business is working to deliver great value for both.</p>
          <p>So we think Google is now well placed for the recovery as it occurs or when it occurs.  Obviously we don't know exactly when.  And the shift continues &#x2013; this is the shift to online, continues to give us a real advantage.  Users migrating to the web and advertisers investing online where ROIs are highest, it appears that the shift to online ROI and movement into our category is outpacing any &#x2013; on a relative basis, any loss of economic activity. We benefit from that.</p>
          <p>From a prioritization perspective at Google, our priorities remain unchanged, basically long-term growth.  Internet growth continues.  Our goal is to build the business and be an innovator.  In our core business, search, making it easier and faster to find things globally, we're doing well there.  Search advertising ads on new properties, for example image search, Google Finance, all of those Jonathan will talk about.</p>
          <p>We also believe that there's growth in new businesses based on superior technical insight.  In display for example, you have a highly fragmented market with multiple buyers, sellers and data sources.  By using our technology we can create an integrated product that will really improve the display ad model.</p>
          <p>Look at the success of Android and the mobile space in general. By improving the mobile web experience, people search many, many times more than they did in previous mobile devices.  We benefit both in terms of end user happiness as well as ultimately strong revenue growth from that area.</p>
          <p>And in enterprise, the same thing.  People are no longer thinking of IT as these expensive boxes but rather trying to apply the consumer market principles to IT, giving increased efficiency as well as higher productivity. So in that sense our mission is unchanged.</p>
          <p>One thing that has changed is we've just announced that after 10 years of managing our global sales operations, Omid Kordestani has decided to hand things over to Nikesh [Arora]. Omid's going to stay with us. He's going to become Senior Advisor to the Office of the CEO and Founders, and he's going to be working on some new business opportunities for us. Nikesh will be responsible for all revenue, consumer operations, marketing and partnerships.</p>
          <p>When I travel, when I spend time within the Google context, I see the hand, in fact the brilliance of Omid and how he built the business of Google. And he will certainly &#x2013; it's impossible in an hour, let alone a minute, to talk about the level of contribution that he's had.  As a business founder at Google, no one is better placed to advise us on issues like future revenue growth for Google. Nikesh of course also with us for many years, running our European operations; the right person to take on everything to the next level.</p>
          <p>So putting it into context, good quarter for Google despite tough sort of overall economic condition.  We're still in uncharted territory.  And I want to remind everybody that we're heading into the Q2, Q3 seasonally weaker quarters. We've seen this every year, it's no change, we expect that will happen as well.  First quarter has demonstrated the resilience of our business model in a very severe global recession and we're going to continue to invest for the long term, as we should and as we will.</p>
          <p>So Patrick, would you like to proceed and take us through the financials?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>...off of mute. Can you hear me now? There we go. Thanks Eric. Sorry, the mute button. Good afternoon, everyone.  As Eric has already covered, we are continuing to manage the business well in what is a difficult economic environment.  Gross revenue was up 6% year-over-year to 5.5 billion, mostly due to the good performance of Google.com. And this despite two strong headwinds, in fact: the economy, but also the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>Google.com was up 9% year-over-year to 3.7 billion driven primarily by traffic growth.  AdSense business on the other hand, was down 3% year-over-year to 1.6 billion, driven by several factors.  Year-over-year growth on the AdSense for Search was impacted by the continued cleanup of low quality network partners that began late in Q1 of last year, FX, and general economic weaknesses, along with other quality and ROI initiatives implemented in Q1 of this year.</p>
          <p>On the AdSense for Content side, branding oriented display campaigns remained challenging in Q1 as our advertisers slowed their spend relative to the performance based advertising.  Global aggregate paid click growth remained relatively strong, however, up 17% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter.  The U.S. growth was also fairly healthy year-over-year given the challenging economic environment with revenues up 4% to 2.6 billion, even if down 7% quarter-over-quarter reflecting the normal seasonal trend that we see in Q1, again exacerbated by the weak economy.</p>
          <p>Our international revenue accounted for 52% of our total revenues or 2.9 billion.  The U.K. was down 9% year-over-year to 733 million, but up 7% quarter-over-quarter.  We did see a seasonal uptick in Q1 which is normal pattern for the U.K. but not as much as in prior years due to weakness in, for example, travel and finance, two very economically sensitive verticals. Note that our U.K. results in Q1 also benefited from a significant gain from the expiration of a set of pound hedge that were put in place in Q3 of '08.</p>
          <p>The rest of EMEA is beginning to experience the slowdown seen in other countries.  Ireland and Spain were clearly weaker while Germany was a relative bright spot as well as Benelux.  Outside the U.S. and Europe, China and Brazil performed reasonably well with relatively strong growth year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to expenses.  Google may be an unconventional company but our Q1 margin demonstrates Googlers responsible management in light of the economic situation we all faced.  Q4 verse Q1 could be summarized as continued tight cost management but also lower labor costs primarily as we reset our company bonus plan for 2009 in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving down the P&amp;L, traffic acquisition costs were 1.4 billion or 27% of total advertising revenue and roughly flat with Q4.  Other cost of revenues decreased 41 million from Q4 to 666 million, which included 13 million in stock-based compensation. This decrease was driven by non-datacenter related expense, primarily payroll again. And finally, all other operating expenses totaled 1.52 billion, including approximately 265 million in stock-based compensation.</p>
          <p>Please note that in Q1 our expenses include 26 million related to the exit of our audio and print ad business as well as severance costs related to the layoffs announced, all of which impacted G&amp;A.  Also in G&amp;A is $20 million related to the proposed legal settlement in the Hanson case.</p>
          <p>That said, expenses improved significantly from Q4 reflecting lower labor costs as I already mentioned primarily due to the reset of the company bonus plan at the beginning of the year.  This favorability in labor expense more than offset the various costs described above in G&amp;A.  And as a result, non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes the stock-based compensation increased to 2.2 million in Q1 resulting in a healthy non-GAAP operating profit margin of 39.2%.</p>
          <p>Note also however, that while we maintain focus on our prudent approach to managing expenses, and as Eric noted we continue to fully fund our strategic growth areas, including for example investments in display ads and mobile.  And we're still hiring but only in the critical areas.  We had approximately 20,000 full time employees at the end of Q1, roughly flat from Q4.  We also announced in late March that we'll eliminate approximately 200 positions in sales and marketing.  Please note, however, that these reductions are not reflected in our ending head count numbers for Q1.</p>
          <p>Finally and also important to note, with slower growth rates in this challenging environment seasonality in our results are obviously more apparent such as what Eric mentioned a typical summer slowdown of Q2 and Q3.</p>
          <p>Let me quickly turn to cash management.  Other income and expenses was 6 million for Q1, down from 17 million last quarter.  We continue to manage our portfolio responsibly and adopted a conservative approach to investing.  This means that we are recognizing somewhat lower yields on our investments in Q1 relative to Q4.</p>
          <p>Also, we realized gains on investments &#x2013; our realized gains on investments were 32 million.  More important to note is the high volatility relative to the option strike prices which required this quarter the acceleration of hedging expenses as per the details of FAS 133 rules.  So in consequence, these accounting rules required us to recognize close to double the expense or 91 million dollars, related to our hedging programs versus Q4 of 49 million.</p>
          <p>Our hedging program continues to work well.  We're pleased that our cash flow hedging program allowed us to recognize a benefit of approximately 154 million to revenue this quarter.  Before hedging the recent strength of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies had a negative impact of 120 million on revenue in Q1 compared to the prior quarter and 429 million compared to the prior year. Also as I mentioned before, our U.K. results for Q1 benefited from a significant gain from the expiration of some pound hedges.</p>
          <p>We're still generating very strong operating cash flow at 2.2 billion for Q1.  CapEx for the quarter was 263 million and related primarily to our data center operations.  This is down significantly from prior periods.  Google will continue to make significant investments to support our core business.  And please keep in mind that CapEx can be lumpy from quarter to quarter.  Free cash flow also remains strong at just shy of 2 billion dollars.</p>
          <p>In summary we're pleased with our Q1 results which illustrate the resiliency of our business model as well as the prudent management of our expenses in these difficult times.  While we remain focused on operational efficiencies, we're not cutting any corners on our growth agenda and continue to fully fund both our core business and our growth businesses.  Finally I wish to reiterate that our revenues typically exhibit seasonality for Q2 and while our revenues may be seasonal, obviously our expenses are not as seasonal.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to thank you for your time and I'll turn it over to Jonathan for his thoughts on the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Patrick. In the current economy Google is more focused than ever on prioritizing resources to our next multi-billion dollar business.  That of course is search based advertising.  And to find more revenue, we need to make sure that we monetize our searches judiciously and to only do that in ways that benefit both advertisers and users.</p>
          <p>You have to understand that most advertisers even today do not max out their daily budget.  So that tells us they're willing to take all the clicks that we can give them at current CPCs.  It turns out advertisers see Google as a sales channel for customer acquisition and not as a marketing expense.  The problem that they have is that if you're an advertiser and you have tens of thousands of products, if you want to run an effective campaign you need lists of keywords, a creative and a bid for each product.  This takes a lot of effort to manage.</p>
          <p>So to increase our revenue as well as theirs, we're investing in tools that make the process easier.  We see that when we build the right advertiser tools it can have an even bigger impact than the ads quality enhancements that we typically talk about on this call. One example is the conversion optimizer, and that automates the bid part of the process.  For advertisers who have adopted this tool, their cost per action is down 14% while conversions are up 21%.</p>
          <p>More recently we launched the searched based keyword tool and that one automates the keyword part of the process.  It takes a look at an advertiser's landing pages and then it matches those up with actual user queries.  Since that launch what we're seeing is cases where keywords suggested by the tool have higher conversion rates and lower CPCs.</p>
          <p>We're also investing in a new AdWords front end and that's now available to over 100,000 advertisers in 12 languages.  This is actually the biggest overhaul to AdWords in the past five years and it greatly simplifies the whole campaign management and reporting process.</p>
          <p>Over on the search side we know a lot about how people interact with search and we can make everyone's experience much better as a result.  We launched a feature internationally this quarter that automatically gives you the best results even if you misspell a query.</p>
          <p>It turns out there are over 800 ways our users misspell Britney Spears, but with this feature we'll show you the right results for most of them without the user even having to click and rerun the query with the suggested spell correction.  You can go ahead and try spelling Britney poorly, or if you're a bad speller just type it wrong naturally and you'll see.  People click on these results a lot so we know that we've made good progress here.</p>
          <p>Patrick highlighted in his remarks that Google has rigorous management of expenses, but we also have a history of making big investments based on technical insights and we're going to continue to do that today especially in areas like display, mobile and Android.</p>
          <p>On the display side the problem that we have is a fragmented market and that makes it difficult for advertisers to run campaigns across the thousands of sites that they want to reach.  So there's an opportunity to turn a complex process into something much simpler and open up the market to new advertisers.  We just launched a feature called Display Ads Builder which helps do this, and we want to make display ads as relevant and useful to users as search ads and that's the intent of interest based advertising which we also announced this quarter for beta launch in Q2.</p>
          <p>On the mobile side more people are accessing the web from their phones.  The number of mobile searches has gone up five times in just the last couple years and this new generation of phones has eyes: a camera, ears: a microphone, skin: a touch screen and they know their location.  This makes them a great platform for very compelling applications.</p>
          <p>We launched Google Latitude which you can use to share your location with friends. There's a fun Google news cluster just this morning on Latitude helping catch a thief in San Francisco if you go to Google News and type in Latitude thief.</p>
          <p>We're also investing in Android to make a great mobile web experience available to everyone and over 8% of mobile browsing is now conducted through Android which is second only to the iPhone.</p>
          <p>Eric noted earlier that uncharted economic conditions that we face.  What's interesting from my perspective is to see how graphically searches shed light on the state of the economy.  Searches on foreclosures are up 42% year-over-year, bankruptcy is up 53% year-over-year, unemployment has more than doubled.  We also see increases in education, self-help, spirituality and on the other side of the stress release spectrum, alcohol and gambling.</p>
          <p>Some of this data about traffic on specific queries is probably not surprising but our economic analysts look at things in terms of buckets and that can be more interesting, so we're seeing some surprises when you look at the categories of search queries.</p>
          <p>Health, for example, has seen strong growth in the U.S. and it's now one of our largest verticals.  Automotive, which is an industry which is actually in dire shape is investing more in search advertising.  It could be there that they're shifting budgets online.  We also see increases in auto maintenance and auto parts, which may be a do-it-yourself phenomenon.</p>
          <p>On the online shopping side, users are looking for bargains in the mature markets and they're shifting purchasing to the web in the emerging market.  So amidst all the economic uncertainty, we're focusing on delivering the best search experience, driving more revenue and on investing in the key areas where our technical insights will help us make a big difference.</p>
          <p>With that, back to Patrick.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jonathan.  And so we'll turn it back to the operator to set up the call for us please, so Operator?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  And we'll take our first question from James Mitchell from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much for taking my questions, two sort of detailed ones.  One, you mentioned the impact of the bonus plan on costs.  Would that be the same through each quarter of 2009 or was it front end loaded?  And then second, you mentioned some U.K. pound sterling hedges expired. But would that imply you're less hedged going into the second quarter than you were in the first quarter, or that you're hedged at less advantageous FX rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so I'll answer both of these questions. On the first one is we had a ramp up in Q3 and Q4 of 2008 in our bonus accruals, if you wish, because we had a very strong end to 2008.  And now we're just resetting the plan for the year at the regular bonus accrual, so that's why you see the big change.  So we had a very strong end of last year.  And so there's &#x2013; that's why the big discrepancy.</p>
          <p>On the issue of the hedges, the original tranche of pound hedges were put in, you'll remember, in Q3 of last year. And we're building a ladder of these hedges, right, over time. And it just happened now that the first tranche came to expire at the end of Q1, so we had to actually exercise them, if you wish. And we've continued through Q4 and in Q1 to continue to build our ladder.  So there is continued kind of benefit or impact of this insurance kind of policy the way we think about it over the coming quarters just as much but it all depends on the strike price that we set at those times. I hope that answers that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll go to the next question, please.  Operator?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, I want to get back to the seasonality comment.  I know you brought it up and we've been seeing it every year.  Do you think you're going to see any abnormal seasonality given the recession? And then a quick financial question, you've got a &#x2013; it looks like a 36% hedging ratio as far as the benefit to the impact from the currency, 429 million over 154.  Is that kind of your target ratio or is it going to move around a lot over time?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can you just repeat the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  It looks like your foreign ex &#x2013; foreign exposure was about 429 million hit and you got 154 million benefit, so it looks like it was like a 36% ratio as far as offsetting the hit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think that's kind of what we should look for going forward or can that number move around a lot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so on the latter question, you can't use it that way.  The issue you have is the more volatility you have on all of these exchange rates, right, the more volatility you'll have in all these ratios.  So you can't use a ratio like that and plug it forward.  On &#x2013; remember, I just want to remind everybody, right, we're not hedging revenue. We're hedging margins. And so there is &#x2013; it happens that FAS 143 forces us to actually plow into the revenue for a portion of it, but it really is a margin that we're &#x2013; and it's the international portion of our revenue only, right? So it doesn't affect the U.S.  On seasonality, I'll let Jonathan answer and then I'll complement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Patrick.  So seasonality &#x2013; I mean we don't give forward guidance so let's just be clear on that. But seasonality can become more visible in an environment where you have relatively slower core growth, so that's certainly a dynamic to understand. The second thing to understand is that if you look at the history of our seasonality over many, many years, there were early years there where, in many markets now where we enjoy significant market share, we were gaining market share. And as &#x2013; that can mask some of the seasonality, it is less likely to be the case now.</p>

          <p>Omid?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can just add more color from an advertising perspective in the different regions. So in the U.S. we also saw the typical seasonal downtick in Q1 but it was exacerbated by a weak consumer, although we had some interesting vertical bright spots in health, auto and shopping. Shopping for example, people are looking for bargains and doing maybe some of their offline purchases online, making some of those shifts.  Or in a recession environment, certain auto queries, maintenance and repairs being popular.</p>
          <p>In U.K. we saw the seasonal uptick in Q1 which is usually the reverse of the U.S. but not as much this time versus prior years due to the weakness in travel and finance. Again, those are economically very sensitive verticals. In the rest of the world, emerging markets, we saw continued growth and optimistic to continue that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other easy thing to do &#x2013; it's Jonathan here quickly, is just check the calendar and look at the timing of Easter, which is different this year than it was last year, which is actually an important factor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so for Q2 and Q3, the issues that Eric mentioned right at the front end of the call and these illustrations are simply to state that it is traditional that Q2 and Q3 are slower and so you know, everybody should kind of think about it.  Let's go to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Imran Khan from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, thank you for taking my question.  Hi Eric, Jonathan, Patrick and Krista.  Two questions. You know, I think you talked about &#x2013; and I think, Patrick, you talked a little bit about trends in different countries in Europe.  The question is more about month-over-month.  Did you see the business condition getting better on a year-over-year basis towards in March or you've seen the same kind of trend you see in January and February?  Can you give us some sense in that you have a pretty good pulse on the economy, what kind of pulse trend you are seeing?</p>
          <p>And second question is my understanding is that you have a pretty large small business customers and with the credit crisis and credit crunch, what kind of impact you are seeing on the small businesses? Aren't they growing slower than the overall business growth rate?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so on &#x2013; I'll let Omid actually talk about the small and medium business and I'll come back to the first topic afterwards.  Omid?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So it is interesting you highlighted and I think the &#x2013; we did see that effect that we actually have a difference in behavior between the smaller and larger customers. And I think the way we can explain this in that &#x2013; in the case of large advertisers you typically have the CMO making decisions and looking at the spending as a marketing expense. And in this kind of downturn and the severity of the crisis that we all face, a lot of those budgets were put on hold or certain decisions were delayed. And our sales force and online teams are busy servicing and accessing those customers to show them performance information and ROI information and all the tools that we have in our hands to help with that spending.</p>
          <p>We did see that in the actually small to medium segment that customers actually continued spending and we kind of attribute that to the fact that they really see this form of search advertising as a sales channel, as a way to generate leads, and as long as they are gaining those leads and customers, they continue to spend.  So it was an interesting pattern that we noticed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Omid.  On the issue of month-over-month, I think that the simplest answer is that a) we don't comment on this monthly activity.  I think that Eric summarized the point very well that the economic situation, it just remains difficult. And it's a tough economy out there whether you're in Europe, whether you're in North America, and you know, that continues to be you know, uncharted territory in so many dimensions.  So that's really how we can best portray the situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's go to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Christa Quarles from Thomas Weisel Partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, two questions. First on the TAC, I know some of the hedging benefit goes into the TAC rates but they continue to come down. And I was just wondering if you could give us your philosophy on your positioning on TAC? And then the second question I had was actually on the licensing side.  There was a fairly steep sequential slowdown and I was wondering if you could give any color there as to whether or not it was on the DoubleClick side?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so on the TAC side, I'll just take that question.  You know, our TAC is actually kind of pretty stable between Q4 and Q1, even with the hedging benefits included.  So we're not seeing continued decline, right, they're actually pretty stabilizing.  There is a mix &#x2013; a shift change, you know, so that obviously between Google and the Network on one piece, and the fact that we see lower TAC in general right now also is driven by &#x2013; we see stronger growth in our smaller partners which just have relatively lower TAC than our larger partners. So it's no more complicated than that.  On the licensing, yes, it is the impact of DoubleClick.  So let's go to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney [Citigroup].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One on display advertising, one on costs.  Both Eric and Jonathan, you talked about the display advertising.  Jonathan, anything more you can tell us about the interest based display advertising?  Overall on the Internet and I guess across all advertising there's a move towards performance based advertising, which obviously search is part of it, but in display there's probably a very significant opportunity.  Broadly, what's missing in display advertising now and specifically what does interest based display advertising do to solve that?</p>
          <p>And then, Patrick, any qualitative comments you'd care to give about how much more cost opportunity you see?  You've only been in there for two quarters but we've already seen &#x2013; three quarters, but we've seen a pretty material move in the margin structure so far.  Do you feel like you're early innings in the opportunities you have to right-size the cost structure the way you think most appropriate?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Mark, it's Jonathan.  It's a little early to really give you deep insights on interest based advertising.  We announced that we would launch interest based advertising on the content network and YouTube and start those deployments in beta in Q2. We're very optimistic because today when you think about the way these ads are run, we're showing ads based on the context of the page the user is viewing at the moment.  So for example if you're on a sports page we might show you ads for running shoes.</p>
          <p>But interest based advertising, basically you use information about the sites that people visit to show them ads about the things that interest them.  And we've certainly seen that &#x2013; if you like cars we might show you ads for cars even if you're not on a car site. And we think that that is very robust in terms of its ability to generate much more targeted interests.  But we don't actually yet have deep insights from customers on how that's working in the field.</p>
          <p>Omid may have a sense of what feedback we're getting from customers in terms of their level of interest in display advertising, but I can't otherwise give you a sense &#x2013; I can't otherwise report to you data on how interest based advertising is improving the targeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the second part of the question which is about costs.  Really you know, we &#x2013; as we had said in Q4 and we're saying again this quarter, right, given all the uncertainty in this environment, I think that the Googlers in general, the entire community of our employees have been quite prudent on cost management.</p>
          <p>On the flip side of that, right, we continue to fully fund all of our strategic growth &#x2013; like fully fund.  So we are, as Eric said at the front end of the call, we are really focused on our growth agenda and we're not stopping that.  So from that perspective, right, I think it's simply a balance we're trying to strike between those two components. I'll let Eric further just comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, my personal view on this is that it's all about making us a better efficiency engine, that the changes in the sort of tightness at which we're running now will put us in a stronger position as the recovery comes out.  We have been able to do the things that we care a lot about, and I think the company benefits from the sort of discipline that Patrick has helped lead here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric. Thank you, Patrick. Thank you, Jonathan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, let's go to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Youssef Squali from Jefferies &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, two quick ones. First Jonathan, going back to DoubleClick, can you tell us about the integration?  When will that be done, when will you be able to finally offer the fully integrated platform for both search and display? And then if I may, on YouTube, Eric, you seem to be getting some traction with the studios getting short and lump form content.  Is the model as you see it ad based only or do you see a potential for some fee based, potentially even some subscription based model as the platform evolves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll let J.R. answer the first one and, Eric, you comment on the second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, Youssef.  We basically just hit the one year anniversary of the DoubleClick integration and it has been a pretty smooth integration.  The good news there is we've gained customers on both the publisher and the advertiser side.  We're pretty well on our way to being fully integrated with AdSense and AdWords.</p>
          <p>For example, we saw the integration of DART for Publishers and AdSense completed in Q4 and that basically combines DoubleClick's management and control tools for publishers with the advertiser demand for the Google content network.  I'm not sure exactly how we define full integration and the details of everything that's left, but those efforts as well as the efforts on the ad exchange are coming along pretty nicely only one year since the acquisition. So I think we're doing pretty well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the YouTube side, we are making very good progress now with small, medium and even large scale studios.  The most interesting deal that we just announced involved Universal Music, which we announced last week which we're beyond excited about, because it really redefines the business model between content owners and companies like Google.</p>
          <p>With respect to how it will get monetized, our first priority as you pointed out is on the advertising side.  We do expect over time to see micropayments and other forms of subscription models coming as well, but our initial focus is on advertising and we'll be announcing additional things in that area, literally very, very soon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Let's go to the next question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Lindsay from Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question.  Can I ask two things?  First of all, can you give us an indication of the percentage of YouTube that is actually carrying ads at the minute and what the rates of advertising are relative to what you thought they would be?  And what I'm trying to understand is, is there significant upside potential here or do we think that YouTube is kind of where &#x2013; it's sort of reached its sort of maximum potential on the advertising side?  And then secondly, CapEx was really low.  Do we think this is sustainable or are you deferring projects and what aspects of infrastructure are likely to come up in the next 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  I'll let Omid answer the first one, and then I'll take the CapEx question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's early for us still to settle down on any specific trends here.  We're just finding that we have &#x2013; we continue to have tremendous usage of the service.  We're continuing to add a lot of great content and there's great advertiser interest.  And again as you know, there's an overall downturn in the display market, so what we're doing is just working with the advertisers to figure out at what price they can work with us, how creatively they can work with us.</p>
          <p>Today for example on the home page you can see a large ad format for Crank 2, a movie opening tomorrow.  So there is great interest and we just look forward to working with the advertisers both in terms of the traditional ad formats, the new ones we're working with, the transaction model that we have developed and then basically be able to share more with you in the future as we have better trends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me just add to Omid if I may, that there's a really synergy between YouTube and the display products.  It's their first and most interesting scale partner and YouTube and its adoption which has obviously been very strong, will benefit from very, very highly targeted display ad models which is what we are in the process of building.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, so that covers the YouTube portion.  On CapEx, look, there is no doubt that this is &#x2013; this quarter again is a perfect illustration of the lumpiness of our CapEx and that you have to beware of models and trend lines because if you trend the last three quarters, then in a couple of quarters we have no more CapEx.  So beware of the modeling at its simplistic level.</p>
          <p>There is no doubt though that because of the economies of scale that we have now with the size of the company and our better efficiencies, working at Moore's law, doing more with less, we obviously see a positive trend that are actually demonstrated in the last few quarters.  But I just want to reiterate that this thing is lumpy.</p>
          <p>So for example, just as an illustration, it's public now that we have acquired a site in Scandinavia and anybody who lives around there knows that working in the winter and trying to do anything on the site has got to be delayed. So that's just an illustration of the lumpiness of how much we can put our CapEx on the line.  So that's how I would answer the CapEx question. Let's go to the next question please.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions.  First, is there any structural reason to think that pricing would not come back to previous levels as macro improves at some point? And then second, just following up on the hedging related to the U.K., can you comment on the amount of benefit that was received specifically in the U.K. due to the hedge? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So I'll answer the latter first and then I'll let Omid and Jonathan talk about the pricing section &#x2013; question.  On hedging, we don't give any of the details of the gains.  So unfortunately we just don't do that.  So on the pricing maybe Omid and Jonathan your thoughts. Let's start with Omid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I think advertisers are just being very rational here.  They really are looking at their cost per acquisition or action and adjusting their pricing based on that.  We're not seeing people, you know, in any significant trends in terms of people dropping out of the auction, so our expectation is that again as the competition increases and the dynamics return, we'll get back to the previous levels.  I think it's purely again results driven, rational behavior by advertisers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Thanks, good afternoon.  Just two questions.  I guess the first one for Jonathan on mobile.  Can you give us a sense of what the click-through rates look like on mobile relative to traditional search? And then secondly, just on the cash balance on the balance sheet, any new thoughts on how you may deploy that in terms of a sizeable acquisition or perhaps returning that to shareholders?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have specific data on click through rate.  Eric, did you have something to add? So you know, we're certainly seeing more advertisers are choosing to run their ads on mobile devices.  You can see examples if you query auto insurance on the iPhone or an Android device and the RPMs on the iPhone and Android are high even though we're in very early days of the mobile ecosystem but I don't have specific data on how click through rates differ.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cash balance, obviously we do have a significant cash balance and I'd love to get Eric's thoughts on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the most important thing to say that it is not burning a hole in our pocket.  2.2 billion of incremental cash will sit in nice, safe, low interest bearing accounts while the economic system works its way through the banking system and all of that.  We continue to evaluate what we might do with the cash, but we &#x2013; our view at the moment is to remain very, very conservative and I don't think that will change any time soon.  We're fortunate that our very high profitability really does generate a lot of cash and that's a nice position for us to be in.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks guys. Patrick, just a couple of numbers related questions.  If we look at the international growth like ex- foreign currency and ex- hedging it looks like it's gone from 30% year-over-year to around 22% in the first quarter, a little bit more of a deceleration than the 32 to 30 from 3Q to 4Q.  So just wanted to get a little more color on, you know, regions that you're seeing potentially more weakness outside the U.K. on the international front.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is back to the bonus accrual issue.  If we look at your cash operating expense, so you know, cost of goods ex-TAC, R&amp;D, sales and marketing and G&amp;A, it went down by about 168 million from 4Q to 1Q.  How much of that decline was related to the change in bonus accrual policy versus just straight cost cutting?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So on the international front and Omid can give more color commentary on that, but essentially what I've mentioned at the front end of the call is for Europe specifically there are a few countries that the economic downturn has made its way to Europe, so now obviously the effects are there, and I've mentioned a few countries and then internationally the big cannons like China and Brazil and a few others continued to actually perform relatively well. Omid, would you have any additional comments on these markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's consistent with the comments you opened with, Patrick, and in general we're seeing the lens of Google really gives a lot of insights in by industry and economic conditions that we all know about, for example, finance and real estate in specific countries that are hit.  In China and Brazil for example, we have performed reasonably well and very strong growth year to year.</p>
          <p>In markets where finances are hardly hit or real estate is hardly hit we see the same patterns.  In autos for example where, as I mentioned in my comments we are seeing robust that there is actually robust activity and a lot of kind of people taking &#x2013; doing repairs or maintenance of cars rather than purchasing new cars.  So it's really industry by industry and country by country, kind of mirroring the activity that we see in the economy overall.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks Omid. On the accrual we don't give all the details of this economic, the facts, but what I can tell you it is true that it finds itself in numerous line items. So it is not only in the G&amp;A portion but would find itself into the R&amp;D or &#x2013; as it is part of labor cost.  And so from that perspective, don't be surprised to find it in a few line items but we don't divulge the details of it.  Thanks Ross. Let's go to the next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Sandeep Aggarwal from Collins Stewart.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question.  First of all, congratulations to Omid for finishing a stellar inning at Google and good luck with the new role.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, you mentioned towards the beginning of the call some trends in the CPC. So one question is the CPC trends you are seeing, are they largely cyclical or are there any secular shift in terms of &#x2013; I'm not necessarily saying search getting mature, but as search gets into 13 or 14th year of operation? And secondly, you know, what kind of traction you are seeing for Android on mobile and what do you think about a potential of Android on the netbook?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>J.R.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'll start with the questions on CPC.  I think the main thing that you're seeing is really a function of some of the remarks that we made earlier.  We see users are still searching but they're searching for lower value stuff, you know used cars versus new cars as Omid said.  When they do search, they do seem to be a little bit less interested in buying and that's shown by somewhat fewer clicks and conversions.  So I think part of the dynamic as we said, is just the auction acting rationally and the advertisers not pulling out but just cutting their bid to manage their ROI.</p>
          <p>I think the other thing that you see across the board is there is a bit of a geographical mix dynamic when you look at overall CPC.  We have high growth in some of the emerging markets like China and Brazil and there's also an FX component to the whole thing.  So I think that's the set of things that we see.</p>
          <p>As the economy comes back, I have every expectation that we'll see the kind of dynamics that we've seen in the past and as we get better at targeting our ad system and building tools like some of the ones I mentioned in my prepared remarks, like Conversion Optimizer, I think there's certainly headroom for us to target much, much better ads which could and should have higher CPCs if their yielding higher conversion.  I think Eric will probably take the Android netbooks question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Jonathan.  Overall it looks like Android is going to have a very, very strong year.  We are already aware of many, many uses of Android which as you know is open source, where literally the devices we hear about mirror the announcement so the open source part of the strategy is working.</p>
          <p>We've also recently just announced an upgrade and new software for Android which is out among the technical community and again the stability, the proof points are really there now. There are announcements happening between now and the end of the year that are quite significant from operators and new hardware partners in the Android space which I won't preannounce except to say that they really do fulfill much of the vision that we laid out more than a year ago.</p>
          <p>On the netbook side, there are a number of people who have actually taken Android and ported it over to netbook or netbook similar devices, so we think that's another one of the great benefits of the open source model that we've used and we're excited that that investment is occurring, and again largely outside of Google, which we think is great.  Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  We'll go to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Mark May from Needham &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Two questions.  I'm hoping that someone will talk about the downsizing in your sales team recently and what you were &#x2013; what your aims are in terms of how you were trying to optimize the group.  Just explain the rationale behind that &#x2013; those changes.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I think you highlighted health as being one of the stronger ad categories in the quarter.  There were obviously some letters from the FDA with some search advertisers in that category.  Are you concerned about how that might impact the health advertising search category for you going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll let Omid answer the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Patrick.  So in terms of the positions that were eliminated, we &#x2013; obviously always painful for us to do that and thankful for the employees and their contributions to Google.  We just have been very disciplined in looking at our &#x2013; how we measure the performance of each region and looking at whether we have expectations that have not materialized and that, you know, that we had some investments in areas that we need to shift, for example, from one region to another.</p>
          <p>So when we took it &#x2013; when we look at the kind of like countries in terms of their status of growth and potential and look at some of the emerging markets, we just very systematically looked at the performance and the resources that are against them and decided in certain areas for example that we were overinvested.  In other cases, you know, we had aligned organizations better so we had taken marketing positions for example and combined them with our sales force and field marketing organizations and in some cases there were overlaps in those groups and we just have been very disciplined at looking at those areas and eliminating those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let &#x2013; just as a complement to that point before I let Jonathan talk about the health vertical and the issues that you have mentioned, I think that it's just fair to say &#x2013; I mean I think, Omid, you would agree with this, you know, when you grow so quickly in the way we did, it's almost impossible to get everything right every step of the way.  So in that sense, I mean these rationalizations are not because the business is not performing, it's just when you take a pause and you look at &#x2013; and it's time to optimize a little bit more, you get these kind of opportunities that show up.  Wouldn't that be a fair statement, Omid?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. For the health one, let me turn to Jonathan to give you more of a perspective on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know all the details about the FDA's issues, but I know that their suggestions, I'm not sure they're regulations, that we want to make the ads to be compliant with particular rules, they generally relate to pharmaceutical advertising and the dynamics around drugs needing to have side effects along with the benefits.</p>
          <p>So we're working with the advertisers to try to figure out how to get their ads in compliance and that's certainly going to take some work.  I wouldn't say that pharma is the largest component of total revenue in that category.  So I think we'll figure that out with the advertisers and move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jonathan.  Look, we probably have time for one or two more questions, one more question. So let's go to the next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you and congratulations, Omid.  A couple of questions.  You mentioned that your customers a couple times throughout this call that they view as more of a sales and distribution channel over marketing channel.  I guess broadly when do you kind of or have you approached a lot of the larger companies and said let's go into the VP of sales, the CFO, the CEO to have a conversation about how Google can help move the sales needle and almost similar to an outsource sales force or distribution channel as opposed to going in at the marketing level which seems to be kind of a tough area these days?</p>
          <p>And second, just curious, I know Twitter has been talked about in the marketplace and the media a lot of late. Seems like more of a passive communication model that is very effective.  I guess when you look at that type of business model or that concept, can you talk about how do you monetize something like that in general using the existing page search or display type ad models?  I know that it's an independent company but curious of your thoughts of a model like that?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll let Omid talk about the first one and then on the Twitter issue, I'll let Eric give his thoughts strategically about Twitter in general. So on the sales channel, Omid, you want to start?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the sales front, absolutely, that's exactly what we do. And we really try to service all the senior level executives in our target customer base and named accounts, making all the tools that we have from our analytical tools to presentations, case studies, vertical analysis to really demonstrate that we are a very, very strong customer acquisition channel.</p>
          <p>Obviously as we're also entering into the display business more and more in YouTube with &#x2013; there is all the branding benefits and traditional ways of reaching an audience, and kind of creating the classic impressions that the display advertising is wonderful for.  So we're really trying to fire on all cylinders and approach it from all angles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. I'll let Eric talk about Twitter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the Twitter side, I think Twitter proves that innovation is alive and well in Silicon Valley. And it's really come on board very strong in the last year. It's been around for a couple of years, and it provides this incredibly useful thing, what am I doing right now?  So the question here is how could you make some money at that?</p>
          <p>And without conversing specifically about Twitter because there's a number of real-time update companies like Twitter, you could imagine that to the degree that they become successful, and obviously, Twitter is already doing so, it could be a channel for product information, marketing information, real-time information for which you can hang advertising products whether it's a text ad or a video ad or so forth off of it.</p>
          <p>And I don't know personally their strategy but it strikes me that's a logical strategy for them to pursue and something that we would be very happy to pursue with them and all the other players in that space.  The real great thing about Twitter is it proves that people really want to communicate and that communication can occur in many, many different forms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric. Let me close now and with the last comments before we close the call formally just to summarize, I mean obviously a good quarter despite a tough economic conditions out there.  I think the key message is around we're still in uncharted territory. This is a tough environment for everyone. And then finally, you know, the resilience of the model is actually pretty interesting given everything that's been thrown at us both from the economy and the FX.</p>
          <p>Finally I think it is really important to recognize all of the Googlers and all our partners for an unbelievable set of efforts in Q1 and I think it is important to really thank them for all their efforts, so good job.</p>
