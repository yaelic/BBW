          <p>... limited to statements regarding our financial outlook, future product offerings and future demand. These statements are based on current expectations as of the date of this call, and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect, as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2009, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in our statements.</p>
          <p>In addition, during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of VMware's performance, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP measures exclude the effect on our GAAP results of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions, the net effect of amortization and capitalization of software, and acquisition related items. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP measures, in our earnings release for the period ended March 31, 2010, and on the Investor Relations page of our website.</p>
          <p>The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 30 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Our second quarter quiet period begins at the close of business, June 16, 2010. Also, unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be in reference to our results for the comparable period of 2009.</p>
          <p>With that, let me hand it over to Mark.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. VMware had a great first quarter, with record free cash flows, revenue and operating profit. Our business was particularly strong in Europe, China and Japan. The demand we witnessed in the December quarter somewhat unexpectedly carried over into the March quarter. We are not yet ready to assume that the world's economy is robust, and believe that we continue to benefit from pent-up customer demand on the heels of a long dry period.</p>
          <p>Our field execution was outstanding across the board, and we're seeing the benefit of our international investments, particularly in Japan and China. In Europe, we closed an eight-figure ELA that included over $8 million of license bookings. This is our largest ELA since Q1 2009. We maintained strong discipline on product discounting, and even though our mix shifted from Enterprise Plus toward vSMP focused vSphere packages, we were able to maintain our blended ASPs at similar levels to those in 2009.</p>
          <p>Customers continue to adopt the vSphere platform as a strategic investment that delivers substantial cost savings, improved efficiency and flexibility for their business. Our message is clear and is resonating with our customers: Cloud computing is not a destination, it is an architecture. The foundation of that architecture is vSphere, which enables customers to leverage their existing IT investment and greatly simplify their data centers, while providing the flexibility to take advantage of the offerings from vCloud service providers.</p>
          <p>During the March quarter, we closed the acquisitions of RTO Software and Zimbra. In early April, we acquired certain of the management products, technology and people from EMC's Ionics group. Combined, we welcomed the nearly 500 new people that these acquisitions bring to VMware, and look forward to delivering new products to our customers.</p>
          <p>These acquisitions complement our virtualization solutions. We continue to invest in our core virtualization platform to maintain and extend our multi-generational lead over commodity virtualization offerings. We plan to release updates of both View and vSphere during the year.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with nearly $2.8 billion of cash and $1.4 billion of deferred revenue. Strong revenue performance, improved operating leverage and capital efficiency led to trailing 12 month free cash flows just short of $1 billion, growth year-over-year of 40%. We're pleased with the quarter and want to thank all of the people of VMware, our partners and our customers.</p>
          <p>Now I'll walk you through the details. Total revenue for the first quarter was $634 million, up 35% from a year ago. Total license revenue was $312 million, an increase of 21% from the first quarter of a year ago. Clearly, revenues surpassed our expectations, as IT spending was stronger than expected, driven by a carryover of the pent-up demand we witnessed in the December quarter. We also benefited from strong sales across our global regions in all customer segments. In particular, Europe was stronger than expected, and the team closed an eight-figure ELA with a large customer that netted over $8 million of license bookings. In addition, our OEM partners had a very strong December finishes for the U.S., resulting in better than anticipated revenue. Finally, we saw enthusiastic demand for Essentials and Essentials Plus, primarily in the SMB markets. Despite the unit mix shift to lower-priced packaging, discipline around our discounting allowed us to maintain our blended ASPs flat to Q4.</p>
          <p>Software maintenance and support revenue was $267 million, an increase of 52% from last year. Our maintenance recovery program has now been in place for a full year, and although down sequentially from Q4, back maintenance revenue almost doubled from Q1 a year ago. As the program will see its anniversary in Q2, we expect back maintenance for the balance of 2010 to be lower compared to the same period of 2009. In total, renewal bookings grew approximately 56% compared to the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Professional services revenue was $54 million, an increase of 44% from last year and stronger than our expectations. Customers consume professional service credits primarily for training and to assist in planning and implementation of vSphere deployment. Our deferred revenue related to professional services declined sequentially by $7 million.</p>
          <p>U.S. revenues increased 30% from a year ago to $317 million, representing half of total revenue. International revenue grew 40% to 317 million, driven by strong demand across geographies, particularly Europe, China and Japan. Enterprise license agreements were in the mid-teens as a percentage of total bookings, and transactions with order values less than $50,000 represented approximately half of total orders. As a reminder, late in Q2 2009, we started to bill and collect in euro, pounds sterling, yen and the Aussie dollar. Until we have the full quarter of prior year comparables, we won't be able to provide you with a constant currency revenue impact.</p>
          <p>I'll now provide some details on our operating expenses. Unless otherwise noted, all references to our expenses and operating results are on a non-GAAP basis, which are reconciled in the press release table and posted on our Investor Relations website. Total operating expenses, including cost of services, and cost of license, increased 2% sequentially to $459 million, driven largely by increased head count, the seasonal impact of payroll taxes, and a robust set of internal IT initiatives to deliver productivity tools to our field and support organizations, aimed at significantly improving customer and partner experience.</p>
          <p>As a percentage of first quarter revenue, cost of revenues were 12.2%, consistent with our 2009 run rate. First quarter R&amp;D expenses increased sequentially to $124 million, or 19.5% of revenues, as compared with 18.7% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Most of the increase was head count related. Sales and marketing expenses were $200 million or 31.6% of revenues compared with 35.1% in the fourth quarter. The decline is largely the result of Q4 variable sales compensation. G&amp;A expenses were $58 million or 9.1% of revenue compared to 8.5% of revenue in Q4. The sequential increase was significantly influenced by contractor costs associated with IT projects and progress, and our global leadership meetings and 2010 kick-off events.</p>
          <p>Our operating profit, measured on a non-GAAP basis, increased 11% sequentially to $175 million or 27.6% of revenue. This beat our forecast range due primarily to operating leverage from our revenue performance. The quarter benefited by approximately 60 basis points from FX rates as compared to Q4, but was negatively impacted by approximately 130 basis points from our Zimbra and SpringSource acquisitions. The non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.32 a share on 417 million diluted shares. Our share repurchase program did not have an impact on EPS during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Now on to our balance sheet and cash flow statements. Our balance sheet remains strong, with cash at quarter end of nearly $2.8 billion, a sequential increase of $270 million, driven primarily by the seasonal collection of accounts receivable from the December quarter billings. During the March quarter, we used nearly $200 million for capital spending, M&amp;A activity and our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we announced authorization to repurchase up to $400 million of our Class A common stock through 2011; the objective of the VMware program is to partially offset the dilution from employee stock issuance.</p>
          <p>Total deferred revenues were 1.4 billion, up 48% from the same period last year and a 2% sequential increase. As a reminder, over 90% of our deferred revenue is recognized with the passage of time or the delivery of professional services. The remainder is solely tied to product release events. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 7,400 people, an increase of 300 from the beginning of the year. Approximately a third of these were from the acquisitions of Zimbra and RTO. However, the M&amp;A activity of early April related to Ionics increases our Q2 beginning-of-quarter head count to approximately 7,700 people, a 9% increase from the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating cash flows, which exclude adjustments for capitalization of software development costs and excess tax benefits from stock compensation, were $357 million for the quarter, and nearly 1.1 billion for the trailing 12 months ended March 31. Free cash flows for the quarter were $326 million and 972 million for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow per share was $0.78 for the quarter. Free cash flow per share for the trailing 12 months was $2.39.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow per share can be volatile in the short term, so we believe looking at it over a trailing 12 months is a better indicator of progress. We are paying increasing attention to the metric as a measure of financial progress in our business as it balances operating results, cash management, capital efficiency and share dilution.</p>
          <p>The fully diluted share count increased to 417 million shares for the first quarter, driven by the impact of a higher share price on the calculation of diluted securities. We expect our Q2 diluted weighted average share count will be approximately 425 million shares, and approximately 430 million shares for the full year.</p>
          <p>Before I hand it off to Tod, I want to share with you how we are looking at the business to give you some assistance in developing your estimates. During the first quarter, we were the beneficiary of pent-up customer demand that carried over from the fourth quarter. We did not forecast the eight-figure ELA, and we don't have anything of this size in our current second quarter pipeline. Make no mistake, Q1 was a great quarter and we are encouraged by the uptake in SMB demand and the strong preference of our customers when faced with competitive options. Given this, we're planning for the future, assuming the economic recovery and IT spending will be gradual.</p>
          <p>We are increasing our revenue and operating margin guidance as a result of our increased near-term visibility and the expected incremental revenue from our M&amp;A activities. We expect second quarter revenues of between 635 million and $665 million, flat to up 5% sequentially, and a sequential decline in license revenue. Revenue from our recent M&amp;A activity represents low single-digit percentage of our guidance.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, the second quarter comparable to last year is relatively easy and over the last two years, license revenue has declined in Q2 relative to Q1, primarily as a result of our reporting of OEM revenue. We expect the acquisitions we have made to be further dilutive to our non-GAAP operating margins. Our 2010 merit increases take effect in Q2, and will cost 120 basis points of margin. Taking into account our adjustments to GAAP operating income that Mike disclosed at the start of the call, we expect second quarter non-GAAP operating margins to be between 25 and 27%. We expect our GAAP operating margin to be approximately 13 to 14 percentage points lower than our non-GAAP operating margin.</p>
          <p>We have established a high bar, given our performance over the past 2 quarters relative to expectations. The second half of 2010 is a much more difficult comparable than the first half, particularly in the fourth quarter, which in 2009 included the impact of our promotion to upgrade customers to Enterprise Plus. We continue to set 6-month quota plans and operate our business in a half yearly rhythm, but expect Q3 license revenue to be flat to slightly down from Q2, reflecting seasonality. We also expect a currency headwind on revenue in the second half as we have the anniversary of our local currency billing and collection.</p>
          <p>We are currently planning on 2010 revenue of between 2.625 billion and 2.725 billion, or growth of 30 to 35% for the year. From a margin perspective, we will continue to invest both organically and through acquisitions. Our current expectation for the full year non-GAAP operating margin is a range of 25 to 27%, but this could be disrupted by M&amp;A activity. We expect our 2010 GAAP operating margin to be approximately 14 to 15 percentage points lower than our non-GAAP operating margin.</p>
          <p>To summarize, Q1 was a great quarter and we were pleased with our execution and solid performance. We are planning for the future, assuming the economic recovery will be gradual. We continue to manage our resources prudently, while making the key investments necessary to maximize our long-term growth and free cash flow per share. Tod?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon. As you just heard from Mark, it appears the technology industry is broadly benefiting from pent-up customer demand, and VMware is no exception, but as we look at our first quarter performance, VMware also benefited from strong field execution around the world and solid product line performance across all customer segments. Further, we are experiencing not just revenue growth, but an overall strengthening of our existing enterprise relationships and are making progress, expanding our footprint within the government sector as well as the small and medium business market.</p>
          <p>vSphere continues to gain relevance, as customers are increasingly utilizing the advanced features of our core virtualization platform as they progress to the next phase of their virtualization journey. Our most recent customer survey showed strong adoption of what we consider the more unique and innovative vSphere functionality most directly associated with the business production phase of the virtualization journey. For example, within the last year, we saw the usage of a feature which enables the automated load balancing of VMs increase from being used by 35% of customers to 56% of customers surveyed. Similarly, the usage of Storage VMotion nearly doubled, an increase from 25% to 49%.</p>
          <p>We also saw a very fast uptake of the new features we brought to market with the release of vSphere 4 in Q2 of last year. Of the customers who upgraded to vSphere 4 by the end of 2009, 34% were already using Fault Tolerance in production, and 29% were using vStorage in provisioning and production. These statistics illustrate adoption points along the virtualization journey. Further, as we learn more about our customers' real world experiences and deployments, we tailor our solutions, professional services, and go-to-market strategies to help them accelerate their adoption and progress on the journey.</p>
          <p>We are also beginning to see the SMB market increasingly value our most innovative technologies. In general, the SMB market, once it begins the virtualization journey, is progressing along at a much faster pace than enterprises, partly because they have fewer servers, but also, they have fewer people, processes and cultural implications to deal with as they transform their IT departments. We certainly expect competitive pressures to grow in the SMB market, but as of today, we continue to see good growth in this market segment and have maintained our blended ASPs over the past several quarters.</p>
          <p>We are investing on all fronts to take advantage of our momentum. We are seeing the rewards of this investment, especially in Japan, China, Russia and across Europe, where we are now fully executing an aggressive expansion effort. As an example, in Japan in Q1, we saw a year-over-year revenue growth of 100%.</p>
          <p>The desktop virtualization market continues to show promise, with an increasing portion of our field organization engaging with customers on desktop evaluations and running proof of concepts. Further, we are seeing our early adopter customers broaden their desktop deployments, some into several thousand and even to 10,000-plus desktops. A specific example, in Q1 2010, one of the largest banks in the world made the decision to expand their virtual desktop deployment to 30,000 seats, up from their initial 3,000 seat deployment. Key drivers for them were centralized management, locked down security, while delivering the best user experience through VMware View's protocol, PC over IP.</p>
          <p>While we have a number of success stories, this market opportunity has not yet tipped and our challenge remains in moving the broader market from evaluation to purchase. We expect to learn more about how this market will unfold over the coming quarters and remain excited by, and focused on, the desktop opportunity.</p>
          <p>Overall, I'm pleased with our performance and results in Q1. From an operations perspective, our goal is to consistently strike the right balance of executing on our quarterly plans, while building the foundation of our business that will allow us to scale and grow over the coming years.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll hand the call over to Paul. Paul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tod. As Mark and Tod have noted, we saw very positive results during Q1 as our customers responded to the fundamental value proposition of virtualization as being not only the way to increase efficiency in the short term, but also being the strategic evolutionary product, or a better way of providing IT services in the future. We see increasing number of customers not only wishing to push for deeper virtualization, but to now reach for a true private Cloud, which will enable them to operate like internal service providers, a concept we refer to as IT as a service.</p>
          <p>As we've outlined before, our goal is to be able to offer the software to not only build these private Clouds, but to manage them, to develop for them, to offer core services that will sit on top of them and to be able to enable hybrid Clouds which span both the private and the public Cloud. During the course of 2010, then, we'll see significant releases and updates of all of our major products to enable these goals. We'll update our core vSphere product line, which offers the foundation for both increased usage of virtualization and the private Cloud. As Tod noted, we are pleased with the way our customers are adopting and exploiting the new functionality that we introduced in vSphere 4.0 last year. We will build on these capabilities as we seek to further increase scalability and deepen the level of automation we can offer in the data center.</p>
          <p>We will also extend our vCenter management product line. In addition to the internal development we have already underway, we announced during the quarter that we'd acquired certain assets from EMC that pertain to configuration control, compliance management, application discovery and service management. These assets will be integrated with our current management offerings to offer a more complete solution for managing both private and hybrid Clouds.</p>
          <p>We'll also significantly update our View desktop virtualization product line. As Tod noted, we continue to see strong customer interest and activity here, with some customers pushing ahead with very large deployments.</p>
          <p>You will see both updated and new products coming from our recent acquisitions. In particular, we are pleased with the progress the SpringSource Group is making, maintaining their lead in the Java and open source development space. As shown by the recent acquisition of their RabbitMQ messaging team and technology, we intend to build on this lead and expand our range of offerings that are useful in the context of both the private and the public Cloud.</p>
          <p>The Zimbra team has now been part of VMware for a quarter. We expect to build on their position as the leading open source mail and collaboration product. Zimbra will provide an important scalable solution that can be hosted on the private and the public Cloud by businesses and service providers.</p>
          <p>In summary, we remain convinced that the industry is in the beginnings of a major and far-reaching transition from the PC client server era to the Cloud era and that virtualization offers the bridge between the two. This is a huge opportunity for VMware, and we remain committed to making the investments in our organization, in organic development, in technology acquisitions, in sales and marketing capabilities and the partnerships necessary to realize it.</p>
          <p>Our sales performance over the final months of 2009 and in the past quarter is certainly very good news and a testament to great products and good execution by our sales teams. Things look positive as we look forward, but as Mark commented, I'm not sure if we have sufficient data points to accurately predict the slope of the curve coming out of the recession and to banish the uncertainty that persists in the macroeconomic picture. We are more than holding our own versus our competitors, but we also know that they are determined and have deep pockets. So while we remain fundamentally positive, we know that we cannot relax, and we need to resist the temptations of exuberance.</p>
          <p>So with that, we'll open it up for questions now.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. I've got a question on your comments around your focus on the SMB. Obviously a pretty greenfield opportunity for VMware. You recently introduced some price promotions during March, so I wanted a comment in terms how that promotion is going and how do you see the opportunity unfolding over the course of the next several quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take that first. This is Tod. Our SMB promotion we put into place at the beginning of March, and are seeing great uptake of our vSphere Essentials product. As Mark mentioned in his script, we actually moved &#x2013; saw an increase in that volume, and so there was a shift from the Enterprise and Enterprise Plus products to Essentials and Essentials Plus, and so we're seeing good adoption, good strength in that market, channel is working well with us and we're very encouraged. We're also encouraged that even with this price promotion, that we were able to manage our discounting such that overall our blended ASPs were able to stay the same as they were in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And was the focus, if I could just follow-up, was the focus there really to go after the Greenfield, as opposed to any competitive pressures that you may be starting to see in the SMB channel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. The focus was it's a greenfield opportunity. There's a lot of, around the world, a lot of SMB out there, and it's a great opportunity for us to get our product in their hands.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Mark, I was wondering if you could address the conservative Q2 license guide, at least from our perspective. Also, if you look at the maintenance catch-up program, can you just bring us up to speed? It sounds like you expect it to tail off, but certainly seems like you're adding a lot of new licenses, so I would expect that that carry forward on maintenance would help you out going forward. Can you just address both? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Brent. First, on the sequential license decline, a number of factors. First, the large ELA that we booked during Q1 was about $8 million, and that wasn't in our original forecast. If you look back to Q1 of last year, we had a similar phenomenon with some large government deals that we booked, and then Q2 declined sequentially. Secondly, our OEM license revenue is seasonal, and so we benefited from the December shipments of the X86 system vendors in our Q1 and just even though server shipments are strong, they're down sequentially in Q1. Finally, we have a bit of license revenue uptick from the acquisitions, but it's not enough to offset the other two. So this is really consistent with the past two years of license revenue declining in Q2 sequentially from Q1.</p>
          <p>With respect to maintenance recoveries, the way that that program works is it was focused on companies that had not renewed upon their renewal period. We got very disciplined operationally beginning in Q2 of last year to make sure that we were reaching out to customers that hadn't renewed automatically, and so, the recovery revenue that we expect &#x2013; in other words, going back and capturing maintenance that isn't within the period upon the renewal &#x2013; we just expect that maintenance to decline over time as we capture new licenses as they're booked on an annual basis.</p>

          <p>And just to be clear, you had two elephant <mark type="inaudible" /> government transactions in Q1 of last year worth 20 million, and this Q1 you had an $8 million transaction. So there were no other large transactions; it's a 20 versus $8 million contrast.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Good quarter. Just have a couple questions here. First, just on the desktop side, wondering if you could just talk about trends in desktop virtualization that you're seeing. And then when do you start to think that that's going to actually see an inflection point occur? Is it this year or is it next year, and what do you actually think you'd need to see in the market? And then also, just from a spending perspective, clearly you're raising your operating margin guidance for the full year. Where do you expect most of that leverage to come from? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Tod. I'll take the desktop one and I'll let Mark address the margin. With respect to the desktop, we're seeing a lot of interest from customers. Most every customer we're engaged with wants to hear about our desktop virtualization strategy. Many are running proof of concepts. We've got our field organization and our partner organization really ramped up to drive and provide the information our customers need to evaluate.</p>
          <p>I think another driving factor is going be that the current desktop fleet out there is aging, and with a pending Windows 7 upgrade, many customers are saying if they're going to upgrade to Windows 7, they want to virtualize at the same time.</p>
          <p>Exactly when this market's going to tip, though, we don't know. We're staying engaged and focused on it, but I couldn't tell you if it's going be at the end of the year or next year, or exactly when that's going to be, but our eyes are certainly on the ball, and we're going to make sure that when it does tip, we're there to take advantage of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Phil, this is Mark. Our guide in January for the full year was to continue to target around the 25% range in operating margins, which is the low end of the guidance that we provided today of 25 to 27%. That said, expectations on operating leverage are going to come from the recognition of deferred revenue as maintenance amortizes off, as we've been building that balance over most of the quarters; as well as our professional services revenue, which has lower general margins, isn't growing as quickly as the rest of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to John DiFucci with JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mark, I wanted to circle back to the guidance. You've obviously put up some good numbers so looking sequentially, it's I guess not that surprising to see, to expect something to come down, license to come down. But last year truly was an anomaly with the economy deteriorating, continuing to deteriorate from the March to the June quarter, and then, if you look at 2008, if I look back at my notes, anyway, it was a very disappointing quarter for you. When I look back the last couple years before that, you actually had an increase, and that's normally what we would expect for IT spending from the first to the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and then I guess you also are saying you expect it to be flattish to perhaps down in the third quarter, and not to take anything away from what you've done the last couple of quarters, but when I look at it, and there's not a lot of history for you guys, right, but it looks like you've been putting up, as far as license goes, sort of normal seasonality, excluding last year.</p>
          <p>To sort of depart from that, it just sort of begs the question, and I would understand if you're trying to be a little more conservative, but given the kind of results you put up the last couple quarters, I just wonder if you could just talk a little more qualitatively about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, John. The fact is that we believe we benefited in Q1 from the pent-up demand that we saw in the fourth quarter, and that there were significant surges in buying in the first quarter. On top of that, we &#x2013; it's been a year since we've had an eight-figure enterprise license agreement. As you saw, our ELA percentage as a total of bookings was in the mid-teens this quarter and at times it's crossed the 20 or 25% range, and that accelerates the recognition of license revenue.</p>
          <p>We are also just in the throes of planning the back half of 2010, and as we look ahead, although we're optimistic, we're still cautious with respect to what the economy has in store for us, as well as the fact that we do have competitors who are willing to throw money at the market, and so, we're just approaching 2010 with caution in assuming that both the economy and IT spending will improve gradually.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>John, this is Paul. I just wanted to add a bit of color comment there. I think it's still too soon to say that we're back in normal waters. I think we're still going to <mark type="inaudible" /> some waves coming out of the recession last year, and we're just uncomfortable saying that that's all behind us, we're back to normal patterns, et cetera.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. Congratulations. Mark, just on Q1 license again, in the last quarter or two, has there been any meaningful amount of license revenue that comes off the balance sheet also that makes the sequential compared harder?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I also wanted to ask about cash flow. Your cash flow generation is extraordinary, I think, relative to your net income and relative to peers, and as that gets more and more focus, going forward this year, could you give us any thoughts on how you would expect cash flow to grow relative to net income? I mean in '09, cash flow grew, I think, over 20%, even though non-GAAP net income was down a little. Can it outpace again this year? What are the dynamics that will affect its relative growth of cash from ops?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Derek, it's a metric that internally we're more and more focused on because it encompasses all of the elements of running our business. Certainly, first and foremost is bookings, and we have been very successful, perhaps much more so than our peers, in being able to get multi-years of maintenance when we sell a new license. So that's the primary driver on the input side.</p>
          <p>We've also had discipline in our cost execution. We have good receivables management. We've kept accounts receivable days, DSO, under 50 days for some time, and so it's really just across the board focus on cash flow as a measurement and as a metric for the business.</p>
          <p>That said, the M&amp;A activity does put pressure on cash flows, but that's something that we're willing to live with because we see it much as you'd see capital investment, is that we're investing for the future and building out products that will help us in this marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one more follow-up on that. Could you talk a little bit about the ELA renewal wave that everybody's been talking about on the way? How much of that have you already started to see, and is that something where you've got ELA renewals coming on top of now your run rate, new ELAs? Is that just kind of one more thing that keeps cash flow generation strong this year or even accelerates it further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Tod. I'll take that. As you know, we've started kind of in earnest our ELA program in 2007, and the majority of them were 3-year terms, and so, many of them will be coming, will be expiring in the back half of this year and will be up for renewal. In Q1, we renewed the majority of the ones that were coming due, and as well, we're adding new ones to the list as well. We expect over the course of the year to renew these as they come forward.</p>
          <p>One of the things we've been asked that we're not doing aggressively is pulling things a bunch forward. We're pulling some forward as the customers engage with us, but we're working at the customer's pace and tracking carefully the deployments, and where are they with respect to their license consumption and making sure that we can not only renew the deal with respect to maintenance, but also up-sell them some of our management products and our desktop products as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Paul. I'd just add another comment on that. We've been very gratified by the response we're seeing from customers in terms of renewing those ELAs. Almost without exception, the ELAs that have come due have renewed, and those that are coming due, we're seeing very encouraging signs from the customers that they intend to renew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. If I could just ask a question or two about the M&amp;A commentary. First of all, could you remind us what percentage of your 2.8 billion in cash is in the U.S.? And then secondly, as we think about M&amp;A on a going-forward basis, obviously a couple deals year-to-date, should we expect you to be more aggressive? Should we expect deals to get larger? And generally, without obviously naming names, what should we be thinking about strategically that you'd like to add into the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Adam, just on the cash comment, a majority of &#x2013; more than 50% of our cash is U.S.-based and available for purposes in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; this is Paul. In terms of our direction, obviously, we're not going to go into any detail of that and drive prices up, but the general rule is we are seeking to invest for future capability, so we are seeking to look at things that can strategically add to our technology repertoire, rather than bulking up on revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just ask a follow-up, then, about the product mix. Enterprise Plus, it sounds like you saw a little bit of a shift towards some of the lower-end SKUs. Do you think that's primarily driven by the incentive programs in the quarter, or is that more of where you are in the product cycle? And how should we be thinking about mix going forward as we get through the promotions into the back half of the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, with respect to the shifts, I think it's partly because the SMB market is just so large, as far as the opportunity and number of customers there are <mark type="inaudible" />, and with our promotion, we certainly helped accelerate some of the focus on that space by us and our channel partners. So I don't think it's indicative that we're going to see things shift like enterprises are using lower end SKUs, but more just as that market opportunity grows and matures in SMB, we'll expect to see continued growth in the SKUs that are targeted on that market.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I had a follow-up question on the ELA renewal comment, and then I had another question about ASPs. On the ELAs, I was just wondering, Paul or Mark, if you could share with us the renewals on average, the ones that you're seeing from 2007, are they coming in at a higher amount than the original ELA, just to give people a sense of a book-to-bill on that? And then I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Heather, this is Mark. Yeah, in general, ELAs are coming in at amounts larger than the original amounts that we booked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, and then the follow-up would be, can you talk about your expectations on ASPs going forward? And also, I think you mentioned that you're going have an update to the product portfolios in the second half of the year. Could you talk to us a little bit about the potential pricing changes we might see, or the SKU changes we might see when you release your new Enterprise products later in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just expectations on ASPs. We have programs in place to make sure that we're doing a good job of managing discounts against list, and we were very successful this quarter and we expect the success to continue by the field organization. That certainly has &#x2013; it's largely dependent upon how the SMB market does, and if we continue to grow the SMB, there will be &#x2013; continue to be downward pressure on overall ASPs.</p>
          <p>With respect to packaging and pricing, we're just not ready to talk about anything until we announce it first to our channel and to our field, and we're always exploring how we might best optimize pricing.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Just had one follow-up on the ELA question. I guess just want to clarify. I guess, as I understand it, the ELA, the customer comes in and renews the maintenance, and you mentioned that you're seeing an uptick in terms of the ELA size at time of renewal. Is that relative to the actual dollars paid, or are you talking about just the footprint of the deployment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really both. The total size of the enterprise agreements are growing and we are seeing new license sales into those organizations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, and then just to help us sort of understand the Q2 dynamic, but I think it would be helpful if we could get a sense of the kind of order of magnitude contribution from the OEMs as those partners have an impact, a delayed impact, on rev rec, just to help us understand the Q2 sequential decline possibility?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, everybody. Wanted to jump over to the international portion of the business, which did quite well. Can you give us some color of how far along your international customers are in virtualization? What products are doing better? So should this trend continue, what changes to the business or revenues flow should we be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we're seeing in Japan and China and Eastern Europe and some of the expansion markets are customers are looking at their early phases of virtualization, and so in the first part of that journey, it's typically around CapEx reduction and the value proposition is incredible, where you could buy 10 servers or you can buy one, and so it's still early stages, much like VMware was 4 or 5 years ago. So we're not seeing as much of, in general, the advanced products around management or Site Recovery Manager, and more folks are looking at View and core vSphere as they're building their base virtualization strategy to get through Phase I. But as I mentioned, we're seeing a strong uptick and seeing good results from these investments and expect that, as they get through this phase of the journey, they'll catch up and look at some of the more advanced features to building a private Cloud, like Paul talked about.</p>

          <p>Absolutely. I was asking about the sales cycles. Are they lengthening or are they shortened right now?</p>

          <p>So for me here, the sales cycles are about where we've seen them. On the desktop side, they're consistent with other desktop sales cycles, but they're certainly a longer sales cycle than we've seen with vSphere. So within the product line, we're seeing consistency across the sales cycle durations, but there is definitely a difference between selling a View deployment versus vSphere.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for letting me slide in under the wire. Wanted to talk about some products in the Cloud division. You hired a guy in March that's the leader of the Redis open source memory cache, and that's one of those technologies that go under the no SQL tag, so it's that movement that all the cool kids are getting caught up in, and I'm an old database guy, so I know that relational databases are really unsuitable for storing stuff in the Cloud and there's a lot of small players in there.</p>
          <p>So by taking this on, are you really tipping your hand regarding entering the sort of the emerging or alternative database market &#x2013; not trying to compete with Oracle but by saying, hey, that stuff doesn't work, here's the solution? And can you give us any sort of larger thoughts about the storage architectures for the Cloud that you're thinking about? Not talking about storage management and integrating that with vSphere, the classical kind of thing; I'm talking about more advanced technologies like that.</p>

          <p>This is Paul. We'd be happy for you to come around and have a cup of coffee with me and we could discuss that for several hours. The very, very short answer to your question is is we are not trying to get into the database business per se. We are trying to be into the business of enabling applications for the Cloud, both private and public, and as I said, building of our SpringSource acquisition, we are adding to the repertoire of underlying middleware and technology that we think are going be needed to develop a new generation of applications.</p>
          <p>So in that sense, our hiring of the gentleman in question is a further indication, as was the RabbitMQ acquisition, of our intent to build a very compelling suite to enable you to build Cloud-based applications. If you want to get into the whole database and data storage discussion, as I said, swing by and we can have a long and interesting debate about that.</p>
