        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you all for joining us today in Grupo M&#xE9;xico's first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Rogelio Velez, CEO of Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, Jorge Pulido, Head of Investor Relations and other executives of the company.</p>
          <p>On today's conference call I will first briefly comment on the economic environment of this quarter and the main issues impacting the company's profitability. Then, I will comment on our Mining Division's most relevant results, to pass on the call to Rogelio who will explain the financial results of our Transportation Division.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, copper prices as well as molybdenum and zinc were lower on a year-over-year basis. Copper prices were again more influenced by microeconomic news than by the copper market fundamentals. We still expect more volatility in the short term, mainly driven by U.S. economic news, the stabilization of the European debt crisis and economic growth in China.</p>
          <p>China continues to be a major catalyst, being responsible for 40% of consumption in 2011, with a 6% increase in consumption year-over-year. China implemented measures in 2011 to slow down its growth. However, some levels of copper consumption still continued. We expect China demand to increase in the rest of 2012 and to hold steady through 2013, due to strong investment in infrastructure, which also drives the energy sector.</p>
          <p>Copper fundamentals remained solid. We are seeing a more positive approach from investors, supported by a better than expected economic downturn and low inventory levels. A combination of lower ore grades worldwide and the location of new projects and capacity reductions will keep the copper to price high. 2012 thus appears to be shaping up to be another year of tightness in the market, remained exactly fit for the third consecutive year.</p>
          <p>Although, molybdenum prices were lower compared to the first quarter of 2011, volumes improved quarter-over-quarter. This was due mainly to increased demand from the steel industry, lower inventory levels and solid consumption from the oil and gas industry. Average silver prices in the first quarter of 2012 was $32.69 per ounce, represents increase year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Grupo M&#xE9;xico's financial highlights, we are very happy to report that in the first quarter of 2012 our total consolidated revenues were a new record high of $2.7 billion, increasing 10% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Our major achievement in the quarter was to increase sales despite lower metal prices, while reducing costs. This increase was a result of greater production at all our mines, mainly at Buenavista in Mexico and Ray in Arizona. Combined, the recruitment operations generated by our Transportation division, it grew its revenues 10% year-over-year because of the record investments made during 2011.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales for the first quarter were $1.2 billion, the same level than the first quarter of 2011. We continue the efforts of reducing cost in peripheral activities and maintain consumption and expense discipline, with the goal of strengthening our position as one of the worlds leading copper producer.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the first quarter was $1.4 billion, a significant growth of 22% year-over-year. Out of which some $2 billion came from our Mining division and $142 million from our Transportation division, which increased the EBITDA 32% year-over-year. Overall, EBITDA margin improved to nearly 51%. Net income in the first quarter was $716 million, reaching our new quarterly record high, perhaps the increase of 35% year-over-year and an increase of 21% quarter-over-quarter .</p>
          <p>In the first quarter total capital expenditures reached a quarterly record of $481 million, out of which 200 was spent in the Mining division, $20 million in the Transportation division and $263 million in our Infrastructure division. As you know, last year was the record year of investment in Transportation division. As I mentioned, we invested $355 million. We are happy to report that we are starting to see the results of those investments.</p>
          <p>We were able to increase sales, increase average speeds, improve fuel consumption and increased the train lengths, while reducing costs. For the Infrastructure division, $211 million were invested during the first quarter to acquire two new jack-up exploration rigs. And $52 million to keep on with our construction of the two combined cycle power plants that are being built by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:05:53), Mexico.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight that our focus is around value creation. We want to optimize our present value of our assets, maintaining one of the most competitive cost structures in the industry.</p>
          <p>I will now discuss the main developments of our mining division, represented by Americas Mining Company, which now comprises as subsidiaries Southern Copper Corporation and Asarco.</p>
          <p>Americas Mining mine carbon production in the first quarter 2012 increased 20% to 200,384 tons of copper, compared to 167,000 tons in the first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>This increase was mainly due to the improvement of ore grades at all our mines, especially at Ray with an increase of 60%, Silver Bell 50%, and Cuajone 23%. This resulted in increased production, particularly at Buenavista, which showed an increase of 70%, which have been operating at its maximum capacity since April 2011 and which produced 47,036 tons of copper in the first quarter.  That compares to 27,590 tons in the first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>Copper production increased 19% at our Ray mine and 18% also at our Cuajone mine. We've been very active increasing our drilling and finding new reserves for Asarco. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:07:11) Asarco's mine production in the first quarter 2012 increased 11% to 47,470 tons, compared to 42,897 tons in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>We expect to maintain our growth and therefore a production during the remaining quarters of 2012. We are maintaining our copper production guidance of 840,000 tons for 2012.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter 2012, Molybdenum production increased 8% to 4,623 tons compared to 4,274 in the first quarter of 2011. This was mainly due a 54% improvement in our growth at the Toquepala mine. This number represents 6% of Americas mining sales.</p>
          <p>Silver mine production increased by 12% on a year-over-year basis, due to greater outputs on Buenavista, Toquepala, and Cuajone.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures for our Mining division totaled $200 million during the first quarter 2012, compared to $89 million in the first quarter of 2011. Americas Mining capital expenditure budget is still is $1.7 billion for the year, out of which $747 million will be invested in Buenavista, $200 million allocated to our expansion in Toquepala, and $165 million to our expansions at Cuajone.  And $84 million to our expansion at Mission mine in Arizona. The balance will remain.</p>
          <p>As you know, we hold the world's largest copper reserves of any company. We were working to convert the reserves into cash producing assets that can actually be profitable.</p>
          <p>Regarding our Buenavista mine, work is underway on new Quebalix. The project report 95% completion and the facility is expected to start operations in second quarter 2012. In addition, construction has begun on the new SX/EW plant.</p>
          <p>The equipment acquired for the Tia Maria project has been reallocated to this plant, and will allow us to increase the original annual capacity of the new plant from 88,000 tons to 120,000 tons of copper cathode. The plant is expected to start operations in the second half of 2013.</p>
          <p>We also continue to work on the new Buenavista concentrator, with an estimated annual production of 188,000 tons of copper content and a second molybdenum plant that will produce 2,600 tons per year.</p>
          <p>The mine and concentrator expansions are underway in Toquepala. Through March 31, 34% has been spent in the project, which is schedule to be completed in the first quarter of 2014.</p>
          <p>Cuajone expansion will include the ore milling capacity and includes a variable cutoff grade methodology. And at March 31, 33% of the budget have been spent and will be completed by the third quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>Regarding to Tia Maria, the company have initiated a new environmental impact study. That would include the written guidelines set by the Peruvian government and the observations made by United Nations parties. We are confident that this initiative will allow us to obtain the approval for the results and we believe product date in 2015.</p>
          <p>With respect to our ASARCO mine Mission in Arizona, the project will expand the concentrator with two new mills. This will allow us to increase annual production 11,500 tons of copper content. The project is expected to be completed in second quarter of 2013. In addition, studies are underway for the reopening of the molybdenum plant at Mission. The plant will have a production capacity of 544 tons of molybdenum per year and represents an investment that is expected to start operations in first quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>Total consolidated debt at March 31 was $3.8 billion, with a cash balance of $2.6 billion. The company net debt stands at 1.1 billion. As you know, the company maintains a very comfortable long-term amortization schedule and then ample financial flexibility going forward.</p>
          <p>Now with respect to dividends, on February 20 we paid a dividend of $0.40 per share, equivalent to $245 million. For the first quarter 2012, the company's Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, which will be paid in cash on May 13 and represents proceeds of approximately $300 million.</p>
          <p>I will now pass on the call to Rogelio who will discuss the main financial highlights of the transportation division. Rogelio?</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Daniel and good afternoon to everyone. I will talk about the main developments during the first quarter of 2012 for our Transportation division represented by the holding company interest to transported vehicle ITM and its principle subsidiaries Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, Ferrocarril Mexicano, which is Ferromex and Ferrosur.</p>
          <p>We are pleased to report that the transportation division reported a strong operating performance for the first quarter of 2012 with all time record in operating income and EBITDA.</p>
          <p>ITMs load volumes being transported during the first quarter of 2012 measured in net trans kilometers were 13.2 billion compared to the 12.5 billion transported a year ago, an increase of 5.6%.</p>
          <p>At 287,000 cars transported increased by 5.2% with strongest increases in maintenance intermodal segment at 20% due to a 39% increase in the cross border business and industrial at 15%, mainly due to strong year in railcars exports.</p>
          <p>The agricultural segment, the most important for both Ferromex and Ferrosur, showed a 9% increase due mainly to imports through the border with the United States and the two key ports of Manzanillo and Veracruz. For 2012 we expect to move nearly 1.3 million railcars and 54.2 billion net kilometers representing growth of 3.5% and 3.8% respectively compared with 2011.</p>
          <p>ITM net sales for the first quarter of 2012 were $420 million, an increase of 10% compared to the same period of 2011, due mainly to higher freight volumes and also a more favorable mix of rates and traffics.</p>
          <p>The sectors showing the best performance were agricultural, which rose 14% due to strong grain imports resulting from poor harvest in Mexico affected by weather, intermodal 13% driven by the growth at the port of Manzanillo and increases in the cross border business.  And energy did 11% due mainly to the new Pemex fuel oil traffics from Tula to Manzanillo for the CFEs thermoelectric plant and for exports.</p>
          <p>ITMs operating cost for the first quarter of 2012 was $253 million, basically in line with the $262 million in first quarter of 2011. Important operating efficiencies were achieved during this period, which is a result of the aggressive investment in power and track implemented over the past 18 months. Although fuel prices and labor costs have continued to increase significantly we have managed to keep operating cost in line with the same period a year ago, reflecting the positive effects of the investments in new sidings and track maintenance and 105 new locomotives, 82 in Ferromex and 23 in Ferrosur, that what we achieved gradually since December 2010.</p>
          <p>Key operating indicators have importantly improved comparing what is the first quarter of 2011 with the first quarter of 2012 such as each &#x2013; from an average of 24.7 kilometers to 27.30 an 11% increase kilometers an hour.</p>
          <p>Cost per train from 68 to 80, an 18% gain, fuel consumption from an average of 4.94 to 4.63 &#x2013; thousand of kilometers a 6% improvement, resulting in a significant recovery in operating income from $76 million in the first quarter a year ago to $111 million in the later quarter, increasing operating margin from 19.9% to 26.4%.</p>
          <p>ITMs EBITDA for the first quarter of 2012 was a record high of $142 million, 32% above the $108 million for first quarter of 2011 and 25% increase compared with a $113 million EBITDA for the last quarter of 2011. Margins reached 34% during the &#x2013; the EBITDA margins reached 34% during the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Capital Expenditures. The Transportation division invested $19 million during the latest quarter, concentrating investments in track infrastructure, the expansion and construction of new sidings and including safety and security to ensure an adequate level of customer service.</p>
          <p>For 2012, the Ferromex Board just approved an additional investment of $22 million for a Nogales-Guaymas Corridor in light of new traffic opportunities of coal, mineral oil and automobiles. Capital investments are now estimated at 253 million, focus mainly on track maintenance and improvement and expansion of railroads, to increased operating volumes, safety and steel.</p>
          <p>I will now return the call to Mr. Daniel Muniz.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Karla Pe&#xF1;a with Actinver. Karla, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Thanks for the call and congratulations on the results. I was just wondering if you could give us some update about the spin-off of the railroads, and also if you have a guidance on the railroads, but not only for the top line; you could also tell us if the EBITDA levels that we could be seeing by the end of the year would be around these levels at the state of oil or if we should see a little bit more an adjustment there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Karla, let me just start off with the question regarding the spin-off. I think on that front, we are still, as I commented last quarter, we're still working with both of the partners in order to try to reach the best solutions for the whole. And what we have been discussing at this point is trying to merge <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:14) does not make sense to make an IPO afterwards. So that is really what we have to follow on that front. I mean we have done a lot of work though, but there is nothing to report you at this moment. Let me just pass the call it to Rogelio Velez regarding I mean the outlook for 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are not printing our outlook for the balance of the year, although we have got a very good first quarter. Still, because we feel a little uncertain about the crops in Mexico. You know, the crops in the northwest is our most important traffic and they are being affected by the clouds in that zone. However, we usually are compensated when the crops are low by stronger imports from the U.S. both from through the borders or through the ports. So it really depends on that. So our guidance still is at &#x2013; yeah, our EBITDA will be around $517 million for the year. Now we should have a better &#x2013; usually the second quarter of the year is the one that has best results because of the grain. So we should be having a better number than the latest quarters during the second quarter.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of <mark type="ph" /> Armando Vorteca with Encursa (21:08).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my call, and congratulations on your results. That was a pretty amazing quarter. I just have a few questions. Basically, the first one would be on the environment or what are you seeing on metal price? Do you expect a further recovery for the rest of the year, or would you be doing a little bit of more hedging on your operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. As I pointed out during the beginning of the call, I mean, we are seeing a more positive approach from investors and they supported better than expected economic data, very low inventory. We keep on seeing lower ore grades throughout mining inspection. We obviously are seeing that most of the projects, approximately 40% of new projects are located in new countries with high risk jurisdictions, you could say, and we are keep on seeing delays from a lot of the companies on the pipeline of new production coming into line.</p>
          <p>That has given us tightness in the market. Most of the <mark type="ph" /> CLU and good comps in the (22:27) world still estimate a deficit for a third year in a row, and we believe that the market will be tight. And that &#x2013; and there are &#x2013; I mean, their demand is hardly going to be matched by the production that we are seeing from the peer company.</p>
          <p>So as I mentioned, we are pushing the gap on our expansion project mainly in the Buenavista mines, which is now have been &#x2013; now more than a year of full production and we will work to reach our 1.4 million tons per a year of copper production. So we are positive there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay, okay. Thanks so much. And that does brings me to another question. If it would be possible just to get a little bit more insight on what is the main reason of the increase in your ore grades during the quarter?</p>
          <p>And basically I think the question would be, would it be fair to say that as of today you are still producing this kind of volumes, the same kind of volumes that you reported on the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you. We have mine plants for a very long term and last year we went through a lower ore grade part of the mine and we have to do stripping, and more stripping than we did this year. But we mentioned in Southern Copper and I can tell you about Asarco mines is that the current ore grades are what we should be able to sustain. Having said that, as you know, in mining you have go through other parts of the mine to get a very healthy mine plan going forward. I think that has been the reason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And thank you so much. And just one other thing for 2012, have you made any changes on your copper production guidance or something like that because I mean last year, the guidance was around 830,000 tons cover and I would just like to know if you are seeing any chances of improving it or well, I don't know maybe you just staying with the same guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, of course we see a lot of chances on improving that. Thank you for the question. I mean, I have pointed out we are working to improve dramatically our production to reach 1,500,000 tons of copper per year.</p>
          <p>Of course, we are working on it. We &#x2013; most of the expansions come out of our Buenevista mine, which as we pointed out is going to grow from 180,000 tons per year to grow 198,000 tons per year, but that production is not coming through the market this year.</p>
          <p>And we have a very aggressive project pipeline and the gap production are coming out this year. That is why we are maintaining the copper production guidance to 840,000 tons as we pointed out at the beginning of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So &#x2013; okay, that is great.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon, Daniel, Jorge, Rogelio. Well, I have two questions on ASARCO, one on infrastructure. The first one is ASARCO rate seems to be recovering from past quarters, but in the order of sands silver production fell this quarter importantly in ASARCO. Should we expect silver production recovering as well? That is my first question for ASARCO. And the second is what sort of cash curve does the Gulf Mission molybdenum plant have taken in and also it will be good to know if molybdenum plant emission can be further &#x2013; can be expanded beyond its current capacity that is for certain? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you, Rodrigo. Well first of all, just to put it in perspective, the production of ASARCO only fell 2.4% year-over-year. The copper production of increased 8.2% in ASARCO. So basically, as you know we prepare above our mining copper for the by-product.</p>
          <p>We are opening the molybdenum plant at ASARCO as I mentioned, so we are very positive and confident in ASARCO. And we also saw in ASARCO when you compared it year-over-year with that, we went through maintenance and replacement of it. So that is what we are seeing. Rogelio, do you want to comment something?  Rodrigo, does that answer your question?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding the Infrastructure division, we noticed a slight increase in the CapEx for the provision of a new OSM platform. They have been just around $50 million. Can you talk a little bit more about the platforms and also this small increase in CapEx for this business can change your expected return on the project in <mark type="ph" /> Tempsa? (28:23).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well sure, let me just clarify, I think well first of all, it refers to the additional CapEx was mainly allocated to the acquisition of two new jack-ups the exploration platform that has already entered into contract. On cooperation in June and that has already arrived from Abu Dhabi actually, and the other platform has been built will be ready in June when we arrive here and enter into operations in October this year. We already have the contract with them.</p>
          <p>The small investment CapEx that you probably are talking about might have to do with the transportation of the platform and that obviously responded to their tenant once you have entered into operations. So that is the minor CapEx we are referring to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other part of the Infrastructure division has to do with two power plants being built close to our carry that metallurgic facility, which we now have two plants 250 megawatts each which is 500 megawatt complex in tonelada, which will &#x2013; the build is been actually build by &#x2013; and its budget is around $540 million.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for the call. And I have two questions. And the first question is about the Asarco. I want to know how the process of increasing with the life of the Asarco's mine is going. And can you give us an idea how many years of life Asarco will have and what is the potential production in the long run?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the Infrastructure division. We saw very positive results in the first quarter comparing to almost in the no contribution in past months. And what is the trend for the coming quarters and what can we expect as recurring for that division? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you. So far as I understand it, Asarco will be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:50) I will tell that we are very happy with the way Asarco is evolving. And well first of all, you know we have incorporated Asarco and taken control in December 2009. So we already operated Asarco in 2010 and 2011 and you know this couple of years, we have increased our efforts in exploration in the mines and exploration outside of the mines. Of course Asarco was in Chapter 11 for some years. In fact, there were not a lot of CapEx or investments made at that facility. So we are doing that. In the last year <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:29) metallurgical facility went through major maintenance and that is why production wasn't as you guys would have expected.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:42) and that was common at the Mission mine, which is Asarco's mine in Arizona and that we're building two new mills, and that will increase the production. I mean, we have expansion projects there. I mean, we think that we were likely to increase the production of Asarco all the way to 280,000 tons of copper and as I said, ramp up again the molybdenum facility. So the outlook for Asarco we think is very positive. We are happy with the last two years that we have operated the mines in the new corporation and I think the add is great. I mean two of the mines that offer good production as well. We have a very good relationship with the union, and nowadays we are happy with it. And I think it is growing.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel, Rogelio, and Jorge. Thanks for taking my question. My question will be if you can say, it will be helpful to know to what extent your flow concessions have been reduced because <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:33:17) in the area of transportation. And also considering that pinnacle issues are certainly aggressive, to develop the Tia Maria project has improved currently? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry I did not understand the second question after Tia Maria. Let me answer that first, and the second you broke up a little bit regarding the transportation question. Let me just start off with the Tia Maria project. And I mean, as you know, the federal government of Peru has been doing a lot of work in order to restart projects in there. We know that there are mining <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:42) project there and they are going through extensive process. And the government's been very cooperative to ensure that conditions are met to develop and grow projects in Peru.</p>
          <p>In Peru, mining is one of the areas of the economy that contributes more to the GDP. So what they have been requesting is that we conduct an environmental impact study to take into account what the new government guidance and also look at communities' observations. And as you probably remember, the government of Peru retained a body affiliated with the United Nations to do a study there. And they are taking into account those observations where we are conducting a new environmental study. And we are very positive that because of our conversations and current work with the government, we will be able to obtain the permits to start this project in June, the construction of the project. Our idea on this project is 120,000 tons of copper cathode per year and the budget for the project was a little bit south of $1 billion.</p>
          <p>Then, I mean, regarding the question of transportation, you broke up. Can you repeat the question on transportation; Rogelio wasn't able to hear that very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it was I wanted to know at what extent is your consumption going to be reduced in construction business in the area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Ramon; that is a very important question because I think it's been key to our results in the first quarter. Our consumption was reduced, it was improved to 4.63 liters per every 1,000 of tons kilometers to &#x2013; I told you 4.94 liters last year compared to 4.63 liters per 1,000 of tons kilometers; it was a 6% improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to know the amount of liters consumed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay in 2012, we consumed in the first quarter 32 million liters versus 35.8 million liters. It is a decrease of 10.6%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay one follow up...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is a result mainly of the operation of the new locomotives, as I told you was 103 new locomotives, and the increase of speed that allows you to consume less fuel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you for the call. My question is also on Asarco. If you compare the AMC results with Southern Copper's it appears like Asarco had a significant reduction in margin sequentially. So I was just wondering if there is any specific reason for that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you. What we saw at Asarco is an increase. Let me just give you the cash costs. It was $1.91 per pound of copper. That was the first adjustment in 2012 cash costs. And in the first quarter 2011, it was $1.83 per pound of copper. I mean that is a marginal increase in cash cost per pound of copper.</p>
          <p>And I mean what we are seeing as most of the mining industry is, is some cost pressures. In Asarco, you got a small increase in labor requirements. We are having a small increase as well in maintenance materials, and there is some inventory variation there that impacts costs as well. That's mainly the main issues impacting the costs in this quarter compared to the last.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you give us any idea of the margin variation you are seeing, because from the costs you gave us, it seems like the margin just contracted very slightly on a sequential basis. So I was just wondering if that is correct, or if there was a larger decrease.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, the copper price was different. I mean, copper price for the first quarter of 2011 was $4.39 per pound. This quarter, it was $3.78 per pound. So, mainly that has to do with the increase of costs that I commented on, and the decrease of copper price.</p>

          <p>Hi there. I have only three questions if I may. This first one is on EMC. Last time &#x2013; the last call, you said that you were looking at some different ways to give to value the Mining division. One of them was a possibility to quote part of EMC on foreign markets. I just want to know if you are still studying the possibility.</p>
          <p>Second question is on the Delaware court's decision. You already made a statement on our feeling on that decision. But just want to know if you have a timing, an idea of when that decision will be taken. And the last question is on GAAP. You are adding &#x2013; as we all know a couple of weeks ago you decided to draw up the offer, the option offer. I just want to know if you still have the 28% and what is your strategy at the moment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the results. My question relates to the railroad division and I just wanted to understand the guidance a bit better. I understand you're expecting a better second quarter, but what you are expecting for the second half of this year, as it seems like the guidance of 517 implies some decline in the EBITDA &#x2013; absolute EBITDA towards the second half, if you can give some more color on that? That is it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our guidance for the year, Mandeep is an increase of 3% in volume, okay. And we are not changing still that guidance after the first quarter because of the &#x2013; of what I said in the previous question of the uncertainty in the crop from the southwest. Generally, our second quarter is the strongest quarter, because of the crop, but since there were &#x2013; there has been droughts there. We estimate instead of around 5.5 billion tons, it will be around 3 million tons. So we are still maintaining our guidance of &#x2013; including volume of 3% year-on-year.</p>
