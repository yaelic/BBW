      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator and good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Craig DeYoung, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at ASML. Welcome to our investor call and webcast.</p>
          <p>As the operator mentioned, the subject of today's call is ASML's 2009 third quarter results. Co-hosting today's call from our headquarters here in Veldhoven, The Netherlands, are Mr. Eric Meurice, ASML's CEO, and Mr. Peter Wennink, ASML's CFO.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and in our fourth quarter results presentation, both of which you can find at our website at www.asml.com. This Safe Harbor statement will apply to this call and all associated presentation materials. The length of the call will be 60 minutes.</p>
          <p>And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Eric Meurice for a brief introduction.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Craig. Good afternoon and good morning. Thank you for attending our Q3 2009 results conference call. As usual, Peter and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the quarter. Peter will start with a review of our Q3 financial performance with added comments on the short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some further details on our current position as we head towards 2010. Following the introduction, we will open up the call for questions as usual. So, Peter, if you will?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric, and welcome everyone. As usual, I would first like to take a moment to review some of the events of the last quarter as well as some details on our third quarter results.</p>
          <p>Our third quarter sales were &#x20AC;555 million, and they doubled from Q2. This was in line, by the way, with our adjusted guidance of September 10 of sales about 500 million.</p>
          <p>We shipped a total of 24 systems, seven of which were new. Our new system ASP of 23.4 million reflected the substantial blend of immersion and non-immersion tools, 11 and six respectively. The ASP of new and used systems combined was &#x20AC;19.1 million, which was helped by the high ASP of used systems which included two used immersion tools. Our service and field option revenue remained stable at &#x20AC;96 million.</p>
          <p>The Company's third quarter gross margin was 34.4% versus 12.5% in the second quarter, and this reflects an improved coverage of our fixed manufacturing costs due to the increase in business volume from the lower second quarter level.</p>
          <p>We maintained our focus on R&amp;D with a spend of &#x20AC;115 million in the third quarter, which is slightly lower than Q2. And SG&amp;A came in at 38 million, which is slightly below our guidance. As a result of the aforementioned, operating income improved from a negative 45% in Q2 to a positive 7% in Q3.</p>
          <p>In Q3, cash used in operations was &#x20AC;65 million. This was largely due to the increased accounts receivable resulting from the higher sales in the quarter. With that, we were still able to maintain our gross cash balance above our target of 1 billion. We suggested in last quarter's call that our cash balance might dip slightly below our target due to a working capital requirement for additional product starts. Although cash flows were impacted by this requirement, stringent cost controls, along with products sold from inventory and fast collection of accounts receivable basically allowed us to maintain gross cash above our targets.</p>
          <p>As for our outlook, Q3 net bookings were strong at 35 systems valued at &#x20AC;777 million, which is nearly twice the level booked in the second quarter. Net immersion bookings were 18 systems, 17 new and one used. And they demonstrated a continued focus on technology investments, especially in the DRAM and the foundry market segment. In addition, we saw eight new KrF bookings, indicating a certain need for more mature manufacturing technologies in support of the leading edge ramp up.</p>
          <p>Third quarter bookings pushed our backlog between 1.3 and 1.4 billion, which is the highest level in seven quarters. The backlog now contains a total of 54 systems, and worth highlighting is the fact that there are 37 immersion systems in our backlog, of which two are used. And 13 of this total &#x2013; 13 are for our newest immersion product, the NXT 1950.</p>
          <p>We expect the fourth quarter 2009 sales to be around &#x20AC;550 million, with a gross margin of about 37%. Expenses are expected to remain at 115 million for R&amp;D, and 37 million for SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>As previously indicated, we managed the company towards a breakeven level, at a sales level of around &#x20AC;450 million, which we should be reaching by the end of this year. We're currently increasing factory production capacity in order to meet the demand, as indicated by our Q3 bookings. And furthermore, we expect orders in the fourth quarter to be at least at the third quarter level, supporting a strong sales level for the first half of next year.</p>
          <p>And, finally, we expect our cash balance in Q4 to be close to that at the end of Q3, even as we prepare to ramp the NXT shipments in the first half of 2010 and to build EUV systems planned for delivery in the second half of next year.</p>
          <p>But I'd now like to turn it back over to you, Eric, for more view on what will happen in the next coming quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. We are indeed currently recovering to quarterly sales level in Q3, 2009 and Q4 2009, which are indicative of extended technology buys. And, we're starting to see bookings which are not so much indicative of a full economic recovery in terms of volume, but indicative of what we call a corrective and accelerated set of technology buys.</p>
          <p>By corrective, we mean then first the segment, the foundry segment, is now building up the necessary structural capability &#x2013; capacity for 40 nanometer nodes, driven by end-customer new products. And two, the second tier DRAM players are now placing orders for 50 nanometer node products, mainly DDR3.</p>
          <p>By accelerated, we mean that the first tier DRAM are accelerating the transition from basically 50 nanometer to 40 nanometer products. This pick-up of order due to these two trends is likely to last at least through Q4 2009, as Peter suggested. And this will translate into strong Q1 and Q2 2010 revenues.</p>
          <p>Our demand simulation model shows however that this scanner demand pick-up, as just described, will not add wafer capacity above the fairly low to reasonable IC unit expected growth in 2010, thus creating no surplus of capacity.</p>
          <p>We believe that the similar high level of bookings &#x2013; similar high level of bookings leading to sustained revenue in the second half of 2010 could also occur, but if the world economy grows sufficiently. The current forecast from industry analysts suggest 2010 semiconductor unit gross level of approximately 8.5%. Our simulation indicates a unit growth of approximately 9.5% would be necessary to sustain the current strong H1 revenue level well into 2010. We will have to await for signs however of the economy before we are able to guide beyond the first six months of 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding technology, we are aggressively ramping in volume our new enhanced XG architecture, we call it internally the XG 4, which has better throughput, better overlay, and better CD capability as our original machine. We are qualifying and ramping also in parallel the first next generation advanced product called the NXT with six planned to ship this year, 2009, and preparing also our shipment of EUV preproduction tools for H2 2010.</p>
          <p>We confirm leadership with the new architecture, the NXT, which has demonstrated this quarter overlay below two nanometer, and thanks to a unique 1.35 NA lens, a new lens, capability for 30 nanometer single exposure critical dimension uniformity across a field of only 0.6 nanometer. Similarly, the progress of EUV has enabled us to start discussion on the purchase order for a six EUV preproduction tool.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, the market is currently driven by product introduction, not by volume, by product introduction, mainly DDR3, DRAMs, on 50 nanometer and on 40 nanometer technologies, and also driven by logic product on 40 nanometer technologies. And the industry is however still waiting to see how the economic recovery will fuel further growth, in particular by triggering the NAND segment which is currently very much under-represented in order placement activities by our customers. We believe that this growth through product and technology transition at this moment will favor ASML's best lithography products, extendable over multiple technologies.</p>
          <p>Even through this optimism that you probably guessed through this discussion, we will still remain appropriately cautious on our cost structure, continuing of course our sustained R&amp;D effort and investment, but not building significant additional structural cost at this time.</p>
          <p>So with this, Peter and I would like to take your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&amp;A session. But beforehand, I would like to ask kindly that you limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up if necessary. This will allow us to get to as many callers as possible.</p>
          <p>Operator, could we have your instructions and then the first question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions.]. The first question comes from Mr. Gareth Jenkins. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. This is Gareth Jenkins from UBS. Thanks for taking the question. Just have a quick question around OpEx into 2010. I just wondered what level. You gave some very detailed color last quarter in terms of OpEx expectations when revenues hit &#x20AC;100 million. As we progress past that point, I just wondered if you could give us a sense of what your OpEx targets for 2010 are? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we said last quarter that we would go back to about 800 million of sales. Total quarterly costs for the company would go back to around between 290 and 295 million per quarter, of which 115 will be approximately R&amp;D and about 40 million will be SG&amp;A, and the rest will be cost which you will find back in the cost of goods section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I have a follow-up on that just in regard to the &#x2013; as you move I guess through the pre-production and you start generating significant amounts cash over and above the one million, what the intention is to use that cash flow, will it be reinvested or will it be given back to shareholders? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably a bit of both. We will reinvest where we need to grow the business, that's number one. And we've always said that's been the policy of the company to return cash to shareholders, which is in &#x2013; when we exceed our target in the terms of share buybacks and dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Simon Sch&#xE4;fer, Goldman Sachs, please state your name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. It's Simon Sch&#xE4;fer with Goldman. I had a question about the order environment. I mean you clearly said foundry and DRAM really driving the momentum here as far as the initial order uptick is concerned recently, but clearly the NAND market is still being very small and almost dormant for now. But given how much higher NAND pricing is moving, is there an argument to be made that that can tied to supply in Q4? And if that's the case, would you expect orders to be picking up substantially in the fourth quarter already or what sort of timing or indications are you getting from your customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, this is a very good question. Yes, we indeed think that NAND is an upside for the future. As usual, it's very difficult for us to forecast or we simulate the future more than forecasting it. What we've done is confirmed that if the &#x2013; there is no significant recovery, just I would say the correction back to numbers of 2008 or so, the capacity installed in NAND is sufficient to cover up to about mid Q2 2010, in which case we would expect NAND orders to start coming in into Q1 2010 for Q2, Q3, Q4 type deliveries. So that is again a simulated number in case the economy were to be just tagging along according to the analyst expectations. Of course if &#x2013; and there are two or three signs in the market that that the NAND business can even do better than that. Therefore we would be getting some short-term order to therefore delivery a bit earlier than that. But at this moment, it's too early to say there is not enough activity in the market to confirm that trend is coming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see, but maybe the way to interpret that is you're basically saying if NAND was to come through a little bit earlier, your orders would be up directionally in Q4 rather than just flat which is what you're indicating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No &#x2013; yes, in fact yes. This is a good point. What we &#x2013; what I just guided that the amount of orders in Q4 is similar to the orders that we've received in Q3. This is based on NAND, not restarting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Yeah, thanks very much. My second question would be, I was interested in your remark about that you needed roughly &#x2013; the way I understood it I think is that you need roughly 9.5% unit growth on your simulation next year. For the industry it allows second half revenues to be similar to first half, but let's just assume that that trend line or that number is slightly better, given lead-times for your equipment, what is the sort of shipment capacity in unit terms that ASML can deliver in 2010 if unit growth in the industry is quite a bit better than the 9.5% that you are suggesting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We know the answer in units because the mix makes it more complicated and the euro output is more significant. For instance, I can give a simple example. We can build three KrF machines in the time we can build one immersion machine. So &#x2013; but if you say three KrF is equal about to the price of immersion, the capacity is basically better measure if you try to measure it in euros. So the answer to your question in euros is the capacity of the company at this moment without making further CapEx nor investing significantly in OpEx would be at this moment between 1 and &#x20AC;1.1 billion sales per quarter. It is a short-term capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, Mr. Jonathan Crossfield. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's B of A/Merrill Lynch. I guess my first question is how do you assess the number of potential new fab projects that are out there if your customers do decide to move towards capacity purchases in the next 12 to 18 months? How much empty capacity is there there that you could sort of sell into do you think if the demand environment warrants it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have all these data. By memory, I'm going to say your question is irrelevant in the sense that there is enough open space in current existing buildings, which would warrant significant sales above the 1.1 billion per quarter. I mentioned all the major accounts at this moment; foundry, DRAM and Flash do have I'd call it free space for additional what they call a lines which in another way of saying a sub-fab into a building. In order to get new buildings, as you know it takes about a year and we already know of a certain numbers of projects, which have been planned for 2011 built up of internal capacity. But as I repeat, the buildings are not a limiter for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just as a follow-up, what is the sort of news coming from sort of logic and microprocessor IDMs where your competitor has produced strong share at the moment. As they move beyond 32-nanometer, when would you expect them to make decisions about their litho suppliers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, indeed we have lost a bit of market share in the microprocessor arena two years ago and this is now due time for decision for the next nodes. This decision time is within Q4 or Q1 of next year. So potential good news would trigger sales in the Q3/Q4 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much, Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, Mr. Sandeep Deshpande. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Sandeep Deshpande at JP Morgan. Peter, I have actually first question for you on the margin. I mean, can you comment on how you see going forward with your revenue levels that seem to be shaping up in the first half of next year does flow through to the bottom line from the 450 million breakeven point that you've talked about in the past will be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think when we think about the first half of next year and you look at the order intake levels in Q3 and what we expect for Q4 and also referring to let's say our cost model that we used in the past where we say we can support ramp up to 800 million. Well at that 800 million level, which is not that realistic level if you look at the current order intake levels. That that would mean that we would be looking at gross margins that at that 800 million level would be in excess of gross margins we had shown on those same levels in previous cycles. So the gross margin would be up cycle to cycle on those sales levels. Now how much will it be up? That's not something I'm willing at this moment to give more detail on. But for the OpEx cost structure, like I said 150 million per quarter and around 40 million of SG&amp;A max, that is what you should think of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And Eric, one last question on NAND. I mean can you comment on what your customers are &#x2013; I mean are your customers already talking to you on these potential orders on NAND or is it that you expect to do these negotiations some point next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think this is a normal pre-planning sessions where we are having already discussion about the timings of the Q2, Q3 deliveries, but there is no acceleration at this moment of these discussions which lead me to believe that we will receive orders in the beginning of Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I mean does this mean that you are going back to what you used to do in 2008, which was that you built tools even before or you started at least the process of building the lens before you got the order and you might have got the order only two months before the actual shipment of the tool?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Although I must say we are trying to prevent that clearly, but it is also clear that we have some of those customers like we also said at that time we have very lengthy and deep discussions and it's not always very &#x2013; it's not always possible to exactly time the day on which we'll get the signed order, so that is a long process. So that's why it might look like the sales order lead-time is sometimes significantly smaller than the six months that we are always quoting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>Next question, Mr. Tim Acuri. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Citigroup. Two things. First of all, I think you guys are sort of implying quarterly revenue levels in the sort of &#x20AC;800 million plus for the &#x2013; kind of on average for the first half of next year. If that's the case, my first question is does that require or rather it would seem that that requires a bookings number somewhere in the &#x20AC;950 million range, maybe as high as &#x20AC;1 billion to kind of support that sort of &#x20AC;800 million plus revenue run rate during the first half of 2010, first of all, is that correct?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well Tim, you basically have to also circle back a bit to the question of Sandeep that this six months &#x2013; although we have six months order lead-time, it doesn't always mean that we get those orders. For instance, people have also done the calculation of &#x2013; we have 70% of our order backlog right now is for shipments for the next six quarters, sorry for next six months, for next two quarters. If you take our guidance for Q4 off then you say, well, then you have about 500 million in your backlog for shipment in Q1, which means that anything that we will receive as orders today will be within order lead-time, which is the case. We are getting orders within order lead-time in Q4 for shipment in Q1. So, just like we will receive orders in Q4 which are for shipment in Q3. So, it is not that easy to say if you want a certain sales level in a particular quarter, you need to book a certain level this quarter. It is pretty fluent, because some customers have &#x2013; they act into our sales order lead-times, and others don't, we have a bit more discussion, I think. But, just to substantiate what you just inferred with the current bookings levels, and at least order intake that we see for Q4, those numbers of around 800 million that we have said, we will be able to wrap up with the current structure in the short-term do not seem unrealistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And remember that when we declare bookings like 777 million, we do not show service and parts. So, you will have to add to make it an equivalent number to a billings number, you will have to add 60 to 100 million. So, the run rate basically 777 really means 850 to 870 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, okay. So, I guess, typically you book &#x2013; because of the lead-times -typically you book more than what you would ship kind of in any given quarter, especially when you are ramping. So, that was sort of the genesis of the question. And I guess my second question is, if indeed you are going to book, let's say 800 &#x2013; 900 million euros, something higher than what you just booked, if you sort of back into what the overall industry CapEx has to be to support that, it's something like 40 to $45 billion next year, which is another $20 billion year-over-year versus what got spent this year. And so my question is, who is going to spend that money? What &#x2013; Intel is down, Samsung will be up a couple billion. But where is the extra $20 billion going to actually come from to keep your bookings at that particular level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we cannot comment on the rest of the CapEx of the industry. In particular, when you are talking about technologies, to be honest, we do not know if, when you go to from 40 nanometer to 30 nanometer, if you have to change your actuals or not. And these things are complicated. So, we barely understand our own business. So, that's point number one.</p>
          <p>Point number two, we are absolutely convinced that in our business, the fact that they &#x2013; the customers have not built up capacity for these new nodes, put them into a situation of correction because of the new products. So, when you are in the DDR3 business, no matter what, you better have the capacity for it, and the capacities are new, it is over a few machines, so you have to find the money. Now, the good news is they find the money because, as you know, most of these segments are becoming profitable again, and even for some of the customers who are not profitable, they are getting near profitability.</p>
          <p>And, because of some segments like DRAM, those customers have reached a level of near consolidation, if you know what I mean, or improved consolidation. All of them have ambition for market share on those DDR3 products and things. And therefore, again, they are forced in building ahead the appropriate market share corresponding to their ambition on those new products. So, if we calculate all this, yes, we definitely will justify easily the numbers we just talked about of, as you said, 800 million plus per quarter for Q1 and Q2 2010.</p>
          <p>We even calculate that, in terms of wafers out, it's not a big deal because these new technologies are big users of lithography. So, in other terms, we don't create a lot of additional wafers with those machines. We are just enabling new products. So, if you add to that, that the business either &#x2013; nobody gets out of recession. The business is not very, very good in volume. We still will need this 800 million for those new products. And, if the volume comes back because we get out of recession, then we have another 1 or 2 billion coming out there just due to volume. So, first, I think the industry has to do it because of the reasons I invoked. And secondly, I believe there is enough profitability now in the business to justify this.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question, Mr. Mehdi Hosseini. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Mehdi Hosseini, FBR Capital Markets. Actually, as a follow up to Tim's question. Eric, I want to understand how your industry views are. Go back to 2007, we had about 22 to 23 billion U.S. dollar of DRAM related CapEx, 7 and 8 billion of NAND related CapEx. We are far from it, I expect 50, 60% growth next year. We are still going &#x2013; it's going to take some time to hit those levels, so when we talk about DRAM customers spending, can you help me understand when do you see, in the future, the industry going back to the 22 or above 20 billion level, and also the same thing with NAND? When are we going to hit those 7 to $8 billion CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your question is very very difficult, because you have an industrial answer to this and you have a financial answer to this. The industrial answer is based on product needs. So, I don't have the number in front of me for 2007. But 2008, the industry user built 154 billion ICs. So in 2009, the industry will build 135 billion. And if you take the current expectation from the analyst, the industry will go back to 2010 at 145 billion. So I repeat, 155 two years ago, 133 now -- sorry 135 now, and 145 2010. So again, without thinking, if you put those numbers into the new products, you create this need for this famous 800 million or plus euro of lithography for Q1, Q2. That's it. If you add 1% to this, you add another need for 800, 800 and plus for the next quarters of the year. So, this is like the industrial response. Whatever happens, if you have those product transition and those units, that's what you have to do, that's math.</p>
          <p>Now your other &#x2013; your question which is more complicated, is well can they afford the CapEx that is behind this, or can they &#x2013; are they getting profitable enough to justify this? And there are two answers to this. First is, do they have the product to attract the consumer? And here you can start feeling a bit of optimism on 2010. You have people talking about DDR3, which is a green product, uses less power et cetera, so it's a good product. You're talking about Windows 7, which is going to make PCs looking like having to have an average of three gig per PC. And everybody's starting to line up for that. You've got the new &#x2013; this Windows 7 has better drivers for hard disk drive which are &#x2013; or solid state drive, which is going to create an application for NAND et cetera. So, these things mean the consumer is ready to pay for these nice features. So, that's kind of the good part and the good news. So, yes, there's money to be made into those products.</p>
          <p>So, your real question is, yes, but if we go back into the game of chicken by which the customers are dumping the final product to keep the market share high &#x2013; so in other terms, if they over-invest in capacity, and they fight another game of attrition, then your point is very correct. There may not be enough capital to pay what is necessary.</p>
          <p>My personal opinion, which is only me, is I would guess that the consolidation in NAND &#x2013; in a sense at this moment you have a bit less aggressiveness by one or two players. And the consolidation, which is obvious in DRAM, by which the weak players have aligned to the big player, will probably give us year 2010 before your problem can recur, and then become again an aggressive game of chicken. So, I will be surprised if the access to capital will be a problem in 2010 or so, but Peter has something to add.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you look at the year 2007, we saw in the year 2007, a very significant wafer capacity buildup in the DRAM space, which was around 20%. And when we look at the DRAM demand today for next year, what our customers have ordered or are ordering or tell us that they need for the remainder of the year, we will actually be flat next year in terms of wafer capacity. So, where we get more units out is through, in effect, that's basically litho and that's why we don't see the risk momentarily with the business that our customers are telling us for next year, part of which we're booking today, that we will create overcapacity and go back to that situation. Like Eric said, we would need very significant end user demand growth before we are back in that situation. But, that's not something for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>Regarding the EUV build-out, when do you actually going to start building the required inventory for, and correct me if I am wrong, for possible shipment in late 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in mid 2010 to late 2010, we are going to ship &#x2013; or at this moment, we plan to ship five of those. And then, as I said, we're very happy that a six customer is interested, but we will be shipping this six's product in the mid 2011. So, for these six products, the build-up of inventory has already started, and it is in the numbers that you've seen already. There is another about 50 million or so that needs to be coming to be able to execute those six units.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Didier Scemama, RBS. Please state your company name followed by your question. Go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. It's Didier Scemama from RBS. Thanks for taking my question gentlemen. Just like to ask your opinion on the impact of this new player in the foundry space in terms of CapEx and manufacturing process. How do you see that playing for you as a lithography equipment vendor? That's my first question and I have a follow-up, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Yes, the entrance of a new player, partnering with AMD as you know, has a strategic impact, which is not yet visible into the bookings. Clearly, at this moment, they are building their business model. They are gathering interest in the market, discussing with certain numbers of players. I think all this is public. They have made a move, as you have heard, on Chartered, so they have strengthened I would say one of the players &#x2013; the existing players of the foundry business.</p>
          <p>So all this is highly strategic, but they are not yet part of the current what I'd call foundry build-up. If you wanted to push my little my nose and my optimism at this moment because, as you can see from our body language, in fact as you can hear from our body language, we don't feel bad about 2010. Indeed, the second tier, or the second players in foundries, have not yet been present and they do represent a significant upside to the current wave of foundry orders that we have received. So in other terms, at this moment the build-up of 40 nanometer capacity is limited in foundry to very small amount of number of players and those comers &#x2013; newcomers will have to do the significant investment also. And that at this moment, again, is not in the short-term plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And I'd like to have a follow-up on that. It looks like, there have been discussion earlier in the call about your lower market share in microprocessors, Do you think that perhaps this market share issue could be addressed via foundries, i.e. perhaps more outsourcing of PC processors to foundries, obviously via IMD it's an obvious one, but then be another one? And related to that, how can that perhaps drive demand, not just for the secondhand immersion tools, but also for maybe 1900?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we lost a bit of market share in the microprocessor about two years ago and I think we explained exactly what the problem was, which at the end of the day, was driven by the fact that our technology at the time was not required, basically. At this moment, we think that the microprocessor world, wherever it is, makes much more usage of the latest technologies. You have heard in my little opening speech that we show a lot of pride about a machine called the NXT, which has less than two nanometer overlay and 0.6 nanometer CD uniformity on field. These numbers are not made to impress financial analysts, that's the role of Peter. It is made to impress certain numbers of customers in different segments, including microprocessors, who have enough difficulties at this moment to understand how to shrink all this and this type of performance is starting to be very attractive.</p>
          <p>So we believe very much that our chances are much higher to build up market share the normal way, which is by technology leadership. The other ways around, which is to participate to these activities outside of the Intel architecture with all these discussions that you have from the foundry players getting some architectures which can be used into consumer arena, but which are based on microprocessor cores and etcetera. All these obviously play in our strengths, because these segments which are, I would say, parallel to PC are clearly very cost aggressive and we are proud bringing machines again which allow throughput and performance at the same time. So yes, you are correct also, we are not unhappy to have a part of the logic segment which gets highly exciting volume and technology.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Deutsche Bank. The first question was on the Tier 2 DRAM and Tier 2 foundries and I wasn't quite sure what you said whether the Q3 bookings and the expected Q3 bookings already included orders from those vendors or whether it didn't, if you could clarify that please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The wave that we are currently precisely guiding, which is the bookings number in Q3 and the &#x2013; at least the same number of bookings for Q4, only include first tier foundry 40-nano, first tier DRAM 40-nano, second tier DRAM 50-nano, that's it.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In other terms, second tier foundry, second tier DRAM 40-nano, any activities in NAND are not included. But I repeat, when I say any, please, any means between zero and 10 <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's very clear. Thank you very much. My other question was on the IFRS US GAAP issue, which I think we touched on on previous conference calls. I mean the sort of EBIT difference still seems to be about 40, 50 million per quarter. I mean do you have any specific plans to actually adopt IFRS in the short term, and hence switch your reporting or is that not the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's our prime reporting standard. We do not anticipate that for the simple reason that all our peers are US GAAP based, and like you said there's quite a significant difference in the calculation of the expenses and the cost, which is basically timing. But that makes the comparison between us and our peers quite difficult, which I think is not a good thing. So we will adopt IFRS when the convergence project, which is currently high on the agenda of the SEC and the accounting bodies here in Europe will come to an end, which I think is planned for 2014. But in the meantime, we will keep reporting under US GAAP and we will give you the IFRS statements. But it's more because we want to be &#x2013; we want to stay comparable with our peers.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Andrew Gardiner from Barclays Capital. I just had a sort of a follow-up around the prior question regarding the bookings for fourth quarter and the type of customers you're seeing in it. Just thinking back to how we've seen DRAM play out through this year, you've already highlighted that clearly the industry health improved, that has helped to drive orders back, but also there has been a competitive side of the ordering with the Tier 1 guys and they are accelerating the move to the 4X node and really putting additional pressure on the Tier 2 guys. Thinking then towards NAND and what you said in terms of it's really being driven by demand and the economy and all of that, I was wondering whether there isn't an element that you are also seeing in terms of the competitiveness of the players there and whether there are signs that one of them may accelerate their buying to try and competitively move ahead and whether that's something we might expect in the fourth quarter as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a lot of activities in the NAND environment to differentiate themself with designs. And I do not see but that may be my mistake at this moment the design differentiation to be leading to more capital expenditure or at least lithography in the short-term. So I think to your question do I see the driver to be designs in NAND, no. Do I see volume? Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But then you have to be waiting a bit for the economy to be positive or rosy before they move, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's clear. And then just one quick follow-up on the performance numbers that you've put in the &#x2013; the slide deck about the NXT tool. Clearly those are all moving in the right direction although based on some of the specs that were bandied about the customer &#x2013; the customer demands were not quite there yet. How confident are you that you can continue to push towards those targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the &#x2013; as usual when you introduce a product it takes a period of time for, I call it a full qualification, in fact there are two qualifications, one is an internal qualification of the machine itself and one there is a, as you can call an applications qualification, which is a customer adequation to the process to our machine. I will say the final qualification of the NXT machine is due at the end of the year internally. Why we would have shipped six of them anyway, so that during our own qualification the customer can make their own qualification, which is probably going to take another three months for them which would then lead them to production ramps on qualified processes in Q2 timeframe. So, that's about the plan. So far we're doing good because conceptually we are better than the spec, the spec of these machines is for instance two &#x2013; three nanometer and we are doing two nanometer. We haven't reached exactly yet the full speed, but it's in process. So all this is in action.</p>
          <p>The good lose is that our XT4 machine is acceptable to the current world anyway. The NXT machine which has more extendibility. So some customers are basically telling us that they hesitate between the two, mainly for extendibility reasons, not yet fully because they have no choice because to make usage of two nanometer you would really have to do some design work which will be necessary for 2011 rather than 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, <mark type="inaudible" />. I actually wanted to ask about the NXT 1950 as well, very good performance data in the presentation and I'm just wondering if you have any indication yet on how your competitors' tools performing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you say &#x2013; as you know the our competitor and as you know there is only one in the immersion world is a powerful competitor with a high quality product. So they have announced a machine which on paper is not very far from ours. This is the typical activities we've had for the history of ASML or at least the past five years have been in there where we are fighting on the same target specification, with hopefully ASML was showing the same leadership in terms of timing and in terms of really achieving the paper target.</p>
          <p>So at this moment, we have seen that this competitor has shipped probably about two machines and are in their own ways starting their own qualification. I do not have I would say much more data that I can share with you at this moment. But I guess for us it's a usual competition, usual fight. We feel comfortable because we have a concept-based machine called TWINSCAN with a very large lens on 1.35 NA and our competitor at this moment do not have a TWINSCAN concept and do not have a 1.35 NA lens. So based on these basic architectural traits, we think that the gap that we have today is going to be projected in the next architecture for both of us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. And along the lines of NXT again, just wondering if you expect to see a substantial shift in demand from the 1900 platform to the NXT 1950 over the next two or three quarters, or do you think, you'll see &#x2013; continue to see demand for the 1900 alongside the NXT?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, if I could answer your questions, I'd be richer &#x2013; it's complicated questions. At this moment we believe it's going to be kind of a 50:50 on the long term, because an NXT is more expensive at because it has more performance and some customers will not need the full performance of it. But on the other hand an NXT is a low-risk machine for the next five to 10 years. So customers will say even if I don't need the spec I could benefit of it, it is extendable. In fact we have already discussions with two large customers, we said we prefer to delay a bit shipments because we really like the NXT, even if we do not use it fully. So, it's a $1 million question. It makes our supply chain a bit of a difficulty at this moment, because we are not 100% sure, where we are going to end up. But at the end of the day, the two machines are very, very competitive. They are above competition. It's quite a different segment or different philosophy decisions and we are offering the choice to the customer which I think will strengthen our competitive advantage.</p>

          <p>Okay. And just I'm just wondering how the ramp of the NXT might impact gross margin over the next couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is true that new machines are always costing us more than more stable machines because you have a lot of more repairs and the customer various activities which are part of the margin. We also have not reached the target cost level with our suppliers. So, your question is very relevant and NXT in terms of margin is not as good as NXT4. But, because we have a magician as a CFO we all believe that we should improve our gross margin from the last cycle to this cycle. So, in other terms we see that above the 800 million per quarter sales we should be able to be above our usual 40% gross margin target.</p>

          <p>Next question is from Mr. Gus Richard. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, Piper Jaffray. Could you talk a little about the foundries transition to 32-nanometers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 40-nanometer is the one that goes into high volume and the 40-nanometer had a history where it went sampling for proof two to three years before we get to this point now where people are struggling to get machines from us. So the 30-nanometer ramp in foundry at this moment is in a mode of sampling and with again for me a bit difficult visibility to know exactly when the thing will be acquiring, I will say, capacity. So it's really an R&amp;D project, not so much yet a production project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you wouldn't expect the ramp until 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I must say I'm missing the data at this moment, so I am not going to try to induce you in any errors. So I ensure that Franki or Craig will be able to give you more inputs. I really don't want to say much at this moment. I don't have it with me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then just as a follow-up. You've seen some of the older KrF and 193 dry systems are getting some demand, could you talk a little bit about the end markets that are requiring those tools?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's really the &#x2013; as you know to make a chip, even a 40-nano chip or a 30-nano with NAND, you have a certain layers, which are called critical, which uses new machines like immersion and you have a lot of other layers, which are non-critical, which use KrF. So to give you an example, a 40-nanometer DRAM would have what, 45 layers and nine max, ten sometimes would be critical and the rest would be either KrF or i-line, so in reality you've got a lot of KrF and i-line layers. Normally the customers would buy only the machines for the 10 critical layers and then would use old KrF to do the rest of the layers except when they still have sustained demand on the old products and they therefore need new capacity for those non-critical layers. So for instance, a customer like a foundry who still has 60-nanometer things in production and a volume of 60-nanometer doesn't go down, they still have to use their KrF to do that and then for 50-nano or 40-nanometer, they will have to renew KrF. That's what we have today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the KrF, the metal is largely in the logic and in the foundry area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As exactly what Eric says because there the build-out of leading edge capacity needs to be accompanied by the build-out of KrF capacity.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Operator, I think we have time for one last question. For those of you that are on the line and were unable to get through the IR department here in the Netherlands is available to take some calls from you. We'd invite you to do that and give us a call. And operator so if we can have the last question please, we'd appreciate it.</p>

          <p>Mr. Ben Pang. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Caris &amp; Company. Two quick questions. One, what is the per fab opportunity for litho on a 3X NAND versus a 4X NAND?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I prefer to push it to Craig and Franki, because the customers at this moment use different technologies. You will have heard the space, non-space, double patterning, et cetera and I don't want to again give you any failures and it's a bit technical, so we'll have to come back to you on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well and that comes to my follow-up is that, I think on a earlier question you commented that you're not tracking what action a lot of these other technologies are doing. I mean aren't you guys concerned that that'll take some of the capital requirement that litho usually takes for 3X NAND?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a different way. We are tracking what technology is used by the customers. Some customers using spacer for instance would require a certain set of tools, some are etch, some i-line, some immersion. And if you use &#x2013; not spacer, but a four time spacers then you use another type and if you use double patterning then you use another type and if you use double illumination then you use another type, so that of course we follow and every customer has its own ways. What we don't understand is that on the part, which is not litho driven, which type of etch tools they use, do they use installed based etch or do they have to buy a new versions of this and therefore does that may put pressure or not on CapEx versus on installed base. That to be honest we cannot really easily follow. This is &#x2013; well, first of all, customer secrets and secondly I don't think it's very relevant because as I say if they need litho they're going to find the money for it, if they don't need litho, they are not going to find the money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and one quick follow-up. In your NAND discussion, if the market progresses kind of to be a higher level of demand, do you expect the 3X will be larger opportunity than 4X for you in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if I remember correctly and again this will have to be proven, there is more critical layers on 3x than there is on 4x. So if I were to say this, it will favor us, this means it's good news.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much.</p>
