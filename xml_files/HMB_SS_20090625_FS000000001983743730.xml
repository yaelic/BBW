          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Hennes &amp; Mauritz six month report conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And just to remind you all, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>With that, I would now like to hand off to today's Chairperson, Nils Vinge. Please begin your meeting and I will be standing by.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Welcome to this conference call on the occasion of H&amp;M's second quarter results. The presentation slides are found on our website, hm.com. With me is also our CFO Jyrki Tervonen, and our Head of Communications, Kristina Stenvinkel. And we will answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>Let's start by commenting the first half year. Sales excluding VAT increased 21% to 49.8 billion. In local currencies the increase was 6% while sales in comparable units decreased 3%.</p>
          <p>Gross profit rose to 29.4 billion resulting in a gross margin of 59% compared to last year's 61.3%. The operating profit was 9 billion and the operating margin amounted to 18.1%.</p>
          <p>The profit after financial items was 9.3 billion and the net profit was 6.8 billion corresponding to earnings per share of 8.18. In the first half year 93 stores were opened and nine were closed. At the end of May the number of stores was 1820 of which 29 were franchised.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the second quarter, we are satisfied with H&amp;M's results given the market situation. We continued to gain market shares even though this is recession-affected consumption. H&amp;M's spring collections were well received. Sales in the quarter as a whole reached 26.5 billion, an increase of 23% in Swedish kroner. In local currencies the increase was 8% and in comparable units sales were 2% lower in the last year.</p>
          <p>Sales in the month of May were unchanged in local currencies, while comparable unit sales decreased 9%. This should be seen in the light of last year's sales development with very strong sales in May and weak April sales. In addition there was a negative calendar effect of around 4 to 5%. The outcome between different months varies from one year to another showing the importance of evaluating sales over the whole season not a single month. Gross profit increased 19% to 16.2 billion corresponding to a gross margin of 61% compared to 62.9% last year.</p>
          <p>The margin decrease is mainly due to the absence of positive currency effects of around SEK 340 million or 1.3 percentage units due to hedging of the internal flow of goods. H&amp;M uses currency hedges to lock in expected gross profit in Swedish kroner. In brief, this is done by hedging of the sourcing cost as well as the expected gross profit from the international subsidiaries. Over time the hedging impact is expected to even out.</p>
          <p>Furthermore the gross margin was negatively affected by the strengthened U.S. dollar, which partly was offset by lower raw material costs, lower transportation costs, and greater excess capacity at our suppliers. Price reductions in relation to sales were at the same level as last year, much due to the efficient assortment and inventory management. The closing stock-in-trade is considered to be well composed and at a satisfactory level.</p>
          <p>The store operations have been adjusted in accordance to the current market situation and costs in comparable stores have decreased. The operating profit for the quarter was 5.7 billion corresponding to an operating margin of 21.4%. Profit after financial items increased by almost 4 million to 5.8 billion. The net profit was 4.2 billion corresponding to earnings per share of 5.07.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M continues to expand. In March we opened our first two stores in Russia in Moscow. So far sales have surpassed our expectations. This also applies for last autumn's new H&amp;M market, Japan. During the spring we opened our first two stores in Beijing and the reception and sales have been very promising. In February, the home textiles collection, H&amp;M Home, was launched and we're pleased with its reception. Online and catalog sales as a whole have developed well and is a good complement to our stores.</p>
          <p>The store chains COS, Monki and Weekday developed as planned. We opened COS stores in major cities like Paris, Berlin, and London. Copenhagen got its first two Monki stores during the spring, in addition to five new stores in Sweden. We are also pleased with this spring's designer collaboration with Matthew Williamson.</p>
          <p>Sales in Germany increased 8% in local currency during the first six months and we have continued to gain market share in a tough environment. France is now clearly our second largest market and we continue to expand. Eight new stores were opened in Q2, among them France's first COS store in Paris. This fall we will open the second large H&amp;M store on Boulevard Haussmann Lafayette, a very good location.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Nordic countries have continued to be slow. The UK market remains challenging. We opened five new stores in the second quarter and shortly we will open a large flagship store in Brighton.</p>
          <p>Retail sales in Spain have slowed down significantly, which also has affected our sales during the quarter. Despite that we continue to grow. We opened a large store in Barcelona and contract for a new flagship store in best business location in Madrid was recently signed. Due to the strengthening of the to the dollar, USA has advanced and become H&amp;M's third largest market even though the retailing market has been difficult. Our reach will soon be extended to Florida where two new stores will open this autumn. Sales in China and in particular in Hong Kong have developed very well. In April the first two H&amp;M stores in Beijing were opened. The reception so far has exceeded our expectations, and in the autumn a third store will open.</p>
          <p>And also in Japan H&amp;M continues to do well. During the eight months we have been open in Japan we have sold fashion almost SEK 700 million in two stores. This autumn we will open another four stores in the Tokyo area, and next year the first store in Osaka. We're pleased with the development of the franchise operations in the Middle East. During the first six months 11 new stores were opened. And this autumn we will open the first H&amp;M store in Lebanon.</p>
          <p>Now a few words on some key figures. The stock-in-trade increased 22% to 8.6 billion. About a third of the increase is due to exchange rates and about half is due to new stores. In relation to sales the stock-in-trade was 8.9%, a historically good level. The stock-in-trade is considered to be well composed at a satisfactory level.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from current operations was 7.2 billion. Investments increased to almost 2.3 billion mainly reflecting investments in new stores. Our finances are very strong even after dividend payouts of 12.8 billion. Liquid funds and short-term investments were 14.9 billion. The return on equity was 51.6%.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M remains positive towards future expansion and our business opportunities. We continue to make our fashion available to new customers by opening new stores, entering new markets and through new customer offerings. For instance, we recently announced this autumn's exciting collaboration with Jimmy Choo, our first with an accessories brand.</p>
          <p>Jimmy Choo for H&amp;M will include shoes, bags and smaller collection of clothes for women and men. The collections will be launched on November 14 in 200 selective city stores worldwide.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M's aim is to increase sales with continued high profitability. In 2009, we plan to increase the number of stores by 225, including 15 Monki and Weekday stores and 8 COS stores.</p>
          <p>The first Monki and Weekday stores in Germany will open in Hamburg this autumn. The majority of the openings this year occur in the second half of the year. We are planning a net addition of 141 stores in the second half mainly in the US, the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.</p>
          <p>Preparations for H&amp;M stores in new markets like South Korea, Jordan and Israel in 2010 continues. Our business concept, fashion and quality at the best price takes us to new markets. We have a challenging and very exciting journey ahead of us.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. I'll be happy to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Rolf Karp. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name and location.</p>

          <p>Hi, Rolf Karp, &#xD6;hman Equities.</p>

          <p>Hi.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have one question regarding the markdowns, you said it was flat compared to the same quarter last year. I asked this question during the analyst meeting, what you saw in the market, how the markdowns looked like? Were they higher or how did you feel about that situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general the feeling was that during the second quarter the market had higher markdowns. That's the general impression.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the dollar increase we're seeing now, do you think that the freight costs, the negotiations with suppliers will benefit you when you enter into the second half this year regardless the increase in the dollar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult of course to talk about the future, but it's important to remember that the freight costs and raw material costs have been very low and are on the rise. But we can only comment on the second quarter and, I mean business continue as usual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's all the questions I had. Thank you.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Hughes. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. It's Andrew Hughes from UBS in London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I have a question on the gross margin and particularly going back to what happened in the first quarter where you had the 200 basis point impact from buying dollars effectively. I think at spot for when you topped up purchases. That doesn't seem to have happened again this time. Is that because there is no impact or you don't actually go into the market in the second quarter to buy more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, if I understand you correct, you are referring to the effects from the unhedged purchase volumes from the --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From the &#x2013; I think about the 10% of purchases that aren't hedged, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, there are time lag, the sleeper effect. Yes, that's correct, the effects in Q2 have been insignificant and thus not affected the gross margin in Q2 materially. So we commented in quarter one due to the extreme effect on volatility on the US dollar exchange rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it is that you, is it rate movements that have resulted in it not being material or that you don't actually buy more at spot in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the main reason is that the volatility in Q2 versus Q1 which affect the Q2, so that volatility has been much less than the corresponding volatility in Q1 versus Q4 where Q4 yes affected Q1, so to say. So the average movements in the Swedish kroner and US dollar has been much less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And you said just on the other element of hedging that you tried to lock in gross profit in SEK?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And saying that over time it does wash out. I mean is there any thinking that you might drop that policy and if it does drop out over time then maybe it's not worth doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>H&amp;M always look at constant improvements and of course this applies for hedging as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So maybe under consideration then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but I mean, but you have to be very careful. If you change something, as long as you do it consistently, it balances out over time</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That said, of course, I mean in the first three quarters last year, we had the same policy and we didn't give any effect. And then, of course, with the extreme movement we saw in last fall of course it had effects and now looking back of course you can always question it. So, you have to be careful if you change something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Richard Chamberlain. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gents, it's Richard Chamberlain here from new shop Merrill Lynch in London. I just had a question on average selling prices. I wonder if you could tell me what they &#x2013; how they trended during the quarter and whether that caused any sort of significant mix effects on the gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on comparable items the prices were on same level. But ASP was slightly up due to mix, but it hasn't affected the gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, thanks very much. And also so you just mentioned, Nils, a figure, I think, from Japan in your presentation, SEK 700 million. Are you talking about the sort of cumulative sales since the stores opened last autumn. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So about nine months worth of sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. It's not even nine months because we opened it during Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay, thanks. And just finally on sourcing, is your sort of geographic mix of sourcing changing? I mean, obviously the long run trend has been a little bit over time towards Asia. I mean, has that now turned and going the other way or is that fairly stable right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fairly stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's fairly stable, but we always look at the sourcing and of course dramatic currency effects like this makes it look even closer to it &#x2013; but you see movement in both directions, but it's &#x2013; on the whole it's pretty stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Tony Shiret. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's Tony Shiret from Credit Suisse in London. Hi guys, my question is really to do with home shopping. I see you commented that your German sales were 8% ahead in local currency. I take it that was pretty much all down to the growth of your home shopping business rather than your sales for your physical stores, is that a correct interpretation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's correct that we are very pleased with the direct shopping &#x2013; home shopping as you say, but we're also pleased with the retail store sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you then sort of tell me why the Netherlands is not growing its sales in local currency, because you had your launch in the Netherlands what probably three or four years ago now and it seems to not be contributing anything to overall sales growth there, it looks like the Netherlands is just negative like-for-like offset by space growth in that figure of zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct that Germany has done better than the Netherlands, but to comment on each country, why they're not performing or why they're performing so well, I prefer not to do, but still one reason of course could be that we entered the online sales and catalog sales in Germany one year after Holland. So, it's still building up so to speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wonder whether there is any &#x2013; I would have expected from a relatively mature position that your home shopping sales would be capable of growing at a superior rate to the market for a significant period of time rather than just in a sort of small build-up timeframe, what do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in theory you are right. But, I mean it's from a small level to start with, but again I prefer not to go into detail about each country, sorry but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more a generic question about home shopping, Nils, as you probably understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure I understand but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you actually put any marketing spend into home shopping in the countries where you have been for a while, for example in the Netherlands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course we do. It's part of the marketing budget.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and of course we're also marketing the home shopping in our stores.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>How do you feel about things looking into 2009, '10 in terms of your ability to perhaps push towards the sort of top end or higher end of your target range for expansion in the year ahead? And can I kind of because I'm only allowed one question attach that to the Japanese market, where you're clearly doing incredibly well and ask you to talk a little bit about what you see the long-term potential in Japan as being?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Historically, the first question, of course, it's tempting to increase the, accelerate the speed. We certainly have the resources to do it, but I think it's important to focus more on quality than quantity and I think we are very happy to be within the bracket of 10 to 15%. Regarding Japan, it's a very interesting market, and of course, with a great potential and we are very happy again with the start. But, we have also deep respect for the market and I think you should be very careful to take one step at a time and not do mistakes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You say 10% to 15%. But it seems closer to 10% for some time. I would imagine this would be &#x2013; this is your chance to push up the rate. So, when you say 10% to 15%, could it really be 15%? Or are we &#x2013; would we be dreaming to hope for that next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a hypothetical question. I mean we want to be redundant, but don't want to make any compromises. And even though, it's of course a lot better this year than the last year when it comes to expansion and we still want to make good deals and there is no reason for us to just increase the speed for the sake of it. So, it's &#x2013; our long-term target is to grow the business 10 to 15% with continued high profitability.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Simon Irwin from Liberum in London. Just going back to the gross margin issue, it's my understanding that the &#x2013; during the first quarter there were kind of three elements to it. Obviously, you talked through the internal hedging impact and the unhedged 10%. Was there also a kind of mark-to-market from gains on hedged product within these numbers, and was that significant, and the point is really &#x2013; are any of these going to become significant in the second half or can we now assume that if FX remains stable that most of these issues are behind us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if we are talking about the 10% unhedged volumes and also the effects from the time lag, sleeper effect, so if the volatility between the quarters are diminishing so with the effect as well, as it happened now in Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up, was there any significant impact on either April or May from the Matthew Williamson that was notable or was it just not broad enough to impact like-for-like sales?</p>

          <p>Hi, how are you? I assume that at this point your commitment and your purchases for the fall winter are almost complete. And I was wondering what sourcing markets you have found especially overseas in terms of dollar based discounts year-on-year. We are guessing from other retailers that there is indeed a Forex headwind, but it's being compensated by discounts from Asian suppliers willing to fill their capacity better and to have some leeway with the major accounts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you're right, I mean and we did comment that the excess capacity has helped us and then getting better prices from the suppliers. But going forward it's very difficult for us to give you any guidance. But I also think it's important that we work long term with our suppliers and we can't just squeeze them too far so as much as about making a good deal, it should be good for both parties and you shouldn't expect any dramatic discounts from these levels.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a question on the favorite topic of the gross margin. You were talking about the gains that you've seen from better agreements, lower commodities etcetera. If the currencies were to reverse, would these gains be locked in these agreements, so we could actually see an improvement in gross margin if the FX were to move in your favor, let's say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very tricky question. I mean last year the dollar was still depreciating now it has been appreciating. And I mean it's business as usual and it's long term and of course things change in both direction. And if we do it better than the competitors, we are the winners. That's how we see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just really trying to work out, when you're talking to your suppliers, have you locked them in at attractive rates for an extended period of time, let's say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's true that we work long-term. So of course we have contract. But again as I said a good deal should be good for both parties. And they work on thin margins and you can't squeeze them too far.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Just one question on inventories because they have been &#x2013; well growth has been accelerating in the past three, four quarters there, and I was wondering with what you know, with what you are seeing in the marketplace at the moment. Do you expect discounting to pick up starting next month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we're looking at the stock-in-trade situation, we have to remember the increase with 22 percentages here, it's one-third is from currency effects and half of it is the new shops. So that means that the increase in comparable store is around 4% when it comes to stock-in-trade. And we have to remember that it's still on a historically attractive level. It's 8.9 percentages of the rolling 12 months turnover. So, we think it's very -- it compels the stock-in-trade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so you don't necessarily expect discounting to pick up in the next couple of months?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the level, as Jyrki said, is historically on a very good level and we have to really, with the balance of the inventory level and I think the best is to comment the second quarter we've managed to keep markdowns on the same level as last year despite the difficult environment. And regarding Q3 you will have to wait until the next report I think to know how that develops.</p>

It hasn't been worse than was the one the first quarter. Can you elaborate a little about the trend that you see in those markets about markdown activities?

          <p>Yes. And when I'm on the line, as Nicklas said, can you -- last year in Q -- the upcoming Q3, you had a strategic fell out of the inventory cost. You had a negative effect of about 100 basis points in the quarter. That was more like lowering the inventory level. And we saw higher markdown activities in July. It was not because the inventory level was exceptionally high in the end of the second quarter, was it?</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon, gents. It's John Guy from MF Global in London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question, hi, my question is with regards to the gross margin, obviously the FX impact is likely to improve going forward into the third quarter and thereafter, but looking at that 60 basis points decline in the gross margin in the second quarter stripping out the FX impact, on the basis that you said that there was no increased markdown year-on-year. Could you just, is that 60 basis points effectively due to markdown, are you saying that there was no gross margin impact on the markdown in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. The markdown in relation to sales was at the same level year-to-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so that 60 basis point additional pressure that you saw in the second quarter, what's that attributed to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I didn't really get your question, could you rephrase it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, over the second quarter you've had a 190 basis points impact to your gross margin of which you said that 130 of that is FX-related, so I am just trying to &#x2013; so there is a 60 basis point outstanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 130 is from the internal hedges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So they are still 60 basis points below last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course that is due to the strengthened US dollar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it is partially offset by greater spare capacity of the suppliers and lower raw material prices etcetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Etcetera, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So effectively no change on your markdown, it's all coming from the strengthening in US dollar mitigated by that spare capacity and lower costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Can I just follow up on costs, you sound pretty happy with your performance on costs relative to the space growth. It's quite difficult for us to kind of back that out in terms of given the FX within that, but can you just talk about what you've done to mitigate your costs, how much of that is kind of company-specific actions and how much of it is FX-related?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was confusing and the line is very bad, so was it cause or costs, could you rephrase it again, sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just talking about costs &#x2013; operating costs, you sounded very happy with your performance in terms of operating costs and can you just say what the &#x2013; for example, what the local currency increase in operating costs was given that there is clearly a big foreign exchange element and also can you just talk about what actions you've taken to maintain to restrict cost growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in our culture at H&amp;M cost control is ongoing everyday. So, we haven't done any major changes to that. So, that's normal life for us and the local growth was 11 percentages and that's in line with the expansion and also in comparable stores we decreased the costs. So, we think we are having a really good cost control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but you can't give us any flavor as to whether that came out of reducing head count or rentals or any specific elements like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course, all kind of elements, there can be for staff planning, there can be logistic things, transports, electricity, all that kind of items, all kind of shop costs, travel expenses etcetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and would you be confident that you can keep this going for the rest of the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Yes, as I said, that's an ongoing process within our company, so of course we have cost consciousness every day.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Could I just ask about tax? I noticed from your competitor yesterday that they were talking about Swedish government tax cuts, forgive me for not knowing this but when does that impact your numbers, and is it the Swedish tax cut on corporation tax and when &#x2013; and was it built into your 27.5% guidance for the tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the change in the tax rate will take effect first next year.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Just a follow-up question on the space strategy targeting still some of the Western European markets. I am really following up, I guess from Fraser's point that you've seen the Japanese demand be very, very strong and yet you're relatively underpenetrated in these markets. Why aren't you necessarily moving away from targeted space in some of these Western European markets and more into some other potentially high growth markers around Asia and also within the Middle East?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we look at each market and we see clear opportunities in the existing markets in Europe and of course we look at growth in the markets like Japan. But as I said, we started last year and we are very happy so far, but we've learned the lesson to take one step at a time and not get carried away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it a function that the cost of rollout in these areas is just going to be significantly greater, because you don't have the size and scale that you do already in the existing Western European regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course initially the first store is always more expensive in a new continent. But as we grow of course we quickly get economies of scale.</p>
