          <p>Financial Highlights</p>
          <p>* First of all, I would like to review some of the event in the last quarter as well as some details on our fourth quarter results</p>
          <p>* As a reminder, in our December 18 press announcement, we communicated that we saw a severe deterioration in order intake due to the global economic crisis</p>
          <p>* We experienced a certain drop-off in the lithography demand triggered by an unprecedented mix of falling end-demand for semiconductors, weak memory device prices, and very limited access to capital for our customers</p>
          <p>Cost Base</p>
          <p>* The associated steep decline in our business outlook forced us to take immediate action to lower our cost base</p>
          <p>* We took a set of measures to lower our cost base which included a workforce reduction of 12% worldwide, a partial relocation of customer support activities from the United States to Asia, a scheduled shutdown of production facilities for four weeks in 2009, reduced labor hours and a dramatic reduction in various discretionary spending</p>
          <p>ASML's Expenses</p>
          <p>* The combination of these efforts will reduce ASML's expenses by roughly &#x20AC;50mm per quarter starting in Q1 2009</p>
          <p>o The cost associated with these measures and the impairment charges was &#x20AC;137mm which we took in Q4</p>
          <p>o Virtually, all of these items were non-cash by the way</p>
          <p>Sales</p>
          <p>* Now, on our fourth quarter results</p>
          <p>* Our fourth quarter sales fell just below 500mm</p>
          <p>* We shifted 25 systems, 15 of which were new and 10 were used</p>
          <p>o Amongst the new systems, 11 were immersion systems keeping the new system ASP above &#x20AC;20mm with ASP of all systems being &#x20AC;50mm</p>
          <p>o This is obviously the result of a large portion of used system sales</p>
          <p>System Revenues</p>
          <p>* Our system revenues were higher than anticipated due to an unexpectedly large number of lithography system moves, and due to the restructuring charges, we reported a net loss in Q4 &#x20AC;88mm</p>
          <p>o Excluding the net effect of these charges, we would have booked net income of &#x20AC;11mm</p>
          <p>o That's 2.3% of net sales</p>
          <p>Full-year 2008 Sales and Orders</p>
          <p>* Full-year 2008 sales were close to 3B</p>
          <p>o That's a 22% decline as compared to 2007</p>
          <p>* Net total for the full year including Q4 restructuring charge amounted to &#x20AC;322mm or 11% of net sales</p>
          <p>* Now, as I said before, orders in Q4 were understandably low with net booking set only 13 systems with a bookings value of 127mm</p>
          <p>* The orders include only five new systems of which there were immersions</p>
          <p>* We have an average selling price of close to &#x20AC;25mm and eight used systems with an average selling price of &#x20AC;400,000</p>
          <p>o This released our order backlog as of December 31st at &#x20AC;755mm with a total of 41 systems 19 of which were immersions</p>
          <p>Restructuring Charges, R&amp;D and SG&amp;A</p>
          <p>* Due to the impact of Q4 restructuring charges, the Company's gross margin was 8%</p>
          <p>* And excluding restructuring and impairment charges, gross margin would have been 35.5%</p>
          <p>o This is well within our guidance range when taking into account the lower net sales in the quarter</p>
          <p>* Q4 R&amp;D costs were &#x20AC;127mm and SG&amp;A were 47</p>
          <p>* Both items included by the way each a &#x20AC;1mm restructuring charge</p>
          <p>* In Q4, the sudden and steep business decline obviously left its temporary mark on our cash position</p>
          <p>* We deliberately made payments to support our suppliers that provided us with inventory that ultimately got pushed out by our customers</p>
          <p>o Customer shipments in the quarter were back-end loaded creating unpaid accounts receivable at the year-end</p>
          <p>Tax and Cash Flow</p>
          <p>* And a final tax settlement for 2007 and investments towards the completion of our EUV factory, which is due to be finished mid this year, created additional cash outflow in the quarter</p>
          <p>* Now, clearly, such cash outflow will not repeat itself in the quarters to come</p>
          <p>* Positive cash flow from operations in H1 2009 will be fueled by collection of our accounts receivable balance and the use of our inventory to support virtually all of our systems and service sales</p>
          <p>CapEx</p>
          <p>* Reduced CapEx in H2 2009 due to the completion of the EUV factory and the cash benefits from lower cost of operations will further help to control our cash position</p>
          <p>* As a result of the above, we expect to stay within the bandwidth of our gross cash target of 1 to &#x20AC;1.5B</p>
          <p>* This would by the way include an expected dividend payment of &#x20AC;86mm in Q2</p>
          <p>Outlook</p>
          <p>* As for our outlook, the severity of the global economic downturn has caused most semiconductor manufacturers to delay their investment plans</p>
          <p>* The uncertainty as to the timing of a pickup of semiconductor demand and the time needed to complete the current consolidation and restructuring activities in especially the memory sector makes a prediction of the pickup of the semiconductor in different markets impossible</p>
          <p>* In this environment of an investment freeze, it is understandable that the wait-and-see attitude of our customers has a significant impact on our system shipments</p>
          <p>o We therefore expect Q1 2009 net sales to be in the range of 180 to &#x20AC;200mm</p>
          <p>* And since our cost base to support our normalized sales levels amounts to approximately &#x20AC;120mm, the gross margin at this very low level of Q1 sales will be about 8%</p>
          <p>* Now, net R&amp;D expenses are expected to be at 170mm while SG&amp;A are expected to be at &#x20AC;44mm</p>
          <p>Closing Remarks</p>
          <p>* As a closing remark, I would like to inform you that based upon our confidence in our ability to keep generating cash, ASML will submit a proposal to the 2009 general meeting of shareholders to declare a dividend of $0.20 per share which is approximately &#x20AC;86mm which compares to &#x20AC;0.$0.25 per share paid in 2008 under profit of 2007</p>

          <p>Q4 Highlights</p>
          <p>* In other terms, Peter confirmed the following</p>
          <p>o First, we executed our fundamentals in Q4 in terms of</p>
          <p>* Price</p>
          <p>* Margin</p>
          <p>* And costs</p>
          <p>o Second, we recognized that the market will be at the standstill for a period of time justifying restructuring, impairments and the significant leverage of our flexible cost models that is reduction of the flexible workers and contracted activities for labor, et cetera</p>
          <p>o Third, we do not have at this point any data allowing us to call for the timing of the recovery</p>
          <p>Semiconductor Unit End Demand</p>
          <p>* The semiconductor unit end demand has dropped significantly in Q4</p>
          <p>* I think it's an historical drop by the way</p>
          <p>o And the customers have slowed down or delayed their technology transitions either by leveraging their existing installed base or just by delaying the new product introduction for later</p>
          <p>DRAM &amp; Flash Manufacturers and New Technologies</p>
          <p>* We however see a certain number of encouraging factors for the future</p>
          <p>* For instance, we estimate that the DRAM manufactures and the Flash manufacturers have now reduced their wafer out leasehold capacity by respectively 30% for the DRAM and 20% for the Flash manufacturers vs. an average of 2008</p>
          <p>o So, that is I would say January numbers or Q1 numbers</p>
          <p>* By a mixture of significant 200 millimeter capacity retirement and a transfer of some 300 millimeter capacity to new technologies, which in turn translate into less wafers per installed base, because this new technologies are less efficient in terms of numbers of wafers although they are more efficient in terms of numbers of dies</p>
          <p>* This significant reduction of capacity combined with the lower utilization rate is slowly translating into a DRAM and Flash chip market price increase as we have seen in the past two to three weeks</p>
          <p>o We also estimate that the current low bookings level is clearly not sustainable in case of a semiconductor demand pickup from current level</p>
          <p>Restructuring</p>
          <p>* In addition, we are encouraged by the progress made towards the restructuring of the overall DRAM industry led by the Taiwanese government towards a creation of a sustainable consortium</p>
          <p>o During this what we could call transition, we are focusing our effort on efficiency and on continuing to invest in technology without any impact on our strategic programs namely the XT:4 cost-efficient platform, the NXT double patterning platform and the EUV next-generation technology</p>
          <p>TWINSCAN NXT</p>
          <p>* In details, we really indeed transition our customers with a cost effective XT: 4 platform within the year 2009</p>
          <p>* Our TWINSCAN NXT multipurpose platform is being finalized for introduction and delivery in H1 with substantially higher speed up to 200 wafer per hour and overlay accuracy that are better than any current ASML competitive product</p>
          <p>o It will provide customers with a capability to image 232 nanometer and potentially dip beyond</p>
          <p>EUV Production System and ASML</p>
          <p>* Our EUV production system roadmap supports cost-effective chip manufacturing to 22 nanometer and smaller and deliveries will start in 2010 as previously planned</p>
          <p>* In addition, ASML has developed a range of resolution enhancement techniques which leading IC manufacturers are implementing to reduce cost per chip</p>
          <p>o These techniques from advanced illumination shaping to radical mask pattern enhancement require powerful computational modeling and intimate knowledge of this kind of systems</p>
          <p>o This is a unique combination in which ASML has established a leading role thanks to the know-how acquired through Brion</p>
          <p>* It's a division that we acquired two years ago</p>
          <p>* We described this concept as holistic lithography and it will now enable a continued aggressive lithographic device scaling while optimizing our customers' cost <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>Operational Program</p>
          <p>* In parallel to our focus on R&amp;D as I said at the beginning, we have actually readied our operational efficiency program in order to be able to weather the current crisis and at the same time become structurally stronger company</p>
          <p>* By this current quarter, by Q1, we will have, as Peter mentioned, already cut operational expenses by about &#x20AC;50mm per quarter</p>
          <p>o Most importantly, we expect that about 50% of these will be sustainable when the economy recovers making ASML much leaner and internally resulting in greater profitability during the market recovery</p>
          <p>Summary</p>
          <p>* In summary, we are confronted with the inventories in the short-term during which we will not burn cash, we will continue our technology investment which will not be impeded, and we will be able to work and focus our attention, our management attention, our people attention on creating a more efficient cost structure for the future</p>
          <p>o So, in other terms, we will leverage the period of low activity during this recession</p>
          <p>* We cannot, however, yet call the timing of the demand pickup obviously which will naturally be semiconductor and demand-driven that is number of units and the application or the new application pickup which are big users of new technology-type chips</p>

          <p>Analyst: Nicolas Gaudois &#x2013; UBS</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Nicolas Gaudois: Yes, hi. Nick Gaudois, UBS. Just a first question on immersion units for which, I mean, three months ago you were saying you will be up from, I guess, 55 units you shipped for <mark type="inaudible" /> in 2008. Obviously, <mark type="inaudible" /> are looking now also. Maybe if you could help us trying to find a base for immersion units for this year and by implication of how would you quantify the pent-up demand? In other words, the difference vs. maybe three, four months ago and now which is represented by companies just coming to a halt in terms of their capacity to buy tools for shrinks. It goes clearly in our view to be a moving part to factor in into the next year hopefully when things normalize and we expect the demand comes back? Thank you.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Nicolas, thank you. In fact, this is a very insightful question, in particular on the pent-up demand, because that's the real question. So, first is at this moment, we have clearly no visibility. We made it. We wrote it in the press release. We must say that we have been surprised. We used to say that we are protected by the fact that there is a significant technology transition business there and therefore, we will have a minimum of x numbers of units and this is why we called the numbers of immersion units for last call.</p>
          <p>What happened, which was a bit of a puzzle to us, is that the recession was so steep in Q4 that even those technology transitions did not happen. They did not happen for certain numbers of reasons. The first is that the application drive that is the numbers of new products, new telephone, new MP3 players, new hard disk, et cetera, basically the application drive disappeared as much as the rest of the demand. So, the drop has been significant which means the customers were really starting to ramp their 45 nano or the 35 nano, found themselves with a new demand type of activity. So, you do have an application impact.</p>
          <p>The second impact was or is the issue of financing certain number of tools. In fact, significant numbers of tools were supposed to be purchased by people who are at this moment in restructuring phase or looking for financing or just waiting in fact for the consolidation that we're talking about the DRAM industry which is a good thing but it takes a bit of time to negotiate as you know the Taiwanese government and we can talk about this later. But all the companies involved in this restructuring are in the wait-and-see attitude just because there is not so much of financing but who is going to buy or what it is, what is the new consortium, et cetera.</p>
          <p>The third aspect, which has completely changed the cards, is that in lieu of lack of demand and potentially lack of financing and difficulty to finance or to justify profitability of all that. Our customers played smart, or operating smart; that is they are trying to build up a new technology nodes by a mix and match of what they already have. So, in other terms, if a customer had one immersion unit and five ArF dry units, they are playing with a bit of double-patterning dry and less immersion layers on the existing installed base, and they can generate a mid node or nodes which are a bit less aggressive or nodes with less heel, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>But basically, they are making use of what they have and that was rendered possible or that was rendered necessary because they did not have cash and that was rendered possible because demand has gone down. So, they don't need the machines in question that became idle.</p>
          <p>So, that puts a bit of a twist to the short-term environment which explains why we come up with a very low guidance for Q1 of 180 and 200. But definitively, which is to your question of pent-up demand, this 200mm, this run rate this is absolutely unsustainable. The smart ways of working these solutions is not solving the mid-term and the application curve is going to start hitting the customers. In other terms, yes, the demand is low, but slowly the demand is converting to the new products, which have to have more integration of 35 nanometer flash card for instance, or 40 or 55 nano DRAM et cetera, et cetera. So, or DDR3, or et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, even if the demand volume doesn't pick up, the mix is going to require capacity. And Nick, I would like, Nicolas, I would like at this point to leave it there and stay qualitative. At this moment, we are re-looking at this pent-up demand number to see when those numbers of 55, 60 will reoccur. And obviously, it's a bit of a mixture between total market units and application mix and I don't think we are at this moment in any position to give you a &#x2013; I would say a simulated satisfactory answer.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Nicolas Gaudois: Okay, great. But, just a quick follow-up on the <mark type="inaudible" /> maybe, if we just stay with a Taiwan, DRAM consolidation firm, if something goes throughout on in refinancing at least the two main players and their respective JVs, with Micron and NLPR, what kind of number of units for immersion could be added, what kind of range, I mean, I understand some of that depends on what exactly the processor will be and therefore a number of units you need but just to give us a range of what is basically locked up here because of these negotiations ongoing?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Yes, I can guess a number of about 15 to 20 for six months. That would be the base. Call it critical mass restart of this environment.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Nicolas Gaudois: Great. Perfect. Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Yes.</p>
          <p>Analyst: Simon Sch&#xE4;fer &#x2013; Goldman Sachs</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Simon Sch&#xE4;fer: Yes, thanks so much. It's Goldman Sachs. I wanted to ask about, not necessarily Q4 outflow in terms of working capital, I realize that that can be reversed, probably, it sounds like in Q1. But, broadly speaking, ASML is finding itself into a &#x2013; in a situation whereby you have a very well-capitalized balance sheet in comparison to really all of your suppliers, as well as, of course, the majority of the customer base, I think Nick alluded to some of that, especially in Taiwan. So what are the risks that, not dissimilar to 2002, the company gets a lot more aggressive in terms of offering options or really financing other peoples upturn, if that makes sense?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: Yes, I think that would be something that you would think of. And clearly I think the whole customer base is thinking of that, and &#x2013; but we make it very clear that we're not the central bank of the industry. So this is something that we are highly careful with, for the simple reason that it is something where if you start doing this you probably have to start doing this for the whole customer base because they're all are in the same position and they're all competing with each other. So, that is something that is difficult to apply in a broader &#x2013; on a broader scale. With respect to the suppliers, yes, like we said, we did pay our suppliers by the end of the year nicely on time for all the inventory that they shipped us which customers started to push out, which actually settles up with, basically settles us with them on the outstanding balances.</p>
          <p>Now, we won't need a lot, we won't &#x2013; we need very, very little over the next two quarters, because what we anticipate that we will sell, we basically have in inventory. So, that will come back in terms of cash. That means that you are drying up your suppliers. Now the question is, how bad is that? If we compare this to the 2001, 2002 downturn, our supply base has actually changed in the sense that we have fewer very large suppliers that we depend on, and those suppliers are bigger.</p>
          <p>We have seen also the consolidation in the supply base and also many of those bigger suppliers have learned and have diversified much more than they ever did before. So, in the scan that we have done through the supply chain, we have not identified any major supplier that will go at risk at this moment, largely because they are bigger, and they are more diversified than they ever were before. So, from that point I don't think we would see a cash drain, and on the customer side I think, I was clear on what our policy is.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Simon Sch&#xE4;fer: Absolutely. That's very helpful, Peter, thank you. My second question would be, and I realize it's very difficult and my question isn't necessarily related to anything demand related. But, just if we just assume for a second that the company's shrink roadmap is on track and that's sustainable for the next three years or so. What do you think is a normal sort of run rate in terms of the requirement of annualized number of machines that your customers may have to take, assuming that they are not expanding any capacity of course. So, just technology purchases, what would be a normalized type of run rate, assuming that customers want to stay on Moore's law?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: We have estimated this about six months ago, and the number was about 2B of sales for us, which includes mostly immersion tools and a bit of service to it.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Simon Sch&#xE4;fer: Okay. Thank you so much.</p>
          <p>Analyst: Unknown &#x2013; Nimura</p>
          <p>Question: Yes, hello, good afternoon. It's <mark type="inaudible" /> at Nimura. I was wondering, on the immersion demand, if you could differentiate the different level of confidence for different customer groups i.e. the main three groups, is there a different level that you feel?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Yes, that's also an interesting question. I think we all believe that the DRAM industry was in dire situation by not having a sustainable business model. And I would say at this moment probably most of us start to feel extremely comfortable that the required consolidation by the Taiwanese government is going to make a bit of a difference. Of course we haven't seen the results yet, but it is encouraging that the Taiwanese government has said, we will help you and support you, but we want to see a business plan that works which is obviously one that says, you cannot over invest and be too many of you in the pie.</p>
          <p>So, there will be a restructuring and retiring of capacity. We can trust, I suppose, the Taiwanese government, they have very well developed the foundry business, as we know. And we think that's a very good thing. Also you have seen that now the big players in DRAM has &#x2013; have retired capacity and now are playing to be bit more smarter in the negotiation of contract pricing to avoid getting into the current situation. So, I would feel at this moment a fairly &#x2013; I would feel very good that the DRAM players will be the ones which will get us out of the crisis. The flash people are good, but they over dreamt the new applications, as we all know from last year.</p>
          <p>Now, you will hear them say that the engine of growth is the solid state drives and the adds or add-on cards, this is good to hear. This is an obvious area of growth. And this is an obvious area where there is need if one achieves a cost levels, and obviously because we are offering customers latest cost levels or cost points and we are giving potentially one or two more node opportunities, we feel very good that they will be sustained by this new growth engine. So, in other terms now that the dreams are corrected, and the new engines are very clear, and they are based on technology. We also feel comfortable that we'll expect this to be coming a bit after the DRAM. Logic, Higher Logic has been slow for lithography for a long time. Now, they are hit by demand at the moment where they ramp 45, and also when the people who have gone foundry like ST and XP, Freescale, et cetera, are starting to ramp these new technologies, or will be. So, I expect that to also happen. But I would expect this too in 2010.</p>
          <p>Question: Okay. And just as a follow-up. Is it fair to say that your views on the logic sector, this is the area where you've changed most because I remember last quarter, we talked about, you said one foundry order per month, we talked about AMD. Is that the area where you've changed most as the outlook?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Well, in fact, the outlook, yes. Of &#x2013; foundry has been lower compared to what I said, one a month, one immersion a month is not the case. But we are shipping, I would say this moment one, say one a quarter. So it's not good. But remember these are people who say, I need the machines, but I'm end-driven, end-market driven. So I didn't have Christmas season, so I don't need the tools. So this is like &#x2013; these ones, the 45-nanometer guys, which we have identified, they will restart at the moment the demand curve restarts. Remember, the demand curve went down 6%, first time in the lifetime that the unit semiconductor within one quarter went down. It went from a plus &#x2013; I think it was a plus 8% on average year, and then went down minus 6% compared to the run rate of the year before. So, it's a tremendous hit on the logic side. So, I did change significantly the forecasts on those guys. But, on the other hand they have never been the bigger player. So, what is impacting us in our top line is still the DRAM and the flash.</p>
          <p>Question: Okay, thanks. That is very helpful.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Thank you.</p>
          <p>Analyst: Timothy Acuri &#x2013; Citigroup</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Timothy Acuri: Citi. Hi, a couple of things. First of all, my question is around maintenance CapEx. I know you just answered a question that you think normalized revenues are kind of in the 2B range. I'm assuming that that includes service, so if you kind of ack service out of that, that would imply using the kind of &#x20AC;16mm, ASP that you're kind of talking about, maybe 100 systems in kind of a normal year. And right now you're shipping a run rate maybe 25 or 28, taking Q1 number and kind of taking that across the year. So, you're shipping, kind of a quarter of what you would consider normalized. And I am wondering what you are shipping relative to what you consider maintenance?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Okay. Well, it's my fault, I use, or I try to hide something, but you are too good for me, so I have to tell you the truth. When I said these are service, I meant a bit of Brion, already getting in there that is the support, totally behind double patterning, for instance in the 2B. I didn't mean, the maintenance and service business as we have on average about 100mm a quarter. So, sorry about that. So, you should &#x2013; I should rephrase, in immersion business including a certain numbers of RET/OPC type deals and et cetera that we add to the package, it would be about 2B. And then you add 400mm of service and that would be the base business.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Timothy Acuri: I see. Okay.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Sorry about that.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Timothy Acuri: Okay. So then, it gets back to the idea of really maintenance CapEx. So, that would say that the normalized number of system shipments is kind of in the low 100s per year, say 125 or something like that. And you're shipping kind of 25 or 28 run rate in Q1. So, what do you think that the maintenance level is for the industry? So, normalized is kind of, over a cycle what you'd expect to ship. But what's the absolute minimum that if the industry wanted to run at maintenance CapEx for the next five years, what's the minimum number of systems that they would have to take per year relative to the number of that kind of 25, 28 run rate that you're shipping in Q1.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Again Tim, that's a very, a still complicated question. You have, of course we simulate this but to make it simple, usually these &#x2013; all these things depend on the numbers of transitions. What you call maintenance CapEx is in fact a way to assume how many new nodes get done. So, we have transitions of course simulated every year for flash, every 18 months for DRAM, every two years for logic, that's clear. So, if you add them up and you say, what's the maintenance CapEx for that, that replace, I would say 10% or 20% of the business with new chips vs. old chips, that type of thing. But you cannot even answer that question because then if you make a conversion from 65 to 55 or from 55 to 45, the answer is different.</p>
          <p>In other terms, the maintenance CapEx, as you said, it's just to make the transition of Moore's law growth. When you make, if I give you the answer of 2B, which I made the calculation because I did it last &#x2013; six months ago. That 2B correspond to a transition of 45 to 35 in flash, of 65 to 55 in DRAM and half of a transition of logic to 45, not much. If I &#x2013; I'll try to answer your question with my memory of what's going to happen a year later when you go one more step in the technology. You probably will create another 500mm. But I do this by memory. So, 2.5 would be the necessary transition cost.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: And everything of those transitions for Logic and DRAM and NAND will happen in the same year. So, and that's what Eric says, there are &#x2013; there is a timing difference in when &#x2013; what you call maintenance CapEx; we call the technology transitions, which I think is a better word. Because that needs to be, and that needs to be done. And that adds up to, we were &#x2013; in fact, if you take 2008, six months ago when we said 2008, we all knew that it was not going to be different by capacity demand but largely by technology transitions.</p>
          <p>And we were looking at about a 2B sales number in terms of system shipments and after that 400mm of <mark type="inaudible" />, I don't know whether you recollect that. But we have been talking about those numbers. That's a kind of, what you will call a maintenance year. We would call that a technology transition year without any capacity additions. And that could be, if, like Eric said, if those technology transitions would also include a full, let's say Logic node transition on top of DRAM and on top of Flash, that could be 2.5 with another 400mm of you know, shares. So, that's how you need to look at that.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Timothy Acuri: I see, okay. And then just, my follow-up question would be on service. And, we've heard from some other large companies that there was a pretty big fall off in service business at the end of December. You didn't see that obviously. And I'm wondering what's your outlook is for your service business in March and June, given the significant number of shutdowns and there are some big DRAM customers stripping down old tools for spare parts. So I'm wondering what your outlook is for service?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: Yeah. We do see some pressure on the service revenue, but I also want to remind you that service revenue was never a major part of our business as compared to some of our peers, which is quite different. I mean, if you are in the deposition area, your service is quite a large part. We have never been there. Now we do see some pressure on costs with our customers, where actually they are looking at service contracts. And we see a pressure between 10 and 15% top line, but that's about it. But what we also see at the other side like in Q4, we see system moves.</p>
          <p>Our customer's saying, we're going to reallocate certain tools to all the lines and we are going to rationalize our factories, which actually means there is a lot of work, because we need to de-install and install tools. So that comes on top. So we haven't seen in Q4 a big drop off, because of those additional activities. But it is fair to say that cost reduction pressure from our customers takes the pressure or puts the pressure on the top line of our service contract revenue, which is ours of between 10 and 15%.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Timothy Acuri: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.</p>
          <p>Analyst: C.J. Muse &#x2013; Barclays Capital</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; C.J. Muse: Yes, it's Barclays Capital. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, I guess a month or two months ago, you guys were talking about 40 to 60 immersion tools as your likely shipments in 2009. And I guess I was wondering, given what's transpired over the last four to six weeks, how has that number changed? And if so, where have you seen strength and/or weakness?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: We &#x2013; again, it is a bit related to what Nicolas was asking. So, first of all, we have no visibility as to the year itself. Anything can happen. As we said, it could be a U-curve type recession. So we have one or two extremely bad quarter, and then everybody gets exciting, because the Christmas season is not that bad and the world has recovered. And basically, if it is definitely a U-curve and we recover, and there will be a lot of immersion tool in Q3, Q4. But it could be the opposite and the world collapses further, because unemployment grows and etcetera, and things doesn't happen this way. So I don't know, but to answer the question about the 40 to 60, which was, I think, 65, this deal correspond to a &#x2013; in other words say, end of demand or simulated demand when world's come back.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: Yeah, perhaps I can maybe try to help you there under the circumstances, which of course you may understand it's quite difficult to do good predictions. But let me give you a bit of an idea. Now on the backlog we have 19 immersion systems, let's say around roughly 20, which is for customers where we have a high level of confidence they will ship those.</p>
          <p>Now, we've had &#x2013; one of the previous questions was, what if this reorganization, this restructuring of the Taiwanese DRAM industry actually happens, and what's the pent-up demand there, we have between 15 and 22, it's basically between 35 and 40 tools. On top of that, you could think of &#x2013; and I don't think about Logic or foundry, because like Eric said, Logic probably 2010. There are memory players that we wouldn't call first tier in terms of financial capability. Because there are a few that are actually in our backlog, which we feel pretty comfortable that we will be able to pay the bills.</p>
          <p>Now, if you add that to 15 to 20 pent-up demand from the Taiwanese DRAM foundry, then there are some other memory players, which could add to that. If they get access to some funding, which we have seen in Korea, which is not be in the order of backlog yet, but which could transpire into some level of orders for H2.</p>
          <p>You can quickly then come to this between 40 and 60 number? I think we can because what we have in the order backlog plus the pent-up demand in Taiwan. The range is already 235, 240. Now the other DRAM players place a few orders, could that be in that bracket, yes it could. Will that happen? I'm not sure. But we're just talking about potential out there.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; C.J. Muse: That's helpful. Can you comment on whether you've seen any push from the NAND side of things, relative to what your expectations were a couple of months ago?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: We have had, I think, the push, and I think we already said that at the last call during the warning. So, yes, a push have been happening. And I even understand that some Flash capacity has been transferred to DRAM. So the Flash capacity has also been scaled which is why we say, we think that we have been scaled down by 20%, and the DRAM capacity in general has been scaled down by 30%. But at this moment, in the past where there where two to three weeks of January, we are starting to understand that the Flash people are re-planning. That doesn't mean they are optimistic, don't misunderstand me, but there is a difference between pushing out and starting to say when do I buyback. So, the only thing I can tell you is, at this moment we are in the process of when-do-I-buyback-type activities with most of them.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; C.J. Muse: I guess my question was, relative to your pre-announcement, since then have things gotten worse or stabilized on the NAND side?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Stabilized.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; C.J. Muse: Okay. And if I could follow-up real quickly. On the EUV side, I think you are planning to ship in 2010. Can you talk about your current visibility there? And what your expectations are in terms of actual tools shipped in H1 2010?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: Well, in H1 2010, it's probably one issue or something. In H2, it's probably when we are in shift, the rest of the five. And as you know, we have five orders. These are pre-production, in a sense that they will be serving the purpose of building recipes for customers, that is technology. They would need about a year and a half, if not two for some customers to then be able to ramp full production. So, 2010 should be five, maybe 2011 should be another, whatever, five or so, which is the other set of customers making technology. And 2012 is when you start production.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; C.J. Muse: Very helpful, thank you.</p>
          <p>Analyst: Sandeep Deshpande &#x2013; JP Morgan</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Sandeep Deshpande: Hi, JP Morgan. Hi, just a quick word on H2. I mean given that you have a particular lead time, I mean, I've been led to believe within five to seven months on some of the lead, highly leading edge tools that you ship. I mean, even if the order intake starts improving in H2. I mean, can you comment Eric on how you see the ramp up of the shipments. And so is 2009, even if you see some pickup in H2, essentially a write-off in terms of actual shipments happening this year?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: I, unfortunately, I think we're going to try to tell the customers that, in view of a bit of a restructuring and push back on the supply chain, they should be reasonable and give us appropriate lead times. So, what is appropriate lead time? On an immersion tool, appropriate lead-time would be six months. But, I unfortunately believe that the curve is going to be 3 to 6. It's going to be, we &#x2013; so you cannot, you will not be able to read anything in Q1 in terms of order entry. The bookings number in Q1 maybe very small, maybe higher, but it's still part of the activities of wait and see. I don't see any bookings from Taiwan, because I know they are negotiating and they, their negotiating is good. But you can imagine that the Taiwanese type companies, when I say Taiwanese I mean the companies involved in the Taiwanese discussions are already telling us what they want in July. But this is not going to be orders.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: And Sandeep, but if clearly I mean, the inventories &#x2013; we do have significant inventories of stuff that we plan to be and to ship as leading edge. So we plan to ship a lot of immersion tools so there is the immersion inventory with us and within the chain, now clearly that has not all been assembled and integrated into new systems. But &#x2013; so that's why you cannot say we have an extremely short order lead time. But we're trying to educate customers also, saying, listen, if you want tools in let's say Q4, you'd better start thinking of giving us orders three to six months before, and we would be able to respond to a certain level, because yes, now like with this big downturn has not only put inventory on our balance sheet but also on those of our suppliers.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Sandeep Deshpande: And quickly in a follow-up. I mean, given that some of these &#x2013; I mean, you know what you've shipped to the leading edge DRAM companies for instance without naming names, but given that some of these tier-two, tier-three DRAM companies are likely to be bailed out or have their consolidation plans done by H2. I mean, do you have an idea of what percentage of DRAM being shipped by some of the leading companies next year will be in using immersions, which will force essentially these tier-two, tier-three companies to speed up their move to immersion, simply because otherwise they won't be able &#x2013; I mean, a bailout will not be meaningless essentially without being able to be competing with the leading edge players?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: That is a very good question. The way, however, the marketplace is where at this moment everybody has frozen, even the top tier types, because of the sudden drop, the no capacity needed, the loss of money, etcetera. So there is a sort of &#x2013; no, we've got to wait and read the market a bit. Your questions about how do some people take advantage of the others being down or being not capable of taking decision, I think this will be playing in the next three months. You have to give it a bit of a &#x2013; a bit more color into how bad the recession is.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: It also means that, I mean, on the top of everything also in addition to that your question saying yes, it is indeed true that you have to ask yourself the question, what is the use of a reorganization if you don't make that new company more cost-competitive, which actually means that the pent-up demand for the second or third tier must happen .</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Martin van den Brink: I think Sandeep's question was what was going to happen to the bigger guys who don't have to wait. And I'd say, at this moment, they are not taking advantage of the situation because the environment is so uncertain. But if the environment starts giving some positive news, and as you've heard that the price of DRAM and price of Flash are coming up, is why I'm starting to tell you that those large customers are starting to talk to us about planning. So in other terms, Sandeep, if you were in the DRAM business you would already probably move, but the others are waiting a bit and we cannot say that we will see the obvious going up or order going up in Q1 for Q2 delivery for instance. I think that would be much, much too early.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Sandeep Deshpande: Thank you, Peter and Eric.</p>
          <p>Analyst: Jonathan Crossfield &#x2013; Merrill Lynch</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Jonathan Crossfield: Yes, it's Banc of America/Merrill Lynch. The question I had was over the past five years, as you've mentioned Eric, we've seen transitions in NAND every 12 months, transitions in DRAM every 18 months. What is the chance do you think that over the next few years as we come out of this recession, the rate of technology transition changes in memory maybe slows down on a longer term basis?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Yes, that is an excellent question in a sense that that is the crux of our gross and profitability and market share and so on. So I don't think the customers will change the profile that is more technology you can develop, the more differentiation you have, the more you take market share and, as volume is fundamental for profit in this business, they will jump on every opportunity. So if the equipment vendors offer them the options of doing it they will do it, and if they have the financing to do this, they will.</p>
          <p>The only reason for a potential slowdown would be that products would not anymore make use of their chips. So in other terms a sort of an application slowdown. We used to say in the semiconductor industry that this will never happen. I think we have to be a bit less proud than that and we can &#x2013; it may always happen. We have to be looking into any signs of this. You've seen a bit of a sign of this in Flash when everybody thought that when you had a 2 gig you can go to 4, and when you have a 4 you can go to eight, and you have noticed that there is not as much business in the 4 gig than people expected it to be, well because it was an application failure. People thought that cameras and things could carry 4 gigs and in fact they don't. 2 gig is good enough or 1 gig is good enough et cetera. So clearly the application curve is a fundamental curve.</p>
          <p>Now, we are not a specialist here, so I'm not going to give you more than that, and you will be able to yourself see if there is an application gap or not. At this moment, that is why I mentioned that the solid state disk and the add on cards are giving me enough of a good feeling to justify 35 nano &#x2013; in fact 22 nano, to be honest, that is really where the thing is going to have to rush. After that I have no clue but as you know I am older now and my sons are not teenagers anymore so I have lost complete understanding of the latest and greatest gadget.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: And there is also evidence, by the way, Jonathan, by the fact that, when we talk to our leading-edge memory customers about their needs, they are adamant about their EUV level shrink needs. I mean, they don't back up.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Jonathan Crossfield: Right, okay. And then maybe, that's very helpful. Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up for you, Peter. On the balance sheet this quarter, there was a 50mm increase in gross debt. Now that didn't seem to come through the cash flow at all, so could you just explain where the other side of that?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: Yeah, the other side is on the other receivables part, that's the fair value of the interest rate swap that we have. Because we have the &#x2013; the bond has a fixed interest rate, which we swapped. And since the interest rates dropped, there is a big fair value there that is in the other receivables, the offset then needs to be included in your long-term liabilities line. So, really we have 600mm of debt and the rest is a fair value balance sheet adjustment.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Jonathan Crossfield: Very helpful, thank you.</p>
          <p>Analyst: Lee Simpson &#x2013; Jefferies &amp; Company, Inc</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Lee Simpson: Hi, good morning it's Lee saying good afternoon. It's Lee Simpson here from Jefferies. Most of my questions been answered, but if I can go back on some earlier questions, I mean given some of that DRAM and Flash price firming that that you are seeing and now a lot of the large customers are coming back and talk to you about new orders. I mean what sort of confidence can you give us at this stage, that Q1 2009 may be the actual order trough?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Good try Lee.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Lee Simpson: I had to give it a go.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Let me try and answer, it could or it could not.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Lee Simpson: Right. And if you had to prefer which side of that answer would you give?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: No, clearly we don't know.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Lee Simpson: Okay. No problem. I mean, as I understand from some of the earlier answers as well, it looks like you favor the restructuring in Taiwan, let's call it restructuring, playing out over the next three to six months, and then pent up demand in subsequent six months of something like 15 to 20 tools. Is that what you're trying to tell us here?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: Yes.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Yeah, for those guys. Yes.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Lee Simpson: For those guys. And on top of that, you're saying at this point the utilization at foundries is probably so low that the recovery to the sort of reorder point is not going to happen until 2010.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: Correct.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Lee Simpson: Right. That's all my questions. Thanks.</p>
          <p>Analyst: Odon de Laporte &#x2013; Cheuvreux</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Odon de Laporte: Yes, thank you for taking my question. This is Odon from Cheuvreux. I was wondering in the backlog, what is the weight of EUV, is there any EUV units is the backlog? Thank you.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: No. No EUV in the backlog, the orders have been taken before and at this moment, as I said, we have to deliver those than there will be orders taken some time in 2010. And after that you will have the ramp in 2011.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: The reason is we &#x2013; in our backlog, we only take up orders for a specific period of time i.e. 12 months. Beyond 12 months orders in the semiconductor industry are generally seen as a wet dream although whether you feed us that's not true. Those will happen.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Odon de Laporte: Okay. Thank you. And I have a follow-up. If I try to estimate sales in Q2, given that 41% of your backlog is shippable in H1, can we expect a level of at least 11mm euros of sales in Q2, is that fair to say that?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Yes, it is in a sense as I said that the current level of 180 to 200 is not sustainable at our customers' level. So we expect this to be an exceptional low number. Now this is going to be this for three months or six, I don't know. But lower than 180 to 200 is absolutely not in our expectation.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Odon de Laporte: Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>Analyst: Mehdi Hosseini &#x2013; Friedman Billings Ramsey</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Mehdi Hosseini: FBR Capital Markets. Eric, we've spent the past hour trying to figure out when the inflection in the bookings would take place, I want to move a step higher and just based on what you know of your customers, if you were to look at your backlog, how confident you are in the backlog as of the close of Q4, and do you see any probability that you may have to take some of the units out of the backlog because there is a probability that some of the units or the shipments may extend &#x2013; may be shipped in more than 12 months? And then I have one quick question for Peter, what is the new break-even point after all the restructuring taking place?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Okay, so Mehdi hi. No, we don't expect any cancellation or further postponement of the backlog or may be for one quarter to the other but mainly due to as we said logistics issue more than anything, we always have this type of activities. So the usual two to five per quarter is a moving target, but more than that not. Peter, what about...</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: Yeah the point is on slide 29 of the presentation. It says after restructuring it's approximately 450mm euros a quarter.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Mehdi Hosseini: 415mm euros?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: Yeah.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Mehdi Hosseini: 450?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: It's on slide 29.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: Okay.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Craig DeYoung: Operator, I think we have time for one last question, and I'd advise anybody of you are unable to get through, the IR team is available to try to fill in your knowledge and understanding gap. So, if you give us a call and again, feel free to call us. And operator, if we have one last call.</p>
          <p>Analyst: Jay Deahna &#x2013; JP Morgan</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Jay Deahna: Thank you very much. JPMorgan. Good afternoon.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: Hi, Jay.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Jay Deahna: Hi. The question I have relates to slide 13, on your handout, that's the slide titled Product Pipeline, and it illustrates the three different leading-edge products that you have. So, my question is, are those the products where the Brion holistic lithography options are available? Are they available on any other tools besides those three? And is the Brion holistic package sold as part of the core ASP of the product or is that sold as an add-on, it's in a sense an option that the customer could buy if they want it.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Okay. Yeah, this is good question. And this is how we create value. So, the holistic lithography package of product, one can be sold on their own. You don't need to buy any of our machines and clearly we have done this already at some level of sales, which is sub 100mm, but it is there.</p>
          <p>Second is, you can buy some hardware options, which are included into the machines and that will be the case of all of the products that you have on the page 11, which is the XT:1950, which will be, in fact, the first one to carry one fundamental piece of hardware. But, the NXT also will carry the piece of hardware &#x2013; sorry, I should correct myself, the NXT at this moment, there is not &#x2013; the EUV doesn't carry that.</p>
          <p>How do we sell these things? We sell these things in three ways depending on customer wish. One is, sometimes it's included in the price of the machine. Sometimes, it's included as a package. So you buy Litho Cruiser at the price of 1 or 2mm. And sometimes you sell a service, which is why, I use the term service and I should not, but a period of a six months to one year of common activity to find solutions like and optimization like matching of a &#x2013; the number of scanners to a number of designs. So we can do it three ways.</p>
          <p>So in other terms your question is timely, I will never yet &#x2013; I will not yet answer the following question, which is how many hundreds of millions of euro do we make with this business, it's a bit too early. But it is good to say that now we have three ways of selling, and we are starting to sell.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Jay Deahna: I guess another &#x2013; that's good, I appreciate that. Another way of looking at is, let's say, you take the XT:1950hi, okay, or the NXT, and you look at the kind of the base average selling price for the tool, and then you look at that tool fully configured with the holistic package with all the Brion offerings and what not. What would be the difference in the price? Do those add-ons increase it by, say, 10 or 15%, or is it something more than that?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: It could be in the orders of magnitude of 10%. Yes.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Jay Deahna: Okay. And are those offerings available on any of the products prior to the 1950?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: As I said, yes. But it would be less than 10%. It's &#x2013; these are products, which have a bit less impact, not so much because they are not linked to the product, but mainly because these products have less impact on node of lower category. So in other terms, it's nice to use Brion when you're trying to do something difficult. But when you try to do something simple, you don't need as much of the capability of Litho-plus.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Jay Deahna: And absolutely lastly, do you view these offerings as enhancing your sustained competitive advantage vs. your competition, because it looks like with every new generation now, there is a significant change in the complexity of the machine which historically has been good for ASML, this is an add-on to that. So, do you view this as kind of critical or very important to your sustained competitive advantage, these offerings?</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Yes, yes and yes. This is a fundamental part. We believe that with this options, we do things that the competition absolutely cannot do on two ways. One, our hardware itself is we think is stretchable to a level that the competition hasn't achieved as we know by history. We do a better overlay. We do a stronger, I would say, overall robustness that creates a better CD, and of course we have a higher throughput. The Brion tools clearly enable stretching the hardware. So because you stretch the hardware, you increase the competitiveness of the tool. In addition, these software stuff are also not provided by our competition. So we've got a significant competitive advantage towards through those products.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Peter Wennink: And also, Jay, I mean, it's not just the ASML marketing talk, I mean, there is a big logic maker in U.S. very openly talks about the device scaling through, what they call Source Mask Optimization, which is basically &#x2013; it can be helped even more than that it needs some of the features that are included in this product pipeline.</p>
          <p>Question &#x2013; Jay Deahna: All right, great. Okay, thanks very much.</p>
          <p>Answer &#x2013; Eric Meurice: Thank you.</p>
