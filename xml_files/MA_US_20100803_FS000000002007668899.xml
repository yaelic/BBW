          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to MasterCard's second quarter earnings conference call. My name is Jeremy and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. At this time, I would like to turn the presentation over your host for today's call, Ms. Barbara Gasper, head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today, either by phone or web cast, for a discussion about our second quarter 2010 financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; as well as Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, highlighting some key points about the business environment and our second quarter results, we will open up the call for your questions.</p>
          <p>This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. The earnings release and slide deck have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one week through August 10.</p>
          <p>Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filing.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Ajay Banga. Ajay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. I am pleased that we've got yet another good quarter to report this morning that highlights the solid fundamentals of our business. Before Martina gets into the details of the results, I thought I'd comment on some of the contributing drivers of the quarter, as well as some recent business highlights.</p>
          <p>So the second quarter we saw net revenue growth of 6.7% as reported and 7.9% on a constant currency basis. Gross dollar volume grew 8.5% on a local currency basis and Cross Border Volume grew 15.2%, both actually continuing their momentum from the first quarter. Processed transaction growth was basically essentially flat for the quarter due to the continued roll off of several U.S. and UK Debit portfolios that we have spoken of on past earnings calls with you. But if you exclude those deconversions, underlying transaction growth was around 10%.</p>
          <p>Our expense control efforts over the past year have allowed us to deliver an operating margin of 52.6% this quarter, a nine percentage point expansion over last year's second quarter. You put all this together and it helped fuel our net income growth of roughly 31% or 34% on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>Some of the progress we saw in the quarter can obviously be attributed to global macroeconomic improvements. And as a global company, we continue to see the non-U.S. markets becoming a bigger contributor to our businesses. Today, in fact, the international markets, the markets outside of the United States, account for 55% of our total revenue, up from about 50% just two or three years ago. As in the recent quarters, our volume growth outside the United States outpaced growth in the United States.</p>
          <p>The Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth, spurred on by I think the continued buoyancy in most economies in those regions. And of course, despite challenges in the European macroeconomic scenario, our volume growth in Europe continues to remain healthy. Both domestic and Cross Border Volumes are driving the growth in these regions. In the U.S. however, conflicting signals make it difficult to determine if we have moved into a period of real economic recovery. You've all seen the recent economic data around unemployment, retail sales, consumer confidence and the consensus seems to be that perhaps there will be some ups and downs with respect to economic recovery. This is reflected in our own consumer research and our spending pulse data as well.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, fine dining, luxury retail, furniture spend has been down in recent months. On the other hand, hotel and airline spend is up. So there are mixed signals here and consumers are likely to remain cautious until employment and housing in the U.S. show signs of sustainable improvement. And I guess they will just continue to look for ways to spend and budget smarter. You can see evidence of this in our own U.S. data. MasterCard's processed credit volume growth was up slightly in the second quarter, an improvement over the first quarter, but the pace of growth declined as we moved from April to June driven by consumer credit. However, processed debit volume growth remained constant at about 20% over the first two quarters of the year, excluding those portfolio deconversions we've talked about.</p>
          <p>While on the subject of the U.S. market, let me just briefly touch on a piece of the recently signed Financial Reform Act, specifically the Durbin Amendment. I know that everybody is eager to fully understand the impact on our business. But the truth is, we just have to wait for the Fed to develop the regulations and for our customers to react before we will know the full implications, both for the industry and for our company, MasterCard. We have spoken to the Fed. We will be working constructively with them as they move into the implementation phase to ensure that they have the necessary inputs to make an informed decision.</p>
          <p>Regardless of the outcome, we still believe the secular shift to electronic forms of payments will continue and that fundamentally U.S. consumers are not going to go back to cash and checks as a result of the Durbin Amendment. Going forward, issuers will need to decide how to meet their customers', their consumers' needs for payment products and we will be there to support that effort, whether it be with credit, charge, or prepaid products in addition of course, to debit. This new situation will present challenges, but I also believe it will present opportunities. And in the past, we as a company have certainly proven our ability to work through them with flexibility and with innovation. And as such, even now, we are exploring various strategies to address the different scenarios that could come about as the Fed goes through its decision-making.</p>
          <p>In the meanwhile, we are focused on executing our strategies around the globe. As I said earlier, the markets outside of the U.S., the global markets outside of the U.S., account for more than half of our net revenue and that percentage is growing. We are continuing to pursue many opportunities to grow electronic payments, pushing hard to deliver more convenience, more security for our customers and value for all of the other stakeholders.</p>
          <p>I thought I'd take a few moments to highlight a few recent news items. Just yesterday, we announced an expansion of our existing relationship with Telef&#xF3;nica, the leading telecomm company in Latin America, to include a co-brand deal of Movistar, their leading Mobile brand. MasterCard will be the exclusive brand on Movistar co-branded credit cards issued in 11 countries, adding to the two in place in Chile and Brazil already. In addition, we will also process the transactions in the majority of these issuing markets.</p>
          <p>We've also recently announced a joint venture with Smart Communications to build a Mobile Payment infrastructure, kind of like a Mobile Gateway, starting in Brazil for our customers that will give consumers access to mobile payments. In China, we launched MoneySend with the Bank of China, so now consumers in China can receive money transfers for friends and family outside of the country. China, by the way, marks the 19th market where MasterCard MoneySend is now enabled.</p>
          <p>Sberbank, the largest retail bank in Russia, is actually upgrading its passbook savings accounts to include a Maestro Debit Card, which will act as the primary tool for consumers to access online and mobile banking. Since this program was started in mid-2009, it has yielded 1.3 million upgrades last year and continues to generate similar results this year. They also just launched a MasterCard branded credit card co-branded with MTS, a leading Russia Telco, on the MasterCard platform are starting the rollout of the Maestro Momentum Cards.</p>
          <p>Here in the U.S., I'm pleased that Citi will be leveraging our inControl platform to bring Citi's consumer cardholders increased control, security and budgeting capabilities. And, in fact, this is the first consumer application of inControl in the U.S. market. We also expanded our PayPass Transit pilot in New York City beyond the original Lexington Avenue subway line in collaboration with the MTA, the Port Authority and the New Jersey Transit to basically make commuting faster and easier.</p>
          <p>This expanded six-month pilot now includes PATH trains, as well as some New York City and NJ TRANSIT bus routes. It's the first payment system to link all three transit agencies, replacing the need for riders to carry specific fare cards for each transit system and, of course, also enables the rider to transfer between systems. Our development of a differentiated solution that allows authorization at the turnstile to take place faster was a critical factor in winning this trial.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on page three of the deck, which shows our reported results. As Ajay said, we are very pleased to deliver another good quarter of solid financials. Net revenue grew 6.7% over last year's second quarter to 1.4 billion. On a constant currency basis, net revenue grew 7.9%. This revenue growth was primarily driven by a 15.2% increase in Cross Border Volume and an 8.5% increase in gross dollar volume on a local currency basis. Additionally, pricing contributed approximately four percentage points to net revenue growth, including the effect of Cross Border rebates.</p>
          <p>All of these positive factors on net revenue were somewhat offset by additional rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed customer agreements, as well as rebates, related to higher volume. Operating expenses declined 10.4% versus last year's second quarter, primarily as a result of lower severance, as well as savings due to reduced head count. Our operating income was $717 million for the quarter and resulted in an operating margin of 52.6%, a 9.1 percentage point improvement over the year ago quarter. We delivered net income of 458 million, or $3.49 per diluted share, up roughly 31% over the second quarter of 2009 and 34% on an FX adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>Turning to page four, we are seeing stronger performance across a number of business drivers, including continued strong volume growth similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Cross Border Volume growth year-over-year was the strongest it had been since the third quarter of 2008. Worldwide Gross Dollar Volume, or GDV, was up 8.5% on a local currency basis in the second quarter and grew 9.8% on a U.S. dollar converted basis to 656 billion. U.S. GDV was down 0.5%.</p>
          <p>While not yet a return to positive growth, this is another quarter of sequential improvement compared to a decline of 1.1% in the first quarter of this year. Across the rest of the world, GDV continued to grow a healthy 14.5% on a local currency basis.</p>
          <p>Worldwide Credit GDV grew 6.1% on a local currency basis. This was also the strongest growth rate we have seen since mid-2008. It was helped by U.S. Credit GDV growth, which was down only low single digits, its best performance in two years. Credit GDV for the rest of the world grew 9.8% on a local currency basis.</p>
          <p>Worldwide Debit GDV grew 13.2% on a local currency basis. This was against a strong comparison of 13.1% growth in the second quarter of last year. In the U.S., Debit GDV volume grew 0.8% and debit growth for the rest of the world was 29%, primarily driven, once again, by growth in our Asia Pacific / Middle East / Africa region.</p>
          <p>On a local currency basis, worldwide Purchase Volume grew 7.9%. Cross Border Volume growth on a local currency basis was up 15.2%. We saw double-digit growth in Asia Pacific / Middle East / Africa, primarily driven by activity in Australia, China, and Korea. As a matter of interest to some of you, we saw a noticeable increase in travel into South Africa for the World Cup and volumes were up 79% in June year-over-year on a local currency basis. We also saw double-digit Cross Border Volume growth in Europe and in Latin America.</p>
          <p>Looking at Process Transactions, they were roughly flat, about 0.1% compared to the year-ago quarter to 5.6 billion. In Asia Pacific / Middle East / Africa and Latin America Process Transactions continued to grow at double-digit rates, offset by deconversions of portfolios in the U.S. and UK.</p>
          <p>The number of MasterCard branded cards worldwide was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis at 944 million cards at the end of the quarter. Excluding the U.S., card issuance grew 7% versus the second quarter of 2009, demonstrating the continued growth opportunities for MasterCard from the secular shift from cash to electronic payment forms. As of June 30, 2010 there were approximately 1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards issued globally.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to page five to discuss the components of revenue and their performance relative to last year's second quarter. Domestic Assessments increased 11%, due to increased volumes and the impact of 2009 and 2010 price increases, partially offset by the repeal of some European pricing beginning in July 2009. Cross Border Volume fees increased by 34.5%. More than half of the $120 million increase was due to our October 2009 pricing adjustment. The remainder was primarily due to Cross Border Volume growth, which was up 15.2% on a local currency basis.</p>
          <p>Transaction Processing Fees increased 6%. Pricing contributed approximately two percentage points of growth, primarily due to U.S. pricing changes which were implemented in mid-April 2009. Additionally, we had a one-time benefit from the implementation of new authorization parameters. As I said before, Process Transactions were essentially flat in the quarter and continued to be affected by the loss of certain debit portfolios. Excluding the loss of these portfolios, Process Transactions grew approximately 10%. However, revenue growth for these line items was impacted less, due to the pricing of the portfolios that are rolling off.</p>
          <p>Other Revenues decreased 5.2%, primarily driven by lower compliance and research fees. All of this resulted in an increase of 204 million, or 12.6% in gross revenue. For the quarter, Rebates &amp; Incentives grew 119 million. Approximately 55 million of this increase was due to rebates associated with last October's revised Cross Border pricing structure. The remainder was attributed to new and renewed customer agreements, as well as rebates related to higher volume. Overall Rebates &amp; Incentives represent 25.3% of gross revenue, versus 21.2% in last year's second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to page 6 for some detail on expenses. During the second quarter, total operating expenses decreased 10.4% and within total operating expenses, General and Administrative expenses decreased 14.5%. The decrease was primarily due to lower personnel expense was down $83 million and lower severance drove roughly half of this decrease. The remainder was primarily due to reduced head count, following personnel actions taken in 2009, although we are adding talent in growth areas such as E-commerce, Mobile and Prepaid. Both Advertising &amp; Marketing spend and Depreciation &amp; Amortization were roughly flat for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to the cash flow statement and balance sheet highlights on page seven, we generated 343 million in cash from operations in the second quarter, primarily driven by operating income, partially offset by litigation settlement payments. And we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of $3.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our thoughts for 2010, but before I get into that let me just give you an update of what we have seen for MasterCard Processed Volumes for the third quarter through July 28. Our Cross Border Volumes grew approximately 15% globally, which is pretty much the same as the growth rate in the second quarter. The Asia Pacific region continues to demonstrate the strongest growth, while the U.S. saw a little bit of softening, although it still remains positive. Although not a perfect proxy for GDV, total U.S. Processed Volume growth, which was about 1% positive in the second quarter, was down about 2% in July, slightly lower than the month of June, due to the continued roll off of the two Debit portfolios. If you were to exclude the impact of those Debit portfolios, total U.S. Processed Volume growth was almost 7% in both June and July.</p>
          <p>U.S. Credit Processed Volume is trending flat in July, verses the growth of about 1% in the second quarter. And U.S. Debit Processed Volume growth, which was about flat for the second quarter, is now trending down 5% in July, but was up 21% when you exclude the tempering effect of the Debit roll off. And in July, total Processed Volume growth for the rest of the world continued at a similar pace to what we saw in the first and second quarters, or about 13%. Globally, Processed Transaction growth was just slightly negative, including the impact of the four Debit portfolio roll offs and almost 12% growth, excluding that impact.</p>
          <p>Now let's get into the thoughts for 2010, and the following represents our current view, obviously, on a constant currency basis. We continue to believe that we could see some tempering in top-line growth in the second half of 2010 relative to the 9.7% growth we've seen in the first half, due to the following factors: The first, we begin to experience tougher comps. Given the signs of the economic recovery began to show in the second half of 2009, in particular in the fourth quarter. Also the pace of recovery, at least in the U.S., remains uncertain. Second, the roll off of a few Debit portfolios will continue to dampen our Processed Transaction growth. It now appears that the WaMu deconversions would be more concentrated in the second and third quarters than initially thought. As a result, we now expect that this revenue will roll off faster than originally anticipated and our as reported Processed Transaction growth will bottom out in the third quarter, not in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And we continue to expect Contra, as a percentage of gross revenue, to average 26 to 27% for the full year, likely at the high end of the range, given the deal volume we have seen in our current expectations for Cross Border Volume growth. Additionally, we now expect to see some impact of our new SunTrust deal in the Contra line in Q3. However, Contra as a percentage of gross revenue will still be highest in Q4 due to the normal seasonality of Rebates &amp; Incentives.</p>
          <p>Overall, we continue to anticipate our total operating expenses for 2010 will be flat to slightly down from 2009 levels, including severance charges. As I said before, some of the savings obtained from our 2009 severance actions are being reinvested back into the business areas, such as E-commerce, Mobile and Prepaid, as well as some additional marketing efforts in the second half.</p>
          <p>Turning to the components of our operating expenses, we continue to expect G&amp;A to be down from 2009 levels, including severance, and while we are currently forecasting Advertising &amp; Marketing to be up, at most by mid-single digits from our full year 2009 spend, we will continue to reevaluate our plans, depending on how we see the economic recovery taking hold. We also expect the quarterly spend to increase sequentially over the third and the fourth quarters. And as we said before, we continue to assume an effective tax rate of 34.5% for 2010.</p>
          <p>Now finally, we remain committed to our objectives for the 2009 to 2011 period of annual margin expansion of three to five percentage points and average annual net income growth of 20 to 30%.</p>
          <p>Remember, while all of our objectives are on a constant currency basis, our as reported numbers include the impact of foreign exchange. This represented about a 1% headwind to net revenue in the second quarter and we expect that headwind to increase to three to four percentage points if current exchange rates, particularly the euro, hold for the balance of the year. Recall that the euro averaged about 1.45 for the second half of 2009 verses its current level of about 1.30.</p>
          <p>Despite some mixed signals around the U.S. economic recovery, economic growth for the rest of the world is improving. Additionally, the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong. This enabled us to deliver a good quarter and, as we work through the challenges of some Debit roll offs, we also have new business wins, such as SunTrust and others that we have yet to announce that will begin to contribute later this year. Remember that some contracts incentives for new business are recognized early on and only over time you will see the full contribution to net revenue. In total, we believe we can deliver a solid year for 2010 in line with our overall longer-term objectives.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, ma'am. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And ladies and gentlemen, your first question comes from the line of Adam Frisch with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Barbara. One question is going to be tough for me, but a lot of ways we can go here. I guess the one place I'd like to go, just given it's the most topical, is the Mobile opportunity. Yesterday's reaction in the stocks from the Bloomberg article suggested a pretty negative outcome for you and your largest competitor, so it's hard not to imagine you working with the largest wireless networks at some point but can you talk about, Ajay, what you're doing here, maybe why we should feel a little less concerned that you're not going to be successful in the Mobile opportunity? And then, maybe expand on a couple of other growth opportunities that you're excited about that we might see impacting the P&amp;L in the next 12 months or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Adam. Well, the first part, the Mobile part, I'm not going to comment on whether that pilot is actually happening or not, because none of the actual players in the pilot are confirming what they are doing, so that's not what I'm going to go down the path of, but I will tell you this. MasterCard has been partnering with mobile carriers, with handset manufacturers and with banks for many years now globally to launch a bunch of NFC, these contactless payment trials  with PayPass Mobile payment tags, person-to-person money transfer services, iPhone Smartphone apps.</p>
          <p>They're all helping to get this Mobile commerce opportunity to come true. In fact, I counted up. We've got close to 20 pilot and commercial rollouts around the globe, as we speak. And I'll give you a few examples for you to understand where I'm coming from. In the UK, Barclays and Orange and MasterCard are the ones working on a similar contract less mobile payments NFC-based technology to pay for goods and services at retailers. There is the PayPass terminal that has been used.</p>
          <p>In Turkey, on the other hand, we partner with Garanti Bank and with Avea, which is a leading local mobile operator, to pioneer these mobile NGC payments and, in that case, it was using an antenna attached to the Sim card. In June, in the U.S., Citi has announced the launch of MasterCard PayPass tags available for the majority of their credit cards. You can stick that sticker at the back of your mobile device and use it at any of the PayPass-enabled merchants that exist.</p>
          <p>We have also announced a partnership with Bank of Montreal and RIMM, Research In Motion, to bring mobile payments to Blackberry Smartphones through a similar MasterCard PayPass technology. We've got programs in Brazil. We've got programs in India. We've got programs in Korea. We've got programs in and Singapore. We've got Mobile MasterCard MoneySend Service, which is an easy way to transfer money from person to person using the mobile phone or an Internet browser. You can also use us to pay for purchases. It also allows small nontraditional merchants to accept electronic payments. We've got MoneySend apps for the iPhone and the Blackberry. We've even got a app for the iPhone App Store where we offer Mobile Commerce apps, including the new MasterCard MarketPlace Overwhelming Offers app.</p>
          <p>So I have a great deal of confidence that these companies are playing, we and others, are playing actively in the Mobile Payment space. I have no doubt that, while the business model for Mobile Payments is yet to be proven in a tangible way across the world, I have no doubt that it will get proven in some form through these various experiments and trials. That I have no doubt on.</p>
          <p>You will find us putting a lot of energy and effort, including these ones I just gave you an example of, including what we just did as simply as a co-brand card with Telef&#xF3;nica, which could open up all kinds of opportunity for prepaid cards and other things we could do with similar phone companies around the world. I just think that one announcement of an unconfirmed pilot in the United States makes me somewhat cautious about jumping to conclusions about the role that different companies will play in the space.</p>
          <p>I also believe that finally the phone partners, the mobile carriers, the handset manufacturers, banks, people like us, what we need is an Open Payment system. What you do not need is a payment system that is built off one brand. Even our MTA trial that I spoke about in New York, while right now it's a trial using us, eventually we actually expect in a short period of time, for that, if it works out, to become a brand-agnostic trial, where we may have the advantage of processing more of the transactions because our technology approves those transactions at the turnstiles faster, but it will be brand-agnostic. And so to me, I think the real development of growth in Mobile Commerce requires that kind of way of approaching the opportunity. And I have full confidence and faith that we will be very much a part at the center of that developing those new generation of mobile phone payments. So, that's where I am with it.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. I just would be interested in getting a little color on some of your conversations with the Fed. We've heard B of A come out with some thoughts, there were some pretty significant cuts in interchange. So would be interested in just what you've been hearing from the Fed? And then secondly on timing, when do you think we'll get some idea on what the Fed's thinking for sure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, we've been talking to the Fed, as I said. So have the others. And our talks with them, our meetings with them are very constructive. We are trying to make sure that they get all of the information they need, all the facts they need to be able to actually assess what they've been asked to do nine months from the date of the signing of the bill which is the actual setting of what should be these new Debit Interchange levels. And they have 12 months to actually come out with clarity around the exclusivity angle of the Debit card branding. I have every expectation they are going to meet their dates. And frankly, what we are discussing with them is not something I'm going to discuss openly on a conference call because that would be an inappropriate thing to do. But it's a very practical open conversation with full data and full information that we plan to give them.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could you give us a sense of where we are in the process for the roll off of account losses for each of the customers? And just looking ahead for the next few years, do you guys have any major contract renewals? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sanjay, in terms of the roll off, we are fairly far through a number of the roll offs, in particular the UK portfolios and, as we just said on the earnings call, we are also relatively far through the WaMu roll off. We have some more cards left to roll off in the third quarter, and that's why we're saying that we're actually going to bottom out from a transaction point of view and from a transaction growth point of view, a degradation point of view, in the third quarter. And then we're going to go into a bit more of a normalized fashion into the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So by the end of the year, we will be pretty much done. We don't expect that our results will be impacted in 2011 and, in terms of major contracts that are coming on board, really the one that we've been talking about now for a while is the SunTrust contract and there, we said earlier and early in the year that we wouldn't think that we have in fourth quarter the roll on accelerating that. The roll on will be coming on in the third quarter now and so hopefully we'll be up and running in the latter part of the fourth quarter with some contribution to our net revenues.</p>
          <p>In terms of major renewals for the near future, we don't really have any major renewals for the next couple of years. We do know that there's an opportunity in 2011 for another customer, which we will be going after. But besides that, I think we feel fairly comfortable on where we are.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the Cross Border Contra revenue, the Rebates &amp; Incentives? Martina, are we going to effectively lap those pricing adjustments at the end of '10 and then normalize in '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, as you know, we have the Cross Border pricing showing up in our gross revenues as well as in our Contra revenues. And we did implement, Andrew, as you know, October 1 of last year, those kind of changes. So in the fourth quarter, we will be lapping those price movements, albeit what I just would just like to make sure that you understand in 2011 and going forward, it really depends on how Cross Border Volume growth is going to behave. So you might, depending on how much it will grow, you might see some impact still year-over-year on the growth line as well as on the Contra line and net-net, as we said before, we expect that there will be only a slight contribution to overall net revenue, positive contribution to overall net revenue.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I just wanted to ask for, a bit off topic, an update on SEPA, with all of the turmoil in Europe, if there has been any movement on that or if that's been pushed to the back burner for now? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Well, no, actually SEPA is exactly where it was and it's still online and they're making steady progress. In fact, in a number of countries, in Germany we've now got the fourth bank to become a Maestro exclusive issuer, which is Dresdner-Cetelem. They're actually migrating close to 0.75 million cards from their local Debit card <mark type="inaudible" /> processor. We've got in France, we have begun processing domestic MasterCard transactions for the first time with the launch of what I talked about in the last call, the Carrefour retailer card as well as ARCO so there's a bunch of these happening.</p>
          <p>We've got Debit MasterCards now in all four Nordic countries. We are launching the product in Ireland, Turkey, Greece, UK, Poland. And in April, we actually have mandated e-commerce support for all 300 plus million Maestro Cards in Europe, which I think will enormously help with the utilization of these cards for e-commerce.</p>
          <p>And on the competitive acquiring front, domestic transactions on these cards issued with the Maestro logo are actually starting to be routed through our network if an acquirer or merchant chooses to do so. So we are seeing an incremental volume from that. It's still small numbers, but it's early days in the game, but all in all, I don't think the so-called macroeconomic scenario in Europe has changed any of the on the ground desire and reality to go forward with the thinking behind SEPA.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Martina, I appreciated the more detailed color about the impact of foreign exchange. If you could revisit what you said again and also the band that you had described for the euro, 1.30 to 1.45, I think, if you could repeat that again, I'd appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. So basically, what we said is in the second quarter we had about a 1% headwind on foreign exchange. So this is really isolating the euro and the real and the movement of that. And if these were to stay at the euro at around 1.30 and you compare that to the year ago second-half euro rate, which was around 1.45, we do believe that we are going to have a bit of an increased headwind of about three to four percentage points.</p>
          <p>Again, it depends on which quarter you are going to be, but for the second half in total, it's about three to four percentage point. I just also would like to reiterate the rule of thumb that we really give to everybody in terms of looking at our euro exposure. We really say for every $0.01 move that the euro moves versus the dollar, that net revenues is impacted by 9 to $11 million. And then on the operating expense line, the move impacts about 4 to $5 million. So on the operating income line, you have about a move of 5 to $6 million and that should allow you to extrapolate, depending on what kind of exchange rates you assume for the rest of the year where our results could be coming in from an as reported basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's really helpful. And then, if I could just follow up with a related international question. One of your competitors on their conference call had referenced long-term targets of generating 50% of their revenue internationally. Since you are already disproportionately international, could you describe your long-term objectives, what percentage and acceleration of your exposure will come from your international portfolio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first of all, I'm not sure the right word would be disproportionately exposed, because I think that's just the reality of the world and what's going on with the economic growth around the world. We have 55% of our revenue comes from markets outside of the United States and I'm not sure that's an unfortunate or disproportionate part of it.</p>
          <p>As for the second part of the question where we are going, we've got Investor Day coming up in September. Why don't we wait to have a conversation that day? I'm not sure yet whether I want to necessarily set up a target to go there. I'd much rather go where markets are growing and if markets happen to grow faster for the next five years overseas, I would love to see faster growth there. If the U.S., on the other hand, comes out of its current cycle into a good economic recovery, I'll celebrate that, as well.</p>
          <p>So I'm not sure that setting up a target for where I want to get my business from is as useful as setting up a target to make sure that I am present at the forefront of trying to bring business where it goes. I'd rather talk about that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I understand that it's going to take some time to get a handle on any affect from the Durbin Amendment, but it might be helpful to provide us with a little bit of color of the revenue yield of the U.S. Debit business so we can get a feel for the economics -- a little better feel for the economics. I don't want to expect something exact but maybe some kind of a ballpark feel for that would be helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, it's Martina. First of all, as we all know, it's far too early to be really drawing any type of conclusions in terms of what the Durbin Amendment does, given all the interpretation that the Fed has to do. But in a very predominant way, what was featured in the Durbin Amendment was really related to interchange fees and, as you know, while we interchange a transaction, that is not our revenue. So we are basically handling the interchange fee from the acquirer to the issuing community. And again, I can only tell you, it's very, very difficult for us without the interpretations to understand how the environment, the payment environment in total will really be impacted, how the banks will specifically be impacted.</p>
          <p>Of course, we are all seeing the announcements and expecting that there will be some decrease to their interchange revenues, but then to extrapolate to what that means for the individual payment networks would be too premature to do at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Good morning. Real quickly, we talk a lot about the numbers that could be at risk related to Durbin and what not, but can you just maybe frame, Ajay, for us the mitigation efforts and some of the strategy that you guys are going through right now as you think about what the Fed could do? What are the levers to potentially offset any moves by the Fed that could impact volumes or your overall business and I guess, just relatedly to that as well, as we look at the credit card accounts on file declining still, how are you guys thinking about that in terms of also mitigating future lack of growth on the Credit Card side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure you can conclude that there will be a future lack of growth on the Credit Card side, first of all. Given all of the change that will happen, one of the things that could well happen is that the pattern of spend changes from one kind of card used to another kind, depending on what kind of consumer incentives get developed over time by issuers or by merchants as they respond to where the Fed comes out on its thinking around these rules. So I'm not sure I could conclude that credit card spend will necessarily decline over time. I'm not even sure I could conclude that debit card spend would decline because it would depend on where the interchange number settles down, how the debit card plays a critical or noncritical role in the strategy of retail banks to get DDAs through the door, which they need for relatively low-cost funding.</p>
          <p>So you're asking me to conjecture on 100 different permutations and combinations and we're working our way through those. I'm not going to do that conjecturing. But I will tell you this. If you go by what happened in Australia, then you know that what will happen here is that banks will relook at their economic model. They will look at pricing. They are already seeing motion on the so-called -- let's say, the soon to happen demise of free checking is how people are speculating. I don't know if that's true, but I can see some movement on that.</p>
          <p>You're going to see efforts by the issuers to drop off costs. They'll go for electronic servicing. They will probably look at their loss programs and you're going to see efforts to cross sell to the DDA even stronger, more enhanced because that is the only where you can afford that DDA account. You're going to find every bank and us and Visa and everybody else working with regulators to make sure that the pricing costing of a transaction includes the fair compensation for technology, for fraud, for security, for privacy, plus a margin for the capital invested.</p>
          <p>I think those are the kind of conversations you're going to see. Beyond that, conjecting how the market will shake out and how we'll respond, we just have to be sensible over the next few months. I firmly believe what I said earlier. There will be challenges, but there will be opportunities and I've said this in a less than &#x2013; in a somewhat more joking way, this is one time when I am probably grateful for not having had the highest market share in Debit in the United States.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's really your conclusion, buddy, to draw. I am still waiting to see how the Fed comes through an understanding of what constitutes the amendment they'd like to put in. If you looked at the language in the Durbin Amendment, the plain language requires that an issuer of debit card must access at least two unaffiliated Debit networks. The Fed's got to interpret whether one of those is a signature PIN, whether they've got one of one, one of the other, two of each, two of the other. I have no idea. I don't know how to put that out there yet, so we're going to see how that goes and then I'll have a more considered view for you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask you another quick one then on prepaid. If you can give us a sense, I don't know if it can be quantitative at this point, but what kind of growth are you seeing in prepaid, maybe parse out U.S. and non-U.S. at least qualitatively to give investors a sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great question. I think prepaid is a huge opportunity. And the market size is the largest today in the United States, largest by far, not just by a small amount. The fact it has many things built into it, everything from what the Social Security Administration is planning to do. Actually, I think we talked about this on the last earnings call, but what they're planning to do is that by 2013, every single payment from the Social Security Administration will either go by direct deposit to a bank account that the receiver has or by a direct load onto a prepaid card that the receiver must then have.</p>
          <p>It so happens that we've got a great program in place to be the supplier of those prepaid cards through direct access in Comerica. And so that's one of the things that's driving prepaid as a space. The Prepaid Card space has a got a large component of consumer reloadable, general purpose cards, a large component of what the government will provide, which is the example I just gave you, a fairly large component dedicated to payroll and corporate payroll and the like and then a much smaller component dedicated to gift cards. And in fact, gift cards are what everybody talks about but, in fact, the economics of a gift card are very different from the other three. Because the gift card is a one-time load of an average of 70 to $80 each time in the U.S., whereas a Social Security Card, 1 million of which are already in circulation, by the way, have a load of somewhere between 700 &#x2013; $800 a month. And if a person stays on that payment for a year, you're talking about $9,600 of load, compared to 70 or $80 of load on a gift card.</p>
          <p>So the economics are very different and we are very focused on the government payroll and consumer general purpose reloadable. There is obviously a lot of growth still to happen outside of the U.S. I think the Telef&#xF3;nica deal, as an example, is a great way to think about consumers who may possess phones, but may not possess formalized bank accounts and formalized credit cards as a way of entering into a whole new space. There are similar opportunities with the accord JV that we signed in Europe where we look at meal vouchers and company benefit payments that come onto prepaid cards. There's opportunities of mobile payments in Latin America that we're exploring and doing a lot of work with. There's similar things in Asia, from India to other locations. So I am very interested and intrigued by what prepaid could do and how it could be a way of getting so many under banked, not just on banked, people to participate in the payment system. And that's where our effort and energy is going, Jason.</p>

          <p>Sure, Don, the DOJ has been in contact with us for quite a while on this CID. It goes back to October 2008. In fact, if you go back to our Q's from that time onward, you'll find us talking about it consistently, including in the latest Q. The fact is, we are working with them and cooperating with them for all of the information they are looking for. As you heard on a different call, this is not directed exclusively at one payments network. It's part of an overall investigation of the merchant rules, not the interchange. The merchant rules, the POS rules, of several U.S. payment card network players. It's got to do with all the accepted rules. So I'm not going to comment on communications with the government regulator. As I said, that's for the Fed. That's not what I do. What I can comment on is in my public filings. All I can tell you is we are actually having a very constructive dialogue with them and that's where we are today.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is there, I guess as an investor, is there any risk around that business practices or would it be the type of thing where it is pretty marginal no matter what comes out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's tough for me to conclude until I know what the DOJ is thinking but I have no reason to believe that the DOJ investigation has anything of any magnitude that I would be, so to speak, concerned about today. That is today. They've got rules. They've got POS acceptance rules. Tomorrow, if they change the POS acceptance rules in a way that makes it a different business model then, yes, over a period of time, it will have an impact. But I don't know any way that I have any more information to you than where that is today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that clarity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question will be from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Ajay, I like your joke about being glad about your low Debit market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, don't take it serious. Mine is the only one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On that note, do you view the Durbin Amendment as opening certain doors to share gain opportunities in the U.S. Debit business and I guess, more specifically on that, could you give us any examples of new strategies that you're entertaining in order to respond to whatever your expected case scenario is related to the Durbin Amendment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as I said, there is not one expected case scenario for the Durbin Amendment. There is actually a series of multiple options that could settle on, depending on how the Fed, which has been tasked with studying this, actually comes to conclusion over the next nine months in the case would be interchange numbers and 12 months in the case would be other provisions around exclusivity. So there is no way for me to give you one verses the other and I doubt that even on Investor Day in September, we're going to know much more by then about which way the Fed is leaning or thinking.</p>
          <p>But I would say this to you, does if open up opportunities? I think it opens up both opportunities and challenges depending on which side of the table the Fed comes out on. And my perspective is that when you have a lower market share, us as well as other players, whatever changes in the game will give us an opportunity to be nimble and respond to it. Having said that, the larger market share players will fight as hard as they can to hold onto their market share. So this is going to be one of those market changing movements that I don't yet know how to predict, but I am very confident that I will find opportunities through this for us to keep doing well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, one scenario is you have an opportunity to get your brand on Visa branded exclusive cards. And I guess my question is, why would that not be a big opportunity from a share gain perspective and opportunity that you've not seen in a long time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, if that scenario were to come true, if the Fed were to interpret it exactly as you just said, I would completely agree with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you be willing to lower price to attract merchant routing decisions your way in order to gain that share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, hypothetical question, chief. I don't answer hypothetical questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. We'll talk at Analyst Day. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question will be from the line of Tom McCrohan [Janney Montgomery Scott]. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ajay, do you have any thoughts about Chip and PIN technology coming to the United States and any thoughts about what you view to be the total fraud cost in the system including issuers, merchants and consumers? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a great question. I'm not sure that Chip and PIN technology in the United States is a definite in the next foreseeable period of time, unless it gets legislated. That's a different thing. But where it is today, the cost of actually rolling out the acceptance network, as well as re-issuing all those cards, is so many multiples of any fraud cost benefit that I think the economic rationale for doing that would become very challenging. And in this current environment where so many other revenue lines for a bank are under pressure, given the moving target of the Financial Reform bill from what's going on with capital to what's going on with revenue streams in their trading book and in their investment banking book, in their consumer banking book, I don't know that a lot of our clients would consider that to be priority number one today. That's just the reality of where it is. So that's where it is today. I'm not sure that you'll see a great deal of movement on that in the foreseeable future in the U.S.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeremy, I think we have time for one last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Your final question will be from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you give an update on the Merchant Litigation case and, Ajay, I heard you mention charge cards in your prepared remarks on Durbin as an option for issuers and I'm curious if you see a revival in growth for charge cards in the U.S.? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Tien-tsin. I'm not sure yet that I can comment definitively about charge cards revival. That's just one of the options that I think that if I were an issuer today, which I'm not, but I was a little while ago, I would be thinking very carefully through different ways of finding relatively low risk methodologies of making sure that I can help give my consumers the right kind of tool and yet protect my revenue stream. So that's one of the ways people would look at it but I don't know for sure that I can tell you that a lot of people are going to come and jump at it tomorrow.</p>
          <p>As far as the Merchant Interchange Litigation is concerned, nothing new. The Court heard oral arguments on the plaintiff's motions for certification and the defendant's motions to dismiss in November '09. That decision is still awaited. The parties are participating in a confidential mediation. I have no idea if it will be successful or not. And no trial date has been set up, so there is nothing new on that Merchant Litigation from what we discussed the last time we spoke.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks for the update.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And at this time, I would like to hand the call back to Ajay Banga for his closing comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for all the questions and let me leave you with just a few closing thoughts. Over the shorter term, both the economy, as we discussed in the U.S. in particular, and the regulatory front represent some challenges. However, MasterCard, I think, has demonstrated over the years that it can find its way through these challenges. And on the business front, Martina and I both talked about the fact that we've lost a few debit contracts over the last couple of years that are now only beginning to work their way through our financials. We've also won a few great deals in Debit and the emerging Payment space that I think will begin to contribute later this year, but it will contribute much more in the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>We also worked very hard to control expenses to manage through the impact of the recent global economic slowdown and still trying to put money in investing in future growth. Again, as Martina mentioned, we are putting some of the savings into E-commerce, Mobile, Prepaid, that kind of space. I'm still very optimistic about our future growth prospects. We do business in 210 countries today. And the majority of our revenues come from outside of the United States, which as of now are showing faster growth.</p>
          <p>At any given time, I'm going to have challenges in some markets and opportunities in many more. Our global structure, our global construct I think contributes to our resilience through cycles and, frankly, to my expectations for long-term growth of our business, as I firmly believe that Payments is and will remain a growth industry, due to the continued secular trend to electronic payments. The underlying fundamentals of our business remain intact and we are also innovating in order to be best positioned to take advantage of these growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>That's why I'm very excited to be here. I'm very excited to be leading this company and this team and, once again, thank you for your time today. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on September 15. And we'll continue the discussion about our business and the strategy for our future. Thanks again.</p>
