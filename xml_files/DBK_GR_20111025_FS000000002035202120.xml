          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 Conference Call of Deutsche Bank. I am your operator for this conference. Please note that for the duration of the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Joachim M&#xFC;ller, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Yes, good morning from Berlin. Welcome to our Third Quarter Conference Call. You will find all of our documents on the website. Just like to note that the cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements at the end of the presentation we'll use this morning are on the back of the pack.</p>
          <p>So, let's kick off. Our CFO, Stefan Krause, will lead you through the presentation pack as usual. We'll try to finish within an hour, so there's enough time for you guys to join other conference calls this morning.</p>
          <p>With that, I hand over to Stefan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Joachim and good morning from Berlin to everybody, as well. Sorry that it's so early in the morning, but we had to accommodate the schedule for the whole day.</p>
          <p>Let me start with my first part, key take-aways during the third quarter. As you all know, conditions in the global economy were more difficult than any time since the collapse of Lehman in late 2008. Bank stocks came under intense pressure, reflecting obviously the concerns, the exposure of peripheral euro zone, the capital adequacy, the access to liquidity and the funding quality and conditions of market stress.</p>
          <p>Deutsche Bank turned in solid results despite charges relating to Greek bond holdings and other specific items. CB&amp;S remained profitable, impacted by substantial market volatility and client risk aversion. Our GTB business, in their results, reflected strong performance across all major products with a record quarter in trade finance.</p>
          <p>Our PCAM business delivered year-on-year profit growth in every segment. Integration of Postbank and Sal. Oppenheim remains well on track. Our Core Tier 1 capital ratio remained solid and will be managed in best interest of shareholders to comply with the tightening regulatory regime.</p>
          <p>Our funding and liquidity position remained strong with a record &#x20AC;180 billion of liquidity reserves and continued premier access to stable funding sources.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move into our third-quarter results into more detail on page four. The quarter, as you can see, our Core Tier 1 capital increased to &#x20AC;34.1 billion. Total adjusted assets were almost &#x20AC;1.3 trillion, an increase of &#x20AC;87 billion compared to the quarter end before. As to our target definition, the leverage ratio was 22. Liquidity reserves increased more than &#x20AC;30 billion and exceeds now &#x20AC;180 billion, a record for Deutsche Bank.</p>
          <p>Let me turn on to the next page where we show our profitability. As you can see, third-quarter pre-tax profit was &#x20AC;942 million, after &#x20AC;228 million of impairments related to Greek holdings and a &#x20AC;310 million charge relating to the impairment of a German VAT claim.</p>
          <p>This compares to a pre-tax loss of &#x20AC;1 billion after significant charges related to the majority acquisition of Postbank in the third quarter of the previous year. Net income was &#x20AC;777 million versus a net loss of &#x20AC;1.2 billion in the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>Debt valuation adjustments on fair value of liabilities were only approximately &#x20AC;170 million. If we had applied fair value accounting to our own debt, we would have recorded a gain of &#x20AC;2.9 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Third quarter's effective tax rate was 18% and primarily benefited from changes in the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets. The full-year tax rate is expected to be around 29% now. Pre-tax return on equity was 7% in the quarter, 15% for the first nine months of the year.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn on &#x2013; over to page six, show our expense development. Our non-interest expenses, as you can see, were &#x20AC;5.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of &#x20AC;239 million, or 4%, compared to the previous year quarter. The primary drivers of the increase were &#x20AC;755 million relating to the Postbank consolidation and the aforementioned &#x20AC;310 million charge relating to the impairment of that German VAT claim. The increase was partially offset by performance driven, lower bonus accruals and fewer expenses relating to policyholder benefits and claims.</p>
          <p>On page seven, we show our current capital ratios and risk weighted assets. As you can see, the Core Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 10.1% as of September 30, materially unchanged from the prior quarter end, but 140 basis points higher than at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Let's now move on to the following page, where we'll provide details on the development of our Core Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets. As you can see on page eight, Core Tier 1 capital increase by &#x20AC;1.6 billion to &#x20AC;34.1 billion in the quarter, mainly driven by FX effects, which explain &#x20AC;900 million of the increase, up also net income.</p>
          <p>May remember that I cautioned you last quarter not to assume a straight-line development for risk-weighted asset mitigation. Additionally, the environment caused us to make a decision to slow down our efforts. FX movements also materially impacted reported risk-weighted assets, which rose &#x20AC;18 billion to &#x20AC;338 billion, with FX effects contributing more than half of the increase.</p>
          <p>In addition, you can see we saw &#x20AC;9 billion <mark type="ph" /> oil (06:13) risk-weighted asset increases for credit risk. However, this was mostly related to derivatives. Our risk weighted assets rose by &#x20AC;6 billion, as changes in yield curve and widening credit spreads led to higher mark-to-market.</p>
          <p>On a net basis, which is relevant for risk-weighted assets, we added &#x20AC;26 billion derivative assets to our adjusted balance sheet in the quarter, which naturally led to higher risk-weighted assets. The remaining increase in the credit risk &#x2013; risk-weighted assets of &#x20AC;3 billion is split about half-and-half between our CIB and PBC lending businesses.</p>
          <p>From this, you understand that our credit risk-weighted asset increase is heavily impacted by foreign exchange and changing market rates impacting derivatives <mark type="ph" /> MTM (07:02) balances. The real increase is comparatively small and related to our core lending business only.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our de-risking for Basel 2.5 is unaffected by this. This is due to the assets that to-date do not attract risk-weighted assets and hence are not reflected in our published numbers. I will talk to Basel 2.5 and Basel 3 more later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Let me move on now to the traditional presentation of our segment results. Usually I would start with the overview of the divisional performance on page 10. CB&amp;S remained profitable with a pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;70 million, including the aforementioned charge of &#x20AC;310 million relating to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (07:46) topic.</p>
          <p>Each of our classic banking businesses increased pre-tax profit versus the third quarter of 2010. GTB and PCAM produced year-to-date pre-tax profits of &#x20AC;3 billion, the best ever nine-month result, and up 80% versus the same period in 2010.</p>
          <p>This vindicates our strategy of balancing our earnings with strategic acquisitions in the classic banking businesses in the past few years. Our corporate investment quarterly pre-tax loss of &#x20AC;85 million was mainly impacted by the performance of our investments, which means Actavis, Maher Terminals, the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax profit in consolidation and adjustments was &#x20AC;202 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared to a loss of &#x20AC;349 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Results in both periods included significant effects from different accounting methods used for management reporting in IFRS. And in the current year quarter, short-term euro interest rates decreased significantly, which resulted in a gain on economically hedged positions.</p>
          <p>Contrast, these rates increased in the prior year quarter, resulting in a loss in that period. May also mention that our business in Asia-Pacific contributed &#x20AC;33 million to the group's EBIT, if I add CIB and PCAM, so we had a very good development in that region, as well, from a regional point of view.</p>
          <p>This quarter was a test, if I go through 11, you see our Corporate Banking &amp; Securities, and as you can see, this quarter was really a test of our recalibrated business model. The ongoing European sovereign debt crisis had a severe dampening effect on client activity in most products during the quarter. And as you know, our business model is fully dependant on client business following the closure of our dedicated platforms as part of the recalibration.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we have reported a strong relative result, ranked number three in sales and trading, and a positive result in CB&amp;S, especially excluding the impact of the charge relating to the impairment of the German VAT claim.</p>
          <p>On a regional basis, what additionally like to highlight that Asia-Pacific delivered a strong and consistent performance. Our Foreign Exchange business in Asia delivered very robust results, with September being one of the best months ever for this business.</p>
          <p>Let me turn on now to page 12. In Sales &amp; Trading debt, our diversified business again delivered good performance given the current markets conditions, actually achieved the number two performance level here. We actually had a record third quarter in Foreign Exchange and Commodities, and a solid performance in emerging markets in rates.</p>
          <p>In Credit, nevertheless our Client Solution business performed well, but we had obviously substantial lower revenues in flow credit, reflecting the wider credit spreads and obviously also very much lower client volumes.</p>
          <p>To page 13, now as you know, market conditions were very challenging in equities, especially in derivatives and in Europe. However, we had higher revenues in Cash Equities, reflecting higher market share in Europe and the United States, good performance in prime brokerage, as client de-risking was offset by a flight to quality. In Equity Derivatives, client activity was very low and this was the main driver of our under performance.</p>
          <p>We turn now to page 14. Our strong global position, which we achieved a number six overall, but very close to the number five firm, despite our strength in Europe, which had a very slow quarter in this business. We remain number one in Europe and we have the number five position in Asia, but a solid quarter in Advisory, but market issuance levels were down significantly in Europe. And what we really have to comment about this business in our pipeline, the pipeline continues to remain strong, but obviously lot of businesses have made decisions to defer decisions in this &#x2013; and defer business in this area, which we expect will not be lost business.</p>
          <p>If you now turn to GTB, we had another solid quarter in GTB with a strong performance across all major products, both in interest and fee income, the latter showing that our strategic ambition over the last few years is paying off to move to a more fee income based business, but a record quarter in Trade Finance and very good results in Cash Management.</p>
          <p>We're similarly pleased with our performance in Asia-Pacific, with a 32% year-on-year growth in revenues with stronger client volumes, with India and China contributing 50% of year-to-date revenue.</p>
          <p>Year-on-year increase in non-interest expenses was mainly driven by an adjustment related to the amortization, and up from premium paid for credit protection received from ABN AMRO doing the acquisition our business in the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>So this risk umbrella for the acquired loan book was established upon the change of control. The respective guarantee was recognized as an asset with a certain value. <mark type="ph" /> With (13:02) change of control, this asset is being amortized until the umbrella expires.</p>
          <p>Formula-based amortization pattern was now changed, together reflect the changes in the underlying risk adjusted portfolio. The resulting accelerated amortization was mainly recognized in GTB as an amortization adjustment for the year of 2011.</p>
          <p>We now move on to page 16. In Asset and Wealth Management, the pre-tax profit was &#x20AC;186 million, more than double the third quarter of 2010 result.</p>
          <p>Both Asset Management and Private Management suffered from the negative impact of unfavorable equity market conditions on revenues for management fees and commissions, as you can assume, but obviously our expense level continues to benefit from the platform efficiencies that we have generated in prior quarters.</p>
          <p>Now, turn to Asset Management on page 17. You know our Asset Management business continues to gather momentum, now despite the weakening equity markets and other good performance, mainly benefiting from our platform efficiencies that we have generated, also came down 21% year-over-year to &#x20AC;281 million.</p>
          <p>We also suffered net money outflows of &#x20AC;12 billion, generally reflects &#x2013; obviously, reflecting the investor uncertainty. However, this is quite interesting, due to the favorable asset mix shift, the impact from these net outflows during the year-on-year &#x2013; during the year on profitability, are really negligible.</p>
          <p>Turn on to page 18, Private Wealth Management, pre-tax profit contribution remained on target for the first nine months of 2011. Revenues displayed the resilience adverse market conditions and only decreased 4% year-over-year to &#x20AC;479 million, mainly driven by slightly reduced asset based fees and some lower performance fees.</p>
          <p>Revenues in the prior year quarter also benefited from higher positive effects from non-core businesses in Sal. Oppenheim. Margins improved 3 basis points to 77 basis points for the first nine months of this year, mainly from improved Lending and Advisory businesses. The Sal. Oppenheim alignment is on track and &#x2013; which is a very important for us, the customer base is now very stable. We have an overall cost base reduced by 45% on a year-on-year comparison. We've also worked on the efficiency of this business.</p>
          <p>Our net money outflow of &#x20AC;1 billion is completely driven obviously by the market's downturn in the quarter. PWM has not lost <mark type="ph" /> at this time (15:42).</p>
          <p>Page 19, we're going into our PBC, our Private &amp; Business Clients business, which delivered a pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;310 million after absorbing mark-to-market losses of &#x20AC;185 million on Greek bonds, predominantly helped Postbank. Apart from this specific charge and the usual seasonal decline, operating performance across PBC remained very solid quarter-over-quarter. Lower revenues from investment products, reflecting this heightened risk aversion among private clients, we had a contribution from Deposits &amp; Payments and Credit Products, which remained very stable.</p>
          <p>At the end, we had one of our income slow down based on the general market conditions. We obviously also can confirm further progress in reducing PBC's cost base, and the Postbank integration is very well on track.</p>
          <p>I understand that many of you have asked us to disclose the PPA FX relating to the Postbank acquisition. As you know, according to the accounting rules, we will now close our PPA calculation finally in the fourth quarter of this year, and then we will go ahead and disclose for you the final numbers of the PPA.</p>
          <p>Let me move on now, after having covered the performance of the group and the segments, to some key current topics that we felt might be of interest in the current environment.</p>
          <p>Let me start on page 21 with the net sovereign exposure on selected countries. Our GIIPS sovereign exposure was &#x20AC;4.4 billion at the 30th of September, down about two-thirds since December of 2010. The third quarter net exposures also generally came down, with the exception of Italy, but we saw higher exposures resulting from our flow derivative and market-making activities as we continue to make markets in this area.</p>
          <p>From an income recognition perspective, we mark all our Greek sovereign exposure to market since the end of the second quarter, and we have taken corresponding charges to P&amp;L. Average price at which we marked our Greek sovereign positions, the end of the third quarter was 46% of notional.</p>
          <p>Most, but not all, of our remaining non-Greek GIIPS sovereign exposure has also had its fair value through profit or loss. Importantly, reflecting the remaining amortized cost in afs, GIIPS sovereign positions at fair value through profit or loss, would cost us &#x20AC;270 million pre-tax.</p>
          <p>As you will see on the next page, the after-tax effect of reflecting all our European economic area sovereign debt at fair value would have been even smaller, namely about &#x20AC;100 million, <mark type="ph" /> strictly (18:40) not a material amount in the context of our capital base.</p>
          <p>What we're done now on chart 22, which I assume we'll get also some questions around and that's why I'd like to position it correctly. You &#x2013; we will provide you two capital slides and the difference is the first capital slide is just a simulation to deal with what we expect the rules to be around the capitalization for European banks that will be part of the European overall package.</p>
          <p>The second slide will just give you an update <mark type="ph" /> or a (19:17) sense with our Basel 2.5 and 3.0 effort. We have to separate them because obviously, they deal with the different regulatory principles and different regulatory background. That's why, please, always separate those charts because they deal with two very different topics.</p>
          <p>Let me spend first some time to walk you through the simulation that illustrates why we are so comfortable that Deutsche Bank does not need any public sector money. On this slide first, our Core Tier 1 ratio at the end of the third quarter, as you can see, was a strong 10.1%, nearly 1.5 percentage points higher than the one at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Then we added what we currently expect to be the impact of Basel 2.5 when it goes live at the end of this quarter. We see, we put down &#x20AC;76 billion higher risk-weighed assets, but also &#x20AC;800 million higher capital, which means the risk-weighed equivalent net impact &#x20AC;66 billion, which covers both trading and banking book rule changes.</p>
          <p>We had given you a banking book target of &#x20AC;50 billion that, as you can see, we will slightly miss by a decision that we've made so far based on slowing down our efforts looking at the environment, right now.</p>
          <p>In the next step, we simulate the impact of treating all European sovereign afs and amortized cost positions at fair value. For us, this would be a mere &#x20AC;100 million &#x2013; as I've said, a mere &#x20AC;100 million. Just remember, all Greek exposures are already at fair value and our other GIIPS sovereign exposure is small and mostly at fair value, as well.</p>
          <p>Now, in the last step on this chart, we added the latest market expected net income for the fourth quarter and for the first half-year of 2012. Simulating, we would have to meet higher capital requirements at the end of June of 2012. And as you can see from the simulations, we arrive just based on this math, at 9.1% without any additional management action &#x2013; without any management action other than the Basel 2.5 actions related in the fourth quarter of '11.</p>
          <p>This means that we achieved 9% and still have the whole toolbox of capital management actions at our disposal, further improve our capital position or to compensate for any net income shortfall in case we do not meet current market expectations.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we do have legacy assets in our Investment Bank that we intend to further reduce, and which, in any case, will roll off over time. Also in Postbank, the refocusing on our Customer Bank also continues and non-core positions will come down. I don't need to go into more detail, and you can see why we feel so comfortable with our capital position at this point in time, but obviously, it's clear we need to keep our overall risk discipline.</p>
          <p>Now, more important, even looking at this chart, which I clearly want to emphasize, even if within the rule of further de-risking will not &#x2013; would not be allowed, as you could see with the management action that we have planned for Basel 2.5, we would not need to do any further de-risking.</p>
          <p>On the next page, now I turn to give you an update of the chart we produced for you a year ago and really see it only as an update, and at the end the core message you have to take away that there is not much of a change versus last year, know why it's Basel 2.5 in the current debate on bank capitalization is most relevant obviously for you and us today, but I just also wanted to a give you a view on where we stand on our Basel 3 point.</p>
          <p>So, a year ago I showed you the same simulation where we said that we have a net risk-weighted asset equivalent impact of &#x20AC;125 billion, bumped at Basel 2.5 and 3 package. That's what we still believe today.</p>
          <p>On the chart you find it's reflected as the combination &#x20AC;176 billion higher risk-weighted asset, but also &#x20AC;4 billion higher capital, which is equivalent to &#x20AC;50 billion risk-weighted savings, so in aggregate, that gives you the &#x20AC;125 billion risk-weighted equivalent impact.</p>
          <p>Now, if one asks the latest analyst net income for the time between now and the 1 January of 2013, they arrive at a simulated Core Tier 1 ratio under Basel 3 of 8.5%. That's exactly as we did in the case of simulation a year ago. This means that in order to achieve a Core Tier 1 ratio of 9% under the then stricter Basel 3 rule set, for example, we would need to deliver, on management action outside of Basel 2.5 or 3, of approximately &#x20AC;30 billion risk-weighted assets equivalent. But again, this 9% is just only a guess of where markets may want to see us.</p>
          <p>But to be clear, any potential get to 9% can be closed by risk-weighted asset measures or capital measures or a combination of both. And we choose the most effective combination of measures to allow our businesses to continue serving our clients, at the same time, obviously to ensure that the bank remains well capitalized.</p>
          <p>So, as you know me, I always believe that the funding and liquidity situation is at least as important as the capital situation. That's why I would like to move on page 24 now to our funding and liquidity. Deutsche Bank as you know has substantially rebalanced towards most stable funding sources, a significant reduction in utilization of short-term funding sources. We built up high liquidity reserves to buffer against extreme stress scenarios and we kept strong capital market access and an evenly balanced maturity profile. Structurally, Deutsche Bank is long-funded across all time buckets and let me give you some more detail on page 25.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we have significantly rebalanced our funding towards most stable sources. As you can see in the chart, roughly 55% of our funding comes from the most stable sources versus just 30% at June 30, 2007. A strong driver of the strategic rationale to become a larger, more creditable player in retail banking plus increase our access and capacity to fund here retail deposits, which we have more than doubled since 2007.</p>
          <p>And as a group, our loans to deposit ratio is approximately 78%, and we continue to be an attractive deposit taker across our retail and corporate franchise. This rebalancing has helped us to maintain premier access to a broad range of stable sources, even through difficult times and potential stress as we're experiencing.</p>
          <p>Now let me move on now to page 26. I give you some more details. We hold liquidity reserves to the protection against the potential stress outflows, the most sensitive of which is unsecured wholesale funding. Unlike some market participants, we maintain strong access to unsecured wholesale funding and have actually increased volumes throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>This increase in unsecured wholesale funding has solely been invested in additional liquidity reserves. It's not required under any core business activities. Our &#x20AC;180 billion liquidity reserves predominantly consists of the highest quality and most liquid assets, cash in Central Bank eligible securities.</p>
          <p>Also of note is that within unsecured wholesale funding, our financing from Money Market Funds are typically more sensitive to liability demands of their own, is relatively small, representing just 3% of our overall funding.</p>
          <p>On page 27, we show you that &#x2013; how our CDS developed. To start with, this item tell you that we have completed more than 100% our current year funding plan and we have now already also started to pre-fund for 2012. The strength of our funding franchise was demonstrated, as you know, by our recent &#x20AC;1.75 billion floating rate note. This was the first senior unsecured bank issuance in 12 weeks, <mark type="ph" /> means (28:06) the order book was oversubscribed and the deal <mark type="ph" /> spreaded (28:09) tighter following the issue.</p>
          <p>Our CDS volatility is caused by many factors, as you know, and they are not obviously &#x2013; in CDS, are not representative of our actual issuance levels, that's been at much tighter spreads. Our average issuance spread right now, as of plus 70 basis points, there you can see significant difference to our CDS.</p>
          <p>As we look forward to 2012, we've recently initiated a new retail deposit campaign through PBC. We hope to raise several billion of deposits at attractive rate before year-end for that campaign.</p>
          <p>Let me move on page 28. We now look at our cash flow profile, we are having here the benefit of a disciplined funding strategy where we didn't compromise the duration of our portfolio for short-term gains. As you can see on the chart, do not have significant concentrations of financing risk at any time in the next ten years. Just as importantly, we calibrate our long-term capital market issuance against our long-term asset profile, both contractual and modeled, and run a surplus across all term factors, as you can see from the chart.</p>
          <p>Obviously the current stress in the funding markets isn't good for the banking sector or the economy as a whole. However, we fell very well placed to continue to support our clients and partly to our well-funding elements.</p>
          <p>On page 29, let me conclude before we open up for questions, think Deutsche Bank has really shown strength in the face of very challenging conditions. Our Investment Banking remains profitable, even in extremely turbulent markets, our Classic Banking business has continued to produce record operating performance, this achieved without significant own debt valuation adjustment.</p>
          <p>Capital ratios remain close to the strongest ever level, core active management of capital base will ensure alignment of shareholder interest with, obviously, all this regulatory requirements we have to deal with, further strengthening of our liquidity position in a substantial &#x2013; and there's substantial high quality funding base, despite stressed conditions, is what we will continue to focus on, continue to also focus on improving our operational and risk efficiency cost initiatives and integration of positions continue to be well on track.</p>
          <p>As significant uncertainties persist for the world's economy and financial markets, with a near-term outlook highly dependent on decisive resolution of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe in the banking system, we obviously continue to expect that we will have challenging times.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, Deutsche Bank is committed to further optimizing its business model and notwithstanding potential changes in regulations, in the best interest of its shareholders and with a sustainable funding model, which will allow us to perform in all parts of our business.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> First question comes from Huw van Steenis from Morgan Stanley. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Huw? We cannot hear anything in the room here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>May we have your question, please? Mr. Steenis? Okay. So, we change to the next question. The next question comes from Derek De Vries of Bank of America. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I got few questions, if all right, and apologies if this is in there. I haven't had chance to get through it in a great detail, but I was hoping you could give us a little more disclosure on the &#x20AC;310 million of an impairment in German VAT and litigation. I just want to understand if I should be stripping that out as truly exceptional.</p>
          <p>And then I guess related to the investment, CB&amp;S, as well, obviously it was a very difficult quarter for the industry and that's reflected in your numbers. I'm just wondering how long you could take this low level of profitability, or in fact, no profitability before you decide to make some significant reduction in head count. So, can you live with this level of profitability for two, three quarters before you decide to make significant changes in head count?</p>
          <p>And then my last question, I guess, would be on slide 22. Is that exercise, is that just for analysts to get their heads around, or do you think that's actually how the European Commission, or EBA, or whoever is actually going to carry out that exercise? And specifically, the decision not to have any organic growth in risk-weighted assets in there despite the fact that you've put in, I guess, three quarters of &#x2013; rather conservatively put in three quarters of consensus profitability. So, those were my three question; thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Derek. Let me start with your first question. This chart represents Deutsche Bank's German input VAT relating to carbon emission rights trading that date from July 2009 to April 2010, and this amount normally is tax deductible.</p>
          <p>In Q3, Deutsche Bank, we obtained some additional information during the public court proceedings relating this VAT fraud that occurred around the carbon emission rates trading in Germany. Deutsche Bank, only to clarify, is currently not a party to this criminal proceeding and obviously, we don't have direct access to the record. That's why, as a precautionary measure and based on legal advice, we have decided not to claim at this point the input VAT for carbon emission rights trading for this period of time that I mentioned.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we will reserve our right to reclaim this input VAT from the tax authorities at a later point in time, as soon as these legal proceedings are done. So, only to answer your question, this is clearly a one-off item. This is a specific fraud situation, and obviously has nothing to do with our ongoing business.</p>
          <p>Second question was how long we could withstand the current level of profitability before head count reductions. As you know, Joe Ackermann did announce that we are doing some head count reductions already in the fourth quarter and going into the first quarter of next year. This is what we announced, so we are adjusting the platform, and we will continue to do so, of course, if the environment persists.</p>
          <p>But let's not forget, we were the investment bank that went in first, and since our peak, we are 10% down in our head count already. So we have been always proactive on the investment bank reduced head count according to our business development. So that's why we didn't have to have a significant cut in this quarter.</p>
          <p>And on slide 20 &#x2013; 22, whether &#x2013; your question was whether that's based on what we believe the EBA stress test, or the EBA requirements will really be. Well, obviously, we don't specifically know what we will &#x2013; what they will require from us, but we do have obviously some good ideas based on the talks we entertain with several people. And the purpose of the strategy, to illustrate to you, that without any additional management action, we will get to this 9.1%. Assuming even your conservative net income projection as per analyst forecast, and then that we even, let's say, if this net income based on current conditions weren't to come in at this level, that we still have the toolbox to deal with &#x2013; know, any requirements that might exist at that point of time. So, it was for us mainly to show you that the math, the straightness, this shows that we will get to this 9.1% without a problem.</p>
          <p>We even &#x2013; let's assume this is one of the potential scenarios that further de-risking action might not be possible based on the agreement. And we also wanted to show that we do not need any further de-risking actions to get there because obviously one of the scenarios, one of the assumptions could be that banks will not be allowed to reduce their balance sheet from a current state.</p>
          <p>So, I think that was the important message for us to tell you that we &#x2013; even not utilizing the entire toolbox that we have, that we still have &#x2013; fortunately still have ample flexibility to exercise other measures if required, but that our current math shows that we will match the most likely number that we hear, which will be the 9%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. That's all very clear. I appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question comes from Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan Securities. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. The first question is related to NPL coverage. What should we expect, assuming NPLs go up over time, what should we expect as kind of a run rate? Around 47%, 48%, is that a fair number that we should assume?</p>
          <p>The second question is on your structured credit assets. Should we assume that in this environment, it's less likely that you going to sale assets in 2012, assuming that we're looking at prices at current levels because you've done a great job so far of disposing of them?</p>
          <p>And then the third question is on the liquidity information, which is very useful. I'm trying to understand two things. One is how much does it cost you, or do you actually make profit on your liquidity position? And secondly, how should I think about slide 28? What I try to understand is if you have a counterparty derivative exposure, how is that managed on a like-for-like basis, i.e., are you breakeven with all your counterparties across your business, i.e., you have a net master agreement of more or less zero?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi, Kian. Thanks for the questions. On the &#x2013; let me start on the NPL coverage ratio. On impaired loan coverage ratio, we've added in the deck on the page, that is with the effect of Postbank, which is a technical effect, which has to do with the acquisition, obviously, accounting. And, yes, I think our coverage will be around that size, so 46%. I have cautioned you because what's happening in this statistic over time is as we fair-valued all the loans and acquisitions, obviously these acquisitions did not go into this statistic because as being fair-valued, they had no reserves versus them and therefore they were not part of the statistic.</p>
          <p>As we now move on in time and we provide loan loss provisions on to the Postbank loan, obviously they will migrate into the statistic. The second thing I caution you, also, expect if you look at the NPLs from Postbank, which are about in the size of &#x20AC;2.5 billion, &#x20AC;2.7 billion, we will slowly migrate and add on this number to our number, so Deutsche Bank should be around &#x20AC;10 billion around. So, don't be surprised, this is just a technical effect of moving up to this number. Okay, so I think 46%, 47%, 48% is a good assumption. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:23)</p>
          <p>Second question was the structured credit assets. I think that what we have, I can almost say, the luxury in our point of view to do right now, we decided to slow down as market conditions worsen. We decided not to take a significant P&amp;L hit under which you could have move more assets out of our books in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>And at this point in time, we just decided to slow down a little bit our effort. Of course, our view is always that if it's capital accretive, we could move to the next step and accept certain P&amp;L losses, assuming that the risk weighted asset releases will be higher &#x2013; substantially higher than the P&amp;L impact that would be, if you &#x2013; so will our second line of defense and then action we could take. So, in that sense, we still don't believe that it's very difficult to sell this asset, it's just a question of how much willingness of P&amp;L. Then let's not forget that there's always the roll-off in natural maturity profile of the &#x2013; and they will fall off the schedule.</p>
          <p>How much of liquidity cost do we make profit, I think we'll have to come back to you on that, as I don't have the numbers here with you, but you can assume that a substantial amount of our liquidity comes from our stable funding sources, and there isn't a substantial negative carry from borrowing long and investing short. So, we wouldn't estimate it at this point to be a big P&amp;L impact, but we'll have to come back to you to answer this question.</p>
          <p>On the derivative, yes, our assumption is that we do have a master net agreements in place and therefore, obviously, that's our assumption that we are protected there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And lastly, just one quick one &#x2013; the &#x20AC;30 billion to get to 9%, can you just give a little bit more detail where that's coming from? Is this Postbank and legacy asset or is there something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this &#x2013; don't forget the &#x20AC;30 billion to come to 9%, it's just again a calculation that we gave you, that's what we would need to take. And it could, as we &#x2013; as I said before, it could come from Postbank where we could do some more action, it could come from other areas. We don't necessarily are planning to do this &#x20AC;30 billion at this point in time. I only put in the &#x20AC;30 billion to give you a size of -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of what it would take to require us to get to the 9%. At this point in time, as we have communicated the 8.5%, we feel comfortable with the 8.5%, but don't forget this is all at the beginning of 2013. We've also given you a number that we will be above the 9% at the end of 2013. And therefore, the question only becomes in case we would have to accelerate something, which is currently no rule impacting. There is nothing that forces us to do other than maybe market needs or market perception or market views. But from an internal point of view, we don't think that we need to do this &#x20AC;30 billion.</p>
          <p>It just was to give you about an estimate, so you have an idea of what the difference would be to get to a 9%. Let's not forget, and that's why I said it's very importantly, that this European rules that will apply to the mid of next year, which is &#x2013; your 9% mid of next year, eventually with limits on what you can do on reducing your balance sheet size. This is a different view we have to take. The other was just an update for Basel. Don't forget that we will be far above all Basel required minimum capital ratios by &#x2013; with 8.5% at the beginning of January. So, there is no pressure to do additional &#x2013; to take additional measures, other than our usual and endless market view discussion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions, please. The first one is just on your new update on Basel 2.5 and Basel 3. The second one is on corporate investments. On Basel 2.5 and Basel 3, am I right in understanding that what used to be roughly a net impact of &#x20AC;188 billion guidance after mitigation is now &#x20AC;176 billion, and that the delta is simply that you have less add-backs for securitization deductions? And following up -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can give you that answer right away, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then basically of that &#x20AC;90 billion targeted management action, the &#x2013; am I right in understanding that it's rather, in your view, a timing difference that you say, okay, you might only achieve roughly &#x20AC;14 billion or so, as per your slide 22, and then the remaining &#x20AC;76 billion are all subject for 2012? And is there a shift in terms of mitigation planned from Basel 2.5 to Basel 3, or is it still the same plan, just pushed more towards 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's absolutely the same plan, and we pushed it more towards 2012. That's why we're not exactly needing the &#x20AC;50 billion for the banking book that we had said previously, but we made the conscious decision to delay some of it in order to take P&amp;L hits right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've guided back then roughly &#x20AC;8 billion capital deductions under Basel 3 to be phased in 2014 to 2018. Could you just comment what amount of that &#x20AC;8 billion is deferred tax assets, which you expect to utilize until the start of Basel 3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't &#x2013; that, Philipp, we might have to come back to you on that question because I don't have that number, obviously, here with me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then a final one on corporate investments, given that it has become a bit of a mixed bag, I believe, also including the BHF now. What is your sense in terms of profitability, or pre-tax profit, development of the division in a tougher market environment going into 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we actually &#x2013; if I look at &#x2013; into these different assets, obviously we have done, we have a lot of one-offs in BHF, because obviously, in order to prepare BHF for a sale, we completely cleaned up the balance sheet, and that took some toll in corporate investments.</p>
          <p>So, I don't anticipate &#x2013; I anticipate BHF to be better from now on, and not to have to carry any significant, then we're completely done with the clean-up of that balance sheet, it's completely free of any sovereign debt now, of any sovereign debt. And it's completely free of any other risky assets. So, in that sense, obviously, we decided to do really a complete clean-up, mainly because obviously, we want the bank, if we sell it and it goes on &#x2013; obviously on, to be able to survive in the current environment.</p>
          <p>On &#x2013; the second is Maher Terminals, Maher Terminals is our port business. I expect that to be at the same level as it has impacted. This is mainly impacted by a one-off &#x2013; by a &#x2013; not a one-off, by a swap that was made in bad times for us. It's causing some burden, so I expect it to be at the same level.</p>
          <p>Our casino is improving. As we speak, we have improved profitability and we expect for 2012, improved business plan. We don't see, and we can honestly say that we see that all our start-up costs will be done with this year, and that we, therefore, will be in positive territory next year.</p>
          <p>And then last but not least, our Actavis, which is the other large one. It's a very profitable and is a profitable pharmaceutical business, and pharmaceutical businesses don't get impacted by crises, as I've learned. People still take medicine, maybe even more medicine in bad times than in good times. So, I expect for that business no impact. So, overall, this is not a very sensitive &#x2013; general economy sensitive business, in the Maher impact and Cosmo impact, which might be the two businesses that are more likely be impacted by general economic changes. The impacts are minimal. We're talking in million type things, not more.</p>

          <p>Next question is from Stuart Graham of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi. I've got a few questions. On the slide 22, the Basel 2.5 impact, can you just explain what the &#x20AC;800 million Core Tier 1 capital is? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Then the second question is on slide 23, where you're talking about the 8.5%, you're still talking about phased in, not with full fat Basel 3 deductions. Is that because you think that's the right way of looking at it, or just because you're replicating the math you showed us back in the previous slide? I'm interested in how you think we should look at your Basel 3, full fat or with phased in deductions because most of your peers are now talking full fat.</p>
          <p>And then my final question is, can you give us a figure for gross sovereign CDS protection you've written on the PIGS, so pre-netting and collateral and pre any offsetting protection that you've bought? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay, Stuart, let me start with the &#x20AC;800 million, that's the reduction in the trading book securitization deduction that we are taking today. And this was a charge, that you remember, I reported on this charge a couple of times that we have to take last year due to a very strict rule interpretation that existed in Germany, and that we had agreed that we had to take based on this German rule. This German rule goes away with the Basel 2.5 implementation because, actually, what happens is that the Basel 2.5 framework comes very close to what this original German rule intended to do. And therefore, this additional charge that we needed to take, we don't need to take anymore. So, that's the background of it. So, it's something that will, for sure, fall away, and we have confirmation of this additional deduction. We will not &#x2013; we don't need under Basel 2.5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's clear. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, under Basel 2.5, obviously, we have to deduct less for this securitization. That's the background of this. The second question was the fully phased in versus the phased in approach. Well, honestly if you &#x2013; there is a lot of mess going around and lot of <mark type="ph" /> effect (53:00), and if you go away and they said what the bank would really require to operate.</p>
          <p>What the bank would really require in it, is non-phased in approach, and that's the way we look at it. Because at the end, the reality and the reported numbers in January of &#x2013; there also will not be &#x2013; with &#x2013; will be without the phased in numbers because at the end, that's what the regulation says and that's what we cannot report again.</p>
          <p>Yeah? And I think all this speculation goes around what will the market think, and what will the market think is necessary and what will the market think is necessary. And you heard me do that very often having this endless discussion, that Deutsche Bank &#x2013; why do we need different capital ratios, if we can fund competitively, if we are well funded, if it doesn't have an impact on our rating, if we don't get any other benefit? And we do believe that at some point, the return on equity discussion will be back. And at that point in time, I think what we've all learned in business is that we also should manage the bank to a tighter capital, does make a lot of sense.</p>
          <p>And I can tell you only one thing from my daily experience as CFO. I'm really happy that we're managing the bank tight on capital, because the activity and the focus and the quality improvement in our P&amp;L and everything we're doing to manage to this tight capital regime, is very good for the underlying businesses.</p>
          <p>The benefit that you have on a tighter capital managed basis than if you have businesses running around with generous capital accounts and without the pressure, I think is improving the quality of the bank tremendously. And I can really say that out of the daily experience we have. But we just think this way. I think this &#x2013; the 8.5% is what we should have. At the beginning, we have also said to you that we will be at over 9% by the end of that year. So, from our perspective, I think we are fine in capital. Market may take another view, but we are accepting the faith in approaches the rules under which we have to operate our bank.</p>
          <p>So, and then your last question was that gross sovereign exposure to the PIGS countries.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about &#x20AC;4.8 billion, yeah. If I &#x2013; if that &#x2013; including the CDS or as we &#x2013; hold on &#x2013; excluding the CDS hedging and derivative collateral, PIGS' gross exposure is &#x20AC;4.8 billion, yeah? Which we only have very limited CDS net bought protection of about &#x20AC;200 million. In fact, on most countries, we are in a position of net sold protection to others, which is included in our net exposure.</p>

          <p>So that's &#x2013; that &#x20AC;4.8 billion is the gross sovereign CDS protection you've written to other banks and counterparties on the PIGS, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the &#x2013; hold on &#x2013; what we've written is the very limited CDS is the &#x20AC;200 million. That is very limited CDS net bought protection. The &#x20AC;4.8 billion is excluding CDS hedging and derivatives collateral. Our remaining GIIPS exposure is a total, because I showed you the net number of &#x20AC;4.4 billion, right, on the chart, and if we gross that up and close it up, it's &#x20AC;4.8 billion.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Minimal between our net and our &#x2013; the point is that our difference between our net and our growth exposure is very minimal.</p>

          <p>&#x20AC;4.8 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Jeremy Sigee of Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a couple of questions, please. I'm still on slide 22. I just wanted to be totally clear. In the Basel 2.5 impact after 4Q management actions, so there's &#x20AC;76 billion on RWAs and the &#x20AC;0.8 billion. Could you tell us exactly what the &#x2013; how much the management action is in the &#x20AC;76 billion and maybe in the &#x20AC;0.8 billion, if applicable? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question on that is, am I understanding correctly you're saying this is what your math shows? I'm just wondering how confident you would be that it's the simple math that determines the decision, or would there be political pressure of whatever kind for you to take capital for the greater good? So, that is the first couple of questions.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, I just wanted to ask a bit more on funding. What your view is on the state of funding markets after your successful issue the other day. Do you feel you could do more? So, and generally, how do you view that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start first on slide &#x2013; on your slide discussion and how much management action is included. Well, in the management action included for the first quarter is about a remaining &#x20AC;9 billion risk-weighted asset equivalent or <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:23) and it's solely Basel 2.5 related and <mark type="ph" /> that's important message (58:24) no other management action is required to make the math work at this stage. So, we -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's just &#x20AC;9 billion in the RWAs. There's nothing in the &#x20AC;0.8 billion of capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The deduction &#x2013; but there's no management &#x2013; you asked me, if I understood your definition of management actions correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's your definition. I mean, you're saying that the &#x20AC;76 billion and the &#x20AC;0.8 billion are after management action, and I'm saying how much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x20AC;9 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x20AC;9 billion. Great; okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second, your question whether this math will work or whether there will be political pressure of greater good of citizens. I can clearly answer the question with no. The agreement is that there will be a set of rules and this set of rules we will have to comply with and there will be <mark type="ph" /> time (59:11) whether bank gets forced to fund it or not. And all we are very confident in saying that according to the math that I show you that, you know, we will not require government funding, and there will be no pressure. It doesn't make any sense, let's not forget this is tax-payer money. And I don't think that they will do, and also unnecessarily, look at the stress situation in Europe, that they will unnecessarily not give funds to banks that, according to their rules, don't need it. So, we don't ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, actually even if you add in the &#x20AC;9 billion, and even if that's disallowed, you're still at about 9.0%, aren't you? So, you're still just about passing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're just about passing and, again, it really is a question then, how is &#x2013; our plan in terms of profitability versus analysts' expectations come in, et cetera. So, there is obviously ample wiggle room, as well.</p>
          <p>Then to your last question, obviously, our funding market obviously remains stressed and funding markets remain stressed. But we were obviously very positive that our recent issue was over subscribed, and that we continue be able to attract flows, even from unsecured wholesale funding means that there is starting to be some credit differentiations in the market, and that we are certainly in the right position for this credit differentiation, as explained. So, that's why we're not pessimistic, but we know that funding markets continues to be <mark type="ph" /> back (1:00:43) currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, just on funding, on slide 27, you talk about &#x20AC;6 billion raised during the third quarter, presumably private placements. I mean, is that &#x2013; what sort of &#x2013; are those sort of five-year placements being done or what sort of placements are those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That number contains all our <mark type="ph" /> truth that it (1:01:06) contains deposits, yeah, a little bit of deposits, it &#x2013; and also contains other funding activities. I don't know -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Just potential &#x2013; (1:01:16)</p>
