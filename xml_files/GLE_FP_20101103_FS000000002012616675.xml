        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone and thank you for attending the presentation for our Third Quarter 2010 Results. As you would see this results confirms the group's rebound and also the soundness of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale model.</p>
          <p>Before giving you the highlight for the quarter, I would like to say a few words by worth introduction. In an environment of hesitant economic recovery and mix market condition, the group achieved revenues of &#x20AC;6.3 billion this quarter, up 2.6% compared to last year and you will see that in the corporate center we have some one-offs.</p>
          <p>The strong momentum of the retail banking businesses and the performances of the corporate investment banking once more illustrates the quality of SocGen universal banking model.</p>
          <p>On the strength of that performance to-date, the French networks should exceed the 3% annual target that we set at the beginning of the year to reach 3.5% in 2010. Within international retail banking, growth is starting to pick up within particular the breakeven contribution by Russia this quarter, you will see where it's minus &#x20AC;2 million, so almost at breakeven one quarter ahead of our expectation.</p>
          <p>In corporate investment banking our customer-oriented development strategy is continuing with some good commercial successes. In all revenues from the co-activities reached the &#x20AC;2 billion mark, thanks to the very strong performance of financing activities and the satisfactory results of the market activities in the mixed environment.</p>
          <p>As for the management of our legacy assets, their contribution was in line with our expectation and we continued with operation of reducing our exposure this quarter with &#x20AC;2.6 billion of disposal and amortization. Finally, as you can see, there was a confirmed gradual fall in the cost of risk for all businesses, I would comment more into detail later on.</p>
          <p>So in total, the Group net income for the quarter was &#x20AC;0.9 billion, amounting to 3 billion for the first nine months of the year and the return on equity after tax was 10.2% for the first nine months of 2010.</p>
          <p>The Group also has maintained a strong financial structure with a Tier 1 ratio of 10.4% and Core Tier 1 of 8.4% at the end of September, excluding the floor effects. Also, we demonstrate the Group ability to rebound and with the first transformation underway, SocGen will be Basel 3 compliant as this 219 Rule was effective on the 1st January, 2013.</p>
          <p>The Group expects to post a pro forma Core Tier 1 ratio of 7.5% on the 1st of Jan, without taking advantage of the saving of the reduction and of course without the capital increase.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to page four and I will allude to the P&amp;L of the Group. As you can see the net banking income rose by 2.6% and this include &#x20AC;216 million negative revenues in the corporate center linked to the CDS, our spread and also the fine that was booked by four French banks in the third quarter. Although for the first nine months, we can see that the rise equaled to 15.1% on a like-for-like basis.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses at &#x20AC;4 billion rose by 1.4% versus last year and for the first nine months it's an increase of just 0.4% on a like for like basis reflecting the discipline of the businesses and also the group's improved operating efficiencies. As a result, the cost income ratio amounted to 64.1%, but when adjusted for non-recurring factors and boost in the corporate center the underlying cost income ratio is at 62.3% for the quarter and 62.4% for the first nine months of the year.</p>
          <p>As a result of decline in provision that I would put on the next slide you can see that we have been able to double the net profit compared to third quarter of last year. Let's move on page five and have a look to the cost of risks. As announced in the beginning of the year, the fall in the cost of risk is gradually improving, with a 10 basis point decline compared to the second quarter at 77 basis point for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In the French networks, the cost of risk is in line with our expectations were now below 50 basis points at 46 basis points representing a decrease from the second quarter and compared to last year. The allocation to provision for the last corporate declined, the level remain high for SMEs and professional and has over the last two years the loss rate is still extremely low for individual customers due to the predominance of the housing loans.</p>
          <p>In international retail banking, the cost of risk at 174 basis points dropped 18 basis points compared to the second quarter. This change was largely due to the improvement existing in Russia, where cost of freight declined by almost 40% and particularly that was not.</p>
          <p>In Czech Republic we also witnessed a decrease in the cost of risk which is now almost back to its pre-crisis level. On the other hand in Romania, we've seen a cost of risk at 300 bps in line with what we've seen in second quarter, reflecting the deterioration of the economic environment and the allocation provision for risk is still significant particularly for individuals and small businesses. Regarding the cost of risk of the specialized financial services at 221 basis points, it's less likely for consumer finance while remaining stable for equipment finance activities.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, for CIB's productivities like in the previous two quarters the cost of risk is almost nil, extremely low reflecting the portfolio's strong resilience. And last but not least, you've seen that we've set aside &#x20AC;108 million for the legacy assets almost in line with the guidance that we set at the beginning of the year and we update at the mid-year saying that we would be at the low-end of the range of 0.7 to 1 billion pre-tax.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to slide 6 and 7 to the subject of capital, first starting with the situation of the group as of end of September and then trying to give you projection for the Basel III implementation.</p>
          <p>First, when you look at the group financial structure as of end of September it remained stable overall compared to end of June despite the minus 23 bps negative impact which is linked to the consolidation of Societe Nationale de Credit.</p>
          <p>We closed the deal in the last days of September, this means that it is in our balance sheet. It is in our Tier ratio, but the impact in the P&amp;L will be booked as from the fourth quarter of this year. As I mentioned already excluding the flow effect, the group Tier 1 at 10.4% and the Core Tier 1 ratio is at 8.4%. Risk weighted assets are under control at &#x20AC;333 billion, an increase of 0.8% over the quarter and 2% adjusted for changes in the growth structure and the constant exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Let us try and look at what could be the ratio of the group under that data stream. And first, lets look at our projection of core Tier 1 under Basel II, so on the same regulation. Based on the assumption that we use for our plan on this one, as 2015 presented last June, the group is able to generate 300 basis points of risk-based capital of core Tier 1 over the period last quarter of 2010 and 2011 and 2012, while first paying a 35% payout ratio each year. Even if we have assumed that we would propose for the next two years, a scrip dividend option and that is success rate will be at 60% for 2010 and for 2011. So this means that in this projection, the 2012 dividend is still pretty provided in cash in the projection end of December 2012.</p>
          <p>On the other side, the organic growth of activities which is 4% growth that we are assuming 2011 and 2012 will bite 420 basis points of the ratio. And thus as a result you can see that our core Tier 1 is expected to be at 10.2% by end of 2012.</p>
          <p>Let me maybe take a step back and say that this is a considerable achievement this 10.2% compared to the situation that we were altogether witnessing before the crisis, so that mid 2007 where the bank like Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale core Tier 1 was expected to be appropriate at 6%. This mean that in six years' time we will have to almost double our core Tier 1 ratio compared to pre-crisis level.</p>
          <p>If I move now to page seven, and look from the starting point of Basel II, what are the impact coming from first Basel 2.5, so CRD3 and Basel III having in mind that the Basel III rules will, well, there are still certain uncertainties that will be decided by the Basel Committee by the end of the year and then we will have also to see for the European Commission and European Parliament as well as the French regulator will finally apply these rules.</p>
          <p>So let's start with the 10.2% ratio as estimated. The impact of CRD3 that we've disclosed last June is 105 basis point reduction of the core Tier 1, it reduced our ratio to 9.15 and then I will detail that if you wish during the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>We do estimate that the group core Tier 1 ratio will be decreased by further 205 basis points, due to Basel III impact which are detailed on this slide. In front of that, we have conservatively estimated that we have mitigation capacity to restore 40 bps by end of 2012 using a three lever, the first one that like many of our peers, we can optimize our market risk weighted assets through an active management of our counter-party risk and also by operating through <mark type="inaudible" /> houses, especially for the rigid activity.</p>
          <p>Secondly, as announced last June, we will continue with the optimization of the portfolio of activities and this could release certain goodwill on risk-weighted assets. And last but not least, even if we have already projected in our projection amortization of our legacy assets, we could also go beyond this projected amortization and by ramping up the sales produce capital liquidity days.</p>
          <p>As a result, you can see that we will able to achieve a 7.5% core Tier 1 ratio under Basel III by January 1st, 2013 with no capital increase and without also phasing the deduction which is allowed by the regulator, including the phasing we will be at 7.9%.</p>
          <p>As in 2013, we will have the benefit of additional results, proposal of the scrip dividends for the 2012 dividend, also the fact that deferred tax assets will continue to be resolved and further amortization of our legacy assets. This should bring us to a 8.5% core Tier 1 ratio without phasing by end of 2013, showing, let's say, the capacity of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale to face this regulatory changes, even if it will require very strict financial disciplines over the coming three years.</p>
          <p>Let's go back to page eight and to the third quarter results, starting with the French networks. As you can see the French networks confirmed their commission momentum of three brands that we've seen since the beginning of the year. With a 4.9% annual growth in September for all group loans in France, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is maintaining its commitment to finance the French economy. And for the French network alone, so excluding financial services and CIB the growth is 4.1%. This is fueled by an increase by 7.5% of the mortgages and by 4.5% of investment loans dedicated to corporate.</p>
          <p>In terms of development of the franchise, you can see that we are continue to open 59,000 new current accounts on a net basis, bringing the total to date to almost 150,000, in line with our expectation to be above 200,000 new current account for the full year.</p>
          <p>Deposits have increased strongly at 11.5%, fueled by side deposits plus 10%, term deposits, plus almost 34% and also by levering off which increased compared to last year by almost 34%.</p>
          <p>In insurance activities, we have a good momentum on the life insurance inflows which you can see at 0.8 billion net basis, this is not the gross life insurance spending this is the net one is at a record level and also the development of the non-life insurance, but this is going well with an increase by 33% of the new contracts year-to-date.</p>
          <p>In telecommunication we have launched our iPhone application and also we have recorded the 3 millionth customer in September on the website of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. In term of results as expected we said that we will see a deterioration of revenues across the year due to the more difficult base of comparison and also the increase in the regulatory savings deposits. We were able to grow the top line by 2.6%, the cost back control leading to a cost income ratio improvement by 0.7 percentage points compared to third quarter of last year and a 15% increase in French networks contribution to Group net income.</p>
          <p>Let's move on page nine, with the International Retail Banking where in an environment where there are still regional differences, the entities of the division confirm the signs of recovery that we've seen in the first half. Starting with Russia, we have a loan outstanding growth which increased by 1.9% compared to end of June, so roughly 8% on an annual basis and this confirms the trend that we have already seen in the second quarter. The cost of risk as we said earlier fell sharply leading to the <mark type="inaudible" /> operation excluding consumer finance activities which are booked in financial services were minus two if we had &#x2013; and which is in consumer finance business we will be comfortably positive, so <mark type="inaudible" /> was making profit in the third quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>The commercial <mark type="inaudible" /> and the Mediterranean Basin, Sub-Saharan Africa and French Overseas Territories was characterized by a rapid growth in the loan outstanding plus 2.5% over the quarter and deposit outstanding plus 5.9%, a gain across the quarter.</p>
          <p>To capture the regions potential we have opened 12 new branches during the quarter. 45 new branches year-to-date and also we have provided new mobile payment services in three countries in Africa, namely Ivory Coast, Madagascar and Senegal.</p>
          <p>In CE, the situation remained mixed with the division reporting growth in loan outstanding by plus 0.9% in Czech Republic. As I say Czech Republic is almost back to pre-crisis level in term of both cost of risk and profitability.</p>
          <p>In Romania, we maintain selective loan approval policy and we have also implemented control the operating expenses which fell by 3.3% over the nine months this year adjusted for on a like-for-like basis.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in Greece, as we say we continue to pursue strict reduction of OpEx in Greece and also we booked as already mentioned provisions. On net basis, you can see the continuation of revenues increase by 3.1% when compared to last year and the increase in group net income is 36% at &#x20AC;149 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 10 on specialized financial services and insurance, starting with the insurance activities which continued to report excellent performances with the system growth in net life insurance inflows, this is not just linked to the net French network but also to our activities in Morocco, Czech Republic and Luxemburg. And also we are seeing the good trend on the life insurance business as already commented.</p>
          <p>In equipment finance, we have seen the stabilization of the new business which is almost now breakeven compared to last year. Margin continued to be satisfactory and thus this has helped the improvement in profitability of SG equipment finance.</p>
          <p>In fleet management, you can see that there also we have seen a good trend in the increase in fleet by plus 3.4% with now more than 820,000 vehicle as of end of September. I remind you also that last week, we closed the sell of ECS to Econocom. The deal is a way to show that we are continuing to refocus this division, two businesses which are extremely steady with the rest of the Group.</p>
          <p>In consumer finance, we also continue to refocus on car financing which is one of the key strengths of the division. And also to expand in Russia in synergy with the rest of the Group as I said posting off, has achieved an extremely strong third quarter of 2010. Overall you can see that the net income at &#x20AC;87 million, show a strong increase compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Page 11, with private banking, global investment management and services, we can say that in a luckless environment private banking confirmed its ability to maintain a satisfactory inflow of &#x20AC;0.9 billion equivalent to 4.5% inflow rate on an annualized basis and also stable margin at 99 basis points, so almost 100 which is our target.</p>
          <p>If you look at the asset under management, with the negative exchange rate impact we have -- we are almost stable at &#x20AC;82 billion compared to end of June, but this is a 10% increase compared to last year.</p>
          <p>In custody business we have experienced a good commercial momentum particularly with the signing of mandate with credit risk activity in Europe in the third quarter and we saw assets in our custody increasing by almost 10% over the one year and we also seen a strong control of our operating expenses as you can see which have declined by 8% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>In <mark type="inaudible" /> combined with seasonal effects, Newedge increased its market share to 12.7% compared with 11.5% in the second quarter. Naturally, asset management, the outflow from TCW continued to slowdown falling to minus &#x20AC;1.6 billion compared to minus 2.7 billion in the second quarter. And the MetWest integration is completed and as you can see, we have also nice successes in the five Morningstar funds of both MetWest and TCW in term of increase of these mutual funds.</p>
          <p>To conclude you can see that the contribution to group net income of <mark type="inaudible" /> has increased compared to last year at &#x20AC;80 million including Amundi equity-accounted contribution of &#x20AC;28 million.</p>
          <p>Let's finish up page 12 with corporate investment banking, I would say last but not least, CIB reported sound results in the third quarter with net banking income of 1.9 billion, 10% compared to Q2, but also with the co-activities which have delivered slightly above &#x20AC;2 billion revenues for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>This is explained by the financing and advisory businesses which had another very good quarter at &#x20AC;729 million of revenues, up 11 compared to Q2. Despite the usual negative seasonal effects, especially for the DCM activities, we have been able to complete such deal like Telef&#xF3;nica that you can see on the slide and structured financing activities has experienced a record quarter with the growth of 20% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>For the Global Market divisions, with revenues of almost &#x20AC;1.3 billion, we can say that the success of this third quarter show the balance contribution from both equities and fixed income, currency and commodities.</p>
          <p>Starting wit the equities, with market conditions which are still sluggish, nevertheless it was less negative that in previous quarter. And we have been able to achieve a rebound of 79% to &#x20AC;639 million, thanks a sound commercial performance for derivatives, including both structure and through products.</p>
          <p>We notable maintain a high tracker market share in Europe, we will share -- we will comment further more during the Q&amp;A. On the fixed income currencies and commodities activities, revenues are stable at 656 million compared to Q2. But I remind you that in Q2 we booked a revaluation of the option <mark type="inaudible" /> for almost &#x20AC;100 million. So adjusted for that, the rebound is between 15 to 20% and this is driven with -- by the vigilance of rate flows and also benefiting from the positive trends that we have reported since last year for all emerging underlyings, particularly in CE which is one of the key strategic objective of Ambition SG 2015 which is to cross sell more on this region.</p>
          <p>Also in fixed income which is a second target of Ambition SG 2015, structured products for the fixed activities has also reported good results, demonstrating our capacity to cross sell and cross subsidize the knowledge from equities into the fixed division.</p>
          <p>What also is important to mention is that this performance has been achieved with VaR stable before netting effects, showing that we are continuing to deliver a strict risk management policy during the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the legacy asset which is the last bullet point, I would say that the most important factor is &#x20AC;2.6 billion of disposal amortization. The contribution, as we said, is in line with the guidance, or low end of the guidance that we have updated as of midyear.</p>
          <p>Let's conclude now on page 13 with a Corporate Center. As I said, we have &#x20AC;216 million of non-economic, so marked-to-market of the CDS minus 68 and mark-to-market of our own spread minus 88. And also exceptional item which is booking negative revenues for the fine linked to the Cheque Image Exchange Commission for &#x20AC;60 million. This is not tax deductible, so this is going through the bottom-line fully. And thus, you can see also, that the initial equity portfolio is in range of &#x20AC;170 million.</p>
          <p>To conclude on page 14, I would like to highlight the Group's rebound over the last nine months. With the Group net income of &#x20AC;3 billion, we have confirmed the soundness of our model and also this has been fueled by a strong commercial and financial momentum of all our activities.</p>
          <p>You remember that mid-June during our Investor Day we presented our ambition for 2015 and the measure that we intent to adopt to transform the Group also by 2012. The French Networks are strong development phase thanks to the introduction of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Marseillaise de Cr&#xE9;dit that will be in the P&amp;L as from the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On the other hand the specialized financial services are refocusing their key activities particularly as I mentioned through the <mark type="inaudible" /> sell of which was completed last week.</p>
          <p>Finally, corporate investment banking has consolidated customer-oriented model and also strengthened its strict management policy and this has resulted in the satisfactory performance in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our result for the quarter and the last nine months together with outlook on the group's soundness prove our ability to adhere to the new Basel III capital requirements with the Core Tier 1 ratio estimated at 7.5% 1st of Jan 2013, 8.5 by end of 2013 and this without phasing, and without raising capital on the market.</p>
          <p>I am now ready to answer your question with the people around me. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Hi, Didier. This is Jean Francois Neuez from Goldman Sachs. I have quick series of questions if you don't mind. The first question is on the increase in risk weighted assets for Basel III. I was just wondering whether you could give us the contribution to that 129 billion coming from the legacy assets, please. Also in terms of the legacy asset the recent market condition with this put back in the U.S. seems to have let to more liquidity or higher prices for certain classes of RMBS. And I just was &#x2013; I was just wondering whether you had &#x2013; see some opportunities or seen improvement in that market for you to potentially improve the selling process? Then obviously it become natural to ask you about the first few weeks of the next quarter, so I was wondering if you could give us some guidance on fourth quarter CIB or maybe just give us some color?</p>
          <p>And then finally, I was just wondering, could you please tell us what is the book value of the custody business, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean Francois, good afternoon. Regarding the increase in the risk weighted assets, so if you look back to page seven, regarding the legacy asset, I would say that the bulk of the impact is coming from the &#x2013; what is current Basel II and will be in Basel 2.5 and deduction from the Tier 1. So you remember that under Basel II and Basel 2.5 we have 50% of deduction from the Tier 2, 50% from the Tier 1. And as our capital structure of the Tier 1 we have roughly 80% core and 20% non-core hybrid. This means that the deduction is coming from this legacy asset of this low weighted securitization is roughly 40% of the total. So you can say that the 2 billion which is on the third line on page seven represent 40% of the total deductions, so equivalent to 5 billion. If you multiply by 1250% to convert then into risk weighted asset, you come almost to the &#x20AC;58 billion of risk weighted assets on page seven. So this is the weight of the legacy asset as from 1st of Jan, 2013.</p>
          <p>Regarding your second question what's on legacy asset, Jean Francois I didn't catch the whole thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Apparently, with this put back option in the U.S...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the put back, okay. Yes, on the put back it should be let's say if it's still extremely uncertain and we will see the volume that will be, I would say that will be subject to this put back to the originator. That's definitely being <mark type="inaudible" />. This is marginally positive, then the magnitude is of course, has to be questioned because we don't know yet what will be the magnitude of the put back that will be sent back to originator. But it can only be positive for us looking at the structure of our activities, but I will not <mark type="inaudible" /> on that, let's say, let's wait and see for the volume that will go back to the originator.</p>
          <p>Regarding the update on the Q4 of CIB, I will give the floor to Michel. But I will say you know that we tend always to be cautious in the first months not because we just closed the third quarter, so the idea is not to be cautious, because there is a problem here or there, it's just that we tend to restrict ourselves in term of any guidance, but Michel maybe just to explain in more detail what we've done in third quarter especially with a good month of September and then to look more let's say on the long-term trend <mark type="inaudible" /> October.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the September has been a different month compared to July and August. July was difficult overall for the industry and August has been pretty slow traditionally. September, we've seen a resuming of client business, both in equity and fixed income and see a strong trend in financing and also some interesting deals in corporate finance and advisory. So the client business is -was much better in September and we are very cautious for October and &#x2013; but nothing we &#x2013; but still have to comment about.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we say very cautious it is that we are cautious in the disclosure, it is not very cautious on the trend. Especially, because when we look at the evolution of the market, let's say, they are not that many different from what we've seen in September. Regarding the book value of the <mark type="inaudible" /> custody, let's say this is a business which is, I would say, initially called businesses for most of it. The bulk of the &#x2013; we have some goodwill coming from the <mark type="inaudible" /> which is partly goodwill and partly also intangible. This is a contract which is amortized over year. Let's say we will not give you some specific figures, but this is an asset as we said where we intend to participate at some point maybe, to the consolidation that we do expect to see on the market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Brice Vandamme from Deutsche Bank. I will limit me actually to three quick questions. The first one is related to the increase in VaR that we've seen in Q3 compared to Q2 at 45 versus 28. Could you please just tell us what it means in terms of risk appetite from your CIB platform?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to Basel 3, if I read well your slide on the impact, I see no part or no capital allocated to acquisitions. Does it mean that you don't want to go back to acquisition over the next two years or do we have to actually conclude from that, that if you do acquisition you will have to raise capital? And last question, could you give us some updated guidances on your legacy assets and in particular, if Q3 was actually the end of some write-backs on the ABS portfolio sold by SGAM or on some write-backs on monolines, as well as are you potentially impacted by a bankruptcy of <mark type="inaudible" />? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brice, good afternoon. Regarding the VaR increase, as I said &#x2013; let's say, when you look at each underlying <mark type="inaudible" /> VaR is stable. So the increase in the VaR is coming entirely from the netting which has been less efficient, I would say. Usually, let's say it depends of two factors: first, the hedging strategy, let's say that can be slightly shifted and definitely in second quarter we had a defensive positioning due to market condition. And secondly, also it depends on the scenario which has played for each underlying and, let's say sometimes they do compensate better than some other. So it's something that you can partly monitor, but also something is more result of calculation.</p>
          <p>So nothing to say apart from that. Regarding the increase in capital, let's say, definitely you know that on the VaR you have to convert into10 days VaR and then there is a mitigating factor to convert into the market risk weighted assets. So you have the full detail in the appendices on the evolution of the market risk weighted assets as corporate investment banking.</p>
          <p>Regarding your point on Basel 3, whether let's say, we will or we have the capacity to make or to complete any acquisition. First, as I said on the 40 bps of mitigating factor. This is a conservative assumption so this means that we have three levels that we could activate partially to achieve that but if necessary, let's say we could decide to go a little bit further.</p>
          <p>Regarding an acquisition at this point. I remind you what we have seen &#x2013; what we said in June is that looking our business model we are keen, let's say to first concentrate on organic growth and let's say if there was some bolt-on acquisition to do as we have seen <mark type="inaudible" /> we could also decide to make some arbitration within the portfolio so that, let's say the impact will be limited.</p>
          <p>So there is no, let's say, a veto on acquisition. It's just that currently there is nothing extremely attractive, especially after what we've said &#x2013; what we made for the <mark type="inaudible" /> end-of-year for the French retail banking business, for example; and thus we will be in a wait-and-see but this is not a priority. Want first to concentrate on model and to grow organically and I think SocGen compared to most <mark type="inaudible" /> as a stronger gross and the debt in its business model.</p>
          <p>Regarding the guidance on the legacy assets, this was the last point. The write-back on the ABS and the impact on <mark type="inaudible" />. Well, you know as we said, you have that on true detail on the appendices, page 43. Well, you can see that most of it, let's say &#x2013; most of it is close to zero. We have some further losses on the liquidity books, which is linked to a basis effect on the RMBS compared to ABS and you have seen that we have deleveraged further this portfolio. What I can see also is that on the shadow P&amp;L it has for the sole loans and receivable part half from minus 1.3 billion to minus 0.7 billion between end of June and end of September. Now we are, let's say, in positive territory for the CMBS and CLOs which is important and confirmed the BlackRock, the BlackRock assessment.</p>
          <p>Your last point was on <mark type="inaudible" /> you remember that we are exposed to the insurance company what is currently in to trouble is the holding company. Under the insurance legislation, the insurance company is ring-fenced compared to the holding. And also the remaining exposure on Amback on the insurance side on the holding company is extremely limited. It's something like between &#x20AC;20 to &#x20AC;30 million, so it's a non-issue for us.</p>

          <p>So just coming back to my second question, when you say you could go further in term of mitigation options. Well, I translate that into something you already said in the past which is you are still open to some potential disposal of activities?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Didier. First, could you indicate us for what value the legacy asset, risk weighted asset at the end of 2013 in your assumption, because <mark type="inaudible" /> having from January to December to comply with the 1% increase, maybe it's too much? Second question, regarding the 8.5% equity Tier-1 and 2013, is this something which points to must have from the point of view of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale or could your model accept to go further higher in this ratio. I mean for instance, if there was a systemic buffer at a higher repo impose on you and together this Basel III for us subject to pile up more capital than the pace of risk weighted asset growth. How can you streamline the deficit in profitability in ROE of the group against that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question is by 2013 how can we be confined with the 100 bps increase that we're between 7.5% to 8.5%. Just to be slightly brief, half of that is coming from the profit for 2013 net of cash dividends minus the organic growth, I would say. And the rest is coming roughly 50-50 from firstly it was assumption that we will have the scrip dividends for 2012 with a <mark type="inaudible" /> of 60%, so this will be &#x2013; in 2013 that we will have this impact. And second, this is more coming from the decline of the deferred tax assets. You remember that the tax loss carried forward are not subject to the franchise, they are fully deducted from the core Tier-1 and let's say by end of 2013 almost all the tax loss carried forward of the group will have been absorbed, and so this is a second level that already played through in 2012-2013 and will be almost fully absorbed by 2014.</p>
          <p>Regarding the 8.5% by 2013 whether it's a must have or whether we could grow further up, especially looking at <mark type="inaudible" /> question. While, first, But first I'd say no, <mark type="inaudible" /> as I said, 8.5% if you come back to the Basel II ratio by end of 2013, what we just showed the projection by end of 2012. As I said, this is a doubling of the capital compared to pre-crisis levels. So from our perspective this is already an extremely strong effort that we will have to comply and all banks would have to comply with that.</p>
          <p>When I look at the business model of SocGen, so I said that, to assume the following this option, just to see what could be a blended common equity Tier 1 for a group like us. If I start with the 10% on the market activities, not the financing which are in CIB but just the market activities, I put 8 for all activities but the French network and I put a 7 for the French networks. As a blended common equity Tier 1 obtained is roughly 8.5%. So in my view, as we have also diversification benefit in term of potential shock that any or each of this division could be &#x2013; could seen. I feel that something, let's say, around 8% or around 8.5% seems at this appropriate with the profile of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>
          <p>Looking at the question about the systemic buffer, first of all let's wait for the Financial Stability Board discussion which are due to give a final answer by mid-2011 or first half of 2011. I will remind you that there are three subject, not just to pile up capital, which is more, let's say, a kind of Anglo-Saxon view. But also the question of the improvement of the supervision, as well as also working on recovery and resolution plan and we feel that it's like when you are in a car. You could have a larger airbag, it's not that, that will be the sole protection. So it is better in our view to train better the driver, and also maybe to make more cops, than just to increase the airbag to discuss with this question about systemic risk.</p>
          <p>So we are currently more in favor of getting maybe more cops so more supervision, and we feel that in France it did work well, also to improve and train better the driver, and we are working on it and we are working on our business model to be less volatile, rather than just to say that with a larger air bag we will be better protected.</p>
          <p>And lastly, regarding equity definitely we will have to retain more earnings regarding retention or scrip dividend. At this point I would say we continue to work on the assumption of this 6 billion target by 2012. Nevertheless we feel that currently we have taken almost all the negatives in term of capital impact, definitely with same needs for higher capital by all activities in all banks, we could also have some positive impact regarding the margins which we've not discounted when we have made our projection by last June and thus this will also counterbalance partly the impact on the return on equity that will come from higher earning retention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Good afternoon, Didier. You mentioned in the press release that there are steps-several fundamental points on Basel III that have still to be defined, could you just update us on that and in particular what the likelihood is of material changes to counterparty risk at the CVA framework. What do you think could be changes of the use of bond equivalent methodology or the double counting on CVA? Second question, a very broad one on capital &#x2013; whatever the endgame is on capital and whatever anyone may think about what the right level is for you, the difference is very wide between yourselves and a large part of your global investment banking peers and looks unlikely to change given the more difficult regulation they face.</p>
          <p>What do you think that does to your competitive position in the markets division, particularly in areas like credit that are a bit more balance sheet intensive, if your hurdle rate of return is lower than the peers that you are facing. Is this something that you are thinking about in terms of future strategy? And then lastly, if you could just update us on the outlooks and margins in France because they were again quite strong despite the rise in the <mark type="inaudible" /> and I guess weakness the below trend revenue growth came really from commissions. So if you can just give us an update on mainly France, please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Omar, good afternoon. So regarding Basel III, as we said and as you noticed <mark type="inaudible" /> question, which I'd say as you mention for the CVA, in our calculation we have taken as an assumption that we will get the &#x2013; the sensitivity methodology which from people in the industry is the most appropriate one in terms of assessing these capital charge against valuation of CVA. Second point for example is also at what level you look at as a minority interest from your subsidiaries. We have taken as an assumption that this will be taken on top of 7% so the 4.5% minimum plus the 2.5% consolidation buffer. And regarding the treatment of insurance, we had used the financial which now I assume continue to be appropriate, it was just recently bought it. So there is no reason to change this item.</p>
          <p>Regarding your point on the endgame of target level of capital, I would say it's a difficult question, because of the results. I remind you that just three months ago, certain investor or certain analyst were seeing that most of U.S. large banks will be able to restore relatively quickly share buyback because they were over-capitalized. And looking at what have been disclosed over the last two weeks on the Basel III, I think the mood has slightly changed. So maybe, let's say, there is balance to wait. As I said, currently with our business model, you mentioned maybe these pieces which are at 10% minimum, let's say, but we are more retail and less geared to pure capital market activities than certain Swiss banks. We see as I explained we are, let's say, at appropriate level at 8.5% with 27%, 8% and 10% depending on the business model.</p>
          <p>Lastly, regarding margin in France, the 2.1 &#x2013; net interest margin is currently stable at 2.44%. As we said, we would nevertheless continue to have in Q4 the headwind coming from the increase in regular settings roughly to make that short we said that H2 we will have a minus &#x20AC;60 million of revenue impact, it was minus 20 in Q3 as we had for two months <mark type="inaudible" /> and one month the passbook, it would be &#x20AC;40 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Having said that I think this is partly mitigated by strong improvement that we've seen in the liquidity position of the networks. Just to show that also we're making &#x2013; we're taking actions in this environment, deposit increase Q3, Q3 was &#x20AC;13 billion, increased about by 6.5 billion, so on the net basis there were 6.5 billion additional liquidity provided by the French Networks over the last 12 months and is of course has reduced in the net interest margin calculations as a reliance on wholesale funding. On the lending side, let's say margins are, let's say, seen on the mortgages but better than what we see at the worst of the cycle. And on the corporate lending I'd say, it has gone down slightly, but it's still, let's say slightly above the bad book, but not that much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Just coming back to the first question, I guess my question is do you see any incremental change to the CVA and counterparty risk framework, from what you've presented to us today. So I don't know &#x2013; through lobbying or any new changes to the framework?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think &#x2013; well on the CVA side, that's in the discussion that were conducted between the industry and the Basel Committee and the regulators, let's say were essentially link to this option about &#x2013; the question of double-counting which has been partly addressed, but more importantly the question of migrating from the bond equivalent methodology into the idea-sensitivity methodology which seems to be more appropriate. And as I said, we have used, let's say, the second option, which seems to be now the most likely outcome for the discussion between regulators and the industry. So I feel that the outcome is relatively now not finalized, but seems to be almost done.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to start off with French retail, actually just to come back to the points just discussed. If I look at slide 25 actually, you can see quite a sharp increase in the interest income from both the individual customer as well as the business customer on a sequential basis, 6% and 8% respectively. I just wanted to try and understand that a little bit better. And also the offsetting change in terms of the other line within that.</p>
          <p>And also maybe if you could provide us with some kind of guidance for 2011, we are looking at 3.5%, I think, revenue growth for this year. I guess, we are expecting a further slowdown going into 2011.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the financing advisory side, just wondering if you could give us a bit more color on structured financing, to what extent is this volume driven story, to what extent is it better margins? And what kind of outlook can we imagine for 2011? Clearly, it's been a very strong growth area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Kinner. I will take the first two questions and I will let Michel answer for the last one on the financial advisory. Well, regarding the revenues on page 25, I think Investor Relations will come back to you after this call to detail a bit more on this. Nevertheless, I think the trends we have to look at the whole net interest income which has slightly increased compared to Q2. On the mix, let's say we'll come back to you.</p>
          <p>Regarding the trends that we could expect entering into 2011 let's say, a start to the year we said that we will have a strong H1 and the basis of comparisons that was &#x2013; that would be more challenging in H2 especially as we had already known the fact that the likelihood we'd see an increase in <mark type="inaudible" /> was relatively almost certain. So we are let's say bang in line with the guidance that definitely entering to 2011 we will have not sustained momentum than when entering in to 2010 we would provide you our new guidance, this is always the rule of the game during the fourth quarter result, the full year result we will provide you more guidance for what we could expect for 2011 for revenue gross of the French networks.</p>
          <p>Michel regarding the financial advisory to give more detail about the driver of this activity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Clearly the market has been a very good one with respect to the level of margins from the financing side, especially on the structured financing, especially on the natural resources financing where margins stayed at a high level we've seen last year. A bit down on the export finance, but up on acquisition finance and overall this has been a good trend for us. And you know that we are a leading player in this field. And together with that, although the M&amp;A advisory industry has been in Europe mainly a bit subdued. We are, Russia's trying some good pick-up with the development and the investment on that part which we started a year ago.</p>

          <p>Just to conclude, Kinner, this is definitely <mark type="inaudible" /> kind of French touch as we do share and this translates <mark type="inaudible" /> and this type of activity which is also extremely secured is a low-risk business and this explains also why we've got not only just a strong top line growth but also you've seen that in the provisioning line a cost of which is clearly low on this business.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I just have three questions. The first one is on the provisioning trends. If you could give some color on you would expect provisions in Romania to stabilize or maybe even start declining and also in Greece maybe as well. The second thing is also on just going back on the Basel 3 slide and the mitigation. The 30 basis points that you indicated by end of 2012. Is that you would say just accounting for the running off of also securitization and active mitigation on the CDA side or would you expect it more to come in the next few years as your portfolio runs off by 2015. And lastly, just on the ROE in the investment bank, given the increase that you &#x2013; that we've seen on the Basel 3, how much should we expect to have and how would that compare to what you guided in June at you Investor Day. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Regarding your first question on the trends in Romania and Greece, I think let's say &#x2013; we could say that this kind of plateau that we should expect for the coming quarters. Let's say Romania, we've seen the economic environment and so it was minus 8% contraction last year. We have some slight rebound in Q1, but now it's going down in Q3, Q4. For the full year we will have minus 25%. So based on that despite the fact that we are these are extremely well-positioned on its market, now it has extremely low cost to income, you can see that in the appendices, that despite a 300 basis point that we have reported, we continue to deliver a mid teen return on equity after tax. We feel that we should have two to three quarters of relatively high cost of <mark type="inaudible" />. And in Greece, let's say, the same picture. You can clearly &#x2013; the Greece situation is not improving. This is not deteriorating, but continues to be challenging.</p>
          <p>On the Basel III, the 40 bps that we mentioned, this is a level, which are totally exploited altogether. So let's say, we have certain room of maneuver . Your point was more linked to the legacy assets, <mark type="inaudible" /> amoritize and confirming the credit value that we have and that BlackRock has also looked at, is more, of course, the risk weighed assets will be absorbed over time. So this will also be an additional level that will mechanically and without any acceleration plate's full also after 2013.</p>
          <p>Last but not least on the return on equity of the investment banks. Let's say, we made ex the legacy asset, a quick calculation. We have &#x20AC;500 billion of risk weighted asset at the Group level under Basel 3. The risk weighted asset linked to &#x2013; the CIB core activity should be roughly one-third of the total. And so if you put a 10% core Tier 1 and we deliver the middle of the range that we've presented in June, you should obtain something in the range of 15% after-tax return on equity for these activities which in our view is extremely satisfactory. Next question?</p>

          <p>Hello? Sorry &#x2013; Maxence, Morgan Stanley. Didier, one question regarding the legacy assets, the 2 billion that you have disclosed are CMBS and RMBS, are you able to give us a little bit of color of which kind of vintage have you been able to sell?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for the CMBS, this is '06, '07 vintages that were sold during the quarter. For the RMBS, let me check, it is also '06 '07 so it is relatively short &#x2013; well, recent that's not the best quality asset that were sold, to ensure that there's liquidity for these assets and that we were able to de-leverage on this part of our exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then to follow-up on the legacy portfolio, can we say now that you're moving to more kind of dynamic strategy on that one to reduce as quick as you can or you're still saying okay, there's the 1.5 billion of capital gain of Blackrock and to go for natural attrition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will say that it's exactly the strategy that we mentioned in June which is not a dynamic that's accelerating &#x2013; just accelerating. We have in this portfolio certain assets which are money good. It was confirmed by Blackrock. We clearly stated that in June and where we have a positive carry. We have also a positive benefit from valuation and convergence. Just to mention, let's say, if we have so, for example, all our CMBS portfolio in June. Look at the rally that we've seen on the CMBS and also on the cash assets and you would have seen that we would have lost internal valuation.</p>
          <p>Certain of these assets are not consuming capital, because they continue to be regulated. For CMBS for example, they are Fed eligible, so they are funded let's say easily and thus, let's say, for us just we have certain other rates, which is a level at which we feel that we could abandon part of the carry to the market, because <mark type="inaudible" /> above return.</p>
          <p>So it's something relatively pragmatic that we continue to have on this portfolio. You've seen that certain of the most problematic exposures I'd say have been addressed over the last quarters with P&amp;L impact that was limited and in line with our expectation. So we will continue to fine tune this portfolio in the coming quarter to come.</p>

          <p>Hi, I've got two questions. The first ones relates to the corporate center. If I exclude these three big one-offs, I get to something like a negative 36 million for the corporate center, which actually seems quite good. I had in mind, but maybe I was &#x2013; I'm wrong. But I had in mind that you had guided for roughly 100 million of negative revenues per quarter. So I was wondering whether there was anything particular in there? And the second one relates to the treatment of insurance under Basel III. If the EU directive of financial conglomerate is scrapped or cancelled under Basel III, will you actually have an impact for insurance? Because you have partial recognition that you're not using much for the stakes in various financial institutions, so in any case that should not have an impact, is that correct or no?</p>

          <p>Regarding the first point about the minus fee operating income, excluding <mark type="inaudible" /> we tend to be always conservative, so we say that it varies. You have there certain, how can I say it, unavoidable volatility which come from the &#x2013; there's a hedge that we have on the equities on the <mark type="inaudible" /> share <mark type="inaudible" /> which are equity instruments. And thus let's say we hedged them in term of rate just because we don't want to take a rate risk. <mark type="inaudible" />. But however, they are equity instruments that are not eligible to the hedge policy. And thus we have a mark-to-market let's say of these instruments, which are <mark type="inaudible" /> this quarter, it's not a huge question. And I confirm you that for the rest, we have no operating activity in the corporate center, so let's say we have nothing indiscernible] portfolio has been strongly reduced, and thus we have no operating activity in this corporate center division.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Didier. One &#x2013; well, two questions. First, regarding on French retail banking and commissions, I mean they are down 2% for service commissions. I was just wondering whether it is reflecting some regulatory changes, some changes in <mark type="inaudible" /> and what you would expect basically I mean for the next quarter in terms of trends for commissions in France? And second question, back on the new risk-weighted asset Basel III and your guided 10% equity location, can you update us on the capital allocation for the group as a whole in 2012? It was a picture you gave in June?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrick, good afternoon. Regarding the first point, regarding service commission, well definitely there is clearly certain pressure from regulator and also from consumers, which wait on this while there was some also impact of low activity on the corporate side. Also regarding, let's say for example, commitment line or this type of things which have been also impacting the service commission this quarter. So let's look at the full year, but definitely service commission will be let's say a low-growth activities going forward <mark type="inaudible" /> for example that we will have next year certain things <mark type="inaudible" /> just to take certain examples, we came up with payment impact.</p>
          <p>Regarding the capital allocation to the business line that we have disclosed in June, while the major impact is of course on the CIB business, which will be inflated by the other three. Nevertheless <mark type="inaudible" /> and looking at the <mark type="inaudible" /> debt, we feel comfortable to have a business model where approximately 40% of the activity will be on risk weighted asset side in CIB, and the rest will be on the retail and financial services and asset gathering.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Didier. Good afternoon. Three quick questions, if I may. First one is on the cost of credit in Russia, which has decreased on a quarterly basis from 4.20 to 2.50 in the third quarter, which I understand probably is not sustain. So I was just wondering whether you had any reversal of the provisions, and what do you think a sustainable level. The second question is on the CIB division, where the capital allocated has increased from 8.7 billion to 9.6 billion. That's an increase of 10%, and the risk weighted assets if I'm correct, they only increase by 2%, so where the increase in the capital is coming from? And finally, going back to the Basel III and the calculation of the common equity Tier 1. You said that the payout should be in the region of 35%, the cash component should be in the region of 15%. I'm just wondering whether you can share your thoughts, and if you think that other banks will follow in distributing more strict dividend going forward and in having a payout ratio in the region of 35% in line with your &#x2013; what actually you are proposing. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Regarding Russia, well the decrease &#x2013; let's say we take our own calculation &#x2013; is from 3.28 to 1.80 in term of cost of risk. I would say what we can say rather than to talk about reversal, it's just that we're showing new allowances were lower that what we have seen in the previous quarter. When you look the Russian market, economic recovery is picking up relatively strongly, let's say, we are seeing some improvement, first on the retail side and also on the corporate side. And so this explain you why we've seen this decrease in the cost of risk. I say again, we are excepting this trend I said to continue across 2011, as there will be normalization &#x2013; not on the same pace, but at least a decrease in 2011 &#x2013; as there is let's say an economic recovery that will be confirmed in Russia .</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding the increase of capital allocated to CIB, which is not <mark type="inaudible" /> to the risk-weighted assets because our allocation is 7% of the risk weighted assets plus the deduction which we have to face from the Tier-1 in the calculation. So this is essentially <mark type="inaudible" /> there was an increase, you can see that in the appendices when we calculate the ratio for the group as a whole, the bulk of cost reduction coming in from the securitization is linked to <mark type="inaudible" /> bulk as a whole, and thus <mark type="inaudible" /> allocation to CIB in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Lastly, regarding the payout ratios, as we said, it's a 35% payout ratio with an assumption of the 60% take-up in scrip. I remind you that first, you cannot oblige scrip dividend in France, so it's always an option, you have first to propose cash and then it is investors, which can <mark type="inaudible" /> subscription whether they take the cash or they take the share.</p>
          <p>When we look at the historical trend, let's say 60% is roughly the average of what we've seen in 2010 and what we've seen in 2009. In 2009, the take up was slightly higher, 2010 is slightly lower; but 2010 was say was done during the Euro zone stress I would say and also the dividend was relatively small, this means that the capacity to have sufficient share to get one new share was limited.</p>
          <p>Going forward with rebound of the profitability of the group, also the fact that we tend to propose, let's say for the scrip dividends as always, let's say, 10% maximum discount for the new share compared to a weighted average share price before the AGM. We feel that it will be an attractive proposal for investors, which want to continue to be associated with a growth story like Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale and want to remain in the banking sector.</p>
          <p>So that's why, let's say we feel that it is a fair assumption and also good proposal as we want to continue to be a income company also regarding the yield that we are able to share to our investors.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>It's from Autonomous. Good afternoon gentlemen, 2 quick questions. When I look at your mitigation of 40 basis points, that's really, really low, Didier. Looking at the disposals you could make on some of your non-core business, I reckon that could probably be 40, 50 basis points and if on top of it you can play around the 58 billion of actually toxic assets and securitization, 40 bps, still like pretty much half of what you could effectively do on mitigations. So I was wondering, what really drove being so conservative on that. And the second question I have very quickly, it seems your Group non-performing loans have now pretty much flattened out, you have just I think 600 million Group non-performing loan on top of what you had last quarter. Is it safe to say that this is the peak NPL everything being equal in the economic environment at that stage, thank you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jacques-Henri, good afternoon. Well, I would say your question already had the answer in the first one. So I will not add something. And we said we are not willing to activate all the lever in the 40 basis point and thus &#x2013; ideally we are saying willing to propose you a projection which was fair, i.e. assuming dividend payment, risk weighted asset growth, certain mitigation, also certain assumption and not let's say aggressive with no growth of the risk weighted assets, huge mitigation or let's say no growth of the risk weighted assets or the dividends. So that's something that we have, we feel is reasonable, we have certain movements but as I said also the level that we are able to achieve by end of 2012 and end of 2013 will require extreme discipline and also already a doubling of the capital level compared to what we have pre-crisis which seems to be already fair compared to what the regulators are expecting from us.</p>
          <p>Regarding the non-performing loans, yes, they are flat net of security, the collateral that we have in Q3, Q2, this trend is observed in French retail and CIB, we continue to have a slight increase in retail outside France which is essentially coming like from Romania and Greece. So yes, we are at a level which seems to be now close from the stability.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Just 2 quick questions please. Firstly on slide 7, I'm sorry if I missed it. But did you talk about what you thought the revenue cost might be associated with the 40 basis points of mitigation for Basel III.</p>
          <p>And the second question was just on the cost of risk in International Retail Banking. I realized there is a few moving parts in there. It sounded like you thought that Greece and Romania were going to go sideways, but Russia perhaps could continue to improve. So, should we model that the cost of risk continues to come down in aggregate, but maybe at a slower pace from the drop from Q2 into Q3. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, good afternoon. So regarding the second question, I would say you can see the trend that we have seen year-to-date, so I will not comment too much into detail <mark type="inaudible" /> into, what we could expect beyond there for the fourth quarter, but we have said that we are expecting a gradual decrease of the cost of risk across the year. And so we have delivered so far.</p>
          <p>Regarding the 40 basis point mitigation, it depends let's say what could this impact on the level that we will activate, definitely I think if we were to arbitrate certain assets we will lose that contribution, yet you could have an impact <mark type="inaudible" /> in terms of net profit. If on the securitization, let's say it's a question mark. Let's say what will be the impact of accelerating disposal and loss of eventual carry.</p>
          <p>On the other side, let's say I think there is plenty of positive measures or positive inflation of margin that we have not discounted. So let's say it's in value something well balanced that we have described you on the slide 6 and 7.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question, actually 2 quick questions. The 2.6 billion euros in disposals and amortization, could you give a split of the 2 and in case of disposals, could you give us the economic result of the disposals. Did you book gains or losses on these disposals? And should we expect some further losses due to well U.S. litigation you said that it would be marginally positive, but due to the fact that some foreclosures might be delayed. And therefore maybe some &#x2013; at the end losses on some of the structured products that you have might be higher than what you estimated.</p>
          <p>And the second question is regarding the DTAs, especially, the tax losses carry-forward DTAs, could you give us the amount that you amortized since the beginning of this year over the first 9 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> good afternoon. Starting with the 2.6 &#x2013; 2 billion sale &#x2013; let me check, well, it depends on the asset classes we have this slight negative impact on the RMBS, but it was more the base effect managing the hedge during the quarter with let's say the indices which are the tightens more quickly than the cash which explained on the illustrated groups, certain negative impact, but top of my mind, because I can't find a figure, top of my mind, for example, we were able to divest certain CMBS which were in the banking group with a positive impact, so definitely depends on each category of assets. So it's difficult to have a let's say a sole answer for all asset classes. But again this is under the, in line with our expectation. So, sorry, not to be able to give you more precise figure. Maybe within the third edition we will be able to get some more detail.</p>
          <p>Your second question was, there was the DTA, there was the &#x2013; now the foreclosure impact, well, on the foreclosure impact, well, first, we have different assumptions, some say that foreclosure will be delayed by 3 to 6 months and then it will restart, some say it will be 18 months, so maybe the truth is in between. Really, as I said, it's something almost neutral, because it impact differently whether you own junior or the senior tranches. And on a net basis, we feel that in terms of foreclosure that is likely to have an impact on our assets. Maybe the put back, there was a &#x2013; huge volumes could be more significant, let's say in the impact. But as I said, we will have to see what proportion of loans will be put back to the originator.</p>
          <p>Lastly, on the deferred tax assets amortization, what I'll propose because I don't have the figures under the eyes, is to come back to Investor Relation to provide you an update where we stand in terms of tax loss carried for deferred tax assets as of end of September. <mark type="inaudible" /> we will have of course the full detail during the full year result. And you can also reach through IR from top of my mind for the 5-year result, because in the appendices you should be able to have information. Sorry not to be more precise, but it's quite technical.</p>

          <p>No, no. In fact, and also what we have completed during the third quarter is that we have obtained an update coming from BlackRock so six months after the first one and BlackRock has confirmed that lets say the trends or the quality of <mark type="inaudible" /> asset that we have presented you all the year actually and that we have presented to you in June was still valid. Let's say what we have as a reduction of the negative credit value on this year for MBS. It has been decreased by the amount of provisions that we set aside in year-to-date which is logic and positive, and on the other side lets say we have a slightly lower level of positive on the rest of the portfolio which is in line with the carry that we had booked in the P&amp;L, so I would say so far, so good, everything is under control as I said and also the equity that's confirmed that what we currently booked in P&amp;L is inline with the credit evaluation assessments as a sub part.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered already. But just sort of a quick follow up on slide seven. I mentioned what you are saying about the true to the minority interest. I just wanted to ask, I mean firstly, you are deducting in effect everything is above $0.07 Core Tier-I in terms of minority interest. Is that something you've had sort of guidance on from regulatory. Because I would have thought that areas like commercial for instance, the Czech, the Czech regulation might well &#x2013; turn around to you and say that while actually <mark type="inaudible" /> 7% ratio there. And then similarly, at least on the phasing in that you are not sort of allowing a phasing in as there is minority deduction. Again, is that just you being conservative or is that something you had guidance from the regulators on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is not a guidance from the regulator. This is currently our assumption. As we said for the minority interest you could have a 7% and in our view middle position, you could have kind of worst case which will be 4.5%. You could have the best case which is one you mention which would be the below two requirements of the local regulator. Regarding the phasing our reading of the tax is at by construction there is no phasing on the minority interest as such. It is not a reduction it's a <mark type="inaudible" />, but I would say maybe this is &#x2013; again, this is not a guidance from the regulators. It is our own reading, our assumption and we have to take certain position in this calculation, maybe you will find that it is bit conservative but at least this is what we have decided to present to you.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just two questions, first, the risk-weighted asset growth. You have indicated 4%. Does it include specific measure such as decreasing the blend in lending or the switch to Basel 2 methods or reduction in operational risk-weighted assets? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is, the adjustments, you indicating in terms of inflation of risk-weighted assets as of 2012 or early 2013. So what is exactly the position today? What is the risk weighted inflation today because probably you are taking some measures already to adjust your portfolio or your activities between 2011, 2012 and for example what would be the CGA today rather than at the end of 2012. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean Pierre, on the 4% risk-weighted asset growth, this is a fair kind of you know, reasonable organic growth that banks could be able to deploy for the next two years. Having in mind that let's say definitely we will be in a low growth environment in Western Europe even if we will be able to capture and I think this is differentiating on all side above average growth from the EMEA now emerging market exposure. So in here it seems to well blended growth organic that we are able to deliver for the next two years.</p>
          <p>The calculation as of today, let's say, first we are making the exercise by 2012/13. Unfortunately, we are not in the <mark type="inaudible" /> at this point for you Jean Pierre, so we stick to this calculation by 2012, 2013. Certain impact will not be that much different as the value adjustment, it is not something which is more that much volatile. And that it is more based on the, I would say, best estimate of current position that we have to update within 2012. But I would say I am not there to calculate. It was a huge exercise internally to calculate the <mark type="inaudible" /> on something as we discussed in the previous question continue to be in certain aspect, and moving target, so just for you to have a better anticipation of our capacity to meet this new regulatory constrain, let's say, short period of time. Again, having certain conservative assumption and not having activity, all the level that we can use.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good, and regarding the earnings impact of all these adjustments, can you give some ideas of what kind of movements we can expect? I mean I am talking about CIB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in fact Jean Pierre, we already did answer to this question. I think there is on the CIB, the point is whether let's say looking at this additional constrain kind of capital. What will be the marking inflation that we would have in certain activities and again, in the projection that we've used in term of P&amp;L. We have to stick to the plan that was presented last June, so it's a &#x20AC;6 billion net profit by 2012. So the factor is something which is maybe certainly we feel that its optimistic as there would be a pressure, maybe some other will say that it's a conservative as we will have certain business that will have no choice then to reprise if they want to deliver such <mark type="inaudible" /> performance of profit for their shareholders. So it was medium and balanced position.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello everybody, just a quick question regarding the insurance business, we know that the insurance business today is quite gloomy either in life and non-life activities and we see in the same time that in France, we've seen the down consumer very strong with <mark type="inaudible" /> and on the same time when I look at the figures of SocGen, I see that woefully the net income of insurance business is &#x20AC;200 million per year with capital above</p>
          <p>&#x20AC;2 billion and probably we don't know of course that probably, occurs due to Basel III. What is your view regarding the maintaining of this activity inside SocGen, would be more interesting for you to &#x2013; and for your networks to externalize this activity with bigger plans, I would say, in this regard. Or at least what is your strategic objective if you tend to maintain the insurance business inside SocGen in terms of profitability and net income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Pierre, two points, first of all, when I look at the life insurance and on our life insurance business, as you said, delivering extremely strong performance year-to-date. And we continue to believe that it's a core part of the distribution or the offering that we are aiming to deliver, not just in France, we have both <mark type="inaudible" /> Sogecap working in synergy with the French networks within France. And as I said during the presentation, Sogecap, for example, has subsidiaries in Czech Republic which is working extremely strongly with Komer&#x10D;n&#xED; Banka, this is KB. We have also insurance activity in Russia, in Morocco. So in this part also via development model of retail &#x2013; international retail banking business.</p>
          <p>Regarding the profitability of this activity, well, first of all you could have different convention between this Group, whether, let's say you give the margin more in the network or more in the life insurance companies. So this is something which I can differ. But also regarding the taxing requirements, Solvency II is likely definitely for business like Sogecap to reduce the capital requirement. And remember that what we are currently allocating, let's say, in all of the banking cash allocation is not, let's say, what we have in term of Basel II capital requirement which is 75% of the minimum solvency margin of the life insurance activity. So this would be improved by Solvency II. And in term of treatment of the life insurance activities, as I said, the financial conglomerate directives continue to make such an activity, extremely synergistic with the rest of the group and, thus, we will stick to this.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Just very briefly on TCW and on the whole issue of mortgages, how is TCW potentially effected, because if I recall, you also have a servicing business in TCW?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> anything or distributed so TCW has no impact for that. You've seen also that TCW was mentioned mainly more alongside <mark type="inaudible" /> in certain discussion on the pullback rather than on the other side. So, there is no point on TCW.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But my understanding is that on the foreclosure side, that the servicer has some potential <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>TCW is not &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> is not servicing mortgages <mark type="inaudible" /> is just a collateral advisor in terms of certain structuration which has been structured by investment banks and thus, it has no risk on that side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is no risk in terms of the turnover of assets in the CDOs that you have to manage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've seen already a big part of CDO amortization linked to, let's say poor performances and we are likely to continue to see certain -- let's say, amortization <mark type="inaudible" /> on that side. But as you have seen, this has nevertheless led us to have a reduction in <mark type="inaudible" /> means that the rest of the business which is also the reason why we have decided to acquire MetWest which was to strengthen <mark type="inaudible" /> franchise not just to be exposed to the mortgage-backed securities, is performing relatively good &#x2013; relatively well and this explains why we have been able to have successes aside from these mortgage-related franchises.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And lastly, can you tell me how much of mortgage-related assets are managed now by the combined group?</p>

      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the total in U.S. dollar, the total assets of TCW are totally US$111 billion as of end of September and the mortgage franchise is roughly $25 billion of which $9 billion are CDOs.</p>

          <p>Next question is from Mrs. Anke Reingen from Execution. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Anke from Execution. I just had very small follow-up questions. Firstly, I understood you said risk weighted assets on the Basil III would be 500 billion and that would obviously imply like a core tier 1 or common equity base of 37.5 billion, which would mean that retained earnings grew quite significantly. Was the 500 billion &#x2013; did I get this number right or was it more like a rounding number? And then, secondly, on the 3.5 billion current deduction from tier 1 capital, how much of this is related to securitizations? And then, just lastly, I'm just trying to understand your legacy assets they are coming down in like nominal terms, but the allocated equity to the division increases quite significantly. Is this something to do with averaging or is this a reflection of that the capital consumption of the division is going up despite the fact that the absolute exposure has been managed down? And then, with respect to what this potentially could mean for Basel III increase of risk-weighted assets, is this taking some sort of assumption of where the exposure could be in terms of capital terms by 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Maybe I would ask you -- I would answer for the two questions and then ask you to repeat the last one. Your assessment of the, let's say, roughly &#x20AC;500 billion risk weighted assets is appropriate. So definitely, as I have said, this is the type of risk weighted asset that we will have by end of 2012. <mark type="inaudible" /> mind that part of that will be Hugh and this is a way to answer your second question. And I decide that securitization of <mark type="inaudible" /> below BB minus securitization which currently are deducted 50% from Tier 1 and 50% from Tier 2. And Basel III will be 100% weighted and so there will be no longer any deduction but there will be additional risk weighted assets.</p>
          <p>They will be weighted at 1250 %. So this is on the slide 7. What you could move from the 2 billion, which used to be deducted under Basel II and Basel 2.5. As I said, we just deduct 40% of this deduction from the core tier 1 which amount for 80% of the total tier 1. If you say 2 billion divided by 40%, you obtain 5 billion which is the total deduction and 5 billion multiplied buy 12.5, you obtain the 60 billion of risk weighted assets. So the answer to your second question is that in Basel III, there will be no longer any deduction linked to securitization. Everything will be translated and converted in risk weighted assets. And this explains also why we have an important increase. Your third question, sorry, I didn't catch it &#x2013; can you repeat it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just going back to that securitization, the 2 billion add-back, is this number currently included in the 3.5 billion deduction from Basel II as per slide 23? Or is there -- do you see an increase in that deduction before it gets netted out under Basel III?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean compared to the slide 23, that's correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This 2 billion will be part &#x2013; well it's not exactly the same figure because we have protected by 2012. But in the 3.5 billion deduction of Basel II, part of that is linked definitely to securitization and this will be reduced yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah the last question was basically to understand how -- why the allocated equity in the legacy asset division increased so much if the absolute exposure --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; so I think I answer as the CIB has a whole level, this means that while the CIB has a whole level, capital allocation has increased essentially due to <mark type="inaudible" /> legacy asset because our allocation internally is not just 7% of the risk weighted assets, but also we had, to this capital allocation 50% of the deduction linked to securitization. So that's why in the legacy assets you have this inflation and this means that it is the beginning of the quarter. So this means that during the second quarter from 31st of March to 30th of June, we're seeing certain rate <mark type="inaudible" /> certain configuration which has led to additional reduction.</p>

But in our disclosure as we feel that also we see at this rate there would be a risk-weighted inflation. And so, compared to Basel I, the floor will no longer be earthed. We have no longer any impact on the Basel III.</p>

Altogether, I would say we are still in the same order of magnitude on the so called PIKS including Italy. So we said that it was something around 10 billion including banking and trading. So we have no big shift compared to end of June. Also, you will see well -- it's more in the calculation of the book value that the other comprehensive income on the available for sale has shrink during the quarter compared to its level of end of June and also compared to its level of the 1st of Jan, showing that exposure has been well managed and there is no, let's say, hidden losses in the AFS.</p>

          <p>Hi, again, Didier. Sorry, just a follow-up on the insurance deduction, the insurance capital deduction on the financial conglomerates, why do you feel confident in using the financial conglomerates directors when, for example, one of your very close peers is certainly not budgeting for that. Is there some guidance that you have received? Why you are comfortable using that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But Omar, I think what we have said there is a directive that was voted recently which is on the financial conglomerate. A lot of people have think about how we can let's say treat such groups. It is up and running, and I would say there is proposal. We just want to apply it and thus, I think that why we should we change something which has been decided recently just to address this question. So that's the point.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. I just wanted to do a small follow-up on domestic retail banking revenues. I can appreciate that it's a bit early to give a guidance -- detailed guidance for 2011. But maybe, can you give us some comfort that even with low rates and with less ability to price for services, we can expect positive revenues at least.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did we ever report a negative growth of revenues in French retail.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But when look at the interest rate environment, I remember when I used to be investor relation in 2004, there was a flattening of the yield curve, rates were relatively low and despite that, we were able to deliver positive growth. So if you want just a start off guidance, I can tell you that revenue will grow next year compared to this year, Guillaume, if it was your main worries.</p>

          <p>I think that we have no other questions. So, I would like to thank you for this very proactive and long -- I expect not too long for you -- Q&amp;A session. I think that what we should be able to remember from this third quarter results is the good performance of all of our activities. The fact that the group, as I said during my presentation, is continuing to transform itself. We have already also made some shift in the business model so with the investment in systematic equities that will be booked in the P&amp;L as from the fourth quarter. Also, the divestment of ECS that was closed last week, we feel that we are showing a further restoration of the rebound of the group. And also, we wanted to provide you in a transparent manner a vision of what we could expect on the Basel III for <mark type="inaudible" />. I thank you again for your attention. And certainly we will have occasion to discuss in the coming weeks, in the coming months about this subject.</p>
          <p>Thank you and have a good day. Bye, bye.</p>
