          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the H&amp;M Nine-Months Report Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And just to remind you all that this conference call is being recorded today.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to your Chairperson, Nils Vinge, Head of IR. Please begin your meeting and I will be standing by.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's third quarter results. The presentation slides are found on our website, hm.com. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen, is with me today and we'll be happy to answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the slide, Third Quarter 2010. Sales excluding VAT reached 26.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of 14% in Swedish kronor. In local currencies, sales increased 21%, and sales in comparable units rose 11%.</p>
          <p>During the year, we have said that we are investing in further improved customer offerings. We'd like to think that the strong sales increase means the customers have appreciated our offerings. Of course, you should also keep in mind that comparables were easy in the third quarter. The autumn collections have been well received. In September, sales in local currencies were up 15% from the 1st of September to the 27th, compared to the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Gross profit in the third quarter increased by 12% to 16.3 billion, corresponding to a gross margin of 60.5%, compared to 61.6% last year. The third quarter last year included positive effects on the gross margin of 160 basis points from our since then revised currency hedging policy. This year, the gross margin was positively affected by a number of external factors. Among these factors were the U.S. dollar exchange rate, spare capacity declines, transportation cost and raw material prices. The positive effects from these external factors have, however, gradually diminished and therefore, have less effect in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>The positive effects on the gross margin were partly offset by the increased investments and the further improved customer offering. Like we've said many times before, the gross level as such is not a main target for us. Our aim is always to deliver fashion and quality at the best price to our customers.</p>
          <p>Markdowns in relation to sales were on the same level as the historic quarter last year. Cost control remained good in the third quarter. Sales and admin costs were 10.4 billion, up 8% in Swedish kronor and 14% in local currency compared to the third quarter last year. The increase was mainly related to the expansion. Cost at comparable units have been kept at a good level. The sales increase in combination will continue high cost consciousness and its strong operating profit.</p>
          <p>Operating profit for the quarter rose 20% to 5.7 billion, corresponding to an operating margin of 21%. Excluding last year's positive currency hedging effect, operating profit was up 32%. Profit after financial items reached just about 5.7 billion, a rise of 20% from the year before. Net profit increased 23% to 4.2 billion, corresponding to earnings per share of 2.56 kronor. As you know, the number of shares were doubled on the 1st of June, as a result of the 2 million shares.</p>
          <p>Sales growth was strong in most of our markets in the third quarter. We are very pleased with the development in North America, where the positive trend from the second quarter strengthened further. In our new markets, sales were particularly strong in China, where we are expanding rapidly.</p>
          <p>Sales in Asia nearly doubled compared to the third quarter last year. Our first store in South Korea has also performed well, and is now accompanied by a second store that opened in September. In Russia, interest in H&amp;M still runs high. We opened our seventh store recently on Nevsky Prospect in St. Petersburg. Elsewhere in Europe, sales developed very well in Germany, the Netherlands and Italy.</p>
          <p>Those were a few comments on our sales and now looking at some key figures for the period. Please turn to the slide, key data. The stock-in-trade was 10.5 billion, an increase of around 3% compared to the same time last year. The stock-in-trade is well composed and at a good level. In relation to the sales, the stock-in-trade was 9.9%, a good level compared to last year and historically.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from current operations increased by 56% to 16.2 billion. The increase can be explained mainly by strong sales, good cost control and controlled stock-in-trade. During the first nine months of the year, we invested nearly SEK 3.1 billion, mainly in new stores.</p>
          <p>Our current estimate on CapEx for the full year is approximately SEK 5 billion, down from our previous estimate of slightly more than 6 billion. The main reasons are the new store openings, as expected in latter part of the year, I will come back to that <mark type="inaudible" /> and the strengthening of the Swedish kronor. Meanwhile, our finances remain strong. Liquid funds and short-term investments amounted to 21.4 billion. Return on equity was 52.3%, compared to 46.8 rolling 12 months.</p>
          <p>And now, some words on our expansion. In the first nine months of the year, we opened 105 new stores, and we closed 15. At the end of August, we had 2,078 stores, of which 43 were franchise. The H&amp;M brand is currently present in 37 countries. The supply of new attractive store locations has diminished somewhat, as the completion of newly shopping malls has been halted particularly in Southern Europe and due to the weak economy.</p>
          <p>As a consequence we will add around 20 stores less this year than we expected originally. The number of net store openings in 2010 is expected to be around 220, instead of 240. But our target remains intact, to increase the number of stores by 10 to 15% per year, with continued high profitability. And we maintain a positive view on future expansion.</p>
          <p>We have many exciting openings to look forward to. We plan to open approximately 140 stores in the fourth quarter and close 10. A week from today, we are opening our first store on the Champs Elys&#xE9;es designed by the world-renowned French architect Jean Nouvel. We will open our third H&amp;M stores in Las Vegas on the 20th of November. It will be a flagship store in the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace, one of the strongest-performing shopping centers in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The new Las Vegas store will also host the world premiere of our new Guest Designer Collaboration, Lanvin for H&amp;M. We're thrilled that Lanvin has joined us on this collaboration. Lanvin is one of the most influential fashion houses in the world. The collection will include women's and men's wear, as well as accessories and will be presented to the media for the first time on the 2nd of November. The collection will be sold in 200 stores in all our markets from the 23rd, with North America a few days earlier because of Thanksgiving.</p>
          <p>Lanvin for H&amp;M will also be available online in the markets where we offer online sales. This autumn, we also look forward to start offering H&amp;M's fashion in new markets. Turkey, it will be a full concept store in Forum Istanbul opening on the 6th of November.</p>
          <p>In 2011, Croatia and Romania will become new markets. We see a great interest for H&amp;M in both countries and we will open our first stores in Zagreb and Bucharest next spring. Also in 2011, Morocco and Jordan will become new franchise markets.</p>
          <p>We also expand to online sales, an important channel in addition to our stores. With our latest market, the UK, we offer online sales in eight markets. Our customers in the UK have been able to shop online in H&amp;M and H&amp;M Home since the 16th of September, and we are satisfied with the initial reception. We recently opened our first H&amp;M Home stores outside Sweden, in Helsinki and Copenhagen, both successful openings. Home will also open in London and Amsterdam this autumn.</p>
          <p> Our other performers Monki, Weekday and COS are also growing, both in new and existing markets. Tomorrow, Monki is set to open its first store outside of Europe on Langham Place in Hong Kong. In our global expansion, it's important that we keep strengthening H&amp;M as an attractive employer. We will therefore start a long-term incentive program for all H&amp;M employees next year. The intention is to encourage and acknowledge the employees' long-term involvement. The program is pending the approval by an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on the 20th of October.</p>
          <p>So if we should sum up before we take your questions, we delivered strong sales and strong results in the third quarter. Sales have been very satisfactory thus far in September. Looking ahead, our designers have created new, attractive collections for the upcoming season, with a growing focus on more sustainable materials.</p>
          <p>And throughout the company, we are on the constant lookout for further improvements, with the aim of offering our customers an even better H&amp;M.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your patience, and we are now happy to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Robert Miller [Redburn Partners]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I ask about the strategy on investments in value, because the fact that you are saying you are investing in quality and value, does imply that you don't feel that you're delivering fashion and quality at the best price every where in the world. Where do you think the issue is most acute for you and how far into the program to correct this do you feel you are at this time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that was maybe several questions. But then, to start with, we really would like to clarify that the gross margin is not the goal in itself and has never been. For us, it's always about the customer. We always have the focus on the customer potential, that we're really having the best customer offering on each market.</p>
          <p>And as we have been talking in previous quarters, there are different sectors that are affecting the gross margin. So it's the situation also in Q3. We are mentioning that capacity still positive factor and the transportation and those are partly offset by the increased investment. And as I said, we are thinking really long-term and how we choose to deal with those different external factors that we really want to keep to ourselves.</p>
          <p>We are working in a very competitive market and we really hope that you respect that we don't want to reveal how we have been acting, playing with our pricing and different sectors and not revealing what we are planning ahead. But one sure that we can be sure about, that is that we are always making the best, what we think is best for H&amp;M in the long run. That is what is steering our business.</p>
          <p>And yes, that's correct to come back to one of your questions that to have an even better customer offering of each market, the situation, of course, are different in different markets and are changing. We are looking in to how the competitors are acting and trying to ensure that on all markets, we have the best customer offering. So it's an ongoing process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I look at some of the impressive local currency sales growth that you are achieving in some big markets for you, can I assume that in, for example, the UK and U.S., you have made an investment in value above and beyond what you would normally do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Investments that we are &#x2013; it's not that we haven't -- didn't invest before. What we'd say is that we invest even further and it's across the line and as you can see, I mean, it's not more or less in any market. It's across the border.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it is broadly across your global markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Richard Cathcart. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's actually Caroline Gulliver here from Execution Noble. I wondered if you could give a comment on the outlook for supplier pricing. You've said that a number of factors were positive, but moderating this quarter, and I think you said last quarter, that you think demand for capacity increased and obviously, raw material pricing increased. So I was wondering if you could talk about the outlook for the fourth quarter and next year, and whether the trend is continuing to get worse and could even potentially go negative or has it moderated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Looking to the external factors that have been positive for several quarters, they are turning negative in the fourth quarter and probably even worse in Q1. But how that will affect on our gross margin, that's a different, because that is dependent on so many other things, how we are acting and reacting. But the answer to your question, the external factors, raw materials, transportation, the capacity, they are turning negative in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And just one follow-up if I may. Could you just confirm, I know you do this every quarter, that the reversal of the currency hedges is something that's going to continue into the fourth quarter, and then into the first quarter and second quarter of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's absolutely correct. They will be negative for us going forward until the second quarter, then they will be hopefully gone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Just if I can bring the first two questions together, one about the price investment and one about increasing cost pressures. I mean, it seems an interesting time to invest in price when your supply chain costs are all rising. Is there therefore a risk that we'll get a double impact on the gross margin going forward, and perhaps if you could also say, why now for the reinvestment in pricing, as perhaps last quarter or the quarter before, when the gross margin was much, much stronger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your second question, why now. We've been talking about investing more and further strengthening the customer offer since Q4. So this is not something new. And of course, we plan to &#x2013; this is an ongoing process that will hopefully never end. But then, there are external factors that sometimes they are positive and sometimes they are negative. And again, as</p>
          <p>Jyrki stated, the gross margin, that is not the target and has never been.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And your price investment, though, when &#x2013; at a time when other retailers are talking more about regulating prices to pass through some of those supply chain costs, you will just continue with your own strategy of putting more back in to the equation, rather than following your competitors in raising the prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We will follow this strategy to always have the customer in focus and how we are going to act, that we really want to keep to ourself for competitive reason. But we are thinking very, very long-term in all our decisions. And we are not running our business based on the gross margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Frederick Bjelland [Morgan Stanley]. Please go ahead, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. My question was around the store expansion and it's kind of twofold. Firstly, when did you notice that the store-opening pipeline was starting to fall behind your original plan. And then secondly, related to that, in terms of the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could we take one question at a time, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the first question, as we've been talking throughout the year, it is a very difficult macro. There is a lot of uncertainty in the figures also last year. Last year, we actually -- there was a lot of opportunities that came up, so the original plan of 225 was raised upwards. So we ended up with 250 stores last year.</p>
          <p>And one reason was that a lot of competitors slowed down their expansion and that gave us opportunities. Another reason was that some shopping mall projects were actually speeded up in order to be open before Christmas. So that &#x2013; originally, we had planned to open them in 2010 and they came in already in 2009. This year however, of course, the competitors have already slowed down their expansion. If anything, they start to open again, so the demand for retail space thus could increase.</p>
          <p>And second, a lot of shopping malls have been halted, as you know, we've been talking about this. But as late as in Q2, we actually were &#x2013; believed that we were going to open a lot of these malls that we now unfortunately won't be able to open. But we were looking for alternative reasons and we hope to open that. But we haven't found any, I mean, good enough to open. We don't want to compromise. So we think it's better to say now and reduce the target from 240 to 220 this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And &#x2013; sorry, here and maybe I could add that we still believe that we can have a long-term increase by 10 to 15% more stores every year. That's the long-term goal for us and that we strongly believe in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and can I just check, the specific projects that you talk about that &#x2013; have they been canceled or they've been stalled? So I mean, should we expect some kind of acceleration in Q1 next year or does this not have an impact on next year's growth target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination of many things. It's mainly shopping malls, in some cases, new malls being constructed have come to a standstill. In some cases, it's existing shopping malls that are expanding, that the expansion has come to a standstill, and in some cases, it's existing shopping malls that is being refurbished and we were &#x2013; we had new store in that refurbishment. But that has also come to a standstill. Some of them hopefully will come in next year, some won't, some maybe will open in 2012, '13, we don't know and some probably won't be opened at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So does this mean that you think that your space growth next year will be closer to the 10 than the 15?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Jyrki, said the long-term growth target of 10% to 15%, we are comfortable with and exactly what it's going to be next year, we won't come back to that in connection to the full year report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also here, it's all about quality. Of course, probably we could have been running through additional 20, 20 more stores. But for us, it's so important to have the quality also in each location because that's something that we will have in the portfolio for a long, long time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry if I'm being a bit dense here, but could you just outline the actual gross margin drivers in the quarter? Sorry for coming back to this issue time and again. But essentially, if I understand it correctly, last year in Q3, you had a 0.6% positive impact from the internal hedging effect. And the remaining one percentage point was rather to do with unhedged portion of the transaction flow, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Can I also ask you, when you write that the markdowns as a percentage of sales were unchanged year-on-year, does that mean that the markdown impact on the gross margin was then zero or does it mean that it was negative 100 basis points, as in Q3 last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The effect is zero on the gross margin compared to last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To clarify, last year, the 100 bps was compared to the previous year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course. Thank you very much. And finally on the same issue, the actual sort of currency impact, the transaction flow impact on the gross margin, would you say that it's -was it closer to zero, but still positive or say, closer to 100 bps or even higher? Just to give us a feel of the magnitude, really?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's, I mean &#x2013; no, it's positive, but it's not &#x2013; of course, not as positive as in Q2. We would prefer not to quantify, but it's diverse and it's becoming negative in Q4.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Anne Critchlow from SG. Hello, I've got a follow-up question on the price investment. When you are setting prices, I'm just wondering which types of retailers H&amp;M compares itself to, and whether you include the discount of the hypermarkets? And now that Primark has entered Germany, would you include a retailer like Primark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're sorry, we would prefer not to mention any specific competitors, also for competitive reasons, of course. But there are a lot of very, very strong competitors out there, but they differ &#x2013; or they vary from market to market, from concept to concept. But again, we prefer not to mention any specifically.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And I wonder if I could just ask a second question on your view of spare capacity and your ability to negotiate in the Far East at this point? And obviously, your volumes are very large still, but is it becoming much more difficult?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's definitely more difficult compared to a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that likely to affect the gross margin looking forward? Is it becoming a real negative year-on-year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>You are saying that you are investing with &#x2013; in prices and in the business with the customer in your site. I was just wondering whether you may also have the competition in your site and the decision to invest at a time when sourcing becomes more difficult, is it fair to understand it as something like when the going gets tough, the tough gets going, in a way? And if this is going to reflect in market share gains and faster like-for-like growth on your part, at least in your expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we can definitely conclude that in the third quarter, we have taken massive market shares in most markets. But about the future, we know as little as you guys do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question, if I may, on operating expenditure, how would you anticipate your operating expenditure to trend in comparison to space? Is it fair to expect operating expenditure to grow at the same rate as space? Or do you see that, for example, for the remainder of the year, you already had incurred costs that you are not going to be able to avoid in relation to the 20 stores that you are not opening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have a really &#x2013; a good cost-conscious organization, a good cost control and that is something that we are working on a daily and a weekly basis. And of course, that goes for the future as well, that we are really focusing on how the operating expenses are developing and we are comfortable with the way we are working with them. So we are not worried.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as the issues appear to be mainly in Southern Europe, where shopping more, they are not coming online, do you have the ability at this stage given the significant growth potential you have in other geographies to redirect your expansion targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, we already looked for alternatives this year, but we didn't find enough good one. But for the future, of course, we need to look for alternatives, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I do have a couple of questions, one at a time, I know. First question on sourcing, do you plan to shift any of your sourcing, from let's say, China to Bangladesh or cheaper countries to offset some of the cost inflation you see coming in the next 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The sourcing strategy, again, is something we work on, on a daily basis, and there are a lot of different factors that influence where we source. Where, of course, cost is one factor, but it's fashion, it's lead times, it's risk exposure, et cetera. So there is nothing dramatic going on there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. In terms of your space expansion in Asia in the third quarter, will that be something that you would comment on? Because you mentioned that you've doubled your sales in Asia. So it would be nice if we could have a kind of sense of how much your space expansion was in Asia in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you have the number of stores in the report, you can see that it's very obvious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It includes the number of stores, I don't know how many exactly. But this year, China will actually be the third most important expansion market in terms of number of stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and this will be the case for the next 12 months, again, China is going to be more important than you space expansion from your markets, correct or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll come back to the expansion targets for next year in connection with the full-year report. But obviously, there is a reason why we have expanded so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And finally, one last one if I may. In Germany, because obviously you've said that trading has been doing very well there, and we've seen the market doing very well there, and it's your biggest market. Any comments on how you see the outlook in Germany? Would Germany be one of the countries that could offset some of the higher cost pressures in the next 12 months by having higher sales growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are looking at every market. It's not just Germany and we are looking at the whole group. So I mean, Germany, yes, it's true that it's been one of the strongest markets for us this year. And, but as you mentioned, it has been also helped by the general economy in Germany that has, for once, been stronger. But the customers in Germany seem to appreciate our fashion and we're happy with the store regional operations and also, the online development.</p>

          <p>Afternoon. Just question on OpEx please, what was the currency effect on OpEx in the third quarter in percentage terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In percentage terms it was &#x2013; in local currency, the OpEx growth was 14%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>14% in local currency, okay. I can work that out. Thank you. And were there any, just on OpEx, were there any particular cost lines that rose faster than you expected because of the stronger sales performance in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we actually we managed to keep a good level on all of the costs within the operating costs. So of course, the number of ours increased due to the high like-for-like sales, so &#x2013; but we managed to really have a good control over the OpEx cost during the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And just one more on OpEx, please. Why &#x2013; there appears to have been quite a big reduction in staff costs in the U.S. and Spain over the past year, looking at the annual report and so on. Could you just explain why that's the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very simple, because sales were bad &#x2013; were low last year, so we had to offset that, but of course, that's something we do on a daily basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But should we assume then that some of that cost is now coming back in to those markets? You are employing more part time staff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, if sales hopefully continue to rise, of course, we have to man up the stores. Otherwise, you'd find a big backlog in the stores and bigger lines. So that's something we constantly work on, but we did reach the leverage that we should have by the positive like for like, which is good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was just asking, and obviously in the U.S. last year, the reduction in head count was way more in percentage terms than the fall in sales, I think. That's why I was just asking, whether there are any, whether there was a particular reorganization or something or-?</p>

          <p>Right. I am curious because theoretically, with that sort of a comp, then you would have had a mechanical sort of boost to the gross margin through higher full price sales ratios. Can you quantify that at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The relation, if you're talking about the relation of markdown sales, it's on the same level as last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So even though the comp was at 11% for the third quarter, you are saying that there was no change in full price to markdown in that ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct. It's the same relation as last year, the relation between &#x2013; in relation to the total sales. Our markdowns are on the same level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But Peter, remember back that when we ended the second quarter, we commented that we had, we carried a bit more than planned inventory into Q3 as a result of the cold spring and that the markdowns in Q3 could be higher than the last year. Now they didn't become higher, as a result of the good sales and we were happy with the outcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. And then just from my &#x2013; I'm a bit confused. You're saying that you've made new price investment, but you're not quantifying it, is that right? So you've cut your average selling price, but you won't quantify by how much, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. As we explained, for us, it's so important to really keep these strategical things to ourselves and not reveal them to the competitors, how we are acting when it comes to pricing and our investments in the custom offer. But as we said, we comment on that the investments have partly offset the positive effect in the gross margin. But to go into detail, that we won't do, due to competitive reasons and we really hope that you respect that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Simon Irwin [Liberum Capital]. Please go ahead, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just answer a couple of questions for me? The first of which, can you just talk about the delivery for the UK online offer, as to where its coming from and how the kind of development of value freeze in Europe is panning out, and how that relates to the online offer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have a lot of questions at the same time. We've only been up and running for 15 days or something and we are quite pleased with the development so far, but of course, it's too early to make any conclusions yet. We do have great beliefs though for the UK market, because it's among the largest online markets in Europe, as you know. The second question, was that the supply or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, I was really asking about supply rather than the performance, just to kind of where it comes from and what your plans are for kind of rolling out these RDCs, which seem to be key to the international offer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. For the moment, we have three distribution centers for our online business. One is in Sweden, one is in Norway, and one is in Poland ports now. And for the moment, I think we are supplying from Sweden, but that could change over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And will there be another RDC being built in continental Europe to support online for the rest of Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't really know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And could you just clarify a question on the &#x2013; going back to hedging again. Did you say that, we obviously had a 160-basis-point gain from hedging activities in 3Q last year. Are you saying that in 3Q this year, there was no gain at all or was it just less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we changed the hedging policy 1st of December, 2009. So the effects from the internal hedge, they have disappeared.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also, the unhedged part has disappeared. There might be a theoretical effect, what we call a slippery effect, the timing difference between when we are putting the orders until then when we are hedged, where we do the hedge. And that slippery effect can still be there, but for Q3, it was insignificant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there was no material gain and then you were saying that there will be &#x2013; that, that will turn into &#x2013; hedging activities in general will turn into a small loss through 4Q and 1Q, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're saying in the comps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The comps here were positive in Q3, Q4, Q1 and Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But we shouldn't expect anything excluding the comp effect then over the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We don't actually know about the slippery. It depends on how the currencies are fluctuating and if they are very volatile, of course, we can say some slippery effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe a story, we should maybe add another &#x2013; in connection to this, we have also changed the policies and now we hedge 100% of the prices, rather than 90%, as we did before, as you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. Just going back to this price investment, as a general rule, would you say that you had reduced prices on existing ranges or if you actually, has price investment more been about adding quality, for example, to the product and maintaining price points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination of both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it can also be, as I said, more sustainable material, like organic cotton.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. But so you haven't actually &#x2013; or would it be safe to say that your overall price points probably haven't moved very much? You just offer better, you think you offer better products for those price points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what is the most important is that the customers, they seem to have, or we are convinced that they have responded, they have appreciated and it's reflected in the sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But still, it's a mixture of those. It's a combination of lowering prices, increasing quality, setting in more fashion details for the same price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning from Uruguay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Rodrigo.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. In order to achieve your goals, expectations, do you have any expansion plans across Latin America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Latin America is, of course, a very interesting market and very interesting potential for H&amp;M. But we have no concrete plans for the moment, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And the second question is, there has been a restructuring of your operations systems with the new company that centralizes the production and logistics operations? I would like to know if that change goes through growth of the franchising system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you please try to clarify? We didn't really understand the question fully. So was the question about our global buying company or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry again. In the 2009 report, there is a statement that there is a change to our consolidation of the buying, logistics and production operations. I was wondering if that structural changes are towards a more franchising-based business model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not done or based due to our franchise business model. It's done simply that we have changed our way of trends to pricing and then we have a global buying company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
