        <plist>
          <p>Hello, all of you, again. Thank you for being with us this morning or this afternoon anyone where you are, and we are here to report our last quarter results and I will also comment on Redecard transactions. And I'll try to be fast enough in this presentation so that we can have more time for questions at the end.</p>
          <p>I'll make some comments on the highlights. I'll be very short since you have already seen the numbers. We had a recurring net income of R$3.7 billion in the last quarter of 2011. This represented 21.8% ROE and the total for the year was R$14.6 billion as a result of reais, an ROE of 22.3%. Loan growth was strong, 19% at the end of the total year, 3.9% at the end of the year. We were more cautious at the end of the year. As you know, we have been talking about that. So loan growth was a little bit lower at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Financial margins with clients grew 14.5%. Net interest margin with clients decreased 70 basis points in the last quarter, mainly due to two things. One was the reduction in the Selic rate, as you know, and the other one that I would like to call your attention is the funding expansions that came from clients that basically had very low margin and the mix overall has changed. And I'll comment additional on this thing but this, when you make the numbers, made up of final margin as a percentage is lower than it should. And this had an important influence in this calculation.</p>
          <p>Spreads on loans remained almost stable with a decrease of 20 basis points and this is mainly due to change in mix at the end of the year. Banking services and the insurance business grew 7.4% in the last quarter, totaling R$5.9 billion and for the year the growth was 13.3%, totaling R$21.8 billion.</p>
          <p>The non-performing loan ratio increased by 20 basis points reaching 4.9%, pretty much inside our expectation for the quarter. And our provisions &#x2013; net provisions of recoveries was R$3.9 billion, 6.1% when compared with the previous quarter, a little bit above the level of growth on the loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses reached 9.5% in terms of growth for the year. In the last quarter, we were only 1.7% above the third quarter level and this has a lot to do with our program of efficiency, our goals. We are announcing a 41% efficiency ratio for the last quarter of 2013 and I believe that we are on the way to reach that number and the best number fourth quarter of 2011, evolution is in line with this result.</p>
          <p>As a result, efficiency ratio that we plan to reach 41% has improved more than 400 basis points when you compare last quarter of 2011 with last quarter of 2010. But for the year it was 140 basis points of decrease, which was a good result, but we are speeding up in this sense.</p>
          <p>Integration, I think this is a very important point for the bank because we have basically finalized everything in terms of integration of the operation of the old Ita&#xFA; and the old Unibanco. Now we have one bank. All the products, all the services and all the business we do is in one platform.</p>
          <p>We don't have any more systems running parallel for legacy data. We are &#x2013; basically everything is already in the operational system that we have to-date. So we were included &#x2013; we were able to close down the data center of Unibanco in December. So we are fully operational in one platform.</p>
          <p>This is an important achievement basically because we have, in the last three years, allocated more than 30% of our effort in technology. We had allocated it to the integration. So we are freeing up more than 30% of our technology capabilities in order to produce improvements for clients, improvements in controls. And this is quite important for us is we will leverage the bank in the future. So we are very happy about it.</p>
          <p>Next page, we have the results. I basically would like to call your attention on the market number. The second line, financial margin with market, which have decreased in the quarter. This was an important explanation for the &#x2013; it was part of the explanation for the results in the bottom line. We have &#x2013; we believe that our run rate for this line should be something along R$800 million a quarter. So this was above our level still although below the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Banking fees have increased more than 5% in the quarter mainly due to the credit card business that has seasonality in December during the Christmas periods and also insurance in terms of revenue has been growing strongly. You can see that in the last quarter we grew 5.5% compared to 10.7% for the full year. So we are speeding up also our insurance business.</p>
          <p>In terms of losses, when we combine losses for loans and losses for claims, we had a growth of 4%. It was great but not as great when we look only for the loans. But in the other hand, we had good improvement on the recoveries.</p>
          <p>I think the great thing that we have done in the quarter in line with our objectives of efficiency is the control on the operating expenses. It was only 1.7% improvement, and this is pretty much in line with our objectives for the next year. And I'll talk more about that when we give the guidance for the full year of 2012.</p>
          <p>In terms of loans, we closed the year with 19% evolution which was a little bit above the market overall. The last quarter, I think that credit card even with seasonality, it was very strong. Mortgages have been strong and we'll keep on being very strong for the coming quarters. We are growing a lot in that business coming from a very low base. Small companies, we are more careful, as I had already comment, given the level of delinquency that was higher than we would like to have. On the corporate side, the growth was more strong.</p>
          <p>To comment a little bit on the net interest margin, we have here the credit net interest margin, which is much more stable. The changes that we have seen here, most of it is due to the mix, but it's pretty much stable overall.</p>
          <p>When you look the full net interest margin of the clients, we have to make the comment that we have increased at the end of the year our funding from clients. This was very good in terms of creating a larger base of clients on deposits. It's important for the future of the bank. And this has on the other hand decreased our net interest margin when we calculated it as a percentage, because of this additional funding, which we have in place basically in Selic rate.</p>
          <p>When we basically make the numbers assuming that we would have no additional funding available in the last quarter compared to the third quarter, the number would be more in line with what would you expect. So, this is quite important. Our reduction in the NIM in the last quarter was in an important extension because of the lower Selic end and the additional funding increase in liquidity for the banks.</p>
          <p>On credit ratios in general, the NPL over 90 days have increased 20 basis points. But, on the other hand, the 15 to 90 days NPLs have been reasonably stable over the quarters with trends to go down. This is more clear when you look individuals, which has clearly improving the rates over time. We are often that we have already achieved good underwriting quality for individuals, for the vehicles portfolio. So, this trend, we believe that is a trend that we will see very solid in terms of improving the NPLs for individuals.</p>
          <p>On small companies mainly and also corporate, it has been more stable, we believe that more stable both on the 90 days and on the 15 to 90 days. But we would like to see this in a lower level, so we are still working in order to have improvements in this portfolio.</p>
          <p>It's important to understand that the last semester overall, we had a very low economic growth activity. Last semester probably Brazilian economy grew very close to 1%, which is a very low level. And this clearly has affected the quality of credit in general. But on the other hand, the good news is that we expect the growth to improve in 2012 over the year. Especially in the second semester, we believe that the economy will be much more active. So we will probably see an improvement on credit quality conditions overall.</p>
          <p>When you see the allowance for the provisions on loan losses, it has been quite stable over the last quarters. And I would like to call your attention on the right side down here, the balance of allowance for loan losses, showing you the numbers that we have split here year.</p>
          <p>We have on blue the additional to the Central Bank requirements provisions and on the orange, we have two numbers. The number below is the number that we allocate for the loans that has already 100% provision. And you see over time that the most of the increase on loan loss that we have seen is on loans that are already 100% provisioned.</p>
          <p>When you look at the amount of provision that we have for other types of loans that is not fully provisioned, we have been increasing also the volume which means that we are not reducing the quality of coverage that we have over the portfolio.</p>
          <p>And this is very clear when you look the credit ratio in the next page. The line in orange shows very stable level of provisions when you compare and you take into consideration only E-G ratios of credits as a percentage of provisions that we have for them.</p>
          <p>So, we have been keeping a higher level of the same policy for the full period. We have not changed anything. We are not reducing provisions for the future. We are keeping the same level provision for the same level delinquency. But we cannot increase provisions over loans that have already 100%. So this seems the number, the volume of loans that has 100% of provisions has been increasing. The total ratio, which is the blue line have been showing a decrease. But overall it's pretty much stable. We are keeping the same level of coverage that we have and always had.</p>
          <p>The next page, basically highlight on the shareholders equity and assets, the growth that we have enjoyed. The next page, we are talking about funding and assets under management. We have shown a very strong growth in funding with clients of the Bank. We, in the last quarter, we grew 8.7%. This was the &#x2013; the result of this is a great relationship with clients, solid base of deposit for the future. But on other hand, we had a higher level of liquidity that has contributed to the lower level of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:03) that we are carrying on. Obviously, we have a positive spread on this, but not as positive as spreads that we have on other types of relation with clients, especially loans.</p>
          <p>So, in the liquidity level of the banks which is seen in the next page is very strong. We have much &#x2013; and have improved as we can see here from the numbers, which gives growth on deposits. We have improved the liquidity position of the bank. We are more than &#x2013; currently we are already complying with the liquidity index that Basel III is indicating as objectives for the future, but we are already complying for those two index of liquidities in a very comfortable way for the bank.</p>
          <p>Next page, we talk about the evolution on fees and insurance results. On the side of fees, the credit card, in the last quarter credit card was very strong, as always in the last quarter of the year, given seasonalities. And this has pushed our revenue of total fee income to a growth of 5.5%.</p>
          <p>But especially I'd like to show you the number of results coming from insurance and pensions and capitalization that has strong growth in the year 29%, especially in the last quarter. We are putting more emphasis on insurance business here. When we talk about results fee from insurance, we are meaning premiums less losses insurance and also deducting the commercial expenses. So the contribution of insurance is increasing in our business, which is very positive.</p>
          <p>On the side of expense, I think we are doing strong &#x2013; a good job. We are very much committed, the full bank is fully committed with this objective of 41%, and we have already seen signs here in the last quarter of this commitment. Expenses had <mark type="ph" /> diluted (21:55) only 1.7%, 9.5% for the year. But the trend is lower than 9.5% as you can see in the last quarter. We are really very much committed to this level of 41%. We have a lot of plans here inside, how we will achieve the numbers. We believe that given the reasonable scenario, without the major crisis in the Europe or something like that, we will have the conditions to achieve the 41% level at the end of the next year, which means the last quarter of next year.</p>
          <p>But, overall you can see here, since we announced the merger of Unibanco, the evolution of total expenses in this period, evolution was very much controlled. We basically view on the basis of inflation and have to remember the during this period, assets have been more than 40%. Transactions in volume has grown probably more than that. So, we are gaining efficiencies and we believe that we can gain even more efficient in the future that we announced for 2012 and 2013.</p>
          <p>On the segmentation side, I don't have any special comments for that. Our business lines are making money. We believe that improving the ones that are suffering a little bit more like small companies and vehicles we have on the positive side of the equation, which is good and we believe that we can improve those business for next year.</p>
          <p>As a contribution for the net income, you can see that we have reduced the contribution in the last quarter of the year coming from market gains and the corporation. And we have improved especially insurance. We have improved Ita&#xFA; BBA and Consumer Credit in the last quarter. I think this is a good thing. It's improving the quality of gains for the company.</p>
          <p>On the side of capitalization, we have a strong capitalization. We have very constant levels that we are currently enjoying. We believe that we can &#x2013; we would not need additional capital for the bank to face the Basel III requirements. We are already complying with most of the requirements and the time table that they are announcing for compliance, everything is quite comfortable for us.</p>
          <p>Market capitalization is evolving more like you can see in this screen here. It has reduced a little bit in the last year, but it is coming back. And more recently, we are happy about the price level that we have been gaining more recently.</p>
          <p>And I'd like to also to comment that although we are focusing a lot on expense and gains and we are more focused on efficiency, which means that we're also looking for the top line, we are much &#x2013; we are getting things that would reduce the potential growth for the bank. We are opening branches. In the last quarter, we opened 82 branches overall, branches in cities and medium-sized cities starting with 50,000 inhabitants, more solid capital in big cities of Brazil.</p>
          <p>So we are keeping our strategy of growing the bank, growing the branch network. We believe that next year we will open additional 150 branches and this is also considered in the guidance that we are giving you in terms of expense growth. So we are controlling expenses but not cutting growth.</p>
          <p>Let me go for this next screen that shows what was the guidance that we gave for the markets for 2011. Credit growth, we expected something between 16% and 20%. We delivered 19%. So we are pretty much in line with the guidance. We had a slight increase in NPL levels. We were not reduced. We had 70 basis points. I believe this was the higher level of the expectations, but still in line with the expectations.</p>
          <p>Banking services, we were not able to achieve the numbers that we were announcing. We were behind that number. We are putting emphasis for the next year in order to have a stronger growth in this line. In terms of expenses, here we over delivered. We were announcing something between 10% and 13%. We could deliver 9.5%, so this was a good thing.</p>
          <p>On the efficiency ratio side, we are not able to deliver what we had announced. We have some &#x2013; the revenue did not grow as we expected. But the main reason was much more a question of timetable because when you compare fourth level against fourth level, we were more than enough of what we were believing. When you compare to those quarters, last quarters of those three years, we can see that we have delivered 460 basis points of improvement, which show that we were still in line with the timetable for the gain of next year.</p>
          <p>What we are announcing in terms of expectations for 2012. Credit growth will be something between 14% and 17%. It's important to notice that we are noting that we &#x2013; we believe that we announce these numbers because that's what we believe for the market. We think that the market &#x2013; we are planning to grow according to the market. We are not planning to gain share, but we are not considering losing share. We are basically announcing something very close to market and growth.</p>
          <p>In terms of NPLs, we believe that we will have some increase in the first semester and some decrease in the second semester. So at the end of the year, we will be pretty much at the same level that we are to-date. So this is what we expect to have for the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of increase in fees and the result of insurance, we are announcing a 10% to 12% growth. And most importantly, we are announcing a 4% to 8% growth in expense. I have said that we are very much confident that we can keep growth of expenses at both levels, which are pretty much in line with inflation although assets and transactions will be growing like 15% a year. So we are gaining, again we are gaining efficiency. And for the year, we believe that we can have a improvement in the efficiency ratio of 200 to 300 basis points for the full year of 2012.</p>
          <p>Before we conduct the questions-and-answers sessions I'd like to make some comments on Redecard. What is the rationale of our offer for Redecard? In terms of the bank, I believe that this will &#x2013; and this is the driver, this will give us more flexibility to talk with merchants, will give more flexibilities in terms of making our offer more rich and we have to deal a lot of issues between the bank and Redecard, issues in terms of what is the price for services. And we have different shareholders, so we have to be very careful on that. And this reduces our abilities to be in the speed that we would like to do.</p>
          <p>So this would give us more flexibility in terms of timing, in terms of offering of things that we can do, offering those services for clients. I believe that the offer that we are doing, it's a very fair offer. We are offering, in the next page you can see &#x2013; looking the numbers of Redecard, that is a great gain for shareholders. We are also analyzing the fact we are also &#x2013; the dividend that R$1 per share that has already been announced in terms of the balance sheet of Redecard. If our offer is X, this dividend to the shareholders we will receive the dividend before the price that we have the option that we will do for the first R$35 per share and for this additional gain for shareholders.</p>
          <p>And overall, I think quite important, it's much about Ibovespa for this in the next page as you can see. In dollar terms, it's even higher than that. So, I think it's a fair transaction I think for our shareholders. We believe that it's pretty much in line with the investment ratios that we see &#x2013; the return for investment risk that we see for the company. So, we are very confident that it's a good move for our shareholders and for Ita&#xFA; as well.</p>
          <p>Thank you, for listening to me, and we are here to &#x2013; and one more thing about Redecard. We are announcing the withdraw of the Novo Mercado Segment.</p>
          <p>So, now I would like to open for questions. Alfredo's here, the people from Ita&#xFA; BBA, from the accounting side, S&#xE9;rgio, Marcelo. We are all here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and Gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Carlos Macedo from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you for the opportunity for asking questions. Actually both of them will be related to Redecard but rather the impact that Redecard will have or the tender offer could have on Ita&#xFA;. The first is we know that this transaction will generate a substantial amount of goodwill in your books. I was wondering if you have already done calculations of what the impact that will be for your core Tier 1 capital, the basic capital, as per Basel III regulations, given that goodwill that is generated after December 31, 2011 isn't deductible or is deductible from your Core Tier 1 capital. I just wanted to see if you know what that impact would be.</p>
          <p>The second one, you mentioned that this will be neutral to results. Could you give us some color on that? Because the math that I do adding the earnings, the 50% of earnings for Redecard minus the amortization of goodwill, minus the opportunity cost of the cash that you're going to use to buy the shares, well I get a R$500 million to R$600 million decline, per year decline in earnings, so I just wanted to see how you're coming up with that number. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we &#x2013; I don't have the numbers here, and it will be very difficult. Rog&#xE9;rio might have down the road. You can look after Rog&#xE9;rio and he might discuss the details of numbers that we are talking about. This has to do also with the issue of amortization of the goodwill. We don't have a clear, perfect view about amortization of intangible since the goodwill is not, as we mentioned, is not possible to amortize. We believe that there will be some intangible to be amortized. We don't have a clear view on those numbers. But we believe that that will be important and probably major part of the total that will not be amortized. In terms of Basel numbers, if we had Basel III today full, we will have to deduct the full goodwill and intangible from the capital base. But Basel III has a timetable that has a timetable to phase in from today until the year of 2019. We believe that the peak of Basel III for us in terms of capital allocation will be 2016 and is less than 1% of the ratio. It's about 0.6% of the ratio of the bank today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But the tender offer and the goodwill generated would have a negative impact on your basic capital ratio and your Basel III?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Basel III, yes, but this as I mentioned is a small impact, 60 basis points, which is a peak 2016 or 2017, something like that.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. I have two questions on Ita&#xFA;, and a new one quick on Redecard. On Ita&#xFA;, the first question is on your guidance, you mentioned credit growth of 14% to 17%. Can you give us some color on what your expectation is for financial income growth? We are seeing that margins are coming under pressure due to the decline in Selic and that may continue throughout the year as Selic heads even further down. Are you expecting financial income to grow less than the 14% to 17%? Can you give us more or less a range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jorge, hello, how are you? Yes. We are expecting margins to be, in terms of growth, below loans. This is, in our mind, this is part of our budget and our plans. I will not get into details but we believe that margins we will squeeze a little bit not as much on the spread side for clients, in terms of loans which is something due to the lower Selic and some partially because of mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Is there any guidance that you're providing in terms of financial income growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are not providing guidance on that. I mean the guidance that we are providing exactly in both sides that we have an asset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Thank you. The second question on Ita&#xFA; is, on the asset quality you had guided towards peak of asset quality in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter, and now you're actually saying that, you're going to see asset quality still deteriorating in first semester of 2012, and probably peak, I guess on June, July of this year. What's happening? I mean certainly, we did see a deceleration of the economy. However, we still have full employment and real wage gains. How is that not translating in some improvements on asset quality and why does the target keep moving ahead? Can you just help us understand a little bit what the underlying problem there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no new problems, first of all. I think that you've mentioned, which is very important &#x2013; let's talk about individuals and talk about companies. In terms of individuals, we believe that, I mean the new vintages of credits that we're seeing have great quality. W are very confident that over time this will improve. But some of those portfolios are longer, okay? It has for instance vehicles, so it's a long portfolio. So it takes some time to you to see it in terms of NPLs over 90 days. But we are very much confident that this was one of the products of this year that the quality that we are generating from the second semester on is much, much better than what we were generating in the first semester or before that, okay?. And this was in terms of individuals, the portfolio that was hurting more our numbers in terms of delinquencies.</p>
          <p>In terms of companies, then I think that the issue of the economic growth because although the economic growth has slowed down a lot, the labor level has not changed in Brazil. So there were &#x2013; people did not lose their jobs. So this did not affect as much the individuals portfolio. But on the companies portfolio especially with small companies, we had much more difficulties because the economy was much slower, okay, than we expected and much slower than we planned. And this is the main reason why we have moving ahead improvements of targets. In the two directions, the slowdown in the economy in the last quarter was zero growth. This affected not only the quality, the capacity of companies to pay back the loans but also the growth and demand for loans.</p>
          <p>So we were affected in that ratio on both sides when we came to that. So we have put up &#x2013; yes, we are not at the peak. We see some improvement and some increase in this NPL over 90 days for the next semester. But we believe that the combination of what we have already done in terms of controlling the new, the quality of new loans and the improve in the economy, we will have an improvement at the end of the year in terms of delinquency. This basically is the story, Jorge.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And just one really quick clarification on Redecard, in the press release where you said that it's neutral in terms of results for the next few years, does that already include an assumption of the tax benefits or the tax benefits, if they appear separate to this view of the deal being neutral or is it already included there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we have not fully analyzed and concluded the tax effects of Redecard. It might have some impact, but it's very small. I mean, the impact of tax is basically very, very, very small in the next two years if it had some, okay? Small in terms of impact on the bank, okay, so I will not count too much on that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Mario Pierry from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. Let me ask you two questions as well, Roberto, both of them related to Ita&#xFA;. First on your cost improvements that you're guiding for the efficiency improvements, part of the improvements we have seen on your expense base has been related to head count reductions since the first quarter. So, I was wondering if you have a specific target of head count reductions over the next two, three years or where should we expect improvements to come from in the future?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is also related to your BIS ratio. You were recently quoted in the Brazilian papers saying that you wanted the Brazilian Central Bank to be more flexible, I mean, same interpretation of Basel III with regards to the deferred tax credits that were created from temporary differences. I was wondering when should we expect the final announcement from the Brazilian Central Bank with regards to Basel III and what are your expectations with regards to whether or not you can be allowed to use deferred tax credits from temporary differences as part of Tier 1 capital? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of efficiency ratio, I think that we are very much confident on the expense side, that expenses will be in the range that we are announcing. I think that 8%, it's the number that we believe that only a disaster would cause an increase above this level of 8%. We are very confident that we can be in the range that we are announcing. So, efficiency ratio in this regard will depend much more on the growth of revenues, which we have a scenario. There are some uncertainty in the scenario, but we believe that the basic scenario that we have ahead of us is a scenario that will deliver this kind of efficiency ratio. Although in this scenario, we have some problems in Europe, I think some risks in Europe that might change the overall conditions. But I'm pretty much confident that on the expense side, we will deliver on the fee service side, we will deliver on insurance, we will deliver. And we're not so sure about what would happen if conditions in Europe gets worse than what we have it today. Although it can get much better, which should be even good news, better news for Brazil and for the conditions in our markets overall.</p>
          <p>The second question relating to Basel III, there is a timetable that says in the capital, the new capital requirements for banks, this goes from next year, I think until 2019. We are quite &#x2013; we are fully comfortable that the bank will be able to comply with all the requirements of Basel III in any conditions in the timetable that they have announced. I think that the Brazilian market has one peculiarity as many other markets have different peculiarities, which is a question about the time that provisions on loan loss, which is not deductible at the moment that we made them, are only deductible on the road, so this creates a different situation.</p>
          <p>Italy had a similar problem, and they have created a very special thing for that. So I think that we have discussed this issue about credit tax deferment and find solutions for that, so that we don't have, in terms of market, a major impact. Our specific case, we believe that on the timetable of Basel III, we will be able to comply even on the side of &#x2013; on the issue of tax credits. We believe that we will be able to comply few on the timetable that they are announcing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me just follow up then on your expense guidance, then you're basically saying that your expenses should be growing roughly in line with inflation, even though you are going to be growing your loan book much faster. So what I understood is you don't foresee meaningful space to reduce head count in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have an objective of reducing head count. We have objective of reducing expenses. In some cases if you end up reducing head count. But this is not a guidance. It's not an objective. It's much more reducing expense. And on the other hand, we are still growing the bank. We don't want to basically control expense. We want to control efficiency and we want to keep growing. As I mentioned to you, we have basically opened 82 branches in the last quarter. We are announcing that we will be opening another 150 branches during the year of 2012. I mean we have additional head count for that in some areas because we are increasing business volumes. In other areas, we are putting more efficiency so we had some reduction on some other areas. But I mean, there is no meaningful program or objective to reduce or to achieve a certain number of people in terms of head count.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Very clear. Thank you, very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of follow-ups on Redecard also. And first question is maybe a little bit of a delicate question, to be frank. And with Redecard's price trading, last time I checked, slightly above your offer price even factoring in the dividend of R$1.1 per share, the market seems to be indicating that they believe that there is a decent probability that Ita&#xFA; will up their price from R$35. And I wanted to just get your feedback on how you would think about it if it becomes clear that you won't be able to get the two thirds approval for the offer. Are you willing to step away from the transaction and how would you think about the possibility of having to increase the bid?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I wanted to get some clarity on the Basel impact and just kind of square away what I heard to in response to Carlos Macedo's question and what I heard on the Portuguese call. Is it fair to say that under Basel III fully loaded, which would be 2016, there would be a 60 basis point negative impact? I also heard on the Portuguese call that it could be slightly positive under Basel II. Could you just elaborate? Is my understanding correct? And if you can just elaborate on what the impact, probably impact would work under the existing capital rules.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on price, we are not considering at all change the offer and we believe that we will be able to achieve our objectives. On the number of Basel III, there's a timetable that stays in the impact and the peak of the impact will be, I think in 2016 or 2017, I'm not sure and it will be something around 60 basis points, 70 basis points more or less, maybe less than that. Let's say something in between 50 basis points and 70 basis points. This has to do with the timetable of the amortization of the intangibles. So it's not a precise number, but something that we have taken into account and is part of the discussion and we believe that we have room for that in terms of capital in the bank.</p>
          <p>Today, we don't have Basel III and we have zero impact coming from Basel III. So basically we are talking about Basel II roads today. We will start having Basel III impact next year and the year after, which are minor because they are starting to phase in. And as I've mentioned it will phase in as we amortize part of the total price. So this is the reason why we have 60 basis points more or less of expected impact on the BIS ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the existing capital rules there, there is virtually no impact on your capital ratio?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks again for taking the questions. Just a follow-up on the potential goodwill amortization, we are aware about all the limitations. But, I just would like to understand the potential schedule for a goodwill amortization? We remember that in other occasions like, which one, you merged with Unibanco or acquired BankBoston, you usually amortized everything on one shot. So, just I would like to understand, if you have any goodwill to amortize if you would do it again, or if you would amortize over a longer period of time? Okay, and then I do my second question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We are not planning to amortize fully, at this moment. Basically, we have a new accounting rule in Brazil, which is International Accounting Rule, the IFRS rules. And in this to comply with IFRS, we would not be able to amortizing it ourselves, so we have to comply with that. And this is the &#x2013; our consolidated balance sheet, we are carrying on, on IFRS rules. So, this would not be possible to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect, very clear. And the second question about the evolution of your balance sheet. As you mentioned in the presentation, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:22) evolution was notable. So could you elaborate a little bit more on the strategic decisions that led to the surge on the high quality at deposits in the quarter? And what do we expect for deposits evolution in 2012? And specifically should you consider that the loan to deposit ratio has further room for improvements during this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in terms of results, the impact is not &#x2013; it's very minor because margins on deposits on the margin is quite small. So the overall impact is now under results of today. I'm not &#x2013; I don't have the number here to give you in terms of how this ratio between loans and deposits will <mark type="ph" /> evolute (59:15) but probably basically we don't think that it will change in a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:21) way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So no specific, I know, action that you did in the fourth quarter that led to the surge in deposits because as long as I can see you improved not only, I know, on an absolute basis, but also comparing to your peers during the quarter. So you gain that it seems market share in terms of the deposits in the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. Thanks for the opportunity. Just my question is a follow-up on the delinquency question. Is it fair to say that there may be delinquency rate, it's probably going to deteriorate, maybe not only in the first, but also in the second quarter, and then the stability after that or do you think that the first quarter will be the peak? And my other question is especially to the sem one is regarding provisions, right, given &#x2013; there is one slide in your presentation where you show that the coverage had to come down, because you have loss <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:00:40) loss were already, you could not go above 100% coverage, which I understand, but so that means that maybe in terms of provision expenses in 2012, we should see them basically growing at a lower growth rate than the loan portfolio itself? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could be first quarter, it could be second quarter in terms of peak of operations. We don't have it very clear. I think it depends on market conditions, it depends on also the dollar ratio because, as you know, this impacts the portfolio. So it's not &#x2013; I mean we're talking about the small differences and small differences might change with the dollar number because it affects 10 basis points, 20 basis points easily the NPL ratio and the variations that we have seen on the dollar side. So I'm not so sure about what would be the peak in terms of dollar ratio, okay.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, I mean, we don't have a month that is real changed. It's overall a trend. We believe that the trend is the one that has started already. It's some increase in the first semester and some decreased at the second semester. With the end of the year, pretty much on the level that we are seeing today. Basically, this is what we expect. I don't have too much more information to give you at this moment</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just on margins, looking at back slide on page six of the presentation, when you look at that NIM on a kind of normalized basis at 11.4%, if you can just go through the kind of rationale of how you arrive with that 11.4%, is that normalizing for Selic and also for the cost of funding? Is that what you're doing there? And if Selic is coming down and really you growing fastest in time deposits, then I don't get why the actual margin has diverted from this normalized one. Can you just clarify there what the explanation you gave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Victor, it's Rog&#xE9;rio Calder&#xF3;n speaking. The way we calculated that was to make the loans to funds stable when compared to the third quarter and also this Selic not moving during the quarter. That's the way we came up with this 11.4%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's keeping &#x2013; yeah, it's keeping the loans to funding ratio the same?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would it be fair to say that you kind of frontloaded here a little bit in terms of the funding and your growth in deposits and we'll see that approach the 100% ratio again heading back into 1Q 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would not say that. I think that we will try to be below that level of 100%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a quick follow up if I may on renegotiated credits and wheeling back into the credit quality, we saw that increase again as a percentage of the total portfolio in Q4. Would you expect to see that normalize or shall we say stabilize into 1Q and 2Q and follow the line that you expect in terms of the credit quality cycle that you are talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are talking about the small valuations which is very difficult to really make it very precise. Basically what we see is I think the best indication that we can give you is what we have in the 15 to 90 days NPLs. This is what we can expect in terms of impact for the next quarter. I believe that as the economy improve this will give us some additional gains in terms of quality on the company's portfolio. And the individuals, I think the trend is very clear and I think that we probably will keep on going in this trend of improving quality.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Thank you guys for taking my call and the question. And just two questions, I have follow-up on Redecard. Have you made an estimation of what is the potential cost saving you could achieve when integrating with the cost operations into Ita&#xFA;'s infrastructure? We would guess that a substantial amount of the general and living expenses could be incorporated into existing infrastructure, when talking about putting call centers and accounting and operating systems. And this would have an important impact in terms of how you view this transaction in terms of value creations. So have you provided any sort of analysis in terms of synergies that could get on Redecard? And then I have a follow-up question on capital but maybe let's get this out of the way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are some synergies. They are not that meaningful in these transactions, especially because the 3% of Redecard is inside Ita&#xFA; already, okay? We already provide them with a lot of sources. So this is already in-house, so there will be no gains coming from, for instance, technology mainly because we already done &#x2013; we are already doing most of the services, which is probably the main line of expenses on Redecard, if you do not consider commercial expenses. In commercial result, no big synergies given the fact that we will keep the company alive in terms of the operational life and so we are not foreseeing that much synergy. Yes, we will integrate the accounting and things like that, but this is not really that much meaningful, in terms of making a big difference for the operation.</p>

          <p>So, in this slide, I think there was a mention regarding the return on capital employed that was going to be in line with the opportunities that are available elsewhere. What is the type of return on capital employed that you would expect to get from this transaction unless you take into account these cost savings and potential?</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:08:12) to account and the fact that we have Basel II is due on today and that the fact this will phase in to Basel III over time, we have a reasonable rate of return, which means that is above our cost of capital,. But if we are talking about the return on investments, the full value that we are paying, then we would be below the cost of capital of the bank.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's interesting. Now, one final question regarding your, the subject delayed about this capital impact on Basel III and whatnot and the phasing of the impact, what is your level of capital on your core Tier 1 under the existing rules that came out of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:09:11) today? Because we know that there's been a phasing in and the way that we perceive they phasing in is is basically in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:09:19) The weakest link of the world financial system to adapt over time and we're thinking here maybe Japanese banks, et cetera. So, when investors and we analysts look at this, they say, well, what is our starting point today, and what is the amount of input that you have to make up over time, and how is this going to be achieved in terms of is it like slower growth or maybe cut into dividend payout, et cetera? So, it would be very useful for us to know what is the level today in order for us to start making the necessary estimates of how this is going to go over time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I don't have a number for you today at this moment here, but I can assure you that today we already comply with the levels of Basel III in 2019 considering everything, okay. We have already conditioned to comply today with Basel III. Basically we will be much more close to the minimum levels but we would need no additional capital to comply with Basel III. Although I have to say also that there's a lot of things that has to be more detailed. We are talking about big numbers and sometimes the devils are on the details but as we can &#x2013; our interpretation is that we are basically already complying with Basel III today.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you all of you to be with us today. We had lot of things to discuss. I think that, I believe that I could make some clarification about the guidance for this year and some explanation about Redecard. But in addition, Rog&#xE9;rio and his team will be available for additional questions that you might have. I know that we still have some questions open, but given the time, we are closing the session at this point. Thank you all for being with us. Bye-bye.</p>
