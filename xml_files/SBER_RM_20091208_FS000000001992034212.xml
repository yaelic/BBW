          <p>Good day, and welcome to the Sberbank Q3 Results 2009 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Dmitry Zhdanovich. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to welcome you to the presentation of Sberbank's third quarter '09 IFRS results. The format of the presentation is straightforward. We will first provide you an overview of the main highlights of the third quarter financial performance, Sberbank's competitive position, and operating environment. This will be followed by Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>The main speaker today is Mr. Anton Karamzin, the Deputy CFO, the Member of Executive Board and the Chief of the company. My name is Dmitry Zhdanovich, and I'm the Head of IR. So with that, let me pass over to Mr. Karamzin.</p>
          <p>Please be aware that we do have the results presentation available on our website, www.sberbank.ru/com at the section called Investor Relations. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. In keeping with good tradition, we are holding our call and the highlights of the numbers for &#x2013; as at the 30th of September 2009 and for nine months of 2009 are the following: Our operating income before provision charge for loan impairment continues to show sustainable growth or consistent growth, I would say. And it has increased for nine months this year as compared to nine months of last year by 48.7%. Our net interest income grew by 40.4%. Net commission income grew 19.6%. Whilst at the same time the staff cost has decreased by 5.5%, which has resulted in pre-provisions &#x2013; financial positions &#x2013; financial results to be at a very respectable level. The provision charges for loan impairment increased 8.3 fold to comparable period last year, and that reflects our view on the risk profile of our loan book. We continued to maintain highly liquid balance sheet in this environment, just under 17 or exactly 16.9% of our Group's total assets.</p>
          <p>Our liquid assets that have remaining expected maturity on demand or less than one &#x2013; less than up to one month. We continue to stick to highly &#x2013; to high capital adequacy ratios under Basel 1 Accord. Our total capital adequacy ratio is 18.8% as of 30th of September 2009, and it is well above the minimum required of 8%.</p>
          <p>Our gross loan portfolio has grown by 4.8% compared to the beginning of 2009 and that dynamic consists of two diverse trends. Our corporate loan book which is about three times bigger than our retail loan book, has grown by over 8.9% &#x2013; 8.4%, whilst our retail loan portfolio structure has decreased by 6.7% which is &#x2013; will primarily explain &#x2013; with the reduction in the consumer demand for loans because this has been happening on the backdrop of us making our products more available and cheaper and more convenient and more accessible for the public. And increase in retail accounts and deposits has shown 9.9% compared to the beginning of the year and they've reached 3.3 billion &#x2013; 3.4 trillion rubles as of the reporting date.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll probably conclude the initial highlights outline session. And once again, refer for your convenience to the presentation that is available on our website. The address was just given by Dmitry, and I hope that will make it more convenient to &#x2013; for you to come up with questions. We'll be happy to answer.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I just wanted to get maybe some of your thoughts. You've been quoted in the press being much more positive on the outlook for 2010. Could you perhaps give us some flavor on that? You reported to have said that you see at least a minimum of 100 billion of net profit. And then going from there, if you could just put a bit more color on your outlook on volumes, provisions, are you seeing provisions coming down quicker? What kind of numbers would you expect? If you could give any guidance and then finally just on the margins, how quickly are you seeing loans being repriced downwards and how much can you reprice your cost of funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The outlook we're giving of above 100 rubles net profit that we're putting into the business planning process that is scheduled to complete by the end of this year &#x2013; this calendar year. It's not yet a final number, but we thought that we might want to indicate that to the uses of our statement and to the investors simply because it needs to be perceived in the right context. If you recollect, our last year's profit was just above this number. And if you compare the underlying pre-provisioning net income dynamics with last year and this year, then this would mean that the 100 million would simply be a return to the net profitability level of year 2008, which in itself was hurt by the fourth quarter which &#x2013; when the crisis has already been raging in full swing. So, 100 million, whilst it is 10 times bigger than what we're showing now, it is still a relatively conservative outlook.</p>
          <p>Now, what is this based upon? It is difficult to forecast the volume in both real and nominal terms of our asset growth. However, we ourselves &#x2013; well simply because there's a number of external factors that are impacting that that are difficult to predict and as many of you are experienced investors and sophisticated analysts, you would certainly relate to the fact that to put an exact finger on the inflation forecast, demand for credit forecast in Russia is a bit tricky these days.</p>
          <p>So, but in these current conditions what we can say is that, firstly, we do believe that we can do a lot of things to improve accessibility of the credit without comprising the quality of the risk appetite that we've got. We &#x2013; those of you who are in Moscow can see and in &#x2013; or in any other cities in Russia, can see that this belief is &#x2013; we're putting our money where our mouth is and the volumes of advertising of our loan products on the streets of the country is of almost unprecedented levels.</p>
          <p>What this means is that the interest of the macro level of Russian economy where everyone understands that pushing more credit through to the real sector will help it recover quicker, are very closely aligned to our own commercial interest. And we are very actively working on finding enough good credits to secure the asset growth, to bring us back to the return on equity levels that we're indicating to be our strategic targets in our strategy, which means above 20%.</p>
          <p>Now, the timing when exactly we're going to reach that again is a bit tricky, but that brings us back to the main driver, which is being the margins and which was part of your question as well.</p>
          <p>The margins that we're showing currently are healthy &#x2013; are very much healthy and if you can recollect the full-year 2007 margins, which was showing pretty decent results was almost a full 150 basis points lower than now. So, we sense that there is, firstly, enough of room for us to maneuver competitively because our margins are much, much better than most of the competition in this market, and it's definitely better than any of the big-size competition that we have to gauge ourselves against. And also the pricing power that we have got in the Russian market competitively although &#x2013; yeah, the pricing power would allow us to protect our margins much longer than anyone else in this market. So, whilst we certainly see that the current level of margins is at its peak and there's due to be some trend to reduction, there's a very long way to go before we can start worrying about it. So, in that context, the 100 million, I'd put on a reasonably conservative side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ma'am, we are ready to take the second question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. If I could follow-up on the provisions, there was &#x2013; just your view on how quickly provisions can come down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Provisioning, again, continuing to follow the same logic as we follow in all our communications with investors and analysts, throughout 2009, we see the provision as a main indicator of the risk profile. And we do see &#x2013; and this is already starting to filter through to our financials that the pace of creating the provisions and the pace of their growth is starting to slow down.</p>
          <p>In fact, if you compare quarter three to quarter two, it's almost halved. So, we &#x2013; the way this dynamic is going to develop in terms of how we perceive it is that we will continue to be creating new provisions on specific assets and loans pretty much all the way, almost throughout the first half of 2010 at a pace that is bigger than pre-crisis. However, because a lot of provisioning that we already do have now have been created quite a while go. Now, end of last year, early this year, as we work our way through those problems together with our borrowers, it's been a long enough time for us to see sustainable trends of recovery in those particular clients and to give us the basis for releasing some of the provisions.</p>
          <p>So, we are already &#x2013; on certain transactions which are working itself out of the problem of borrowers, that are working themselves out of the problem, we have already started releasing. We hope that this trend gathers pace and by some time, hopefully within the first half of the next year, that pace will overcome the pace of creation of new provisions. And we will be releasing more than we create.</p>
          <p>The length of time and the time length that this dynamic sets in is pretty natural for us because, again, our loan book is 99% plain vanilla bilateral loan transactions, which take quite a bit of time to go bad and then to go back to recovery if there's a basis for that. So, it's just a bit longer dynamic than you would see in the more sophisticated markets and product portfolios.</p>
          <p>So, where will that peak? Given that we're pretty modest on the nominal growth of the loan book forecast, the provisions to portfolio may as well peak out at 12%, 14%, maybe closer to 12 than 14. But you have to be &#x2013; before they start recovering, but you have to be bearing in mind two things that there is two parts to this equation, the size of &#x2013; the dynamic of the loan book and the timing of creation and release of the provisions, and also that our capital allows us to comfortably digest much, much more.</p>
          <p>So, hopefully, the outlook that I'm giving now in terms of numbers turns out to be conservative and modest. But we have consistently been doing so, and hopefully have been showing some consistent trend in beating the expectations, so &#x2013; or beating our own estimates. So, hopefully, there would be some positive news later down the road. So, yes, that's the way we see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry, just to clarify that I've heard and I'm interpreting it correctly, in the second half is it possible that the releases will be over the new creation of provisions, which net-net may mean a P&amp;L positive charge rather than what we see now like negative charges. Is that the correct interpretation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. With all being equal with the way the world is seeing the macro-dynamics in Russia now, hopefully, that would be something that is highly probable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from Marta Czajkowska from KBC Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. It's Marta Czajkowska from KBC Securities. Maybe we could &#x2013; you could comment also on your guidance on cost. The latest what we could see in Newswires was up to 15% rate increase. But on the other hand, you have guided for the tough reduction. And maybe if you could comment on any cost-cutting initiatives in non-HR costs, thank you, for the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The cost dynamics that have been driving the results that we're showing now has been the following. We've been quite aggressive in holding off on paying our people in the times of uncertainty, so that has allowed us to save quite a lot of money on the cost of pay.</p>
          <p>We have also been quite conservative in spending money on line expenses and sort of strategic budget, strategic investment budget into our technology, et cetera. So, how much of that is sustainable, how much of that is due to go back? Well, head count reductions as you have mentioned are sustainable and the story is going to be even better because this year also includes most of the charges that are associated with parting with people, which are definitely not going to hit us next year for those people that have gone.</p>
          <p>We have done quite a lot of initiatives that ensure sustainable savings on the cost base, and we have much more up our sleeve. In fact, we have so much more that is going last us, at least three or four years, to realize the full potential that we see. We do see and we've tested that now after a couple of years of the new management team being in place that there's a lot of room for sustainable cost efficiency improvement, including the head count numbers.</p>
          <p>Now, where I would have liked us, in retrospect, where I would have liked us to be on the cost/income ratio. Instead of low 30s, I probably would have liked us to be in higher 30s because of the fact that we've been a bit too conservative in spending money on our strategy, whilst we've been hardly working on executing that, but trying to stressing our team heavily, trying to do miracles, i.e., get all the strategically planned efficiencies and results without actually investing money into it. I would have loved us to invest just a little bit more.</p>
          <p>And in the context of our bank showing over 50% cost/income ratio for a comparable nine months of 2008, only 12 months ago, high 30s instead of low-to-mid-30s in the cost/income ratios would have been more sensible. So, we would like to compensate &#x2013; next year to compensate a little bit for that underspending to catch up, which means that we can afford ourselves to be in low-40s next year, which would include whatever spending was originally planned for 2010 in accordance with our plans plus some compensation for underspent investment into strategic initiatives for this year. We will continue in 2010 to reduce head count because we see a lot of productivity gains that we could make further. So, low 40s, as most of you &#x2013; the audience of this call, investors and analysts are providing to me the feedback on that low 40s are quite respectable as compared to any of the big competitor in the global context. So we hope that we'll be comfortable with very low 40s next year.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from David Nangle of Renaissance Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Hey, Anton and Dmit, it's Dave Nangle.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Yes, I just &#x2013; a couple of questions, and I want to start with the guidance, just to go back to that point. You said 100 billion rubles at least next year and you say you're being conservative. Like, what way I'm looking at is, I'm clearly looking at your operating profit, which is very strong this year; it's over 400 billion rubles. You're talking about potential write-backs in provisions in the second half of next year, enough potential I know. So with a more realistic forecast for next year's earnings not be &#x2013; at a minimum 100 billion and at top-end 200 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll leave the upside to your imagination, David. Look, I'm the boring conservative CFO, so don't push me on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's never a shortage of upside enthusiasm in our market, as we all know. So, I see my duty to give you the guidance on the minimum. So all the rest is, as we always mentioned, relatively easily can be reverse engineered from the macro trends that you can see in the Russian economy, and that's the easier be it for anyone who is looking at Sberbank as compared to any other bank. So, sorry I can't &#x2013; my own fantasy helps me, but I feel I cannot be public about this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fair. I just wanted to throw it at you. And, but also, just say for Q4, you're saying 15 billion rubles for 2009 and you've already made 17.2 billion for 10 months, nothing bad happened in November or December. I assume you're just being conservative again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, no, yeah. We're just being conservative, and again because, compared to our size, a few billion rubles each way is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...is purely a rounding thing and we've got big transactions, we've got hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of small transactions, which can statistically through rounding give us a spread between the financial result between 10 and 20 billion. Again, there's the Russian press. I made a little bit of a point on the Russian press conference today when I said like "our estimate is 10 billion, 20 billion rubles as per Russian standards for the end of the year and God knows maybe 15, but let's stay within the range." And they immediately kind of put the headlines of saying, oh it's 15, but may be 15, may be 17, that type of precision on the backdrop of the net operating income of 400 billion is really meaningless.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And &#x2013; but that's a kind of general questions. I got a little bit specific, I won't be long, but just on costs, you said low 40 cost/income, which is fair. But head count, in your presentation you're at 254,500 head count at the end of September. Can you give me a number ballpark for what that will at end '09 and what you'd expect it to be at end 2010? And you're looking at kicking back on the wage side next year. We've heard a number of 15% wage inflation, is that a factual number and does that maybe kick in on January 1st or later on next year? And just finally, non-staff expenses, they're up 4% year-on-year for the nine months of 2009. Are we looking to getting back &#x2013; given your earlier comments, a double-digit growth of non-staff expenses next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. On the head count, we're sticking to the same outlook as set out in our strategy, 220 by 2014 &#x2013; 220,000 people by 2014. We are pushing hard to fulfill our business plan of 10% reduction by end of this year for full-year 2009, and it would be sensible for us to be continuing to showing round 5% reduction every following year. So, at least we sense that this is something, but is not easily, with quite some work, but is achievable.</p>
          <p>In terms of head count associated costs and pay costs, again we have &#x2013; we're pushing hard to get to the 10% head count reduction, but most of that has been happening in the second half of the year, which means that the full effect of that is going to be seen much later, i.e., in 2010. We also have said that we will reassess most of the positions in our staff schedule and reprice them according to the market.</p>
          <p>We will definitely be doing everything that is needed to retain the best staff, who &#x2013; on the shoulders of whom we will carry all these difficult reforms that we have to make. The markets in the banking sector in Russia are paying up. The competition is paying up for the talent and paying up pretty much to pre-crisis level. The math that we're doing is that 15 is the guideline that we set ourselves, but we will actually be doing very specific review. Some people were overpaying too and we are going to be honest to people in those cases and tell them like, after some comfort period, we are going to be bringing you back to the market. But some people were underpaying and in those cases we were also gradually going to be bringing them back. The math should be stacking up in such a way that we will be still showing very comfortable cost/income ratios, we will be still showing very comfortable dynamic in head count reduction, and we will be at the same time be able to pay people fairly in accordance to the market.</p>
          <p>There are distortions both up and down. So the market may not necessarily end up coming to exact 15, but that's where we are sending the message to our people that &#x2013; if you have strong talent and you earn the papers, the market, we will be prepared to put it right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fair, and just one last question, specific. And your depository receipt program, there's a lot of market focus on it, you've given some indication so far. Is there anything concrete you can tell us today or what are your latest plans?</p>

          <p>Once, it's set to the landscape, we will kind of kick off the detailed discussion at the management level here, what exactly are we doing in that environment, in that regulatory environment, and in that market environment. We still fundamentally believe that this is the best thing that we can do these days for our investor base after showing stellar financial results. So, we're committed to properly reviewing and deciding on the mechanics soon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But the Regulator should &#x2013; would you say at the year-end or it should be done quite soon on that? And then from your side, you're not actually raising capital, so it's just a structural issue, is it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. Exactly. We're not raising capital. On the last Supervisory Board Meeting that's taken place a couple of weeks ago, we are due to report to the Board whether we need them to exercise on their right to raise new capital. The shareholders' meeting has delegated to them back in June and our proposal was clear and unambiguous, we don't need new money, and that obviously was approved by the Board unanimously. So for us, you're absolutely right, it's a structural issue. And from what we hear in press, the Regulator is saying that they're expecting their registered regulation out of Ministry of Justice by about end of this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, given that it was only &#x2013; when was that, yesterday or today? Today. They've announced &#x2013; they published a new &#x2013; the terms of initial agreements with the creditors. We &#x2013; in that context, for one to digest that for a day or two before we actually can say how that may impact our own timeline of doing the due deal. So, if our call would have been a few days later, I probably would have had some guess, but our guys are still looking at that and digesting it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Would it be &#x2013; I mean, how would you construct it, would you be acquiring the bank or just the assets? And do you think, I mean, your talks are exclusive than to mean how do you censor it to that exclusion, will it be challenged by others?</p>

          <p>I'm not sure I can &#x2013; I have enough detail handy now to give full comments about that. I'm yet to give our guys that are working on this transaction, at least today to digest the data and come up with impressions. All right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And one final question, just on the loan quality, I mean, clearly deceleration in the NPL ratio in the third quarter, that's very fortunate news, but just, I mean, can you shed some light first on how your restructured loans are developing? How much it was at the end of the second quarter and how it was at the end of the third quarter? And just give an idea of what's going on with NPLs and restructured loans, whether it's &#x2013; I mean, is it just a matter of now or maturing of your rebate loans or is there &#x2013; are you seeing some of the client that were not paying before now starting to pay again? Or is it just, I mean, you're writing down some loans and that's why at some point, I mean, the NPL ratio will peak and then start to drop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. On the proportion of restructured loans, again, we're normally required to disclose that only at year-end, but keeping with good tradition of transparency, I can give you some indicators. As at mid-year, it was about 10% or less and now it's around 12, 12.2. When we look at &#x2013; just one second, I'll just dig out the right page.</p>
          <p>Right. If we look at Page 10, which is Note 5, loans and advances to customers continued, there's an interesting table that analyzes the split of impaired loans by maturities. It shows you an interesting dynamic that actually &#x2013; those loans that were impaired back at last quarter, pretty much they are a bit longer-dated obviously, but they have been pretty much there and the dynamic of the fresh ones like loans up to 30 days overdue, 60 days overdue. If you compare that with second quarter, that actually has been quite positive. There's no significant new things coming up. And is it collectively assessed or individually impaired, and in either commercial loans or specialized loans? So that means that the new, fresh NPL creation or rather impaired loans creation is showing significant slowdown. We obviously welcome that dynamic and hope that gives you enough guidance.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question from Dmitry Trembovolsky from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. Hello, guys. Just I wanted to follow up a bit on your comments on costs. Clearly, this is the thing that you control the most, and you were giving some thoughts on the staff expenses clearly indicating that you probably will have to catch up with the market and I guess people will be budgeting this 15% number, I think, because you didn't give any number in their models. Now, in terms of non-staff expenses, I guess you &#x2013; there were very good dynamics this year and you were indicating that the guys who were implementing your strategy were struggling to really go on with all the plans without adequate financing. So, can you give us some more thoughts on how your non-personnel expenses are going to develop next year in the context of what you were saying about need to invest in the franchise, need to invest in the growth, and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, most of that investment is actually expected to come in terms of CapEx. We will create data center capacities when we centralize the industrial-type functions in terms of creating &#x2013; investing in software development, which will allow us to release most of the cost efficiency. So, the financial impact of that is going to be delayed in accordance with proper accounting rules. So that's where we have under invested a little bit. Also we are &#x2013; we were talking in the public space that we would want to refresh the format, the visual format of how our branches look.</p>
          <p>But instead of the one sharp redesign and huge investment into the branch network refurbishment, at one point, we said to ourselves, look, as and when we &#x2013; our regular refurbishment schedule and repairment schedule comes for the branches, we will be switching them to the new format and our target is that it costs us &#x2013; although we wanted to make it significantly better, but it should be costing us not more than what it has been costing us per square meter before.</p>
          <p>In anticipation of that, we have actually put on hold some of the CapEx and OpEx associated with repairs to the branch network for several months this year. So, that will be catching up a little bit next year, so it would probably see not the regular amount but say about 1.5 of our regular amount put into the comparable cost, CapEx and OpEx next year. But what you can be comfortable about that this is just catching up with the delayed schedule and that we're not investing a single ruble more per square meter into that cost. This is a very hard and not movable threshold that the Executive Board is putting to the system. Yes, we're re-formatting, yes, we're catching up from postponing some of the expenses from 2009, 2010. But on the medium-term perspective, it shouldn't have a single ruble more cost impact on our financials. So, that's some color that I can give you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But just to sort of &#x2013; so, you're saying that the strategy costs are not actually &#x2013; will not be charged through the P&amp;L mainly, right? So the increase of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. What I'm saying is that a good chunk may be more than half of the things that are associated with strategy budget are going to be going through the CapEx budget. But, yeah, there'll be OpEx stuff associated with that as well. And also, the way the strategic efficiency initiatives are having the impact on the financials is obviously, you spend some money first and then you start to recognize the financial impact, say, the following year when you've &#x2013; for example, you've concentrated certain industrial-type functions first in, say, in a bigger data warehouse like we've done in Moscow. But it takes you some time to get rid of the 13 back offices that have been operating on the single territory of Moscow City that we've had before.</p>
          <p>So the full financial impact of getting rid of those 13 is only going to be showing itself up from 2010, once we've made full investment into the single back office with a data center this year. So, there'll be both efficiencies from '09 impacting '010 and new investment in '010 that &#x2013; through CapEx and OpEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. But can I just then to finish up this particular topic just to be really straightforward on this and to say that in the nine months of 2009 as it was said previously over the last nine months of 2010, your OpEx &#x2013; your non-staff expenses went up by 4%. I mean, if you look on average for the last four years before 2009, they were going up by around 26%, so it's a huge difference. I mean, a huge, sort of work that you have done, I guess, to achieve that. So shall we now expect that you &#x2013; I mean, you will increase these expenses and I mean, will you guide us that there will be, say, a low double-digit increase or shall we expect that you will come back to over 20% increase per year in non-personnel expenses in the next year as you're going to catch up with what you were expensing previously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'll give you pretty straightforward answer. With one condition that the inflation is not spiraling out of control next year and showing the decent level that it's been showing this year, we should be expecting low-double digit and definitely not the 26-type stuff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Now, the second question that I have is on margins again, just a bit more color on that. So, clearly, you now have to reprice back the &#x2013; as far as I understand, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but you have to reprice back somewhat the asset side, you priced back the loans that you &#x2013; well you increased pricing in the beginning of this year and end of last year. At the same time, you obviously repriced your funding side just modestly and actually it looks like this particular quarter, you were only able to sustain the margins because you repriced corporate deposits down.</p>
          <p>So the question is that, obviously, we have the Central Bank rates going down and probably you will have to follow with reducing your &#x2013; the asset rates. And will you be comfortable in also repricing the retail deposits, which is the bulk of your funding and also the corporate deposits potentially risking of losing some market share but in a way to sort of protect your margins or in a way to defend the slowdown a bit in the margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have got a lot of flexibility in repricing our corporate deposit base and we have been using that actively to protect our margin because the corporate client is far more liquid in terms of changing from one bank to another looking for better conditions. And we have got a lot of loyalty in that pricing. On top of flexibility, we also &#x2013; and quicker pricing, we also have got a lot of loyalty from our client base whom we are supporting during the difficult times. We were to keep the cash.</p>
          <p>In terms of the retail deposits, I would have liked to give you some guidance on how exactly we're perceiving this dynamic and whether we're ready to reprice and how effectively can we reprice. But I'm particularly sensitive to any price indications on the retail deposit base because of this particulars of the local market. When you're 50% of the domestic retail savings deposit market, anything that might hint in that direction will have competitive &#x2013; significant competitive impact, and in fact, will have significant macro-impact on the country.</p>
          <p>So what &#x2013; instead of giving you specific guidance on that, I probably just refer you to page 10 on the presentation that we're showing that tells you how much we actually have been reacting to the market dynamics with the cost of our retail deposits and current accounts, and how many decimals of a percentage has it &#x2013; or percentage point has it been showing as reaction to the changed markets and let you extrapolate from those dynamics.</p>
          <p>To conclude, I'll tell you we're very comfortable in our ability to protect our margins and market shares in non-pricing terms. We still sense that our products, both in the assets and the liability side can be made much more competitive and more attractive for the growing client base through making them more convenient and more accessible other than in pricing terms. And that's where we are yet to release a lot of potential for Sberbank.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from Alex Kantarovich from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello, gentlemen. My question is perhaps going back to NIM, net interest margin. What sort of erosion can you sustain given the flexibility that you have with your market share in deposits? This is question number one.</p>
          <p>Second question is, is it reasonable to assume that the peak in provisioning charge can perhaps take place in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter of 2010? And the third question is, as to sustainability of ROE, what level can you project as a reasonable, sustainable in the long run? By long run I mean, four, five years. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alex. The market sharing in retail deposits is not a sacred cow for us, if we're talking about flexibility of a few percentage points. If you follow the Central Bank data on market shares, you can see that ours have been easily moving between 48% and 52%, and that means trillions of rubles. And we have been relatively comfortable with that type of &#x2013; with that spectrum of volatility.</p>
          <p>So, hopefully, that gives you some idea on &#x2013; or some confirmation that market share is only a sacred cow to the extent that we keep certain critical mass. At the same time, we therefore refrain from direct competition on the pricing and have been able to do so for many years including 2008 and 2009. And still, sticking to around 50. So we see no reason why we should deviate from that approach.</p>
          <p>It might fall to 45, 46, whatever. There are certain right things that we know we need to do and we are doing that in the long run will keep us close to 50 anyway and those things are not pricing, so we're comfortable. I didn't quite get your question on provisioning. You were asking how much exactly is going to come &#x2013; the provisioning charges are going to come up to in first, second quarter next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I was just asking when the peak in provisioning charge would take place, whether in the coming quarter or whether this would be first quarter of next year. I presume...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My sense is within first half of next year, maybe &#x2013; well, if all thing goes well, maybe close to the first quarter than to the second. But then again, you know me, I'm a conservative guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Anton, and back to the first question, what I was trying to figure out is what sort of erosion in net interest margin we shall assume for the next couple of years, given that flexibility that you have on the deposit side? Obviously, this gives you some pricing power, in fact, a lot of pricing power. So, in fact, in terms of net interest margin erosion, shall we assume something closer to 50 basis points or 100 basis points? And I'm not trying to figure out the exact basis points, just the magnitude of that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. But, Alex, again look, at the end of 2007, the world was still applauding to our 6.4 margin saying, yeah, but look, this is Russia, this is a competitive advantage. They are living off so fat margins of 6.4. We're now sitting at 7.8, 7.9. So, you're asking whether it's more likely 50 or 100. In terms of significance for our financials, probably still within the comfortable zones, whichever way, 50 or 100. And in terms of what factors are going to be impacting that, again, it's much more, inflation, demand for credit, balance sheet dynamics and other external factors.</p>
          <p>So if you ask me specifically, more 50 or 100, we may have some better feel because we have &#x2013; a bit later because our modeling guys and our strategic think tanks are crunching the models now whilst we are in the middle of business planning versus for next year. By the end of December, we're going to be done with that, so we may come up with some fresh scenario that we might want to share with the world. But now is a little bit too early.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I understand. And in terms of sustainable ROE, your largest competitor has been giving some pretty explicit indications. So I'm just curious if we could get any sort of feel for what the number is going to be in the long run.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I've been mentioning earlier answering other questions, there's so much productivity gain and efficiency gains that we do see internally, that we can free up. There's so much potential in the banking sector itself that needs to be unlocked. There's so much that we can achieve from turning our bank as we have said in our strategy from the product-oriented model to client-oriented model that our strategic target of above 20 ROE that we've set in our strategy, five-year strategy, still doesn't look unrealistic to me.</p>
          <p>I'm not sure what strategic or tactical perspective our competitors are giving on their own outlook for the ROEs. But in our own perception on the time horizon that you're talking about, around three, five, seven years and even longer, above 20 should be comfortably achievable.</p>

          <p>Okay. Again the asset growth &#x2013; I think I've already commented on this earlier on the call. We &#x2013; it's very difficult to pinpoint even the range. The NPL performance, yet again, I'd rather point your attention to the provisioning levels for reasons outlined early on this call and on all the previous calls. In terms of the provisions to NPL coverage, I think we're showing 1.1, 110% coverage now. So &#x2013; which is comfortably within the reasonable 80% to 120% range that most of the normal banks in the world are sticking to.</p>
          <p>So for us, it's not &#x2013; we're not particularly sensitive to the provisions to NPL coverage, volatility within those reasonable ranges of 80% to 120%, because again our capital adequacy allows us to digest much more of provisioning. So, yes, 1.1 where it is now, we're comfortable. May drop, may come up, that will depend on specific transactions that are coming through, and the pace of the work out, but we're comfortable to sticking where we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you. My next question is also related to NPLs. So in relation to the current NPLs, where do you see the two main sectors, which are driving NPL creation, and in what proportion you'll be driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Where do I see which driver, sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The two main sectors driving NPL creation currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The two main drivers. Well, as I've been mentioning on earlier calls as well in each and particular sector in corporate loan book, we do see more polarity, polarization. The people that have been feeling, some of the people that have &#x2013; the client that have been feeling bad as the crises have been developing they are feeling worse and worse, but some of the people that have been hit not that bad are actually feeling much better. And that's in every sector whether this is sort of weak or greater impacted sector or less impacted sector.</p>
          <p>So the dynamic, their polarity increases and therefore there's two opposite trends, in some of the cases we're releasing provisions already, in some of the cases we either creating new or continuing to create more provisions on the existing ones.</p>
          <p>So, in more recent months, we see more NPLs and provisioning coming from the volatility of the markets, the volatility and &#x2013; yes, the volatility rather than people underestimating their capacity and their sustainability to the crisis. So it's more tactical problems that we're seeing rather than long-term strategic ones. Long-term strategic ones are probably already crystallized pretty much in all sectors.</p>
          <p>In the retail side, we actually do not see much dangerous things happening. Yes, there's some problems coming through but our capacity to restructure and work them out without negative impact to our own financials is relatively good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And <mark type="inaudible" /> same question but if you look at industry-wise breakup of NPLs, which industries would contribute most to NPLs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's all the same well-known sectors that have been considered kind of weaker performers in &#x2013; or at the macro level. Again, I'll point out that our corporate loan book is almost a direct reflection of the structure of national GDP. We're not particularly overweight or underweight anything. So, which ever sectors you can read in the press and in the macro surveys performing weaker than the others, they'll be almost a mirror image in the structure of our NPLs.</p>
          <p>So yes, the developers in construction; yes, the financials a little bit &#x2013; I mean, non-banking financials; yes, some metals; yes, some retail. Retail supermarket chains have been hit but again, equally, in each of those sectors, some of the companies that are doing much, much better than the others and to them we're happy to continue to grow our exposure. But at the same time, we're much more cautious with the ones that are getting weaker and weaker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you very much and my last question is about the activity of Sberbank, you would expect Sberbank to make an activity in domestic and external bond markets in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In domestic and external bond markets, we are hoping to be more active in helping our clients to access the domestic and external debt markets as arrangers we're looking to build our capacity to do that. We, in terms of our own asset structure, we are continuing to be quite conservative in the way we structure our balance sheet. For us the securities portfolio is either a reflection of our credit appetite to particular names or just keeping the liquid cushion of some yielding assets sticking to the target proportion of having 70%, 75% of loans to assets ratio and hence, moving to more liquid instruments on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>As you can see on page 16 of our presentation, we've got about 10% of securities in our balance sheet, up from 7% at the end of last year, which reflects the fact that we saw the positive trend in the securities market throughout this year and build-up our book accordingly. But then again, not in speculative terms but rather restoring it to the healthy levels in relation to the rest of the balance sheet that we normally have been practicing.</p>
          <p>I'm also quite happy to announce that Mr. Denis Bugrov has joined us on this call, our member of the Executive Board and Senior Vice President who is responsible for strategy and reform and transformation of our bank. We have asked him to take part in our call as we sometimes do, especially to mark this time the fact that the new strategy was released to the public about a year ago, that our new CEO has joined the bank about a couple of years ago and started forming a new management team. So there's probably a little bit of time now to pause for a minute and take some stock and let Denis maybe spend couple of minutes on summarizing the results as we see them and let you have the chance to ask him some questions.</p>

          <p>For us. Not in the nearest future. So far, we've got more than enough liquidity to ensure healthy pace of growth. And, in fact, we feel more potential to increase our funding base in traditional way without having to access the markets and the wholesale funding.</p>
          <p>The main driver is going to be how much credit &#x2013; right profile risk behind the real credit demand from the economy and the population there is. So we feel comfortable that we can fund whatever growth that is out there in the asset side.</p>

    <section name="MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION">
      <speaker id="10">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, everybody. I'll try to be brief and leave time for questions. When we presented our strategy a year ago, we started off with saying that we believe Sberbank has a very strong equity story and that equity story is driven by both the structural characteristics of the Russian financial services market as well as the unique position Sberbank currently holds in the market and our ideas on how we could restructure the bank to take full advantage of the situation.</p>
          <p>Fundamentally, a year on, we still believe that the equity story is very much robust and is intact. Despite the recent financial crisis, we still believe Russia is one of the most interesting markets in the world and very few markets where banks like ours can achieve a net interest margin of the magnitude that we have been able to achieve. We still believe that our market position is unique and is extremely strong. In fact, as you have heard, in the nine months of this year, we have strengthened our market position in key segments, for example, in both retail and corporate lending. And we also believe that the restructuring program that we've put in place is starting to work and is delivering results in a trajectory that we like. What we promised to you guys a year ago, we are broadly delivering in a nutshell.</p>
          <p>We have done quite a number of things in retail banking where we have started with a new lending technology. We have currently moved all of our lending operations, for example, in Moscow and St. Pete to a completely new underwriting platform. This allows us to have much greater control of risk and give out loans and we advertised three days, in reality it's two days time to money. And combined with our great interest rate advantage makes our products quite popular in the market.</p>
          <p>We are rolling this out to the entire network throughout next year. We have invested a considerable amount into channels, we have our national call center now, didn't use to have that before. We have added considerably to our ATM network. We have redone the service model in the branches and by the end of this year we'll have rolled it out to 1,400 new branches. That new service model essentially gives us a factor to increase in sales per employee, a factor to decrease in queuing times and freeze up anywhere between 10% and 20% of resources in the branch, and we have also worked hard on the brand and customer loyalty. You will see something in this direction by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>In risk and back office, we've done what we had essentially promised on consolidation. We've consolidated the back offices in Moscow and Saint Pete. We used to have 13 back offices in Moscow, now we have one; productivity improvements of 50% achieved. Similarly, risk for moving to a consolidated underwriting platform. As I've said, 2010 we will have completed another several &#x2013; we have launched, so we're not fully completed, another 7 of our 18 regional business units and will be well underway with the remaining ones.</p>
          <p>In &#x2013; other areas what we have done, it's very importantly is on the management structure of the bank. We have completely reorganized the headquarters. We have done the design for the New York structure and the regions we are rolling out as we speak, and have essentially assembled the management team both at headquarters and in the regions structured along through a very focused definition of lines of business and functional responsibility areas, and that's worked well.</p>
          <p>And finally, what we've promised to do was to improve productivity and realize efficiency gains. For that, we have our own track to do. Our pre-provision results are very pleasing and our staff optimization program is well underway. We are on track to meet the 10% staff reduction target that we set out for ourselves this year.</p>
          <p>So, as I looked at the materials that we promised to deliver last year, again, I see that we've done most of the things that we had promise to do. So, the management team is happy with the trajectory. There are two things that we are not fully happy with and that's particularly to do with our corporate business and corporate risk. Some of that is our fault, some of that is the crises that's going to be key area of focus of &#x2013; in our activities in 2010.</p>
          <p>Finally, many people have asked me whether we think our strategy has to change in light of the crisis. We have asked ourselves this question many times. We think it's robust and we see no major need for readjustments to our strategy. Obviously, there are different nuances that the crisis has brought on. Primarily, these are around the even greater importance of risk management. But we remain confident that the trajectory set for the bank is the right one, and we therefore reaffirm the long-term objectives that we have for the bank, particularly financial ones as a target cost/income ratio of under 40%, 2013 and ROE of 20-plus percent 2013, and a two-plus fold increase in profitability levels versus 1998.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll pause and I'd be happy to take questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from Elena Maitroplasty from Insight Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you? Good afternoon. My question is about what you mentioned about the slow down in consumer demand for lending, especially on the retail side. It said, first of all, what do you expect for 2010 next year in terms of a specifically retail loan growth, if any? And how would it be reflected in the margins, net interest margins on the retail side? And also if I may, in terms of &#x2013; it's a completely different question, do you expect in 2010 &#x2013; do you expect your total loans to grow faster than your deposits or not? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we had in 2009 is obviously deposits growing much faster than loans and therefore our liquidity position has been improved dramatically. In 2010, we do expect a pick-up in loan growth. Particularly on the retail side, our estimates are that there should not be any significant imbalance between loan and deposit growth next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of your expectation for retail loan growth next year, what is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific range of how many percentage points there are. Again, and as I've mentioned a little bit earlier, there is two strong impact of external factors on that and that's more on the macro side like inflation, exchange rate, because the reason there is reduced demand is much less because of the fact that people are over leveraged. Russian retail public is by any standard heavily under-leveraged and under-penetrated by any type of banking service, including loans. So it's rather more the sense of uncertainty and the way people perceive the prospects of how much they are going to be earning and how much they're going to be affording to spend even on debt. There is no such culture whatsoever in any comparable terms as compared to the West of financing lifestyle through debt. Russians generally tend to feel that any debt that they have are burning their hands and they're repaying them as soon as possible, and especially in the face of uncertainty about the exchange rate and what is going to be happening with the economy.</p>
          <p>So, therefore, it's very difficult to predict those things on the backdrop of uncertainty in people's mind. Also, as we were discussing things in the past couple of minutes, there's been Newswires coming from the owners of BTA about the development situation there. So, we had the questions earlier about this, but there are some news coming out, which says that we may be continuing the discussions with them further from 1st of February, just to anticipate anything on that side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the comprehensive presentation. I have a short question. Most of my other questions have been answered already. Against your entire corporate loan book at the moment, what's the size of your total collateral base and how much of this collateral base are equity space in Russian companies and how much of it is real estate? Can you give us some indication about that? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we generally, throughout all the recent years have been doing virtually no unsecured loans to the corporate sector. And therefore, there's always some type of security in various forms. Meaningful chunk of that is real estate, meaningful chunk of that is shares in the underlying businesses.</p>
          <p>We do track that statistics, but I don't think anyone of our competitors have actually ever been disclosing that, and I don't think I'll be comfortable disclosing that either. I'd probably just point out that the level of disclosure in our loan book is unprecedented for the Russian banking sector environment and is at par, and in many cases even better than most of the banks are happy to disclose in the rest of the world. So, I'm not sure I'm going to be comfortable giving you exact numbers, but what I am relatively comfortable with is that there's always been very conservative approach to the collateral and security coverage levels against the notional of our loans. So, we're feeling quite comfortable about it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was mainly trying to focus on, let's say, changes in the value especially for the equity space in the operating companies, for example. Changes in the value, how do you account for in your financials?

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. I guess I'll ask probably a question for Denis in terms of the retail banking strategy for the Sberbank. I'm interested in your thoughts and your kind of plans for your expansion of credit card lending over the next one to two years. I mean, this has been, I guess, kind of on the agenda for Sberbank for quite a while and I'm wondering if you can give us any really color on that? Do you have any kind of target for the kind of share of credit card loans within your retail loan portfolio or the number of cards you plan to have compared to now?</p>
          <p>I'm also interested in point of sale lending. I think there's been a bit of noise recently that Sberbank was looking at this market, and I'm wondering if you have any plans for this kind of credit scoring, lending or actually through other kind of retail outlets?</p>
          <p>And I guess, finally, just in terms of your ATM kind of upgrade plans, could you give us any details of the kind of scale of the upgrade and the kind of new ATMs that you're planning to install over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I'll try to take those in turns. So, first one was, credit cards, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We planned to end the year with somewhere under half a million credit cards. And that is by no means an indication of the potential because the potential is massively huge. We &#x2013; the reason we are not as aggressive as we could be is essentially technological one, we're working on making sure that our back office works properly with the credit card product.</p>
          <p>And we're also making sure that the credit card product is fully integrated with the new underwriting platform I was referring to earlier. Both of these projects are on track to be completed in 2010 that will allow us to massively boost our efforts in credit participation. I'm hesitant to give you a specific target, but we have something like 32 million or 36 million, I keep forgetting, debit cards. And there's no reason why a significant proportion of those we should have an equivalent number of cards or credit component to them be that revolving credit or an overdraft facility.</p>
          <p>So, that's certainly in our plans. There are some piping that needs to be done to the machine to work properly. And we expect 2010 to be a very good year for credit cards.</p>
          <p>Now, the second question was on POS and scoring, and I wouldn't put the distinction &#x2013; I wouldn't put in sort of a POS equals scoring mindset, we are actually highly advanced in using scoring techniques as part of the underwriting platform that I've referred to. In fact, I believe, we have one of the best in class platforms in the market. But, so that is certainly something we are doing, and that is certainly something that's core to our lending strategy.</p>
          <p>In terms of POS, this is a reasonably small segment of the market. POS accounted for something like 4% of non-mortgage lending, so it is of a reasonably low interest to us. We are, as part of due course reviewing whether we should be doing something in segments of the market, we have so far made no decision to enter into POS.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much. Can I just ask one more question? In terms of your &#x2013; on the cost side, you mentioned that there were redundancy charges in 2009. I'm just wondering, given that you're looking at cutting the workforce by about 10% this year still, that suggests quite strong cuts, I guess, in the fourth quarter. I mean, have these kind of charges would they've been kind of accrued during the year or can we expect that there will be kind of quite a hit in terms of the costs in the fourth quarter from these redundancy charges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in perfectly honest terms, the relative size of those charges as compared to most of the other economies, especially developed economies, in Russia, is relatively low per employee. Therefore, the effect of those charges is accounted for relatively quickly within the next two or three months following the redundancy itself and is not really a big driver of the cost base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And one more very quick question. You mentioned earlier about provisions peaking around 12% to 14% in the first half of next year. And you said, well, you'd like to think it would be maybe closer to 12%. And then, in the second half maybe you could actually see a net-net kind of decrease in provisions as recoveries exceed new provisions being written. So, I mean, is it fair to basically assume that you could well have provisions as a share of loans by the end of next year somewhere below 12%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quite possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from Andrzej Nowaczek from ING. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I've got a couple of questions. A general question on the fee and commission income outlook, are there any new products you're planning to introduce in the coming quarters or at least new fees for the existing products? Any thoughts on the cross-sell ratio, anything to do with the fee and commission income, which hasn't grown that much this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's a lot of rethinking we're applying towards our product line both in retail and corporate. We do sense that there's more potential to release on the new types of fees and commission and the new types of service that we can provide to our clients that can be of demand. And that's more on the corporate finance and more sophisticated banking services to the medium and large segments of our corporate client base. And most of the cross-sell effort is going through on the retail side although on the corporate side, there's also quite good potential in there.</p>
          <p>So, the number of initiatives in the cross-sell marketing and product line improvement in retail is quite significant for 2010. Not all of them technologically, are realizable within 2010, but quite a meaningful number. So we are expecting certain boost to that line already starting from next year. Also, if there's any more questions to Mr. Bugrov, who unfortunately has to leave us quite soon, I ask you to put them forward because otherwise, we may need to let him go within the next five minutes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for this answer. I have another question. I'm afraid it's more of a technical question, so perhaps, you Anton rather than Denis. The guidance, this whole guidance is based on the Russian Accounting Standards, and clearly those have been converging with IFRS but still if it is not too technical, can we go over the main differences, especially with regards to accounting for loan loss provisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're mostly of timing difference &#x2013; in terms of timing of recognition. There are some classification differences but those are becoming less and less significant, there is a Central Bank that's changing the rules of the local accounting and governance differences are virtually non-existent. So it's just timing of recognition. And as you can see, the dynamic of our financial results under both standards in the past few quarters, the difference is narrowing. It increases a little bit through the volatile times, but on the regular terms, it's significantly reduced, especially from last year when the basis of accounting has changed to, from cash-based to accruals.</p>
          <p>Fair value of derivatives has certain differences between Russian and IFRS, but then again derivatives are such an immaterial part of our activity that is not worth talking about this. And I'm hoping there's more synchronization coming from the regulator in the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would you say, we're talking IFRS profits being RAS profits plus/minus 10%, not more than this kind of range?</p>

          <p>Hello. Thank you very much. I have one question on DL program. If I understood you correctly, you are waiting for legal base to be established, hopefully by the end of this year. Could you please guide us on the timeframe for further implementation of this program? When do you expect it to be approved and implemented? And also, maybe you can give us details on what kind of shares will participate in this program? I mean, both ordinary and preferred or only ordinary shares? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't taken any specific decisions, and I think until such time that we firmly see that the new regulation is in place and have had a chance to analyze it properly, it's timely to give any guidance on what kind of the decisions might come out of that analysis. So I guess a bit premature.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hello. I have just a couple of small questions. The first one is more follow-up question about the loan book growth. Could you please provide us with some of your vision about loan book growth in the last quarter this year and also next year, I understand that it is difficult to give us exact numbers but at least in next year, will it be a single-digit growth or double-digit growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may postpone the answer to that question to sometime in January when we're done with the business planning because I'm not going to be looking good if in a couple of weeks' time, we'll reassess this outlook with our modeling guys and macro guys, and I'll be having to come out with some different numbers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and my second question is that could you please summarize the situation with BTA Bank? Could you please repeat what is the timetable of the deal? When should we expect to get some more information about this deal, and when this deal could probably be closed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not ready to comment on that right now because there has been some news coming out on the wires from both sides or rather from BTA side, this morning and this afternoon about the deals that they're having with &#x2013; announced with the creditors and also Mr. Kelimbetov, who is making comments in the press just within the past 10, 15 minutes about his today's meeting with our CEO. I haven't had digested those results, and we haven't &#x2013; I haven't yet agreed what our public comments on that should be. So, we need to wait a few days before we can come out with our public position on that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early to make that decision for us, we are going to come to that closer to the date. With the volatility in the market, I cannot, even if I wanted to make any certain guidance on that, and also from the standpoint of forward-looking statements, I cannot really make such announcements on the calls like this.</p>
