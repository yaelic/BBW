          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Eni 2008 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. My name is Rachael, and I'll be your coordinator for today's conference. For the duration of the call, you will be on listen-only. However, at the end of the call, you will have the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I'm now handing you over to Mr. Scaroni to begin today's conference.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone and thank you for attending our third quarter results conference call, despite the unusually late time. I apologize for the delay. It was caused by the signing of the final Kashagan agreement on which we will be happy to answer your questions at the end of the presentation. We're pleased be reporting a very strong set of numbers today. In a minute, Alessandro will take you through those in detail.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we're currently working on our plan for 2009-2012 and we will update you on our strategy presentation next February. But given the turbulence that we're seeing both in the wider financial markets and the oil market itself, I thought it might be helpful to give you my perspective on how this affects our future plans.</p>
          <p>The first point to make is that Eni's strategy is devised on the basis of a conservative oil price scenario. Indeed, our 2008 to 2011 strategy was built on the assumption that the average oil price would be $64 a barrel in 2008, and would then fall to $57 a barrel in 2009, 56 in 2010, 55 in 2011 and 50 in the long-term. This is the scenario that we used last year in the rigorous assessment process to determine our investment, and actually I'd expect the new scenario to be very close to it. Therefore, the full-year capital expenditure plan that we presented in February is robust in the current market conditions and the upstream acquisitions that we completed to date are cash-generative and solid, below the long-term assumption of $50 a barrel oil price.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we are obviously monitoring our CapEx closely with particular attention to the time-to-market, a risk profile of each project, and I can anticipate that we have the flexibility to respond appropriately to changing market perspectives. Our conservative scenario also governed our thinking on cash priorities and distribution. As we said last February, we are firmly committed to maintain a leading dividend yield, also leveraging on the resilience of our Gas &amp; Power division, which enables us to remain highly cash-generative even at a time of falling oil prices.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to hand over to Alessandro to take you through the numbers, after which together with Claudio we will be happy to take your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Paulo, and welcome to everybody. This is something of a landmark for me as this is my first presentation as Eni's CFO, and I am pleased to start with a strong set of results that provides a solid support in this uncertain time. Going to the results, adjusted net profit in the third quarter amounted to &#x20AC;2.9 billion, an increase of around 53% compared with a year ago. This was largely due to a 46% increase in the adjusted operating profit that totaled &#x20AC;6.2 billion, as a result of the good operating performance and the strong trading environment on the Exploration and Production division, on which I will comment in a minute.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our business segments in the Exploration and Production; hydrocarbon production in the third quarter increased by more than 6% compared to the same period of 2007. This strong performance is the result of the startup, build up, and better performance in Angola, Congo, Egypt, Pakistan and Venezuela, and a contribution from the Burren Energy acquisition, which totaled 24,000 barrels per day. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of the Production Sharing Agreements that accounted for 60,000 barrels per day. Net of this effect, growth would have been of around 10%.</p>
          <p>The PSA impact is based on the new 2008 sensitivity of around 1,500 barrels per day for each U.S. dollar change. The lower sensitivity resulted from the recurring screening of our PSA contracts, which proved to be less sensitive to changes in oil price. Having said that, assuming an average oil price of around $100 per barrel, our full-year production will reach a record level increasing by approximately 3%, one of the highest growth rates in the industry.</p>
          <p>Third quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;5.3 billion, up 60% compared to one year ago, mainly as a consequence of higher realization prices denominated in U.S. dollars, and higher production of oil. These improvements were partially offset by the appreciation of the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar and the higher depletion, depreciation and amortization. In dollar terms, third quarter adjusted operating profit increased by 75% versus the corresponding period of last year.</p>
          <p>As far as the Gas &amp; Power division is concerned, overall gas volumes sold slightly declined in the third quarter of 2008 as a result of lower sales in Italy partially compensated by the growth in International sales. The Gas &amp; Power adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;564 million, down 3% over the same period of 2007.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the third quarter of 2008 amounted to &#x20AC;781 million. This compares to &#x20AC;797 million in the third quarter of 2007. Marketing segment result decreased by 9%. This reduction was primarily due to the lower volume sold as a consequence of the stronger competitive pressure in Italy as well as to lower electricity sales. These negative elements was partially offset by the favorable scenario in terms of both the Euro's appreciation versus the U.S. Dollar, and the trend in energy parameters to which gas purchase cost and selling price are indexed.</p>
          <p>The regulated business generated &#x20AC;228 million, up 6% versus the third quarter of 2007. The increase is due to the improved operating performance and to the recognition in tariff of expenditures incurred for new investments and for the upgrading of the existing transportation network. Finally, international transportation showed a 6% increase versus the third quarter of last year, thanks to the increased transportation capacity.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Refining &amp; Marketing; adjusted operating profit of this division increased by around 56%. The higher refining margins in dollar terms were partially offset by higher maintenance activities and the appreciation of the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar. Marketing segment benefited from the higher volumes sold due to the higher market share in Italy and full contribution from the acquisition in Eastern Europe. Furthermore, marketing margins showed a positive trend.</p>
          <p>As far as the other businesses are concerned, in the third quarter of 2008, the Petrochemical business represented by Polimeri Europa, posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;59 million compared to a &#x20AC;30 million profit in 2007. This loss is due to the negative base chemical margins resulting from the higher feedstock costs.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering &amp; Construction sector, third quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;276 million versus &#x20AC;211 million in 2007. The increase is attributable to higher results across all business lines.</p>
          <p>Turning now to cash flow, this slide compares our sources and uses of cash in the first nine months of 2007 and 2008. Operating cash flow increased to &#x20AC;16 billion, up 20%, and disposals provided a further &#x20AC;500 million. This strong cash generation fully covered the &#x20AC;9.9 billion CapEx and the &#x20AC;5.9 billion of shareholder distributions, which included a payment in September of 2008 interim dividend.</p>
          <p>Net financial debt as of the end of September increased to &#x20AC;17.8 billion, and our net debt to equity ratio declined slightly to 0.27, assuming $100 per barrel for the full-year, on the basis of planned outflows, which means &#x20AC;14.4 billion of technical CapEx. The acquisition of the majority stake of Distrigaz and the total acquisition of First Calgary leverage at the year-end is expected to be lower than that of the end of September.</p>
          <p>With regards to the liquidity position that catalized the attention of investors and analysts in the last weeks, I want to provide you more information. Our short-term debt amounts to &#x20AC;9.3 billion of which &#x20AC;3.1 billion are Euro Commercial Paper. The market for Euro Commercial Paper has always been open for Eni, even in these severe financial market conditions.</p>
          <p>From a strict liquidity perspective, we can rely on more than &#x20AC;7 billion of cash and committed undrawn facilities. The strong cash generation, the high credit rating and the availability of diversified committed bank lines without material adverse change conditions and the financial covenants provide the evidence of our strong financial position and allow our self to cover both short and long-term financial needs.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And now we are ready to answer to your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, gentlemen.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions please. First, Paolo, you mentioned in the last conference call that you were going to be talking to GasNaturale in September about the potential preemption of the Union Fenosa Gas joint venture. I wonder if you could update us on the status of that. Secondly, I think you announced yesterday or the day before that Gazprom had now started back in on the Russian Arctic Gas and Urengoil assets. I wonder if you can tell us what percentage back in they've taken, and what this means for the Gazprom Neft stake you currently hold. And thirdly, on the buyback, you have &#x2013; you are very close to the 10% limit on that. I wonder what you're going to do.  I wonder if you can tell us what you're going to do in terms of canceling shares and getting authorization for a new buyback. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Let me answer these three questions in succession. Now, GasNatural, you are right, we have been in contact with GasNaturale about our Union Fenosa stake there. As you know there is a mechanism which could lead to either buying the 50% or selling our 50%. We received as an answer that GasNaturale prefers to wait until the full process of authorization is finished before starting any discussion. This process will end up at the beginning of next year. We are planning at the beginning of the next year to be in contact with GasNaturale to start a discussion based on new market conditions. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second point, Arctic Gas and Gazprom &#x2013; let me start saying that as far as Gazprom Neft is concerned, we held a meeting yesterday with Gazprom, and they confirmed to us their intention to exercise the call for this 20% in due terms. I think that their option expires on the 9 of April &#x2013; on the 4 of April, on the 4 of April, and within that date, they should be exercising the call.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, yesterday, I saw that Gazprom held its third quarter result presentation and within the presentation they disclosed their CapEx for 2009, and within the number that they presented was included the $4.5 billion which is essentially the price they have to pay including interest less dividend etcetera. So, let's say, they are certainly moving in the direction of exercising the call. There is an obligation, so for me it's difficult to give you what will be the final position, although the sentiment I have is that they want to exercise the call. Now on Arctic Gas, Arctic Gas and Urengoil, the assets, we go under the name of Severenergia, the company we hold together with Enel, and on which Gazprom has a call, yesterday we reached an agreement, it is a kind of complex agreement, so I would not go into all the details.</p>
          <p>But progressively, Gazprom will enter into the capital of the company. So they will end up being our partner in 51%. They will start buying the first 10%, 10% of the total company. So the first 5.1% in the next few weeks. Their entry is not important in financial terms because we're talking about small numbers, but is very important in terms of speeding up the process of making all the required investment to put into production Arctic Gas. Now, on the buyback, you're right, we are very close to reaching the 10%. This is what will we be doing with this 10% will be a decision we will be taking next year. We think the shareholder meeting next year, because as you might remember, in order to cancel those shares, we had to bring it to the shareholder meeting. We have not really been focusing very much on what we will be proposing to our shareholder meeting next year, but we will be more precise in next February at our results presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Just one bit of clarification. So you say Gazprom have got 5.1% at the moment. Do you expect them to go up to the to the full -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you expect them to go up to the to the full -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the 51%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; 51%, what &#x2013; sometime in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a fairly complex agreement. It will take me maybe 10 minutes to explain all the details. But let's say it's a mechanism which is &#x2013; in which Gazprom continue to have the option to grow to the 51% we were &#x2013; which has always been in our plans. There is also some good mechanism in our hands, if the process of licensing that we need to achieve will not be according to our plans. So let's say, for me what is relevant is not exactly the financial side, because as you know here we are talking about fairly small numbers. At the end of the day, when Gazprom will be buying the 51%, their total investment will be in the region of $1 billion. So we're talking about a much smaller number than Gazprom Neft. What is relevant to us is where there is a partner in the whole process of licenses and in the CapEx and take &#x2013; how do you say that &#x2013; off take agreement to have Gazprom with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michele Della Vigna from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Michele Della Vigna here. I wanted to ask two questions. The first one is, you've just, and from what I understand, come back from Kazakhstan, could you now give us a CapEx figure for the first phase of the project? And then my second question is relating to your 2009 CapEx. If the oil price was to fall further from here, what is your flexibility for the 2009 CapEx, and more specifically in terms of the FID of some of your major new projects, what timing have you got in mind now for the third phase of Karachaganak and for Goliath and for the second of Danyeta?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, you're quite right. I came back from Espana, five minutes, well, 10 minutes ago. I think we've finally reached a final agreement, which was on the lines of what we've been signing on the 15 of January 15 in Espana. So no real &#x2013; I mean nothing major change from that. As far as the CapEx for Phase I, the total CapEx for Phase I will be $38 billion. But this number, to make it comparable to the numbers we've been disclosing before, you should deduct the Phase III, which was not included in previous numbers, plus the train &#x2013; the railway station that we are building in Espana in order to export oil. So the two numbers are not exactly comparable. If you were to compare them, we should compare the 19 we presented in the past to 25.</p>
          <p>So the difference between 25 and 38.6 is additional scope of work. On the other hand, the experimental program, of which will continue to hold responsibility, is now projected to give a production capacity up to 450,000 barrels, as compared to the 300,000 barrels which was announced before. That's the first point. Now moving to our CapEx plans for the future. Now we're in the process of &#x2013; as this months are for us our planning months. So we do not really have numbers. I can give you feelings of what we're going to possibly propose to our Board beginning of next year. So generally speaking, the numbers of our plan should be close to the numbers of previous plans. So you should not expect different numbers.</p>
          <p>And second, as far as the flexibility that I mentioned, there are some projects which could be launched and which will be included in our plan, or could be postponed according to market conditions. We want to have some flexibility in order to decide, according to market conditions, which project will be going ahead. Okay. So you should imagine a plan similar to this year plan, but embedded some flexibility. And as far as production is concerned, we're not expecting any change for next year from the targets that we already announced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Dave Thomas from Citigroup. Go ahead, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. I've got a couple of questions, please. Not to do with Kashagan surprisingly enough, but only a couple of your interests perhaps. One on Galp, there has been a comment today from Amorim suggesting that might be interested in buying a nice stake in Galp. Given your comments at the previous conference call, I would like to encourage you to give some comment back on that. And secondly, on Papua New Guinea, you have an interest in Papua New Guinea through a recent accord with the government over exploration. I just wondered whether you have interest in the LNG project in that area also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now let me first comment on Galp. Let me make a general statement first. Every time that we hold a stake in a company which is doing our business, which is really doing our core businesses, our general objective is to own 100% of it. So this is the general idea. We do not want to have stakes here or there. We want to have, in our core businesses, companies which are fully integrated with us, making all the synergies of our business. So this is the general statement.</p>
          <p>Now, within this, we look at Galp. Galp has been a phenomenal business for us. We have been investing, if I'm not wrong, &#x20AC;900 million. We got back more than &#x20AC;0.5 billion of dividends so far, and our stake &#x2013; I have not looked lately at the stock exchange, but might be worth 3 or 4 billion or something like that. So we are very happy with it. The relationship with Mr. Amorim is very good. We are very pleased of how we've been managing this investment in the interest of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Having said that, this is not going to last forever, and we considered that we are ready either to move to the position I described before, that is, to be the majority shareholder, possibly the total shareholder of the company one day. Or we are certainly ready to receive offers for our stake at conditions that we would judge of interest to our shareholders. In any case, there is no negotiation whatsoever of anything with Mr. Amorim.  I don't know why he made this declaration, but I read it exactly as you read it. On Papua New Guinea, I will ask Claudio to tell you something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Paolo.  Good afternoon, talking about Papua New Guinea, what I can say that few weeks ago we sign an agreement for new exploration areas. These exploration areas are fresh new virgin area or exploration area with some wells already drilled. We are looking for gas, for sure, but we are looking also for oil, because there are oil in that province. So this exploration project is not linked to the existing Exxon LNG project. For sure if we find some gas we are ready to participate, but we understood that the joint venture is already setup. So maybe in the future, but it is not the case at the moment to look for a new LNG because we are in an exploration phase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sergio Molisani, UniCredit. Go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen.  A question of strategy, if I may. You often emphasize the value of the integration of the Exploration &amp; Production in Gas and Power divisions. Do you think such synergies will continue to justify keeping both businesses together going forward? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Well, you're right. We always emphasize this unique feature that Eni has got as compared to other oil majors. Now the Gas &amp; Power division is a strong generative business which enables us to have a competitive advantage for integrated gas projects and in the dialogue with oil and gas producing countries. Let me just mention our position in Algeria and Russia as a sign of &#x2013; and Libya as well &#x2013; of this double position we have.</p>
          <p>Now, of course, when you look at the Gas &amp; Power division, there are two components in this business. First, we have the merchant part of the Gas &amp; Power division, which are essentially our wholesale and retail. We are the European leaders in this business, which is strongly cash-generative, despite having limited capital employed and zero CapEx. This is the part where there are greater synergies with E&amp;P, and of course we want to own 100% of this business in order to continue to extract the strategic and economic value.</p>
          <p>Then we have the infrastructure base activities, which are either regulated, and this is the case of Italgas, of Snam Rete Gas and of Starjak, or they are semi-regulated, which are our international pipeline network. And to a lesser degree, we have also in this region EniPower. These assets have of course fewer synergies with E&amp;P, and we do not necessarily need to hold on to 100% of these activities going forward. Okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one is just on the balance sheet and whether you think in the current volatile oil price environment, you think that you have the flexibility and the appetite for further acquisitions, and if so, what kind of size? The second one is just on the clarification of the Galp point. My understanding of the shareholder's agreements for Galp is that both Amorim and Eni can't change their percentage stakes until at least 2010. Is that the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. Correct. Let me answer to that question saying correct. Of course we cannot change it, but we could always make a deal between us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fine. So that your stake wouldn't change for, then, <mark type="inaudible" /> change on that level until 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now let me answer your question.  Now, we've always been looking at potential acquisitions which are very synergic with our activities. Now, in order to find lots of synergies, it is very unlikely that this will happen in large acquisitions. It's much more likely that this happens in small acquisitions such, as an example, First Calgary. First Calgary, it is an acquisition but in fact what we acquired is an asset which is close to our own existing assets. So looking into the future &#x2013; and talking about our appetite, our appetite, if any, we'll always be targeting small targets which one way or the other are synergic with us. It is possible that in the future there will be opportunities such as I described, and we will look at them closely as we've been doing in the past in the interest of our shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But with the volatile share price, oil price environment, you're happy that you're making enough cash flow in various scenarios, you can say down to 40 or $50 next year to give yourself enough flexibility -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we will be fixing a scenario, conservative, a long-term, old-fashioned and conservative as we've been doing so far. We did not get excited when the oil price went up to $150, and we do not get desperate when the oil price goes to $65. We will always use a scenario which is conservative, which is in the long-term what we should expect and look both at our internal CapEx and into acquisitions, keeping in mind that they should pass the test of our scenario. Now, of course when you talk about acquisitions, you should add synergies, which are the most important thing that creates value around an acquisition.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The final question comes from the line of Jon Rigby from UBS. Go ahead, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I have three questions. The first is on Gazprom, again going back to your point raised right at the start. If one was to envisage that the current financial crisis were to continue into the New Year, would you, given your desire to maintain good relationships with Gazprom, envisage some kind of flexibility around the original transaction that has been negotiated, either by extending the option period or perhaps aiding Gazprom via some sort of financing or change in the arrangement in some sort of way.</p>
          <p>The second is just on Kashagan. I think while we were in Kazakhstan, you indicated that you felt that there was something of the order 25% or so of your E&amp;P technical staff on the project right now. Do you envisage some release of those technical staff?  A, because you're getting to the point where the project has basically been agreed by the partners; and B, clearly there is a division of labor now approaching between the partners as the arrangement kicks in. And do you see benefits from that?</p>
          <p>And the third, I'm sorry to come back to this one, on Galp, do you also, or could you envisage an arrangement whereby you could access the type of synergies an upside that you talked about without necessarily holding 100% in that company? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will say something about Gazprom and maybe Galp and I'll leave Claudio to tell you more about our future in terms of HR employment there. Now on Gazprom, let me just tell you how we see.  Now of course Gazprom is a very important relationship for us. And we want to keep very good relationship with them. Now in financial terms, when we look at Gazprom, never forget than we are paying every month a check to Gazprom in the region of &#x20AC;500 million. So let's say there is a flow of cash which goes from our pockets to the pockets of Gazprom every month. So if there were to be discussed a different financial arrangement, this could play a role as well. Am I clear about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First point. Now on Galp, now of course we can make some synergy, and we're already making some synergies with Galp, particularly in the gas division and also in E&amp;P. We have seconded a few people from Eni into Galp and we try to do our best in order to extract synergies. But of course it is very different when a company has its own strategy, its own management, its own objective, by the way I consider Galp a company which is managed properly and correctly. So no criticism at all on that. Let's say since this company is doing gas and we are the leader gas company in Europe, is doing E&amp;P and we are an important player in E&amp;P. He is doing a refine, and we are in refine as well. You understand the long, long term, say 10 years from now, for me it's hard to imagine that we will continue to hold 33.34%. This is a stage in the process. We are in no hurry at all and a colleague of yours correct me to flag the fact that until 2010 we have a standstill agreement. So we are not planning in any case to make any move. But if I look ahead, 10 years from now, certainly I consider the fact of being standing still is fairly unlikely.</p>

          <p>Vishi points out &#x2013; all arrangements are there to be rearranged if both parties agree on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we could rearrange the position in the interest of both shareholders, but we are extracting some synergies, you are quite right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now passing to Kashagan question, about the resources.  You know that we are still responsible, in charge for the experimental project, and that means that most of our people will be there to &#x2013; in the next three years, to get the first productions in 2012, and the rest that are now on the second phase, and I mean is more or less 20, 25, 28%. We will move on other projects. So this kind of synergy and this kind of reduction of our resources still in place, we'll move some of these people with &#x2013; on the second Phase with Total and Shell and Exxon, but for sure we can save some human resources, about the number that Paolo said last time, 20, 25%.</p>
