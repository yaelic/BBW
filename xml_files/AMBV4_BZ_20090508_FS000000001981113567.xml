        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dorothy, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to discuss our 2009 first quarter results. Before I start I just would like to remind you that as usual, the specifics discussed during this call are organic in nature and effective this quarter, AmBev has adopted IFRS as its new reporting basis. <mark type="inaudible" /> I will discuss <mark type="inaudible" /> underlying trends in our business.</p>
          <p>We have also decided to present the key performance line in our statement of operations on a normalized basis. Normalized figures exclude relevant items that are not recurring in nature. The main example in our first quarter results is the gain recognized in connection to protect our licensing after a bad spread year in the US. As some of our figures are non-GAAP measures however, we continue to disclose our consolidated net income, EPS, and EBITDA on a fully reported basis.</p>
          <p>As usual, I will start the call by sharing a brief overview of the quarter, and then, Jo&#xE3;o will provide you with some overview of our results in Brazil, Hila-Ex Quinsa Canada. And I will finish by providing more specifics regarding the first quarter financials.</p>
          <p>Turning to the results, during the first quarter, our consolidated EBITDA reached more than R$3.5 billion, which represents a 16.3% increase, when compared to the first quarter of 2008 and was driven by strong results in our Brazilian beer and Quinsa businesses with Brazil soft drink delivering a good quarter and Canada delivering growth on a very high comparison from first quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>EBITDA17.3% supported by beer volume growth of 7.6%, and CSD and NANC volume growth of 12.6%. Jo&#xE3;o will provide you with more detail of the key drivers in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA margin in Brazil increased to 190 basis points benefited from good volume growth, good performance on pricing, and cost management and low costs from Q1 2008.</p>
          <p>In the US we lost R$39 million, compared to 60 million in first quarter 2008 as our volumes declined 9.7% in this period. Our Quinsa operation delivered strong results in EBITDA growing 22.8%, despite flattish volumes for the region in this period. In Canada, despite first quarter volume decline of 2.7%, EBITDA increased by 3.5% as a result of good top-line performance and restricted cost savings.</p>
          <p>Normalized net income totaled R$1.4 billion in this quarter, which was 13.9% higher than last year. Normalized earnings per share increased by 13.5% in the quarter. I will comment further on net income at the end of this call.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Jo&#xE3;o, as we start to look a little deeper into the results of future operations. Jo&#xE3;o?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nelson and good morning, everyone. Let me start by discussing our performance in Beer Brazil.</p>
          <p>Great volume performance in the first quarter was driven by growth in consumer disposable income and more favorable weather in carnival calendar as well as pricing in line with inflation. Disposable income growth was supported by a 6% minimum wage increase in real terms and full inflation deceleration, which delivered considerable purchasing power growth in real terms for the first time in six quarters.</p>
          <p>According to Nielsen, our market share reached 67.1% in the period, which is seven basis points decline versus first quarter 2008. However, we are pleased that our mark-to-market share was 67.2, which is already 20 basis points higher than March 2008.</p>
          <p>As mentioned in our first quarter conference call, we started to implement our price increases for the summer during the fourth quarter, and as a result, we will have 80 basis points of share through <mark type="inaudible" />. Since then, we have recorded 20 basis points of share which, compared to previous periods of share performance after price increases is roughly that market share of volumes we had.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have observed a more rational behavior in the industry, and some of our peers have started or completely followed our price increase. We remain committed to try to optimize profitability, while also improving our market share and we are pleased with the performance of our 2008 and 2009 innovation, which represent new ways of connecting with our consumers and developing our brand preference while maintaining profitability in the future.</p>
          <p>Our beer net revenues per hectoliter in Brazil grew 2.7%, when compared to last year. But when you exclude revenues from malt and by-products, beer net revenues per hectoliter actually grew 3.5%. This increase reflects our price increase at the end of last year, which partially offset by excise tax increase which became effective January 1.</p>
          <p>Our beer cost of goods sold per hectoliter declined 5.9% in the first quarter, when compared to last year as the benefit from currency rises, our business efficiency projects, higher fixed cost absorption, as well as easy comps from consumption of more expensive imported malt in first quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>Beer SG&amp;A excluding the D&amp;A grew by 5.5% in the period. This increase is the result of higher volumes, general inflation, carryover impact from our increase in direct distribution from last year and investments to support our innovations. It is partly also offset by fixed cost gains in the period. Normalized beer EBITDA finished the quarter 18% higher than in Q1 2008 with EBITDA margin expand 370 basis points, when compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Brazil soft drinks NANC, we have a strong performance in volumes driven by industry growth in market share gains in the period. Our market share reached 18.1% for the quarter, which is 40 basis points higher than last year. We are also pleased with our market share performance as it reached 18.4% in March 2009, which is 120 basis points higher than March 2008. We continue to be very excited and we see plenty of opportunity in CSD business growth from our market share as well as profitability perspective.</p>
          <p>CSD and NANC net revenues per hectoliter grew 2.7% as a result of price in selected markets partly offset by excise tax increase in product and package mix. We will continue to track in line of pricing opportunities. Soft drinks cost of goods sold per hectoliter fell by 0.5% in the quarter in spite the very low comparison from first quarter 2008 as our currency rate gains and lower PET prices offset higher sugar prices.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expenses excluding depreciation and amortization increased by 39.5% in the quarter due to very low comparisons from first quarter 2008, higher volumes and timing of marketing investments to support our brand innovation. CSD delivered good EBITDA results 13.5% higher than last year, with EBITDA margin contraction by 6 basis points to 46.2.</p>
          <p>Turning briefly to HILA-ex, we continue to face challenges in the region with an EBITDA loss of R$38.9 million for the quarter, driven by significant industry decline in the beer industry in some of our key markets.</p>
          <p>Beer volumes declined 25.6% in the period as a result of significant industry decline across the region, while CSD volumes were up 3.2% due to strong performance in Peru and Dominican Republic.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Quinsa and our operations in the south of Latin America, we are very pleased with our EBITDA growth in the quarter in spite of the industry's very low volume rates. In the quarter, both our beer, and soft drinks units were suffering the important contraction in consumption.</p>
          <p>We have been able to deliver an EBITDA growth of 22.8% and a margin expansion of 60 basis points. This growth was based on higher market share, revenue management initiatives, and strong cost and expense. Overall volume growth was 0.4%, with beer volumes increased 0.7, and soft drinks declined 0.1%.</p>
          <p>Net revenues per hectoliter grew organically both in beer, and soft drinks as a result of price increases that were introduced and in line with inflation throughout the region during the last 12 months, as well as focused revenue management due to good performance &#x2013; last year, efficient current spend management, and strong performance from our premium brands from the lengthening in Argentina and Bolivia.</p>
          <p>We recently did some strategic moves to strengthen our position in the region. We took control over the Pepsi franchise in Bolivia and we added the Budweiser brand to our portfolio in Paraguay. I'm very confident that these steps will add value to our business by consolidating our top-line and actually also achieving cost synergies.</p>
          <p>Our COGS and SG&amp;A expenses were negatively affected by increasing labor, transportation, and some raw materials during the year. Nevertheless, we can still search for savings through ZBB, our procurement standard, and all the process that's been implemented has been effective at minimizing the impact.</p>
          <p>We also benefited from currency hedging, affecting the stand in our corporate value devaluations that already affected the region. We have been able to overcome the industry deceleration within the region so far with all of our efforts in keeping our EBITDA growth. We expect that good beer will make that industry contraction strong mainly in Argentina.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our results in Canada. I'm very pleased that our Canadian strategy continues to drive results forward, delivering a 3.5% increase in EBITDA versus last year. This was achieved in spite of estimated 1.5% decline due to industry broadening, and the lack of general economic turmoil across the country.</p>
          <p>As you have seen throughout the last five quarters, the top-line has been a significant bright spot for AmBev. We continue to lead the pricing agenda, boasting a 2.9% increase in domestic net revenue like we did in the first quarter. This growth was fueled by strong price increases implemented late last year and early this year as well as by structured approach to revenue maximization built into our commercial access program.</p>
          <p>In the quarter we grew the combined market share of our focus brands, Bud &#x2013; Bud Light, Stella, Keith's, and Lakeport family by 160 basis points. These brands drove the share gains in the critical &#x2013; in both core and light segments <mark type="inaudible" /> market. However, due to industry decline in the segments and province where we had higher market share, our overall market share declined by 10 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our dream has consistently been to grow EBITDA and market share by focusing on a few and big things. We remain committed to disciplined revenue management, bigger support of our focus brands, and product innovation. As an example, in February, we launched Keith's Premium Light, an expansion of Alexander Keith family of fine beers. It competes in growing light beer category, carrying the inherited tradition of its market brand leader in the domestic premium segment.</p>
          <p>In line with our strong cost management culture, we were able to reduce the fixed cost associated with the COGS. Still this was not enough expect the increase in raw material pricing appreciation we saw in the first quarter of 2009. The commodity pressures resulted in an increase of 11.2% in cost spread to liter.</p>
          <p>Nowhere is our ability to manage our fixed cost better highlighted than in cash SG&amp;A, where we saw a decline of 3.2% versus last year. This <mark type="inaudible" /> ownership culture within our business continue to incorporate new efficiency and better ways of operating. This has allowed us to continue to reduce our fixed costs while impacting the quality without of course, affecting the quality of our products <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with the financial performance of Labatt in this quarter. We have launched an initiative to address our GAAPs and are executing the plan we communicated, which shapes 2009. This is focused investment in our key brands, disciplined revenue management, smart fit programs, and obsessive sales execution which will continue to help our dream of growing bigger in market share.</p>
          <p>We have executed well on that business. First quarter of 2009 was a productive start of what we believe still could be a challenging year. Normalized EBITDA growth of 16.3% was possible, despite volume slowdown across many of our markets other than Brazil, due to our discipline in pricing, focus on <mark type="inaudible" /> and product initiatives.</p>
          <p>Moving back to the overall business, first quarter of 2009 was a start of what could still be a challenging year is probably one of the most difficult ever as far as forecasting goes. We have seen industrial volumes being negatively impacted by current global economic slowdown in some of the markets we operate in, although, Brazil, which represents over 70% of our volumes, has been a more resilient market year-to-date in scientific volume growth year-over-year due to macroeconomic scenario</p>
          <p>Although it is too early to talk about outlook for the rest of 2009, we have to vet ourselves and we will focus on innovation and initiatives. To support our profitability for the rest of the year. As I have stated before I remain more optimistic about the resilience of the beverage industry than about other industries.</p>
          <p>I also believe we have the right teams, brands, plans and resources to support our profitability in 2009 and beyond. I would like to go back to Nelson. Nelson?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jo&#xE3;o. In this final section, I would like to guide you through the main line &#x2013; normalized EBITDA for R$2.26 billion and the net income of R$1.313 million I disclosed on page four of our release.</p>
          <p>Non-recurring items above EBIT added R$217.4 million in this period, mainly due to gains in connection with perpetual licensing of Labatt branded beer for consumption in the US amounts to $R237.2 million</p>
          <p>Our net financial expense with R$325 million, an increase of 17%, when compared to R$277 million in Q1 last year. This includes primarily a result of high interest payments in our debt and higher carrying cost of our hedge instruments. Our effective tax rate weighted 23.9%, compared to 21% last year. The decrease mainly a result of incremental growth, no repeat tax planning, when compared to first quarter 2008, which stands at normal tax rate.</p>
          <p>Our net debt decreased to R$6.4 billion at the end of March, compared to R$7.4 billion at the end of December, due to an increase in our tax position by allowing R$1 billion to the period .  In the electro which materials at R$1.7 billion. R$265 million for 2009. Our operating cash flow generated in the first quarter totaled R$1.6 billion, which is 85% higher than 2008. Operating cash flow generation is considered to be one of our focus areas for 2009.</p>
          <p>As I have mentioned before, regarding the use of cash in 2009, we continue to prioritize paying the maximum amount of paydown on capital possible and despite the latest downward trends in current interest rates. We are likely to retire the debt maturing 2009, keeping current spread levels, while pursuing more effective financing alternatives. We remain committed to maintaining our track record for actively managing our capital structure and returning the remaining expected dividend cash to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>I will now hand it back to Dorothy to open up for questions -</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. [Operator's Instructions]Your first question comes from the line of Robert Ford from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good day, everybody, and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to focus on perhaps one of the tougher areas, right, in Canada. And if you could perhaps you want to comment a little bit more broadly with respect to the outlook for Canada, both you and most of you appear to be losing share. I was curious as where you see that share going, and how you're responding to that?</p>
          <p>And then if you could also comment somewhat on the outlook perhaps &#x2013; what my understanding is we have a tough compare in the first half, and I was wondering to what extent that's expected to ease in the second half of the year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Bob. If I understand correctly, I think I clear &#x2013; the question is all related to Canada. Canada, again I don't look into pricing, and get in Canada's cost of goods sold like for the year. I would say that this first quarter as I said, we're excited with the quarter that despite the volume decline; we were able to deliver EBITDA growth.</p>
          <p>In terms of outlook, in terms of volume &#x2013; first you know we are not disclosing any guidance. And it's actually very difficult to know where industry is going. So, we remain focus in the ability to grow/latter three quarters. I think first what we have been able to show, if you look at the last five quarters, but more specific in the last two quarters, is that order to grow year-against-year, we grew around 3.5, now just this quarter and another are booked through in the last quarter. So quarter important growth which I think leads to at least for the moment, a conclusion that the industry as a whole is behaving more rationally than in the past.</p>
          <p>Certainly, there has been more discount in last two quarters, when compared to the years before. Then maybe people expect or then people have gone through. We don't see any changes to that. But of course, if there are changes we would respond, so. But again, always remembering that our objective there, is to be able to grow EBITDA and share this impact, which you also think it's feasible except for 2009.</p>
          <p>In terms of costs, which of course, will impact this is the prospective for Canada. I would say that this is probably the worst quarter in that we have a very tough comparison against the last year, where specifically in January, we had another a very big quarter cost wise. So, we don't think that the first quarter is a reflection of Q4. I think that there are easier comps and a better situation comes to life, which of course, will also help us to achieve this objective of share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jo&#xE3;o, who do you think is taking share right now in Canada? Is it <mark type="inaudible" /> is it some of the discounters and how do you respond to that without getting sucked into it instead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the &#x2013; yes. Okay, Robert, I think what &#x2013; we are seeing is two things. I mean, first, what we said in the beginning was that we're being affected by the channel &#x2013; by the different regions that where we have higher market share, we lost the &#x2013; the market has actually declined more in those regions. But most of the exploration comes from that. But it was both parts as well as more for losing share, what we see in a very short-term is a higher level of discount from traffic &#x2013; in which traffic beers &#x2013; some of that small share that we saw at the last.</p>
          <p>So, it's a combination, mostly from a market industry decline in the regions where we have higher market share and some of the loss, is specifically taken, both from large the competition or mostly from the credits which are still being slightly higher than they used to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>These are draft beers that are typically priced at a premium for the mainstream, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct. We have been actually trying to develop or testing our premium different price points below what used to be a premium price in domestic beer.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Lore Serra from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I was having trouble hearing you, so, I hope this isn't repetitive. But I was hoping you could expand a bit more on the policies on shareholders distributions, and you mentioned that you made them debt capital repayments in April, but what I'd like to understand is last year, you paid about R$3 billion I think in total dividends, including interest on capital. With the increase you have in the cash flow, which was in price from the first quarters, should we think about that number being stable in '09, or should we think about it possibly going up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Lore. It's Nelson here. Let me take your question about the use of cash. Last year we paid like R$3 billion which includes the interest on capital. And yet what aligned with our position have being managed proactively, our capital structure in '08 was to maximize the returns of the shareholders, right. So, what we see this year, as we've said before, it all starts to recover &#x2013; a positive start to power cash flow generation. And as I said, before, when we make our forecast, and outlook for the balance of the year, we expect something between 4 and R$6 billion of our operational cash flow to be generated. And then, we start to discuss to use of this cash, which &#x2013; we have a couple of options, right? The first one, which also <mark type="inaudible" /> before, is to maximize the payout to the interest on capital.</p>
          <p>So we already have in 2009 in general R$260 million. And we are going to add another 260 late in May <mark type="inaudible" /> their maximum cash flow IOC amount, and for fair financial rate better way to payout for mutual benefits. I think it's important to highlight that the IOC tax benefit, we need to a lot more &#x2013; a little bit of more leverage for our capital structure. So, we connect the dots, we have a little bit more than half of this quarter for the balance of the year.  We would have the remaining and looking at the expense levels that we see today. We are likely to require the remaining warrants, which we see going back in July is the most &#x2013; a decent amount, again, on our <mark type="inaudible" /> for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>So once we see that, of course, we are pursuing more attractive financial alternatives like the PNTS line for our cap exposures. So, that's the <mark type="inaudible" /> and then, as we still remain cautious, with regard to the market conditions for the balance of the year, and this reflects to the near future. We have decided to keep the cash for a while to maintain certain flexibility. <mark type="inaudible" /> will have a better view, first of all, a standard <mark type="inaudible" /> so we're not giving any guidance on specific models, but it could lead for instance, is talking about the 3 million VAT that we have to pay. And then, the remaining excess cash to be distributed, first of all, higher dividend deferred cash flow, and then, the remaining cash <mark type="inaudible" /> like a number that we can solidly <mark type="inaudible" /> for how much we can generate, between 4 to 6 billion, and also, wide range, so that's how cautious we remain regarding the outlook for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. That's very helpful. And just on a related financial note, we've seen a lot of volatility recently in both commodities and in the currency in reais, should we assume that &#x2013; and that continues to hedge sort of on a 12-month forward basis on a consistent basis into 2010 at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've been committed through our thoughts and we really talked a lot about the policy figures that you can find, that's 12 months on a normal delivery that we <mark type="inaudible" /> had. We had certain flexibility this year, let's see, the first two months, our average from months before so we can, of course, by just given the volatility that we see in the market, but on a further report, <mark type="inaudible" /> hedge should have a stable and predictable outlook for our exposure power stations, so that both in terms of <mark type="inaudible" /> that we can hedge, which is aluminum, sugar, barley. So, that's what we do and hedge for the rest of the year, and are already part of 2010, we're lining this 12 months -</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wanted to expand a little bit on the hedging question, Felipe Dutre yesterday on its conference call basically confirmed that the cost of goods per hectoliter for AmBev would be going up in the low single-digits for 2009, so that seems to be in line with what I was thinking. But, again, in 2010, from your previous answer, it seems like you have had to display some hedges at a pretty high cost, and at a pretty high level of reais so far this year, given that we're in the fifth month. But in general, did you wait until the last possible minute to be begin those, or have you done it consistently throughout the year?</p>
          <p>And then just another related question, you mentioned your hedges in Argentina was &#x2013; if you could review what your hedging policy is there, is it &#x2013; if it's different from Brazil? And how long and perhaps at what rate are we hedged in Argentina for the next year, or however long you're hedged? That would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jose, let me take the part of this question, and then, Nelson can also jump in. Starting from the second part of your question, on the hedges, for let's say for example, Latin America South, and what we did last year. What we &#x2013; what implemented in the last couple of years is for customer &#x2013; as last year. We have the current result also of HILA. We have implemented the same policy that with the dollars so let's say two portions to go into Brazil. Therefore, looking at the policy, as Nelson just said it's to &#x2013; you have to compete steep here with fragmented stock markets ahead that's having the plus two or minus two. This group former units, as far as in <mark type="inaudible" /> in Bolivia but when we'll use it, what to use, you will see, is that if you look at the deals were in terms of last year, or the bottom end in Paraguay you'll see that something similar to what happened in Brazil, is still happening to us in this country. So, this currently started <mark type="inaudible" /> 100 in the beginning of '08, and some of them came down to like, 75. So, we actually were able to take very good currencies open quote given that decline on those currencies, and this could actually have the same spike as you find in Brazil in the last quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>We've not disclosed the hedge on a country by country basis, but you can just grasp the currency impact of those three countries for last year, you will definitely have a valley &#x2013; an important valley and that we &#x2013; despite was in a much slower piece than it was in Brazil. So, we have very good benefit &#x2013; very good currency that is in place and we will benefit from that, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> the same thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I understand, <mark type="inaudible" /> mentioned about growth organic, let's say EBIT &#x2013; when you see &#x2013; when you compare with combined minus 12.9 as compared to minus 5.9 has two components, one is that basic count if you want <mark type="inaudible" /> make it little bit higher. But the product that is related to the benefit of the currency of the dollar that will remain "stable" for the year given that we do on a key basis there was nothing like you have mentioned that we actually didn't want to <mark type="inaudible" />, not at all. So you have a straight benefit across the base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also to add on that, I think I understood from question of both and you were trying to confirm it, we're consistent with our policy of being 12 months for our hedges forward and we are. So of course for 2010 I think we know that the average weight for our <mark type="inaudible" /> our dollars goes exposing into 2009 is 188, which given the current rate in the market 215 out of the 210, 2008 that's what we saw, yesterday. So what we have is a &#x2013; general consistent with policy therefore these rates are the rates that we are looking for 2010, and of course, we also see the commodities going down even further.  I mean you see PET going down by 36%, corn going down by 18%. Those are even commodities that are fluctuated and remember <mark type="inaudible" />, so we already have this benefit in 2009. We also funded some mortgages that we are able to hedge. They are going down and therefore we are going to see the benefit for the year 2010. So that will be our net feedbacks of all tax and again consistently level purpose of the hedge points, we will talk about that <mark type="inaudible" /> engineered. So we are looking to out Q2 keep our clocks definitely below clear so that we try to beat here and that's what we have in terms of overview for the months to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to get it straight, you will definitely your calls &#x2013; will still be below inflation for '09 that's kind of in the bag, but are you saying that for 2010 given the decline in the dollar pricing commodities that when it all averages out, you will still be below inflation for 2010? Or you anticipate? Or is it fair to assume a little bit higher somewhere in the 5 to 6% range for the aggregate cost per hectoliter in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's too early <mark type="inaudible" /> said that we have first of all aggregate for what he don't hedge so they are fluctuating so they're first-rated, but I mean we are too early in the year. And actually that we have to hedge some bonds. And we still have one important exposure for 2010 not added, so it's difficult to predict that. And of course, the dollar is negative but as I said and we didn't expect to be <mark type="inaudible" /> dollar but and it's regarded that anywhere expect as it falls in 2010.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good day, everyone. I have a couple of questions. One regarding Canada, what are the synergies, if any, that you have seen between <mark type="inaudible" /> and how should we think about those going forward? And if you could remind us what were your characteristics for the agreement that you have for selling bottle items, Budweiser, I understand those are the number one brands of beer are in Canada and the ones that are growing the most? And the second question has to do with CapEx of AmBev, how should we think about CapEx for the full year '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Alan let me take the first part, of Canada, and then I will pass on to Nelson to talk about the CapEx. Okay, I think about Canada there are two parts to impress. I think the first one, we are seeing a lot of a benefit from this greater relationship with A-B and I would say that for the most part <mark type="inaudible" /> purchasing rights, purchasing services, different things that we can centralize, selection <mark type="inaudible" />. It's starting already helping us in the cost of goods sold part, and they actually have agreed to also help us in the expense part. So those are very good news for our Canada operations.</p>
          <p>In terms of the agreement, really nothing changed. This agreement test it was &#x2013; a agreement for 99 years. I think we are probably in the ninth year. I believe so, we already have nine years going ahead of us. I think that we also mentioned in the past which has not changed. In fact, I wanted not to have the number one beer vendor in the country. And also a fast growing brand, number one with Budweiser- and a fast growing brand with Bud Light.</p>
          <p>The good thing is that they do demand a certain premium to our other mainstream domestic brands, which, even after loyalties we have a very good mark-up, which sometimes is not the case for when we have a royalty, or a licensed brand. So actually we have been happy with the agreement since we started in 2004, and now we are happy that we can benefit from this schedule given the current <mark type="inaudible" /> North American, our presence in the same region. So those are the good news from the relationship.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the <mark type="inaudible" /> royalties are reflected in costs, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it fair to assume &#x2013; I mean it's an excellent DMA management and cash at DMA, but the results were in 2.2 in DMA. I mean about how much do you think it's because of the synergies with Anheuser-Busch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first the reason I <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; when you have a license <mark type="inaudible" /> same or &#x2013; of at least <mark type="inaudible" /> and when you talk about <mark type="inaudible" /> to say was that I think we already, <mark type="inaudible" /> faster to reflect the efficiency and the cost but if you <mark type="inaudible" /> on a spot rate is automatic. So that is already happening as we speak.</p>
          <p>I would say that the decline on the first quarter it is still much more given the sort of length that that I think always amazes that we were able develop last four five years in Canada as well as give an example internally for Brazil, for Latin and South America, that those guys are really doing a good job so I would say the 2% is much more a mindset that has been developed there, then already the benefits from the relationship of scale that we now have with A-B and I think these benefits we will still see it going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you. As well as the CapEx numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so what we saw in the first quarter, our CapEx was R$154 million for America whole versus R$200 million in the first quarter 2008. And that's consistent with what we indicated before that <mark type="inaudible" /> for us. And we are select <mark type="inaudible" /> do so we're making investments that you based on the possible growth for the future but also being very focused on the returns of the investment the approval growth or so. Last year, I don`t know is you remember, in 2008, our total capital was something like R$2 billion and then 2007 it was R$1.6 billion, so our view for <mark type="inaudible" /> forgive me for 2009 &#x2013; that it should be closer to the level of 2007 that's subject to the also see reflecting in the first quarter numbers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>HI. Good morning. I guess first of all could you talk a little bit, and I'm not sure if I've missed something earlier, this year, but on the Canadian side, Quebec specifically, could you talk a little bit about the dynamics there and also the practices of the retail trade and what role that can have, and what role you can have in influencing that from a price fidelity <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes we make sure that that's a little bit <mark type="inaudible" /> in terms of what you said that we are I think we are going through a much more rational moment in Canada than we were in a year ago. I think that way we are showing that on our quantitative basis when you look at our <mark type="inaudible" /> quarter on quarter of last quarter and also in this first quarter this were the best I think we had this we get in Canada.</p>
          <p>So actually, seeking to be able to do this and at the same time <mark type="inaudible" /> given what developed in the last few year also in terms of trade system management we have a good combination of <mark type="inaudible" /> with some beneficial effect also the <mark type="inaudible" /> so that combination leverage through a dealer <mark type="inaudible" /> last year. I think that combination could also lead us to that 40,000 in 2009 of course again I think the crisis at the same time that it helps making both industry in several regions where we operate with the other competitor we just <mark type="inaudible" /> but again given that we &#x2013; or some other way we will respond because we to be able to do both things but actually we are &#x2013; we are actually happy with sort of good traction, especially in the last couple of quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I caught part of that before but that seems to be more of a general comment Canada. I was wondering if you could be a little bit more specific about the issues that you face in Quebec, as it's obviously a different structure of market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't want to discuss the competitive dynamic on a progress-by-progress basis and you'd see a lot new disclosure in terms of agreement with the different customers we still have remain in place <mark type="inaudible" /> but again this is as much the <mark type="inaudible" /> so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then if I can just follow up with a strategic question obviously the situation in the U.S. the capacity system in terms of consolidation I think of the two big bottlers in the US like PepsiCo. If that deal happen we wonder if P&amp;G's operations in Mexico to reduce operations in Mexico might be of interest can you comment a bit on your growth Mexico, either of your softening why then how you can think about that marketing now if it's really different from interest you expressed <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I mean I'm going to make a very general comment, Celso,  in terms of &#x2013; I think we have said in the past that of course give that we think that we understand that market very well and that Mexico is a very important market. Of course there is a market that we would like to operate. So that's the general comment but I don't see to that as a better transaction at this point I change our perception <mark type="inaudible" /> changes in the year, our year by answers in the next two months. We <mark type="inaudible" /> but we don't see in the near term any chance of <mark type="inaudible" /> any intense of what have been in that market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks I just would love to hear your thoughts a bit more on the outlook for the Brazilian beer market through the balance of the year. I know you mentioned in the opening comments that there is no certainty and the year might be tough but you also talked about the resilience of the market for '09. And I wonder if you could talk about what kind of trends you think you might have this year. The rule may be that innovation could play some of the things you have done recently, are interested in your perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes Lore, I think what I said in the opening comments, if you what it is, I mean if you started to forecast &#x2013; industry growth that we saw in first quarter. As we said this is a lot due to the liquidity. We have <mark type="inaudible" /> those are things I think that we cannot control, so I think it's able to offset however the potential decline that could come <mark type="inaudible" /> however the crises could hit Brazil and I think <mark type="inaudible" /> is difficult to avoid through &#x2013; is difficult to forecast, but I can't. Right now it's been the world is changing to really caution this <mark type="inaudible" /> cautiously move towards what &#x2013; Brazil, I think what we're assuming that Brazil has really given us so much exposure to the credit crisis, but I think we are solid and at that point in terms of <mark type="inaudible" />. I think lot of exports in Brazil are also not too high, but also allows the country to be more resilient. And that's the reason why we are actually quite excited about Brazil and deliver.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Question is a follow-up on Brazil. I was just curious if you could be a more specific with respect to channels. I know you had a good quarter based on weather and what not but are you seeing more off trend versus on trend consumption? Is that the case or obviously just the weather on trend kind of consumption trends just go well or doing well? Changing with categories, are you seeing trading down or are some of the higher price points doing well for you? And I guess this is on more general sense, I was curious to find out looking at the growth rate we saw on the first quarter anyone having guidance here but any sense of how sustainable those growth rates could be as we think about the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Again, Brazil and Canada <mark type="inaudible" /> both in terms of liquid and packaging it surely <mark type="inaudible" /> there definitely helping the sort of deliver the Brazilian A-B market has given us so far. So, we are happy with the very early results of our innovation in production, but again it's early in production.</p>
          <p>In terms of trading down, we haven't seen really a great down that could be expected that we actually entering in other market <mark type="inaudible" /> Brazil &#x2013; going forward. In terms of channel, it is true that one thing that is happening &#x2013; that has been happening slightly also before say this world crisis that the old trade channel has been <mark type="inaudible" /> to fewer times then going on a everyday purchase beyond trade or there is more off trade. So, no trading down but definitely a higher growth &#x2013; slightly higher growth in the up-channel than in the old trade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I am not sure if you want to touch upon April but any sense or what you saw in April was too much what you saw in the first quarter in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are not really pressing upon April. I think what we have seen in Brazil more specific than in the other markets but the good sign we have here that &#x2013; so it's basically not fully in the market. Prices are speaking then volumes are resilient. So, no specific on April but I think the combination of pricing <mark type="inaudible" /> is the &#x2013; I think is good news for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And last question. I guess there was maybe a hint out there that there is potential for further tax increases in Brazil. Is there any color you have on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Yes, actually we think there was a lot of high similarly that there was last year. In fact that people talks a lot about the excise or tax increase, divisional rate but the excise increase really happened in January 1 of 2009, so actually <mark type="inaudible" /> that has increased <mark type="inaudible" /> I said volumes are stable or growing actually. Although what we had price increase and tax increase we've been able to abstract the tax increase for the most part so that we are also very satisfied with that. And we feel very compelled to engage in talking to federal government and state governments because that is only something that keeps us awake at night. A further tax increase would impact industry volume and it would impact industry volumes. It would also impact the tax collection. So, that combination is a negative for everybody. So, we don't want that to happen.</p>
          <p>In the last point, I think something that has been also happening for the Brazilian workers. They have done a very good job in terms of bringing back the debtors, income tax payers. Well, they actually are able to grow the tax base, the tax collection not just by increasing the tax but also by brining those guys into the system that have revamped the system that they have been built with even different better one. So, I think that will also help them to increase the tax collection. I'm bringing this new <mark type="inaudible" /> that's also good news I think for us, for the industry and as well as for the government.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I have just one question actually on your volume deterioration. I would like to know if that the results could be sustainable mainly on the <mark type="inaudible" /> side and I saw like the volumes deteriorating but actually the margins are quite high. Can you comment on that sustainability for the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, I think let me now consult market and as we said in the opening comments specifically as <mark type="inaudible" /> our markets that we have seen decline, not already declined in the quarter but our markets definitely worry. When you look as a whole we are able to fully offset that with everything and it was pricing, it was cost with expenses. I think we are going to be able to continue deliver EBITDA growth but I think it would be too much to expect that same sort of growth that we delivered in the first quarter. I mean we delivered growth 20%, EBITDA growth <mark type="inaudible" />. So, again, difficult to forecast what is going forward and say what is recovered. I think the sort of growth can be flat for the remainder or higher but it is our feeling more likely it will be &#x2013; continue to be flat. We'll continue to enforce and strengthen our actions taken in revenue management, cost control and the hedge that help us as we said in expense control.
