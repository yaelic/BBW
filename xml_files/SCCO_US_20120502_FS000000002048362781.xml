        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to Southern Copper's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Participating in today's conference are Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO; and Daniel Muniz, Grupo Mexico's CFO.</p>
          <p>In today's conference call we will begin with an update of our view on the metal markets. We will then talk about Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating costs, financial results, expansion projects and capital spending programs. After that we will open the session for questions.</p>
          <p>Going into our view on the markets, during the first quarter, metal markets continued to be affected by negative macroeconomic events, that affected consumers' expectations being the most important one, the European recession. Europe, as you know, is 28% of the world economy and &#x2013; its debt crisis. Copper, as you know, it's our main product with 77% of total sales in the first quarter of 2012. Even though, we believe copper fundamentals are sound for this year, demand is negatively influenced by the indicated macro outlook.</p>
          <p>At this point, we perceive a different situation between the Asian and the developed markets. In China, several sources point to a growth in demand of approximately 7% to 8% for this year. In the U.S. and Europe, inventories are extremely tight and we see them increasing to more normal levels over the next 12 months, particularly in the U.S. Demand from the emerging economies is also growing at a good pace, somehow offsetting weaker consumption from European and American markets.</p>
          <p>According to our sources total refined copper demand growth is estimated for the year at about 2.5% to 3% for this year, 2012. If we consider global copper demand at about 19.3 million tons, metric tons, this represents approximately 500,000 tons of additional refined copper tons required in 2012.</p>
          <p>On the supply side, production has underperformed badly in 2011 due to labor unrest, power shortages, weather conditions and ore grade decline. We are seeing these events continuing in 2012, maintaining tightness in the corporate market. Currently we estimate supply growth of about 0.5% for 2012 and we also estimate a market deficit of approximately 550,000 tons for the year.</p>
          <p>Focusing on our own operations and our corporate production for this quarter, let me start by mentioning that, we had a remarkable first quarter in 2012. Our mine production increased by 23.1% to 152,900 tons, which compare with 124,000 tons in the first quarter of 2011. This increase was a result of higher production at all of our open pit mines led by Buenavista, which increased production by 70%. Higher ore grades on recoveries at our Toquepala and Cuajone mines increased their combined production by 12%. Finally, higher throughput and ore grade at La Caridad mine improved its production by 3.4%.</p>
          <p>Regarding our molybdenum production, it increased by 8.2% in the first quarter of this year when compared to the same period of 2011, due to higher production at the Toquepala mine, as a result of higher grade and recovery. This was partially offset by lower production at the Cuajone mine.</p>
          <p>Focusing on our financial results, for the first quarter of 2012, sales were $1.8 billion, 13% higher than the $1.6 billion that we had in the first quarter of 2011. This increase was mainly the result of higher copper and byproduct sales volumes, which more than offset the lower prices that we had for copper, molybdenum and zinc in the first quarter of this year. When comparing the first quarter 2012 sales volume with the same period of 2011, copper sales volume increased by 25.5% due to Buenavista pool recovery of production, silver sales in volume increased by 27%, and molybdenum by 7.6%.</p>
          <p>Our total operating cost and expenses have increased $65.6 million when comparing the first quarter of 2012 with the prior quarter that is the fourth quarter of 2011. Higher cost inflation in energy, labor, workers participation and inventory consumption were partially offset by lower third-party's copper costs and other cost variances.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA in the first quarter of this year was $1,057 million, which is a margin of 58.5% of EBITDA to sales; and these figures compares with $965.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of about 10%.</p>
          <p>Regarding cash cost, we have no significant variance regarding cash cost in the first quarter of this year. Southern Copper's operating cash cost including the benefit of by-product trades was $0.522 per pound and this cash cost was slightly lower than the $0.525 per pound that we had in the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product trades was $1.82 per pound in the first quarter compared with $1.64 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2011. The $0.18 per pound increase in operating cost results from the indicated cost inflation already mentioned, partially offset by production increase from our operations.</p>
          <p>Regarding byproducts, we had a total credit of $423.9 million or $1.30 per pound in the first quarter of 2012. These figures compare with a credit of $382.7 million or $1.11 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2011. The higher byproduct credit results from an increase in zinc sales volume of 10% as well as higher prices for molybdenum, about 7% increase on that matter; zinc, another 7%; and silver when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Our net income attributable to SCC shareholders in the first quarter of 2012 was $621 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.73. This figure compares with net income of &#x2013; for the first quarter of 2011 of $478 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.56, a 30% increase. Diluted earnings per share were $0.63 per share for the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Focusing on our expansion and capital projects, as you know our board of directors approved a $1.5 billion capital expenditure program for 2012 that will be mainly used for our projects in Buenavista, Cuajone, Toquepala and maintenance and replacement capital.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Buenavista expansion, we're building a Quebalix facility at this property. This investment consists of a crushing conveyor and a spreading system that improves the SXEW copper production by increasing recovery and reducing the required time to extract copper from mineral. Overall programs it's 95% and this facility is expected to begin operating in the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Through March 31, 2012, we have invested $53 million of the $70 million budget for this investment. Also, the SXEW III plant construction is moving forward at the Buenavista mine and we will be using equipment originally purchased for the Tia Maria project. This will allow us to increase the annual SXEW plant capacity from 88,000 tons to 120,000 tons. Basic engineering was multiplied by the supplier and includes the construction of an additional conveyor line. The detailed engineering work was transferred to Mexico.</p>
          <p>The moving has reached 40% of completion for this project and the new plant should begin operating in the first half of 2014. The total budget currently is $444 million with $16 million expense through March 31 of this year.</p>
          <p>The new Buenavista concentrator with a milling capacity of 100,000 tons per day is also in process with an estimated annual production of 188 tons of copper and 2,600 pounds of molybdenum. Basic engineering is completed. Detailed engineering and equipment acquisition are moving forward as scheduled. The building process for steel structure and earth moving were performed. The project has a total budget of $1.4 billion and it is expected to begin operations by 2015.</p>
          <p>The Angangueo basic &#x2013; project, which is zinc, silver, gold <mark type="ph" /> product (11:32) the company has included in its pipeline has its basic and detailed engineering moving forward as scheduled and we are estimating a total investment of $131 million in this project. Angangueo will have an annual production potential of 36,000 tons of copper concentrates, 4.5 million ounces of silver, 41,000 tons of zinc concentrates and 6,600 tons of lead concentrates. The project is scheduled to begin operations by the second half of 2014.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Toquepala expansion, up to the first quarter of this year we have to spend $202.9 million on this project. These expenditures includes, technological investments to reduce hauling and other cost. Current project completion is scheduled for the second half of 2014. The Toquepala expansion will increase annual production by 100,000 tons of copper and 3,100 tons of molybdenum.</p>
          <p>On the Cuajone expansion, through March of this year, the company has spent $100 million on this project out of the $301 million budgeted. This is scheduled to start operations in the third quarter of 2013 and will add an annual production of 22,000 tons of copper and 700 tons of molybdenum.</p>
          <p>For Tia Maria, we're working on the new environmental impact assessment that is taking into account local community concerns, government new guidance and observations from a United Nations agency, UNOPS, retained by the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines for this purpose. We are confident than this &#x2013; that this initiative will allow us to obtain the approval for this project of 120,000 tons of copper per year. As a result of this process, we have rescheduled the start-up of operations for the first half of 2015. Meanwhile, we have reassigned equipment previously purchased for Tia Maria, for Buenavista, Toquepala and Cuajone mines.</p>
          <p>Another investment that the company it's &#x2013; has finished, it's a joint venture with Buenaventura and others regarding the Tantahuatay mine, which is located in the Cajamarca in the northern part of Peru. Production for this operation started in August of last year and it produces 46,200 ounces of gold and 216,000 ounces of silver in 2011. For 2012, Tantahuatay is expected to have an annual production of 105,000 ounces of gold and 592,000 ounces of silver &#x2013; of silver. We have, as I said, partners in this operation, Minas Buenaventura and others, and our participation is 42% &#x2013; 44.2% of the total.</p>
          <p>Regarding dividends, as you know it is the company policy to review at each board meeting the capital investment plan, cash resources and expected future cash flow generation from operations in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, at the close of the market on April 23 of this year, the board of directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.53 per share of common stock payable on May 24 of this year, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 11, 2012.</p>
          <p>Well, with this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us; and we would like to open up the forum for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. This is actually <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:07). Good morning, Raul, Oscar and Daniel, thanks for the questions. I have two questions. My first question is regarding CapEx, I know you just mentioned a $1.5 billion budget, but just to be clear, since you only invested $177 million in the first quarter, do you still believe you will reach this budget? And what kind of ramp up can you expect in the coming quarters? That's the first question. And the second one, if you could provide a guidance for copper production in 2012 and what we can expect on all grades going forward, should we still see improvement? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me address the second question first, Felipe, and then I'll ask Mr. Oscar Gonzalez to comment on the capital expenditures forecast for the year. On production whereas we have guidance at the beginning of the year of 640,000 tons in total production for 2012, we're still maintaining that guidance. That should also consider a 5% third-party's copper in that number. So, for 2012 we're maintaining our initial guidance of 640,000 tons of copper. And on the CapEx question I'll pass to Mr. Gonzalez to answer it please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are still expecting to spend most of the $1.5 billion, we start slow in the first quarter, but we already asked for some purchasing of equipment in about $300 million for the second quarter, then we expect that we are very &#x2013; we want to be very close to $1.5 million because Buenavista is spending a lot of its $1 billion that they have for this year and <mark type="ph" /> Southern Peru (18:13) only has $387 million and we expect to be very close to that amount in the year of 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Thank you, Oscar and Raul.</p>

          <p>Hello. Good morning, everyone. My first question relates to the hedging strategy. Did you have any changes in the hedges for this year? And also, if you have any expectations for future hedges? This would be my first question. And my second question is related to the Cuajone project. We noted that the setback of the project was delayed by one year. So, I just want to have more color on the main reasons for this delay? And also if you could comment about the process of the environmental license for the Toquepala expansion would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Daniel, would you like to comment on the hedging strategy for the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Raul. Well, as we've mentioned in the past, I mean, the hedging strategy for the company is analyzed every quarter at the board level and analyzing capital needs, cash flows for the project, the market, et cetera, that's how we make decisions, as you know. Our last hedges were just for the first quarter 2012, so currently we have no more hedges in place and at this board meeting the decision was not to take any hedges, at least at this level. Raul, I think, probably the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:58) you can answer the delays in the Peru project? That was the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the first, the question on production. For Cuajone, basically we have two projects that are being developed at the Cuajone operation. One is what we call a variable kind of rate, that it's &#x2013; it's getting to its completion through this year in 2012 and we will have a slight improvement in production resulting from this project. And for next year we have &#x2013; for the &#x2013; by the end of the first quarter of 2013 we have scheduled the startup of the high pressure grinding rolls facility that we are also building in Cuajone. This facility will basically fracture mineral before it gets into the mill of Cuajone. And, by doing that we expect to improve the recovery and possibly the production or the throughput that the Cuajone concentrator can process on a daily basis.</p>
          <p>As a result of these two projects, we're expecting an increase in production of 22,000 tons as has been reported to the market. We have basically rescheduled something that was for the high pressure grinding rolls, scheduled by the end of 2012 to the beginning of 2013. It's not a one year delay. On the Toquepala license, let me ask Mr. Oscar Gonzalez to comment on it, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So in the Cuajone, we are doing the flexibility study with M3, a company, an engineering company from Tucson, Arizona. And it's to go from 85,000 tons that we are milling right now to 120,000 tons. We are expecting to have that results by the middle of this year and then take the decision and go ahead with that expansion, that will be additionally or what Raul mentioned of the 22,000 tons of copper per year and 700 tons of molybdenum for the variable cut-off grade. And about Toquepala, in Toquepala we are waiting from the Minister of Mines to approve the new date for the public...</p>

But that's &#x2013; if that is the case we are going to be ready for start construction because we have 95% of the engineering done, and then the construction will take 18 months in order to be ready for production.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Raul, Daniel and Oscar. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is regarding a third-party concentrate, the sales at this time are near to the company's all-time low, so we should be expecting this to continue? And my second question is about the joint venture you mentioned in Buenavista. Maybe you can give a little more color about that joint venture, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Buenavista, no. We are the sole owners of Buenavista. <mark type="ph" /> Ramon (24:20), I think that you meant, you probably meant Tantahuatay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah, with Minas Buenaventura, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, basically it's a project that we started a few years ago with Buenaventura. As we indicated previously, we have a 44.25% participation on this project. It's a gold/silver mine at this point; however, there is a copper body underneath the silver and gold deposit that we're currently exploring. No specific plans has been developed at this point to tap on the copper portion of the mine. But obviously it's a very interesting resource for the future for the company. And, what we're seeing here is the benefit of this investment. Basically, the cash cost per pound of gold, it's under $500 per ounce, and I mentioned already the estimated production for 2012.</p>
          <p>And your second question was on third-parties concentrate. Well, it's, we do buy and sell concentrate in the market to adjust our metallurgical facilities' capacity to our production capacity.</p>
          <p>So, at certain parts of the year, we may acquire third-parties' copper concentrates and process them. And at certain parts of the year, we may sell concentrate. And it's the driver, it's basically the match between the production capacity of our smelting and refining facilities in Mexico and Peru, and the production from our mines. For this year, we're expecting a much better production from our own operations, and obviously our copper &#x2013; own copper production is much, much lower in cost than the third-parties' copper. At the end of the day you pay market price less discounts for third-parties' copper, while for our own operation it's what it cost to produce it. And we're &#x2013; as you know we're very, very competitive in cost. So, for us, it's much better to use our own material than third parties. But we need to acquire copper from other operations now and then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But giving a little more detail in the concentrate for this year, we are going to buy only 50% of what we buy &#x2013; we bought last year. And we are going to have more production. For that reason we are going to request less amount of concentrate from the third parties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's it. Thanks a lot.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking my questions. Gentlemen, just a couple brief ones; the first concerns, the Angangueo project, you mentioned in the press release and then in your opening remarks I believe 36,000 tons of copper concentrate, 41,000 tons of zinc concentrate. I just want to confirm, do those metals, those numbers refer to the contained metal? Or to concentrate tonnage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It refers to concentrate tonnage because the ore grade of one of the concentrates may vary. The metal content may vary. However, we have an estimate at this point and I could mention it now. For copper, we're expecting about 11,000 tons of copper production contained in this copper concentrate. For zinc, will be 22,000 tons of zinc on a yearly basis. For silver, 4.5 million ounces of silver per year. And, on lead, about 3,500 tons of lead. I also like to point out that production will come first, we will have much more copper production and &#x2013; in the life of this project and later on in time seeing that their mining plants they will have much more zinc production. What will be relatively stable will be the silver production that will halt at about the average dimension.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for that information, Raul. And then if I may, regarding the Quebalix facility, how much additional copper throughput do you see that facility contributing to the Buenavista operations in 2012? And then how much in 2013 with a full year of operations?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Raul, I apologize. I'm referring to the Quebalix facility.</p>
          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; [0BQNJJ-E Raul Jacob]: Ah, well, the Quebalix is up, it's part of the equipment that we use for the SXEW plant and the benefit will be captured by the SXEW plant that we have for both, the current two SXEW plants that we have and the new SXEW plant that we are building in Buenavista, so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, let me rephrase it. Just to the extent it's increasing recovery that you get out of the SXEW process, how much incremental tonnage from that &#x2013; those improved recovery rates?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well for &#x2013; let me say it little bit different. Quebalix, it's a facility that increases the production and improves the recovery. So, these are the two effects and these are tied to the project. So, we will &#x2013; in order to produce a 120,000 tons of refined copper at the new SXEW plant, we need to have several Quebalix. In order to produce in our current SXEW plants, we have to use our Quebalix at full capacity. We don't do the project with and without the Quebalix even though we know that they're very important in terms of the benefit that they provide.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I noticed that your copper, zinc and silver sales volumes all exceeded mine production during the quarter. So, it appears you had a pretty significant inventory drawdown. Should we view this as a positive read through for overall demand and can you comment on your current inventory levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our inventories are basically &#x2013; in our refine operations probably less than a day. And in general terms, what we have had is some copper in progress that was &#x2013; in process, I'm sorry, copper in process that we have at our inventories, in our production lines at the end of the fourth quarter. It has been finished process and sold through 2000 &#x2013; through the first quarter of this year. Our inventories <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:42) we had in process about 12 million pounds that were &#x2013; went out to the market in the first quarter and in Mexico about 9 million pounds. Basically our copper in process was reduced by that match through the first quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question and congratulations for the strong results. My first question refers to operating cash cost which increased in Q1. Could you please provide a forecast of your cash cost in the remaining part of the year? And the second question refers to corporate price, even production <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:42) copper worldwide. Do you expect higher copper price in the second semester of the year? Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the cash cost, basically, we're expecting it to be at about this level. And here we have the big question mark related to how are we &#x2013; what is going to happen with the energy market. Basically, our main cost, as you know, it is power and fuel. Fuel is about 12% of our total cost and power about another 24%. So, depending on the cost of these two main inputs to our production cost, that will affect our cash cost. In terms of our currency appreciation, we're seeing some currency appreciation, particularly in our Peruvian operations. In Mexico, it's still depending on how Mexico is going out of the economic slowdown that has affected the U.S. And the second question was on copper price?</p>

          <p>Basically, we have a positive view for the rest of 2012. At this point, our price &#x2013; internal price forecast is in line with the market. Obviously, we believe that the fundamentals of this market are very positive and we think that Southern having a very low cost &#x2013; cash cost, probably lowest among the similar-sized companies, will take significant advantage of the current price environment.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Thank you for taking another question. My question is, regarding by-product production, are you guys expecting to keep these levels for the rest of the year? And also to ask you, if you could please repeat something regarding your hedging strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding by-product production, we are expecting to maintain it as it is now. We gave guidance on the production forecast at the beginning of the year. Our main by-product, which is molybdenum, is expected to be at about 17,500 tons for the year. We expect to improve it a little bit, but at this point, it would be &#x2013; we can't be sure about that. So, on zinc, basically we're seeing the results of having our Santa Eulalia operation back; not on track, it's still on the process of recovering to full capacity. This facility was affected by a flood in the last couple of years and we're solving the flooding problems through this year.</p>
          <p>And on the other &#x2013; the other point was regarding hedging, we already explained the company position on that. Basically, we evaluate the market circumstances on an opportunistic basis, we take action on hedging. At this point, we have no hedges at all.</p>

          <p>Hi, Raul. Thanks for taking my question. We saw a sharp jump in dividends for this quarter, after a sharp drop in the last quarter, which was attributed to a more prudent stance in light of the upcoming CapEx schedule. Since the CapEx which has not changed, how should we think about dividends going forward? And do you think the higher dividends this quarter could be maintained in the upcoming quarters? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much for your question, Mandeep. And I'm sorry to say that we can't comment on what the Board will think about when they discuss our cash position and their view on the market later on through the year. As I mentioned before, our &#x2013; the way that the dividend is set in the company is not tied to a payout ratio or a fixed amount of dividend per share &#x2013; per quarter, it's a &#x2013; it's something that is discussed on the date of the outlook for the market, the company cash position, the amount of capital that is required by our projects. So, that's how the dividend we set. Now having said that, as you know, the company has been very keen on rewarding their shareholders through dividends, so basically, the track record is something that it's a reference of what the board may do in the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We're still maintaining the guidance of start-up operations for the first half of 2015. That's certainly has a condition that we'll receive the approval of the environmental assessment board. We already have started working on a new environmental impact assessment study after we discuss our options with the Peruvian government. The government has also gave us &#x2013; well, you do know that we have a new government in Peru that took office in last July. And they have passed on some new guidance regarding certain conditions we should consider for our study and we want to address these conditions. The questions made by the local communities regarding the projects, the project, and the observations or the points made by the consultant that the Ministry of Energy and Mines approve higher from a U.N. agency last year. So, all of this is being considered for &#x2013; as part of a new environmental impact assessment.</p>

          <p>Hi there. I just have one little question. It's on your capital statement. I just want to know, where the positive $294 million is coming from in investing activity, this is sale of short-term investment?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sorry. Sure. It's just on your capital statement, your investing activities in the line of sale of short-term investments. You have this quarter a positive $294 million. Just want to know where it's coming from exactly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Now our cash flow &#x2013; let me see if I copy you well. You're saying that on the cash flow we have from investing activities of the sales of short-term investments that amounts for a net of $294.7 million. Is that your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Indeed, yeah. I just want to know where that comes from.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Basically, it's a change in the cash position. We 're following U.S. GAAP accounting principles, we have to book as short-term investments, investments are usually longer than a three-month maturity. So, in this case, some of our investments went from a longer than three-months period, to less than three-months, and that's why we have to book them as short-term investments, coming back to our cash position. Now, for a more proper view in these, basically what we have in our balance sheet as cash plus short-term investments are basically the cash position of the company.</p>
