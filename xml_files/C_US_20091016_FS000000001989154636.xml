          <p>Hello.  And welcome to Citi's Fixed Income Investor Review with Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach, and Treasurer, Eric Aboaf. Today's call will be hosted by Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Also, as a reminder this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>
          <p>Ms. Fiszel Bieler, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today our CFO John Gerspach will speak first, then Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, will take you through the investor presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we get started I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Citi's financial results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our SEC filings for a description of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ from expectations.</p>
          <p>With that said, let me turn it over to John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to be hosting our fixed income investor review this quarter. This is our eighth year hosting calls specifically for fixed income investors.</p>
          <p>We have important accomplishments to discuss with you today. Our capital position is one of the strongest in the industry. Our structural liquidity is significantly improved and in fact robust. And you will see that as a result of our disciplined balance sheet management and strong liquidity profile we are largely pre-funded heading into next year. Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, is going to take you through the improvements in our capital position and liquidity profile. And then walk you through our funding plans.</p>
          <p>Many of you may have joined us yesterday on our earnings call. And there are some key points from that call that I would like to re-emphasize to start us off here on slide one. Combined with the capital strength and improved liquidity profile that I just mentioned is our continued improving financial performance. Despite the challenging environment facing many of our businesses, in the third quarter we produced adjusted managed revenues of nearly 22 billion and a profit of 101 million, our third consecutive quarter of profitability.</p>
          <p>Clearly, credit remains the number one issue affecting our near term profits. And I would just note here that while the outlook for U.S. consumer credit remains mixed, largely reflecting uncertainty about the economy, unemployment and the U.S. housing market, we do see signs that the credit outlook in our international consumer businesses is improving.</p>
          <p>As we said yesterday, our results this quarter also demonstrate that our client facing businesses are performing well, reflecting the strength and resiliency of the Citi global franchise. For example, year-to-date revenues in our Institutional Clients Group are a record, as is our net income in Global Transaction Services as clients in both businesses remain actively engaged with us. The same is also true with our retail clients, as our regional consumer banking businesses continue to increase revenues and deposits. Eric will go into more detail with you about our deposits.</p>
          <p>We also continue to successfully execute another key part of our strategy, shrinking our non-core businesses and assets in Citi Holdings.  In the third quarter, Citi Holdings assets declined $32 billion to 617 billion. And they are now down almost a third from their peak level.  I think yesterday's results reflect that the steps we've taken over the past 18 months have laid a solid foundation for the future of Citi. We have unquestioned financial strength and liquidity and we have one of the most global and resilient franchises in financial services.</p>
          <p>Now let me ask Eric to discuss with you our current management strategy in more detail and to take you through how that strategy has positioned us to achieve important shifts in our structural liquidity, a strong funding position and significant capital strength. Then he and I will be happy to answer your questions. Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Let me start off on slide two and remind you of our management strategy which Vikram and John have previously described. Our strategy really focuses on Citi's historic strengths in global banking and is well-positioned against our growing segments in financial services around the world.  We're executing this strategy while shifting away from businesses that are too asset intensive or that have been too reliant on wholesale funding.</p>
          <p>To execute this vision, we've focused our Citi Holdings management team on winding down and shedding businesses that were more product driven than client driven. This includes managing good businesses that we don't see as core or strategy at this time as well as de-risking the balance sheet. At the same time, this allows the majority of our team to focus on the attractive businesses that we have in Citicorp. These businesses are global in their footprint, they're well diversified across consumer, institutional and the transaction services revenue pools in financial services.</p>
          <p>I think it's important at this point to remind everyone that there is not a legal separation between Citicorp and Citi Holdings businesses. So our debt will continue to be supported by all of our businesses. As we have said before, we have no intent to legally separate them.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide three, you can see the results of our management strategy, which continues to deliver strong revenues and declining expense trends. Together, these will create earnings power as we work our way through the current credit cycle. On a managed revenue basis, excluding the gains on Smith Barney, the gain on the exchange offers and the impact of net revenue marks, Citigroup generated $21.7 billion of revenue in the quarter, down 8% from last year, and roughly flat sequentially. Note that this quarter's revenues did not include revenues from Smith Barney, which were two billion and one billion in the prior year and prior quarter respectively.</p>
          <p>The trend in our expenses, which were 11.8 billion this quarter, is down 16% from last year, and down 1% from the second quarter. This is the result of the divestitures of businesses like Smith Barney, the resizing of our holdings businesses and the re-engineering of our Citicorp processes. More detail is available for each of those businesses in yesterday's earnings presentation.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide four, as John mentioned earlier, credit remains the number one issue affecting our near term profits. While the outlook for U.S. consumer credit remains mixed we do see signs that the credit outlook in our international consumer business is improving. This quarter, our net credit losses totaled approximately $8 billion, up from 4.9 billion in the third quarter of last year, but actually down slightly from eight billion last quarter.</p>
          <p>You can also see on the chart on the right side of the page that our total loan loss reserves are $36.4 billion. Our loan loss reserves as a percentage of total loans outstanding is increasing and are at approximately 5.9% of loans this quarter, up from approximately 5.6% last quarter. We are appropriately reserved as a company.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to some important balance sheet indicators on slide five. On the left side of the page, within Citi Holdings, assets have declined 20% year-over-year, or $158 billion, to $617 billion in total. The quarter-on-quarter reduction was $32 billion, and is driven primarily by pay downs and dispositions as we de-risk the balance sheet. In particular, the focus has been on reducing illiquid loans and hard to fund assets as way to improve our net liquidity, something which I'll describe in a few slides in a moment.</p>
          <p>On the right side of the page, you see that as a result of our asset reductions we continued to reduce most of our key exposures significantly in these businesses, something which we have tracked over the last two years for you.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to capital and liquidity which are the real measuring sticks of a financial institution. Let me start with capital on page six. As many of you remember, we were one of the first banking companies to raise capital early in the credit cycle, both from private and public sources. We raised $48 billion in the capital markets during 2007 and 2008, and $45 billion in government support via TARP over the last year.</p>
          <p>As the market disruptions continued, the market clearly demanded a higher mix of common equity in our capital structure. Along these lines we initiated and successfully completed our exchange offer. As a result, we increased our Tier 1 common and our tangible common equity, by approximately $63 billion each. We now have substantial amounts of capital across each of the major measuring sticks: $126 billion of Tier 1 capital, $90 billion of Tier 1 common and 102 billion of tangible common equity.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, as John mentioned earlier, you can see that our strong capital ratios make us one of the most well capitalized banks in the world. We've maintained a strong Tier 1 ratio for four consecutive quarters, and importantly, as I just mentioned, took significant steps to increase our Tier 1 common capital and tangible common equity ratios.  With these strong ratios, we are very well-positioned to both weather the economic uncertainties while at the same time take advantage of the growth opportunities around the world. We have the balance sheet strength at this point and the flexibility to do just that.</p>
          <p>Since late in the fourth quarter last year, our ratings have been consistent and stable.  And our current ratings are A3 from Moody's A from S&amp;P and A+ from Fitch. We are in ongoing discussions with the ratings agencies to provide them with continuous information such as this on our capital strength.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to slide eight. A liquid balance sheet is just as important as a well capitalized once and we have been actively building our structural liquidity in two important ways. First, we have a diversified and stable deposit base that increased in both our Consumer and Transaction Services businesses globally. Company-wide deposits increased $53 billion year-over-year or 7% to 833 billion at the end of the quarter, which directly increased our liquidity.  In fact, if you take into account the swings in foreign exchange, we sequentially increased our deposits in each of the last five quarters as a company.</p>
          <p>Second, if you look to your right, total assets have declined 8% year-over-year and most importantly loans, which are one of our most illiquid assets, are down $107 billion or approximately 15%.  This gives us a real tailwind of liquidity each quarter and we expect this trend to continue in the coming year.</p>
          <p>Clearly, raising deposits and reducing loans offset by any reductions in short-term liabilities results in higher levels of cash on our balance sheet and you see just that at the top right.  As John has said, this results in a deliberately liquid and flexible balance sheet here at the company.</p>
          <p>Going to slide nine, you see that we have improved our structural liquidity in both dollar and percentage terms.  Based on the traditional measure of structural liquidity which is equity plus long term debt plus deposits, all as a percentage of total assets, we've increased from 63% a year ago to 72% today.  This result is clearly driven by improvements across each of the drivers.  Shareholders equity and deposits have increased as we've discussed earlier.  Long-term debt balances, which drifted down through the first quarter of 2009, have since increased as we have issued both TLGP and non-TLGP debt.</p>
          <p>Looking at Slide 10, an important part of building our structural liquidity this year has been to issue non-TLGP debt.  We have issued $22 billion, most of which has been issued in just the last five months.  We've issued across the curve 5s, 10s, 30s.  We've issued in multiple currencies with a strong international mix as we've done in the past and we've issued with a weighted average maturity of over 10 years.  I do want to thank you for the strong sponsorship that you've all provided.</p>
          <p>Moving over to page 11, you will notice a significant shift in our funding plans relative to both our 2008 and 2009 issuance levels.  This year we've reduced assets, we continue to increase deposits, and issued $76 billion of long term debt.  We are now largely pre-funded going into next year and we are looking opportunistically at issuing debt in 2010 while preserving key investor relationships.  As we continue to increase deposits across the company and reduce the loans and holdings, we have less of a need to reissue our maturing debt on a dollar for dollar basis.</p>
          <p>Our current expectation is that we will probably issue less than $15 billion of long term debt next year.  This amount is less than our non-TLGP issuances over just the last five months.  Along the same lines we have reduced Commercial Paper outstanding from 29 billion at the end of 2008 to 10 billion currently.  CP will continue to be an important funding source for us next year at about the $10 billion level.</p>
          <p>Moving to our last slide, the key takeaways from today are really threefold.  First, our capital base is one of the strongest in the industry and this is reflected across every one of our significant capital ratios.  Second, we have significantly improved our structural liquidity by increasing our deposits and reducing loans and assets.  We deliberately liquid with a flexible balance sheet.  Third, we will require a lower proportion of wholesale funding going forward.  We are largely prefunded and currently expect to have modest reissuance needs going into next year.</p>
          <p>That concludes our fixed income review.  John and I would be happy to take questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from Samuel Crawford [Stone Harbor Investments].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Thank you.  Let me go back to some of the discussion from yesterday's earnings call if I may, please.  The confusion that there is and the uncertainty there is around the HAMP [Home Affordable Modification Program] program and the modifications in your various business lines, I wonder if we can sort of cut to the chase now and just get an aggregate measure or point us in the direction where we might compose an aggregate measure for all loans that have been re-aged, restructured and modified?  Where do we find that time series, that number either in call data or in your financial statements?  Is it fully included in troubled debt restructuring or is it elsewhere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Stan (sic) [Sam], it's John.  I'm trying to think about the best way to point you to where it is.  In the call reports, we do report in the call reports the total amount of debt that is on our balance sheet, currently on our balance sheet that has been restructured.  So that is certainly an item that is in the call reports.  That would include of course all restructurings.</p>
          <p>You also mentioned the HAMP program.  One of the issues with the HAMP program right now is that actually everything is in trial.  So I want to be a little careful here because dates move around a little bit but since we're in that fifth month of the HAMP trials and since the earliest trial modifications take five months of trial period, we have had very few HAMP modifications at this point in time.</p>
          <p>That's one of the reasons why &#x2013; I think I was asked on yesterday's call, you know, how &#x2013; what would be the timeframe that people would actually have to look to in order to see, you know, the success or get a report card on the HAMP program and I believe what I indicated yesterday is that it would likely be the first quarter of next year before any of us got a clear view as to the success rate of the HAMP program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  No, in fact you all made those points pretty clearly yesterday.  Let me just for my own sake clarify.  With the 30,000 modified accounts that was made reference to yesterday, are those all in the HAMP program or am I mixing apples and oranges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm trying to remember the 30,000, to be honest with you, Stanley (sic) [Samuel], and I just don't have that number in front of me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was &#x2013; the reference was accounts modified or accounts addressed &#x2013; accounts changed, I believe the word was or accounts acted on was the phrase that was used during the course of 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that was specifically during our discussion of the North America mortgage business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right?  So that included &#x2013; I believe that what we gave you is that we took line actions on &#x2013; the 30,000 was with regard to second mortgages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay. So that was clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you.  If you'll permit me one last question, different subject.  Looking back a little bit over the course of the last year, last 16 months, you all have been through a fairly remarkable, almost, not quite unprecedented liquidity test.  What did you learn about deposit duration and confidence sensitivity specifically as regards your deposit base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We learned several things when we look back over the last year and a half.  I think first we learned that our deposits are really well diversified across countries, geographies, and business lines.  And that, that diversification has served us quite well.  If you go through the last five quarters, if you go through the last 10 quarters of our deposit trends, they've been remarkably stable given the enormous dislocations we've seen in the markets.  Beyond that, we've also learned that there is a real appreciation for the Citigroup franchise and the Citigroup brand and its strength and when we engage with customers, whether it's corporate clients in our Transaction Services businesses or retail clients, there was real confidence in us and that was born out by that same stability I've mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you didn't actually see any portion of the deposit base show itself to be more sensitive than expected or more price elastic under stress than expected?  In fact, it outperformed across the board?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do want to say it did outperform, it outperformed all of our stress tests that we run, our modest stress tests, our severe stress tests, and at the same time, as you well know, we have a mix of deposits.  We have deposits that are five years in duration, we have deposits of two years, one year and overnight.  Obviously each of those perform a little bit differently through stresses, but in aggregate, we had quite consistent and quite robust results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  I'll pass it to the next caller.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your next question comes from Kelly Garrisy-Nelson with Dow Jones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentlemen.  How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Kelly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I have a quick question about TARP funds &#x2013; I'm sorry, TLGP funds.  I'm wondering since that program is set to expire on October 31 and Citi isn't a large issuer of that debt, if you're considering other ways to issue debt at such a low rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly we have a number of ways we issue debt and we access the markets today, right?  If you take them from across the board we have deposits, which has traditionally been our lowest cost funding source and we continue to have very successful growth in deposits.  Beyond that, we access the debt markets through our ABS issuances, credit cards, auto and so forth and those continue to be very attractive funding sources by virtue of the pricing in those markets.  Clearly those are attractive.  And then finally, we have very successfully issued in the long term debt unsecured markets, we'll continue to do that but clearly in a more modest way and that'll actually be cost effective for us as a result.  That mix, that mix of funding sources that we have will really be a good mix for us in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And I'm assuming that that number, the 15 billion that you said earlier, doesn't include those sources of funding, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me?  You said it doesn't include...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The 15 billion that you said you had planned to issue via the debt markets, that doesn't include the other avenues you just mentioned such as ABS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.  The ABS issuances are separate from that.  This is really just the top of the house, unsecured debt that we issue regularly now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And my second question if I may, is just on CDS levels.  You talked about a strong capital ratio and I'm wondering just in comparison and contrasting, Citi is currently trading at a 213 mid on a five year and for comparison purposes, Bank of America is at 125.  Can you talk a little bit about why you think the level is so different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I think there are always different views in the marketplace.  Those different views have changed.  If you go back over the last three months, six months, nine months 12 months, they've widened, they've narrowed.  I think that's within the band of the views today.  And clearly we expect as our performance continues to improve that those will narrow over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

          <p>I'm sorry. I hope this is better.  One of your peer banks has mentioned the fact that they think that regulators will require deposits in their various countries to be ring-fenced so they couldn't transfer deposits intra-group.  Are you seeing the same pressures so that certain countries like Mexico, or say South Korea it prevented you from transferring deposits intra-group?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If the question is about the international regulatory community, clearly we've worked actively with all regulators around the world as you'd expect us to.  We've worked through the Fed, the OCC, the FDIC and others here in the U.S.  They've worked with regulators around the world.  I don't think we have gotten any undue pressure in any particular way.  In particular around deposits, there's clearly appreciation for our franchise that we have in each of those countries.  Those regulators are appreciative of the economic benefits of those franchises that we have as well as the value that their own folks put into our brand.  And so it's been nicely, you know, stable in many ways.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Can you give an update on how much more in the ring-fence assets you would need to lose before you actually start to get some benefit from the insurance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Tom, that's kind of an interesting way of phrasing the question as far as getting benefit from the insurance because getting benefit from the insurance means we would have had to have lost $39.5 billion.  Our goal is not to lose $39.5 billion out of those ring-fenced assets.  However, to directly answer your question, through the end of the third quarter on a GAAP basis the losses against the ring-fenced assets amounted to about $7.8 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And, you know, separate question just on the funding side you guys did a lot of long term unguaranteed funding at fairly wide spreads, and that obviously had a pretty big impact on your margin in the quarter it seems like.  I mean, why, you know, now you have much less funding to do next year, but why would you have issued so much at the wider spreads to prefund so that you only have 15 billion to do in the next 12 months if you think your credit's actually improving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question, Tom.  If you think about our balance sheet we have a &#x2013; earlier in the year we had a high level of loans.  We talked about the reduction that we've made in loans and assets, right?  What we've done is actually funded up to a level that supports those higher level of loans that we had earlier in the quarter and earlier in the year and that was appropriate for the time.  What's happening now is because of the efforts we've made in the Citi Holdings businesses we've actually been reducing those loans and assets.  And as a result, we have less of a need to reissue the maturing debt as it comes due.  So it's really around having properly funded ourselves earlier in the year and now taking advantage of the tailwind of those declining loans, which require less long-term debt against the balance sheet over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Tom, it was less of a &#x2013; you know, we weren't focused on trying to time the market.  We thought that it was appropriate and prudent to do the funding in the time when we could access the market and the market was there, and, you know, maybe we paid a little bit of a price for the certainty, but as a result of that, we've got a lot of flexibility now going into the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  Thank you.  Could you comment a little bit on your 30-day delinquency rate on your U.S. credit card portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>30-day delinquency rate on the credit card portfolio, I think what we said yesterday is that in the retail partner cards business, our 30-day delinquencies are stabilizing.  I'm not going to give you the exact rate because we don't disclose that precise rate.  And in the branded cards business, it was slightly elevated but that was one of the reasons why we were putting more focus on working with those customers in the branded cards.  If you recall what we saw on branded cards was a decline in the 90-day delinquency rate even though our net credit losses were growing in that business.  But we're really focused more on the early bucket delinquency statistics now in branded cards.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  I got onto this call a little late but did you go over, like, specific funding strategies for the wholesale capital markets business?  You know, is it still going be within the generic funding capability?  Or is there going be more specific funding going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  The funding strategy is largely a reflection of our success over the last months and quarters of this year and actually quite similar to what we've done in the last couple years.  It's really about funding across a mix of tenors.  You've seen us go out in 10s and 5s and 30s.  You'll see us across currencies.  We've consistently done that over the years.  We did dollars, euros, Sterling.  You'll see us continue the broader breadth of currencies that we've done before and you'll see us do it at a nice mix of maturities so that we get the weighted average maturity that is appropriate for our lending book.  So it's really in terms of strategy, I think pretty consistent to what we've done in the past and we've found a lot of appreciation for that in the market and you expect that to continue.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Follow-up question.  I don't know if you talked about this as well, but between the composition of senior debt, subordinated debt and then preferred hybrids, are we going to see a bigger change towards senior subordinated versus hybrids going forward?  Can you just talk about possible supply in each generic bucket giving your shrinking balance sheet, weighing &#x2013; you're getting out of I guess the consumer finance business.  You don't need as much senior debt anymore.  So can you just talk about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, most of our debt issuances have been in the senior category. I think that'll continue.  I think what we're talking about here is not large changes of mix but primarily just moderating the historic levels that we've been at.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.  I have a quick question about the dollar and the way it fluctuated in the last, you know, recently.  What impact does this have on Citigroup?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Yes, sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  The dollar exchange rate movements as are most of the major exchange rates around the world are something we clearly monitor and anticipate.  We have fairly robust and long standing programs around EBIT hedging that have served us well.  We have programs around hedging our capital base and obviously have programs in place to monitor through our risk organization any fluctuations in those rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In addition to the hedges, does your liquidity strategy change with the dollar exchange rate?  In other words, are you being more aggressive in raising deposits in one country versus the other when you see exchange rate changes?  Or am I thinking about this too simplistic or the wrong way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The liquidity strategy by nature needs to be stable, right?  Because it counts on a stable base of customers around the world.  Those customers expect consistent and fair pricing as an example.  And so the liquidity framework and requirements are fairly stable actually relative to any changes in foreign exchange movements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Think about it this way: what we are doing is we're building a customer franchise and therefore, we have to be consistent in our approach and not just redirect our business based upon momentary changes in foreign exchange rates, Matthias.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for giving me a second shot.  The question actually is very simple, which is between the cancellation of excess lines that are unused and the destruction of credit through sort of the writing off of bad debt, in the past quarter was Citigroup a net lender to U.S. households?  Did you increase or just hold credit steady or actually reduce credit availability to U.S. households?  How does that sort of fluid dynamics problem work out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm trying to do &#x2013; we certainly were a net extender of credit to U.S. households in the third quarter.  I can't give you the statistic business by business but we certainly were a net extender of credit.  I think you see that in some of the statistics that we've actually published through TARP.  There's a TARP score card that is on there.</p>
          <p>You can also see at least in our regional consumer banking businesses that loans increased including in the North America consumer banking business.  So we are still a net increased extender of credit.  Now, the math that I'm trying to do in my head quite frankly is we have cut back on some open lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, you know, in many ways that has just been unused capacity over time.  So depending upon how you consider open lines, you might get a slightly different answer but as far as actual use of our balance sheet, we would be a net extender.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow-up in this regard.  I guess three quarters ago we were all in a fevered sweat about the contingent draw represented by corporations pulling down their available lines and that has to some degree kind of reversed itself with pretty accelerated paybacks especially since everybody's gone to the bond market.  How about on the household side?  If you think about the excess availability through cards and you think about the excess availability through home equity, and then the handful of other instruments that might create contingent excess credit availability to households, what have you all learned and what is the right balance to be running on that contingent credit available to households ready to be drawn at will?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way I would frame that is that clearly having contingent availability to consumers and to corporations is valuable to them and in many cases we earn fees and revenue from that.  The essential question is what's the right mix of that?  And you've seen that we have adjusted that mix of undrawn availability to drawn availability across our franchise.  You'd expect that of any banking institution as we go through more difficult parts of the credit cycle or more benign ones.</p>
          <p>So there's not kind of a simple answer for how much is right.  It's really about a very algorithmic approach to line management in an annuity business like cards and it's a client by client approach on the corporate side and what we've found is from a liquidity perspective that management strategy has served us quite well.  We've had, relative to any of the battery of stress tests we run, we've had very modest draw-downs from corporations on the old stuff that we talked about and from individual consumers.  And in fact, the way you could take a look at that is to see whether there is any large increases in loan balances, because the un-drawn becomes drawn and you can see that there hasn't been that lumpy increase that obviously we want to be prepared for and in many cases moderate or avoid.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. One is a just a quick follow-up. Just on the ring-fenced assets again, the 7.8 billion number you're giving me is an NCL. I guess I was more interested between NCLs and allowance for loan losses, what's that number look like relative to the 39 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't separate out the loan loss reserve that we have on the ring fenced assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. But the 7.8 is just actual losses incurred, right? And then I was looking at...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Tom, the reason I was give you that is the one that is most closely associated with the 39.5 billion, which is the first loss position that we have. The 39.5 is related to actual NCLs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I realize that but you're going to stop provisioning right, once you get to 39.5, you're not going to have to provision anymore. And you do have, like, 26 billion and change of provisions at Citi Holdings. So is it fair to say a meaningful chunk of that is for ring-fenced assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about the fact that a meaningful chunk of the ring-fenced assets are mortgages. You can certainly say there is a meaningful chunk. But I wouldn't try to guide you anywhere beyond that. You know, the other factoid would be that the ring-fenced assets now have actually reduced. We started out at 301 billion. As of the end of September, the total ring-fenced assets were down to $251 billion of which 205, 206 were actually on balance sheet. So we've also seen, you know, some appreciable shrinkage in the ring-fenced asset portfolio as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that's just primarily you sold down 50 billion then of the ring-fenced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sold down. It's pay down. Again, like all our other holdings type, holdings assets, we are actively managing that portfolio down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

          <p>And then just a quick one on the expense side. If I actually adjust your operating expenses in the third quarter, it looks like they actually went up or adjusted for Smith Barney. What's going on in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually did talk about that on the call yesterday. And, you know, there are two things. One, you're quite right, adjusted for Smith Barney. We should have seen a reduction and what we mentioned that we actually increased expenses in Citicorp by about $400 million, quarter-on-quarter. And that was primarily due to increased compensation costs, the biggest driver in our Securities and Banking business. That increased compensation accounted for about two-thirds of the increase and the other one-third was due to foreign exchange.</p>
