        <plist>
          <p>[Abrupt Start] ...show a strong performance in an environment which has not always been easy. This strong performance is reflected by a significant progression in underlying earnings, 9% when compared with the previous year. You will recall that the guidance we've given as far as Ambition AXA is concerned is between 5% and 10%. You can see that we are closer to the top of the range than to the bottom.</p>
          <p>Underlying earnings have reached &#x20AC;4.3 billion last year. If you look at the pre-tax underlying earnings, the progression is even 10%. You cannot ignore the fact that in some countries, taxes have increased last year, notably in this one.</p>
          <p>Operating free cash flows are up from &#x20AC;4.2 billion to &#x20AC;4.7 billion, this coming from the increase in operating cash flows from our Life activities. You know that this part of our plan in Ambition AXA to generate &#x20AC;24 billion of cash flows between 2010 and 2015. We think that there, the indication of an 11% growth for 2012 is a good sign of progress.</p>
          <p>So, good earnings growth, strong free cash flow generation, very comfortable solvency levels, supported by very strong operating returns. If you look at both solvency measures, Solvency I may be technically outdated but still in place, 233% historical high. Solvency II, 206% coming up from 180%-something last year. So it's an increase.</p>
          <p>And what is important there is to see that the operating returns are generating 26 points of increase in the year, during the year, which showed that the ability of the group to reinforce its solvency through the generation of earnings is pretty strong. The gearing is slightly decreasing. It's now down to 26%. You know that the middle-term goal of 2015 is 25%. We are now extremely close to this goal. And thereto, we are therefore comfortable that we will reach the target of Ambition AXA in that field.</p>
          <p>All this leads us to propose to the shareholders to approve an increase in the dividend, increase from &#x20AC;0.69 to &#x20AC;0.72. This is a payout ratio of 40%. We are going back to the bottom of the range we have indicated in the past, which was 40% to 50%. Last year, we were at 50% because of all the exceptional elements. You will remember, this year we are at 40%. We are comfortable with this level and we intend to use the returns, the retained earnings to generate further growth. The dividend yield is above 5%. So we think it's a comfortable one.</p>
          <p>If I go to the next slide, this is the set of results is an illustration of the validity of our business model, which has not changed. As usual, we see our three core business lines as being Property Casualty, Health &amp; Protection, and Savings and Asset Management. We have crossed the bar of 100 million clients last year through our very strong distribution footprint and through a multi-distribution model which is working.</p>
          <p>We have improved further the efficiency of the group through the actions of the two global business lines, Life and P&amp;C, and through the action of the operations headed by V&#xE9;ronique Weill. All this is helping us deliver the performance you are seeing and makes us comfortable that we will see in the future a steady earnings and dividend growth. We also think that we will reach the targets we have in terms of return on equity. You will note that in 2012, the return on equity was at 13.3%, so getting closer to the long-term target.</p>
          <p>I think you have to have in mind the fact that we are well-diversified both in terms of earnings and reserves. If you look at the split of the pre-tax underlying earnings by business line, you will see that Property Casualty, Health &amp; Protection, and Savings and Asset Management is a little more than a quarter, that P&amp;C is 40%, and Protection &amp; Health one-third. If you look at our insurance reserves, you will see also quite balanced split which is reducing the risk profile of the group.</p>
          <p>On the Property Casualty side, there too, you have a picture of diversification and efficient performance. If you look at the global footprint, Europe is still representing approximately 60% Continental Europe, 60% of the business. But the proportion represented by high growth market is growing every year, and we will come back to that later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>But you should have in mind that back five years ago in 2007, the high growth markets were representing 4% of the revenues in P&amp;C and 4% in Life. You will see that now, it has more than tripled and sometimes quadrupled within five years. So, good geographical diversification, good diversification also in terms of business lines.</p>
          <p>If I look at the P&amp;C business, between the motor business, the commercial business, the personal non-motor, 55% of our revenues are coming from retail clients with a focus now for us on developing multi-access and telematics. We think we have a significant competitive advantage with our direct business.</p>
          <p>We are the biggest direct writer outside the U.S. We are the only one having successful operations in nine countries. And we think there is a good momentum in our P&amp;C operations because our revenues, which were at approximately &#x20AC;16 billion, &#x20AC;17 billion in 2000, have now nearly doubled. You will see that we have made significant progresses also on the combined ratio in 2012. Denis will come back to that into more detail.</p>
          <p>If I look at the Protection &amp; Health business, more or less the same picture with something I would like to highlight, which is the growth in terms of revenues. I say more or less the same picture because the geographical spread shows you that we have a balanced portfolio with a proportion of high growth markets which is 22%, which we think is a significant achievement knowing where we come from.</p>
          <p>The volume of business also is growing fast. And this is an illustration of the success we have in rebalancing the mix. We've told you that we wanted to accelerate in Protection &amp; Health, improve the proportion of Unit-Linked, and therefore reduce the proportion of general accounts in our Life &amp; Savings business including Protection &amp; Health.</p>
          <p>This is working. This is working because we are accelerating in Protection &amp; Health as you see from the chart on the right-hand side of this slide. And this is not done to the detriment of the profitability of the business since the combined ratio is consistently in that segment of the business, below 95%. So we have, in these two businesses which are generating very significant margin, we have a very strong and very well-diversified geographical footprint.</p>
          <p>The next slide, Savings and Asset Management. This business has been suffering from a negative evolution of the market in the previous years and also from some issues which were, I would say, more AXA-specific. We think that 2012 showed very significant signs of improvement. And this is giving you, I would say, the global picture of what we do and where we are. 58% of the savings reserves, which amount to &#x20AC;330 billion, are in the General Accounts and Savings business.</p>
          <p>42% are in the Unit-Linked business and therefore, has been benefiting and will benefit from the improvements in the situation of the market. These assets, this part of assets, &#x20AC;330 billion, is generating earnings which are driven by the asset base evolution. What we want to do on the G/A side of the business is extract more value from the very large inforce portfolios we have and we are starting to succeed in that area.</p>
          <p>We think that these inforce portfolios are an opportunity for us and that working more on the expenses, on the restructuring of the product, sometimes on the conversion could generate significant additional earnings.</p>
          <p>If we look at the Asset Management side, the assets we are managing, which amounts to &#x20AC;900 billion, are split between two parts which are grossly equivalent, a little more than 50% on behalf of AXA companies, a little less than 50% on behalf of third parties. 25% of these assets are equities, 55% are fixed income. There, we think we have a win-win relationship between AXA and the asset management companies.</p>
          <p>And 2012 has been a year where things have started to turn around, as you will see in the details of the presentation when you look at both the earnings but also the asset flows. The first half of the year has remained difficult. But in the second half of the year, flows have turned positive both at AXA IM and AllianceBernstein. So we think and we hope that we will, in 2013, continue to build on this momentum to come back to positive inflows.</p>
          <p>I will now let Denis comment more specifically on the details of these earnings which, as I said in this brief introduction, are solid ones and showing that we progress well on the road to Ambition AXA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Henri. Good morning, everyone. So I will go into more details, as Henri has proposed, on the comments on the results of AXA. You know the Ambition AXA strategy. I don't need to repeat it. But I'd like to come back to some of the financial targets that we have set ourselves.</p>
          <p>First one was underlying earnings per share progression of 5% to 10% per annum. This year, we are progressing by 8%. So we are well in line with this target. Group operating free cash flow of &#x20AC;24 billion over five years, this year at &#x20AC;4.7 billion. We have a strong progression. Again, another progression of &#x20AC;0.5 billion following the previous progression of &#x20AC;0.5 billion. So we are well on our way to reach the &#x20AC;24 billion.</p>
          <p>Adjusted return on equity. We are already within the range of 13% to 15%, having reached 13.3% adjusted return on equity. And finally, debt gearing at 26%, we remain close to the 25% target that we have set ourselves for 2015.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the Life business. We had indicated that we would increase the focus on Protection &amp; Health on one hand, and Unit-Linked on the other hand. The proportion of Unit-Linked is relatively stable at 32%, but the proportion of annuity business has grown by 5% in 2012. The proportion of Protection &amp; Health has continued to increase at 40% with a growth of 16%. And this translates into a better new business margin, which is now at 31% in excess of the 2015 target, thanks to this improved mix and the higher proportion of Protection &amp; Health business which, and I will come back to that, reached 53% new business volume margin.</p>
          <p>The IRRs are also progressing. As you probably know, the new business margin is a market-consistent margin. So we don't take into account the evolution of interest rates. Whereas the IRR is based on the management case, so it's a deterministic measure. Our IRR is at 12.5% against 11.5% last year. And this is on the back of an economic scenario which we see as less favorable this year than we were seeing it last year.</p>
          <p>In other words, interest rates in 2012 have declined when we expected them to increase. So we see now a progression of interest rates going forward which is less optimistic than the one we saw last year. This in itself has a negative impact on the IRR of close to 0.7 points. And in spite of that, we have improved the IRR by 1 point between last year and 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving now to P&amp;C profitability. The whole year combined ratio has improved by 0.3 points in 2012 to 97.6%. This improvement is a bit disappointing and this is due to the 0.7 point impact of a reserve strengthening in Turkey. We took an additional reserve which has a net &#x2013; I mean an underlying earnings after tax impact of &#x20AC;117 million related to the deterioration of our bodily injury expense in motor in Turkey. We have taken a very radical action there and we are re-pricing our third party liability products in Turkey. So we believe that the issue is clearly behind us, but it's a negative surprise.</p>
          <p>On the Direct business, I would like just to emphasize that we have a unique Direct franchise with more than 5 million policies sold in 2012, a presence in nine countries, and now 63% of the business coming through the Internet. We are the second largest European player behind Direct Line and in a tie with Admiral.</p>
          <p>Moving to high growth markets. The progression in high growth markets is quite important. You see that the share of high growth market in our P&amp;C revenues has moved from 4% in 2007 to 12% in 2011 and 14% last year. In Life, the proportion of new business premiums has moved from 4% in 2007 to 17% in 2012, so a strong progression which in line with our global strategy.</p>
          <p>And we see the early signs of success with our JV with ICBC, where the launch was on 19th of July and the second half was more than 2.5 times the first half of the year. So, solid progress there. We are not yet breakeven but we have the aspiration to be breakeven in 2015 and to continue that progression to be the leading international JV. And the ambition of the bank is to move this company, this JV to number seven in China.</p>
          <p>Moving to Asset Management. We have assets which have come back to their levels of 2010. With improving net flows, you will recall that we had negative flows of &#x20AC;8 billion in the first half. We had positive flows in the second half of &#x20AC;6 billion. So the net for the year is &#x20AC;1.5 billion negative.</p>
          <p>We have a strong progression of our earnings and our investment performance has continued to improve. And the diversification of the asset base and of the franchise has substantially increased at AllianceBernstein which make us less fragile and less dependent on the success of one specific investment expertise.</p>
          <p>On the cost savings, we have decided to increase our target from &#x20AC;1.5 billion to &#x20AC;1.7 billion because we had not factored in at that point the Life &amp; Savings acquisition costs expense savings, which we are now estimating at &#x20AC;0.2 billion. We are well on line to reach the &#x20AC;1.7 billion by 2015. We are at &#x20AC;0.7 billion after two years, &#x20AC;0.4 billion in 2012, which I mean makes us confident that we can achieve the full target by 2015.</p>
          <p>Going into more detail on the earnings. I'd like first to look at the composition of the underlying earnings which grew by 9%. You see that the contribution of Life is quite significant. The contribution of Asset Management is also positive. The other businesses have a more modest contribution to the improvement. P&amp;C earnings have increased by 1%. And as you will see in the next slide, the international earnings have brought a smaller contribution because of lower positive prior year developments on one-off portfolios.</p>
          <p>Moving to the adjusted earnings. Our adjusted earnings have grown by 28%, which gives us this ROE of 13.3%. This is due to higher capital gains at &#x20AC;815 million and lower impairments at &#x20AC;283 million. You will recall that 2011 was marked by the impairment of our Greek sovereign bonds. We didn't have that issue in 2012 and this solid progression of the adjusted earnings.</p>
          <p>Net income which, unfortunately, has been the headline of the announcement this morning, our net income on a comparable basis is down 4%. But you will recall that in 2011, we had significant exceptional elements. So excluding those exceptionals, which I will detail in a minute, the growth would have been 44%.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we had sold our participation in our business in Australia, New Zealand, our business in Canada, and our participation of 15% in Taikang Life in China. And we had also had a reduction of our U.S. goodwill of roughly &#x20AC;1 billion. So those exceptional elements accounted for a positive of &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>In terms of restructuring costs, we are broadly in line with last year. We still have &#x20AC;244 million of restructuring costs. As you can imagine, when we do significant expense savings initiatives, we have redundancy costs. We have leasehold improvement write-ups on our real estates. And it means that we will have, going forward, perhaps not the same level, but still a significant level of restructuring cost.</p>
          <p>In terms of change in fair value, the second line of this slide, there is always some variances in our net income because as you know, some of our derivatives are mark-to-market even if they are hedging. But sometimes, they do not qualify for hedge accounting.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the business by division. On the Life &amp; Savings, in terms of new business, we saw a growth of 2% of our APE in mature markets and good improvement of new business margin at 29%. High growth markets, this is a contrasted story. Again in 2012, we see a decline of Central and Eastern Europe, which is down 34%. This is the continuation of the negative impact coming from the change in pension regulation in Poland and nationalization of pensions in Hungary.</p>
          <p>We have to reposition our sales force to Life products, which are more difficult to sell. And so, we continue to have a negative there. This is more than offset by growth in Asia, which is 17%. But the overall figure is not as good as we would have hoped. The new business margin continues to be quite steady at 44%.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide, on the split of the new business. You see that we continue to have a solid growth of our APE and Protection &amp; Health and a good new business margin, strong sales in Asia and Japan, as well as strong sales in France.</p>
          <p>On the Savings side, as expected, we continue to see a decline of new business of 10%. We have moved to a positive margin after two or three years of negative margin on G/A Savings. This is thanks to principally better expense efficiencies, but also better investment margin and an improved structure of the products. The decline in G/A Savings was particularly significant in Italy, Germany, and France.</p>
          <p>Unit-Linked was up 2% with a margin of 28%. Strong performance in the U.S. with non-GMxB products, the SCS product in particular, as well as in Japan and Italy, partly offset by CEE and UK. Finally, Mutual Funds plus 13%, NBV margin of 4%. But as you know, the result almost no capital use in this business. Strong performance in the U.S. and the UK.</p>
          <p>On the Life side in total, we see a progression of high growth markets of 18%, but also a progression of mature markets of 19%. You see in the waterfall on the right part of the slide that we have a very solid investment margin. G&#xE9;rald will come back to that later. Progression of Unit-Linked fees and margin revenues is in line with the progression of the assets under management and the revenues.</p>
          <p>Much lower charge from U.S. GMxBs and this is, to some extent, offset by higher DAC amortization. As you know in the U.S. with DAC activity, the more you make profits, the more you amortize tax. We have better profits and therefore more DAC amortization. In total, this brings us to the &#x20AC;2.6 billion that you see on the slide.</p>
          <p>I'd like to spend now little bit more time on what happened in the U.S. You see first that the contribution of our U.S. business was &#x20AC;522 million to group underlying earnings, and the VA GMxB losses were limited to less than 1% of the group earnings at minus &#x20AC;28 million. So clearly, an improving situation.</p>
          <p>You see that base fees less expenses have improved from &#x20AC;165 million to &#x20AC;276 million, that our hedge margin remains negative at minus &#x20AC;156 million. This is clearly a declining number compared to last year. We have almost no basis risk losses anymore. We still have some volatility losses coming from the fact that we have hedged volatility at a cost, not coming from a high volatility because volatility was low in 2012, and as well as some hedge breakage relative to interest rates and credit spreads.</p>
          <p>The biggest movements are in the reserve strengthening area with a negative of &#x20AC;148 million. You can see that we have done a number of actions in 2012, which we believe are positioning us well for the future. We have had another look at our lapse assumptions and we have put in place more dynamic lapse assumptions in the portfolio, which have led to a &#x20AC;273 million hit.</p>
          <p>We've also looked at all other policyholder behavior impacts and in particular, partial withdrawals, and took a hit of &#x20AC;217 million. This was partly offset by two other important moves. The first one has been the elimination of drop in premiums at the end of March 2012. So this is positive development because we used to have something like $600 million of annual recurring premiums on our old VA contracts. We stopped that and this is a positive.</p>
          <p>The second change that we made, which is on the last line, the plus &#x20AC;164 million relates to the decision that we took to move our 2001 to 2010 legacy portfolio to a 3% long-term discount rate. And as a result of this change in the reserve assumptions, we have reduced the amount of hedging on the GMxB's interest rate hedging by 25%.</p>
          <p>We thought that doing that at the end of 2012 was a good idea because we thought that we had reached a bottom in terms of long-term interest rate and dispositions as better for the future because first, we have an increased exposure to the rebound in interest rates. Secondly, we have significantly reduced our expected probability of future reserve strengthening. In one words &#x2013; or in one sentence, we believe we have stabilized our U.S. Life business.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the P&amp;C business. Revenues were up 3%, both in personal lines and in commercial lines. In personal lines, average price increases was 2.9%. We saw more than 1 million net new contracts. But this was offset by lower average premium, particularly in Southern Europe. On the commercial lines, also a 3% increase in premium, average price increase of 3.1%, more favorable business mix. We are roughly breakeven in terms of inflow of contracts.</p>
          <p>Looking in more detail at the pricing situation, you see that there is still a lot more green than amber on this slide. We have been able to increase prices in almost every territory in 2012. In total, 2.9% in personal lines, 3.1% in commercial lines. The only exception being Switzerland where we, as you know, have a combined ratio which is slightly below 90%. So it's no surprise that prices don't have much room to increase in that country.</p>
          <p>2013 pricing trends. Germany remains very well oriented. Other than that, you see that we have still some green but more amber than last year, which means that we are probably closer to the plateau in terms of prices in P&amp;C in Europe.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the revenues and margins by market. Mature markets, the current year combined ratio declined by 1 point to 98.3% with revenues up 2%. High growth markets, revenues were up 12%. This is on the businesses that we consolidate. There are some businesses that we did not yet consolidate, particularly in Asia where the growth was even higher. But 12% is already quite a solid growth. Unfortunately, because of what happened in Turkey in terms of bodily injuries, the combined ratio deteriorated by 1 point to 101%.</p>
          <p>Direct business also a contrasted picture. In countries other than the UK, revenue growth was 9%. In the UK, where we were not happy with our performance in terms of combined ratio, we have been much more selective and our revenues went down 17%. All in all, the combined ratio, however, improved to 105% (sic) [100.5%] (32:57). The current year combined ratio in total improved by 0.8 points, which is a good result.</p>
          <p>Moving to the earnings. They grew by 1%. The current year, as I told you, improved by 0.8%. When you look at the natural events, you have the natural catastrophes, which was a low impact of 0.4% of combined compared to 0.7% last year. But other than the natural catastrophes, we also had a negative impact of freeze which was costing us 0.5 points in 2011. And it's costing us 0.9 points of combined ratio in 2012. We have lower expenses and the price inclusions I described, which allow us to improve by 0.8 points.</p>
          <p>Prior reserve developments, a positive of 1.2 points, less than last year. But again, we have to withstand the impact of Turkey, which is 0.6 points on this total. Investment income remains relatively stable, minus 2%. Asset yield at 3.9% against 4% last year.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, our average AUM were up 2% at AXA Investment Managers, down 3% for AllianceBernstein. AXA IM moved to positive flows in Q3. AllianceBernstein moved to positive flows in Q4. In total, we had a negative movement in the flows of minus &#x20AC;1.5 billion for the year for the two companies combined, but you see that we have now turned the corner in Asset Management in terms of net flows both at AXA IM and at AllianceBernstein on the back of a very solid investment performance in AXA IM and a more contrasted but quite solid performance at AllianceBernstein, very strong in fixed income and alternatives, and somewhat more contrasted in equities. But we have a number of equity <mark type="ph" /> expertise (35:33) which have shown solid performance. The remaining issue is the large cap U.S. performance.</p>
          <p>Asset Management earnings and revenues. You see the growth of the earnings of 14%. Thanks to a positive squeeze effect, if I may call it that way, revenues were down 3%, but expenses were down 5%. Thanks to a very strong expense discipline in particular at AllianceBernstein, where the cost-to-revenue ratio has been maintained below 50% thanks to a reduction in FTEs and a reduction also in the premises cost.</p>
          <p>I will now &#x2013; thank you for your attention. I'll hand over to G&#xE9;rald Harlin for the balance sheet and other items. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Denis. Good morning. Starting first with the shareholders' equity. Excluding the &#x20AC;2.1 billion that you can see on the slide and corresponding to a change in DAC policy, our shareholders' equity went up from &#x20AC;46.4 billion to &#x20AC;53.7 billion. The main elements are, first, an increase in net unrealized capital gains, with lower rates, with lower spreads at &#x20AC;6.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Then we have the net income of the period, &#x20AC;4.2 billion; dividend, minus &#x20AC;1.6 billion. The change in pension benefits, as you know, our pension benefits are discounted at a AA corporate spread level. Hence, we had a decrease in the interest rates by 80 basis points, which explains why we have an adjustment of minus &#x20AC;0.8 billion. Forex movements, minus &#x20AC;0.6 billion, mainly coming from the Japanese yen, which decreased significantly.</p>
          <p>Moving to the economic solvency. You can see that our economic solvency went up significantly from 183% to 206%. Two remarks. First, in the U.S., we benefit from a strong 525% RBC ratio. And three, as you can see on the right part of the slide, the sensitivities are small across the board.</p>
          <p>Moving to the debt gearing. First of all, our debt gearing moved down from 27% to 26%, negatively impacted by DAC restatements which is roughly plus 1 point on the debt gearing. Interest coverage moved up from 9.1x to 9.3x. And as you can see on the left-hand side, we have only subordinated debt of which 60% are undated.</p>
          <p>Moving to ALM. So as mentioned previously by Denis, our Life &amp; Savings asset yield went down by 10 basis points from 3.9% to 3.8%. In P&amp;C, the same, from 4% to 3.9%. As explained by Denis, we had the flexibility to lower our credited rates. That's what we did in countries like France, like Switzerland and for the many important ones. And this in the end, we increased our net investment margin from 73 basis points to 78 basis points. That's indeed the high end of our guidance and we intend to remain within this guidance.</p>
          <p>You can see that the asset duration remains at a high level, 7.7 years for Life, 4.7 years for P&amp;C, and the duration gap has been managed at less than one year during 2012. As mentioned, we also have caps and floors, swaptions in order to protect our balance sheet in case of significant moves in the interest rate.</p>
          <p>Moving to the portfolio, asset portfolio. On the left-hand side, you have the investment portfolio overview and no big change. That means that we are mostly invested in fixed income, with govies and related representing 45%; corporate bonds, 31%. So mostly fixed income. On the right-hand side, you have the current investment policy on fixed income. So that's the policy we have run during the year, during 2012. And in 2012, we invested more in corporate bonds, less in govies, and more, I would say, in deep diversified products.</p>
          <p>First, starting with government bonds, which represented 30% of our investment. We have been investing in Q4 in Italy and Ireland again for roughly &#x20AC;5 billion. And as far as the diversifications that I mentioned before, we have invested 7% in short duration high yield. In ABS as well, we reinvested in AAA CLOs for 7%. And loans, most of these loans correspond to corporate, real estate of 7%.  As you can see at the bottom right, the total investment rate has been 2.7%, of which in the Eurozone, we were at 3.2%.</p>
          <p>ALM spreads now. So on our inforce business, we have significant &#x2013; next slide. Thank you. So on the inforce business, we have a significant buffer to cover the guarantees. We have an average spread of 160 basis points. On the new business, so you can see we have more important spreads, 200 basis points and with lower guarantees. And we proposed to our clients lower guarantees to attract higher margin Unit-Linked business.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to EV and operating free cash flows. So first, let's start with the IFRS tangible net asset value corresponding to the IFRS shareholders' equity minus sub-debt which are accounted for in the shareholders' equity minus all the intangibles, goodwill, tax and so on. And you can see and you can notice that we have a significant improvement in our TNAV by plus 52% from &#x20AC;14.2 billion to &#x20AC;21.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Next, the group EV. The group EV went up from &#x20AC;31.5 billion to &#x20AC;37.3 billion, mostly explained by a strong 19% operational return. This operational return is explained by a 25% higher NBV. We have a strong &#x20AC;1.9 billion NBV and also the growing inforce.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the Life free cash flow now. As you can see that they improved from &#x20AC;1.4 billion to &#x20AC;2.2 billion over the last two years, which is a significant improvement, mostly explained by the growing inforce business. At the same time, in the bubbles, you can notice that our IRR, internal rate of return on new business, is going up mostly explained by two reasons. A better business mix focusing more on more profitable products and the productivity gains, meaning that our internal rate of return went up from 10.9% to 12.5% in 2012.</p>
          <p>Third, the new business investment you can see in the orange bar. New business investments are stable at &#x20AC;2.2 billion. So that means that despite higher and new business volumes, we kept the same new business investment explaining that we had an active and an efficient capital management.</p>
          <p>Let's now focus on the group free cash flows. And group free cash flows improved from &#x20AC;4.2 billion to &#x20AC;4.7 billion mainly explained by the Life &amp; Savings operational free cash flows that I just explained. So remittance ratio, which is the amount of cash which is upstream to the holding company, we are pretty stable at 74%. So you can notice that also, we had a significant improvement in our operating free cash flows. We had accordingly a strong upstream of cash coming on the operating company.</p>
          <p>Now, I hand over to Henri. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So as a conclusion, I think these earnings are reflecting both the fact that 2012 was a strong year and that we are well on track to deliver our long-term earnings. If you put everything together, underlying earnings are up 9%, so at the top of the range we had indicated. Adjusted earnings up 28%. This leads us to propose an increase in the dividend. The return on equity is also progressing quite well. This reinforces further the balance sheet. So when we look forward, we are confident that we will deliver on Ambition AXA and we are starting to prepare the long term future.</p>
          <p>We think we are well-positioned. We've been dealing, a both Denis and G&#xE9;rald have been highlighting, with the issues stemming from the Asset Management and the U.S. business. And that's where we are. No reasons to be overconfident given the global macro uncertainties, but all reasons to be confident that we will deliver on Ambition AXA and see growth in revenues and growth in earnings continuing in the years to come. That's where we are.</p>
          <p>We'll stop the presentation there and take questions. When you have the mic, you can introduce yourself so that everybody can know who is speaking. It's going to be even better. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Colin Simpson from Goldman Sachs. I just got two questions, please. Denis, you mentioned that you've stabilized things in the U.S. Life business. I'm just trying to work hard at what level they stabilize. In other words, we have this &#x20AC;1 billion pre-tax pre-debt charge coming through the GMxB line or &#x20AC;300 million post DAC and post-tax. What is a sensible or a reasonable range to expect going forward assuming markets stay relatively stable?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on just all these tax changes that have happened in France. I'm just wondering what impacts we're going to see from them. In particular, you've got debt that I believe is taxable. You're paying a cash dividend which I believe is taxable. And you've got some changes to your staff costs, I think, in France.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So now, if we go back to the slide that I showed, which is slide A30 of the presentation, I believe that you could assume that the reserve strengthening line on a post-tax basis is the one that is not recurring. We should continue to have some hedge breakage at the level that we currently have or level nearby.</p>
          <p>So basically, you're talking of an improvement in terms of a number coming from the reserve strengthening &#x2013; you should eliminate the number coming from the reserve strengthening. But I mean, we are not moving to a very profitable VA portfolio. We are coming to a situation where the VA portfolio becomes marginally profitable.</p>
          <p>On the tax changes in France, the overall tax charge coming from the increase in taxes in France, we have estimated at &#x20AC;170 million, &#x20AC;175 million. And the impact within that of the tax from the dividends is roughly &#x20AC;50 million for the current dividend that we announced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of it is non-recurring because what has been done on the reserve recapitalization is a one-off and it's &#x20AC;53 million, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Thomas Jacquet from Exane BNP. We noticed in the industry a trend to slightly change the dividend policy payout at some companies. It's not yet a trend. And in any case, I know that you prefer to be a trendsetter than a trend follower. But can you share with us your view on that topic, having in mind that while they keep a payout ratio, they tend to commit to a minimum level of the dividend per share?</p>
          <p>My second question is in fact in terms of &#x2013; can you give us an update on the potential regulatory pressure that is likely to happen in 2013? I think in particular, the global <mark type="ph" /> C fees (50:06) status and what could be the consequence for you? And my last point is about the mid-term targets. We appreciate the fact that we have 2015 targets. But what could you say about 2013 and how you see that developing in the short-term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the payout, we've moved from a 50% payout to a 40%. But last year, you know that the 50% was more or less an exception. I mean, we were comfortable by distributing 50% because we had some exceptional elements on the adjusted which were negative. We are back to 40%. We think the &#x2013; we have two reasons to change the guidance 40% to 50% because we &#x2013; when you see growth resuming in the business, you should expect that you will have different ways to reinvest what you keep. But there is no reason either to decrease the payout range.</p>
          <p>On the regulatory pressure, I'm not going to add anything significant to the ongoing discussions on Solvency II. I mean, you know everything as well as we know it. The unknown is where is the discussion on <mark type="ph" /> C fees (51:23) going to go. The feeling we have, at the risk of being slightly politically incorrect, is that whatever measure is going to be decided, whatever the KPIs which are going to be used, the list already exists. So the problem is &#x2013; the sentence is already defined, even if there is no crime.</p>
          <p>That's not the problem. So the problem is not: to be a <mark type="ph" /> C fee (51:48) or not to be a <mark type="ph" /> C fee (51:50). We remain convinced that by nature, insurance activities are not systemic, point one. And that on the contrary, we are stabilizers in the system and that this should be taken into account.</p>
          <p>But if there has to be a list, it's probable that the big boys will be on the list. So the key question is what are the consequences? Is it going to be additional disclosure? Is it going to be additional financial requirements? The debate is open.</p>
          <p>What we would like to highlight is the risk of having additional financial requirements, for two reasons. First one, because the essence of the insurance model is diversification and all what goes against geographical and global diversification is not reducing, but increasing the potential risks in the system.</p>
          <p>Second, we are not in a situation which is comparable to the banks, where there is more or less a normalized measurement system of the financial strength, Basel III. We all know that different geographies have different measurement systems. And applying the same add-ons to very different bases would be flatly wrong from an economic and from a stability standpoint.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, examples like Northern Rock in the banking sector have shown that it's not necessarily because you are big that you are creating an issue. Sometimes, smaller player have a bigger issue than large and well-organized players. Denis, do you want to add something?</p>
          <p>Mid-term targets. Well, mid-term targets are mid-term targets. I mean, between and 2015, we think that we will be between 5% and 10% in terms of earnings growth &#x2013; earnings per share growth, sorry. And we are confident that we will deliver it. And since the crisis has made all of us learn that there could be some volatility, I think it would be premature at this stage of the year to say more than what I've just said. And you were not expecting a more precise answer, I guess.</p>
          <p>Next question? Do we have questions on the phone or on the web?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First question. Could you go through again the use of the 3% discount rate in the VA business? You seem to be moving to a non-interest rate-sensitive reserving regime and taking off hedging. Is that right? And could you just explain why you've done that? And the second question I have is what level of economic surplus capital would you say would you start thinking perhaps too much capital? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Denis or G&#xE9;rald?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the U.S., we used to have in our old portfolio two different subsets of the portfolio, one which was hedged at &#x2013; which was, sorry, discounted at 4.5% and one which was discounted at the current market rates and hedged proactively. The first part being protected by fixed &#x2013; static hedges.</p>
          <p>We moved the totality of our 2001 to 2010 portfolio to a 3% long-term discount rate because we &#x2013; and we've reduced the amount of hedging accordingly because we believe that this portfolio is now quite stable, that 3% as a long-term assumption is a rather conservative assumption, and that reducing the amount of hedging on this portfolio at this current stage makes sense. For the portfolio 2011 and more recent, we continue to actively hedge the portfolio on current interest rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may just come back, actually, on that particular point, when you say the kind of policyholder behavior actuarial side of VA, costs will decline in the future. Is that because you're now happy with your dynamic assumptions or was it because of this assumption? Could you explain that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is just because we are happy with our current assumptions. We have now assumptions which are more dynamic and we are reasonably well-protected. We give you a slide in the appendix that gives you some sensitivities. And maybe G&#xE9;rald can comment that slide if you wish, but we &#x2013; or we can &#x2013; you can take that offline with the IR department.</p>
          <p>We have now a set of assumptions which we believe are reasonably conservative. And we've given you some sensitivities if things were deemed to be &#x2013; were effectively different from our assumptions, which we are now much more comfortable with those assumptions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And on capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the economic solvency &#x2013; your economic solvency question, if I understand it correctly, Farooq, what you ask is what level of capital is too much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean, you have over &#x20AC;200 million on your measure. I believe it's probably over &#x20AC;160 million on the measure where you use &#x2013; you apply Solvency II to the U.S. The number will probably go up if markets are stable. I mean, when do you start thinking, well, we need to pay more dividend, we need to do more with our capital? When do you start making less defensive comments about capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I hope we don't make too defensive comments on capital. We still note that we suffer from a discount compared to our peers because we were seen in the last four years as having less strong capital base. So I believe that the two measures that we will be looking at will be not just our economic solvency but also our gearing. And we believe that we've adjusted our dividend payout policy in line with our view of the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning all together and thanks for taking my question. I have actually a couple of very simple questions. The first one is I was pleased with your capital development. I mean, your shareholders' equity is particularly strong. And here the question is did you have any plan to change your reinsurance policy going forward in the sense of retaining more business and reinsuring less? We saw here already some companies moving in that direction.</p>
          <p>And the second one is we were &#x2013; I mean, another competitor this morning just disclosed a change on IAS 19 which had a huge charge on the pension benefit. And I saw you have already a charge for &#x20AC;0.8 billion. Is this all or should we expect more going into January?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>G&#xE9;rald, do you want to take the question on IAS 19...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...and Denis you take the first part of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I'll start off with IAS 19. So we can expect that &#x2013; you know that the change will consist in booking in the P&amp;L account, discount &#x2013; using in the P&amp;L account, a discount rate and expected return on assets to be more clear, which will be in line with AA rates. So that means that we can expect next year to have a cost of &#x20AC;0.1 billion. Roughly &#x20AC;100 million will be restated also 2012 and the restatement would have been almost the same.</p>
          <p>But on the shareholders' equity, it will be neutral, because in fact, it will be a move between shareholders' equity and P&amp;L account. And so, future adjustment will still flow &#x2013; actuarial adjustments will still flow through the shareholders' equity. So you can expect to have a move of minus &#x20AC;0.1 billion next year in the P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So again, we don't have to book another major balance sheet adjustment next year. It's just a P&amp;L effect as G&#xE9;rald described. On the reinsurance policy, I mean, this is something that we review on a regular basis. And you shouldn't expect a major change in our reinsurance policy. We will look again, as we do every year, what our peers are doing and whether we need to change this. But you shouldn't expect any major change that would be visible on the P&amp;L or the balance sheets coming from our reinsurance policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have two questions from Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. First question, does the reduction in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:11) rate give AXA the opportunity to reducing its French crediting rate and/or grow the top line? Question two, what is your appetite for further increasing investments in European peripheral bonds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. G&#xE9;rald, do you want to take the second one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As I mentioned to you, we started in Q3 to invest a bit more, roughly &#x20AC;5 billion in &#x2013; two-thirds in Italy and one-third in Ireland. In 2013, yes, we can expect to have some part of our investment in <mark type="ph" /> several (1:02:54) countries. We consider today that the spreads are quite attractive compared with the risk, and we consider that most of the risks are behind us. So yes, we will invest. To which scale &#x2013; for the time being you can expect that we will &#x2013; we might invest &#x20AC;4 billion, &#x20AC;5 billion in these countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the first half of the question is concerned, we are not chasing business under General Accounts, as you know. The comment I would make on the <mark type="ph" /> LIBOR (1:03:09) is more that it has taken too long to decrease the rate because objectively, they could have been brought down earlier.</p>
          <p>In terms of crediting policies, I mean as we have always state, we are tight on the ALM. We are trying to combine the profitability of our operations with the attraction for our clients. But it's not the <mark type="ph" /> LIBOR (1:03:34) we are looking at when we decide the crediting rate. It's more the opportunity, as I said, to combine a good deal for the clients and a good profitability for us.</p>
          <p>And there I think the innovation with the French teams have brought to the market is the ability to differentiate the credited rate depending on the mix of the new business. Rates on the General Account part of the account are higher when people take Unit-Linked investments as a significant portion of their savings than when they only take the General Account component of the account.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Just one very quick follow-up on the hedging adjustment that you've made this half. I wanted to understand what was economic and what was sort of just accounting reduction in volatility. So the removal of the hedge &#x2013; or the reduction in the hedge, is that an economic impact or is that just reflecting less volatility on the liability side because of the move to a fixed-discount rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to be clear, I described both, a change in accounting and a change in hedging from an economic standpoint. We keep hedging on an ongoing basis, the annuitization phase and the fixed income components of the investment of our policyholders. We keep hedging on a current basis the policies that are issued since 2011.</p>
          <p>We have a static hedge on a part of the legacy portfolio of 2001 to 2010. But in total, we have reduced the amount of economic hedging &#x2013; interest rate economic hedging that we have on the portfolio by 25% as indicated in slide A30.</p>
          <p>You would note, if you compare the disclosures of AXA and its peers in the U.S., that we were probably the company that had the biggest hedged assets but we were hedging interest rates much more actively than most of our peers. And we've decided to reduce slightly this hedging of interest rate that we had and that had given us a lot of cash. And so that positions us better for the upside.</p>
          <p>We've taken our profit in a sense on those hedges. We've done that at a time when interest rates in the U.S. &#x2013; or the tenure rates were below 180%, and we have already benefited from the movement of 20 basis points that has occurred since then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So to be clear, your interest rate sensitivity on that, economically, should now be higher...</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...but your accounting volatility should be lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. Our accounting volatility is sharply down, but our economic volatility is up. And you can see that it has an impact on the EV sensitivity in the U.S. It has an impact even on the EV sensitivity of the group. We have more exposure to an increase in interest rates than we used to have a year ago &#x2013; favorable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding Basel III, as you know, banks are trying to integrate this kind of new model in the CIB which is called originate and distribute, and try to work a little bit closer with insurance companies. Do you have any envelope, I would say, regarding making some business in your investment policy with banks in the framework of this originate-and-distribute evolving model? And is this a line included in what you call loans in your invested <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:08:19), I would say.</p>
          <p>And regarding more or less the same question, regarding real estate. As you know, the government recently said that it would be a kind of obligation, I don't know, you are in a socialist triad. So regarding necessity for insurance company to invest in real estate, what is your view on that? And what is presently the part of social real estate that you have invested in the past, I guess, real estate in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:09:11)?</p>
          <p>And the last question is regarding the northern, eastern of the country. It seems that revenues are decreasing there in quite a significant proportion. Is there any problem in one country or two countries? I don't know. And what is your view regarding the evolution of the business in this area in your Life &amp; Savings business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I suggest that G&#xE9;rald take the question on banks and loans made with banks. Jacques, do you want to say a word on the Life business in Northeast? And I'll take the question on real estate. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the loans are concerned, up to now we have been doing in France &#x20AC;3.5 billion of loans. We can expect this year to do in France maybe something like &#x20AC;1 billion. And on top of this, we are expecting to have loans in other countries. Maybe we could investigate &#x2013; we could do it in Germany and maybe in Italy, also maybe in the Netherlands. So all together, we can expect this year to have something around &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>About your questions, where is it accounted for? Yes, it's in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> 1:10:45) in the loan category. The most important part of it being corporate real estate loans because as you know with AXA IM, we are quite well-positioned in order to originate such kind of loans which are with quite attractive margin. In both cases, we are speaking for margins which are around 200 to 250 basis points.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So regarding Central and Eastern Europe, yes, volumes are down. AP are down. There are two reasons. The first one is that due to the change in the pension reforms that have been made in two countries, but mostly Poland, there is no new business anymore coming from that business. That's one.</p>
          <p>And second part, the economic crisis which was affecting first the South, has also had an impact as from last year in these countries, meaning that the saving power that is coming from this country is slower. What you don't see in the numbers is that like in any other countries, where shifting an important part of the business toward protection, but you don't replace immediately the volumes in savings by Protection business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the real estate side, as you've mentioned, there is a tendency now to look at the reserves accumulated by life insurance companies, &#x20AC;1.4 trillion for the French market. There is a tendency to replay Ali Baba and The Forty Thieves. In other terms, having the temptation to put the hand in the pot to finance various exotic things.</p>
          <p>A, it's the money of our policyholders. B, we will fight to defend it. C, the best way to resolve the housing crisis in France is to free up the rents and to take out the tenants who don't pay. It's absolutely politically incorrect to say that, but that's the best way to have a well-functioning market.</p>
          <p>Having said that, AXA is a responsible citizen and is already very active in social housing. You cannot ignore that we own le Logement Fran&#xE7;ais, which is one of the biggest companies having or developing social housing. We have, I think, 70,000 apartments which are rented to middle and low-income people with acceptable returns.</p>
          <p>And if collectively, the industry decides that we have to do something, we will do it. But per occupation, number one is going to be fighting for the interests of our policyholders because it's our fiduciary responsibility. Is this clear?</p>

          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Paul De'Ath from RBC. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. Just a few questions if I can, please. First of all, what's your long-term strategy regarding the General Accounts Savings business? I mean, is the move into Protection simply a temporary thing given the interest rate environment? Or are you eventually looking to exit this business longer term?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on the Asset Management flows, obviously Q4 was a positively flow for both of the businesses. Are you happy that you've now turned the corner in terms of flows in Asset Management and do you expect to see these going forward with some more consistency?</p>
          <p>And then the third point is just a small question on the &#x2013; in the press release, there was a specific quote about investing &#x20AC;1.2 billion into the business in 2013. Just if you could expand on what that relates to, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Long term strategy as far as the General Accounts is concerned, I think you should not isolate one specific product even it's a large one from the range of what we do. We intend to stay in the Savings segment of the Life business. What we've been over the last years is driven both by the interest of our clients and by our own margins.</p>
          <p>Investing further and incenting clients given the current situation of interest rates to put more money in General Accounts is probably never the best advice we can give them, nor the best way to improve our margins. So we've been, over the last three years, de-emphasizing the General Accounts and pushing Unit-Linked and held from Protection.</p>
          <p>In the future, if interest rates go up again and if it's in the interest of the clients given the perspectives of long-term returns and in our interest, given the margins we can extract from it to be a gain slightly more in General Accounts, why would we not do it?  But you have to accept that we have a range of products and that depending on different phases of the cycle, we can put more emphasis on one or on the other in the best interest of our shareholders in the long run.</p>
          <p>So today, clearly we see a real success in changing the mix. The fact that we have been successful in changing this mix is also a reflection of the control we have on our distribution. This does not mean that this mix will remain intangible for the next century. I mean, you have to be pragmatic.</p>
          <p>On the Asset Management, yes, the first quarter has been positive. Yes, the year has been starting fine. But it would be premature to say that we have definitely turned the corner. I mean, we hope we have turned it. But we know that markets are still fragile that risk appetite comes on and goes. So it would be presumptuous on my side to say that the sky is blue and that everything is going to go well.</p>
          <p>I don't know. What I know that we work hard to improve the competitive offer. What I see as a positive sign is the fact that last year, if you look at  the Financial Times rakings, the addition of the gross flows of AllianceBernstein and AXA IM positions us as the second largest asset manager in Europe in terms of gross flows, just behind, second only to PIMCO.</p>
          <p>The &#x20AC;1.2 billion, V&#xE9;ronique, do you want to comment on these investments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the &#x20AC;1.2 billion, we are investing &#x20AC;1.1 in technology. I can quote three main areas of investment. One is Digital &amp; Multi-Access. We definitely want to accelerate our ability to interact with our clients through digital tools and we're doing that very closely with our distribution network. So it's also helping them, helping the distribution to transform and allowing products and services to be available on web and tablets.</p>
          <p>The second area where we're investing also is in Health &amp; Protection. As you know, this is a very strategic initiative for us. And if I look at the numbers, we are investing in technology &#x20AC;130 million this year in Health and &#x20AC;158 in Protection. So definitely, strong investments in technology in many areas like Digital, Health &amp; Protection.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>We have the next question from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Thanks very much and good afternoon to you all. Three questions, I think. Firstly, can you give us some guidance on your expectation for net capital gains? That's the number that falls in between the underlying and the adjusted earnings line. That'd be useful.</p>
          <p>Secondly, looking at your Life business and the net investment margin, you talk about guidance of 70 to 80 basis points. It's quite a big range really, the difference between being at the bottom or the top is about &#x20AC;350 million, I think. Your move towards the top, is that somewhere where you'd hope to stay or you expect to say in the coming year or two? So just a little bit more guidance on that if at all possible.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, it wouldn't be a results presentation without a question on the U.S. And on the legacy book, what gives you the confidence that you're now in a stable environment? You've taken reserve adjustments for customer experience over the last two or three years. And they are still at quite high levels.</p>
          <p>So what gives you the confidence that we're now entering a period of stability? And as a follow up to that, if we are entering a period of stability, how much further would you expect that that charge to move up assuming that we don't have any further losses on the GMxB book? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>G&#xE9;rald, do you want to take the first two and Denis, the third one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So the expectation on the capital gains there, we are still in the range. We said that we should be between &#x20AC;300 million and &#x20AC;500 million. So we will be within this range. Let's be cautious. It will highly depend on the equity market and two months is not a year. So we can expect in the present moment to be in the low end of this range.</p>
          <p>As far as the spreads and the investment margin, you told us that 70 to 80 basis points was wide. Indeed, we can expect that we will be more towards the middle of the range. But I cannot give you &#x2013; honestly, I cannot be more precise today taking into account the environment. The reasons that led us to increase the investment margin are still true this year.</p>
          <p>And as much as possible we try to decrease, to optimize this margin taking into consideration as well that we can expect that with the, say, dilution of the General Accounts, and that we can expect to decrease our present yields maybe by 15 basis points. So that's why I'm relatively cautious but we'll do our best.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on your U.S. question, Blair, I thought that I had answered all the U.S. questions there with the previous two. But I hope this one will be the last one. On the stability point, we gave you two slides on the U.S. The slide, as commented live during the presentation, and slides B25 which gives you further information both on our lapse assumptions and on the maximum downside risk that we see beyond that.</p>
          <p>We believe that with our current lapse assumptions, which outflowed at 1.5% to 2.5% for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:22:44), we are at the right level. That's why we are reasonably confident that we shouldn't have significant surprises ahead of us. But having said that, as we show at the bottom of the slide, we give you a sensitivity. If lapse go to zero, this is what you have.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; and I cannot tell you more than that, really. On the DAC side, as you have seen, we have grown our new business in 2012 in the U.S. by 14% if my memory is correct. So in a growing business, you should assume that DAC will continue to grow up, because when you have a business that is growing, you have more DAC that you put on the books because of the new business. Then DAC <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:23:34) amortize on the existing business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may add one point, Blair. What is interesting is to see presently, we shared with you the key factor and the key factor on the Accumulator business still decreased. So we've had 81% one year ago. We are now at 61%. And at the end of June, we were at 64%. So we are moving in the right direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If I can just follow up on the last question, I understand that the DAC increases as you put business on the books, Denis, but the question was really reflecting the speed of which you amortized the DAC that's been built up over the last couple of years. The pace of amortization has been very slow. And on the assumption that you enter into a period where you have no additional losses on the GMxB book, I was wondering if there's any rule of thumb as to how much more the DAC amortization will increase by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I don't think we will give you more detailed guidance on that on what I've just told you, Blair.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sorry for asking another question. Just actually two questions. Firstly, you pulled away from Direct in the UK quite strongly. What is the risk that we see some reserving implications going forward from that? Second point is your remittance ratio guidance has usually, I think, been 75% to 85%. I don't know if that still lasts. But what's the potential for that remittance ratio to go up especially as you become hopefully more confident on capital? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on your UK question, we have peeled back on our UK exposure with, I would say more, I mean more granularity in our pricing. And as significant price increases at the time when the market was stabilizing, we have absolutely no bad news on the reserves.</p>
          <p>So you shouldn't expect reserve strengthening in that part of the business. And we believe that we are now in a better position having done what we have to do to, I mean, to stabilize and reprice the Direct business during 2012. Remittance ratio, G&#xE9;rald?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remittance ratio, yes, we can expect to have improvement in the remittance ratio, taking into account that there is always a lag. This year and over the last years, we had a strong improvement in the operating free cash flow and the remittance ratio corresponds to the cash dividends from entities. So with dividends, we have a one-year difference. But we are working hard in order to optimize these cash flows and we can expect it to go up.</p>
