          <p>Thank David and good morning everyone. We appreciate your interest in Kimberly-Clark. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Randy Vest, Vice President and Controller. Now, here is the agenda for today's call; Mark will start with a review of our fourth quarter results and Tom will provide his perspective and discuss our outlook for 2008. And, that will leave us plenty of time to finish, as usual, with Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>For those wishing to follow along, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors' Section of our website, www.kimberly-clark.com. The presentation also includes details regarding our 2008 planning assumptions. First, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call today. There can be no assurance that future events will occur as anticipated or that the Company's results will be as estimated. Please refer to the Risk Factors' section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a description of factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin. Management believes that reporting in this manner enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. For additional information on why we make these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable measures determined in accordance with GAAP, see today's news release and additional information on our website. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. I hope you had a chance to review our news release this morning with the details of our results. I am going to briefly review the quarter and I am going to start with a few headlines. First, we achieved outstanding top line growth with sales up 10.5% that includes about 6% organic growth above our sales objective led by very strong performance in Personal Care. Second, we delivered solid bottom-line results, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.11, up 8% from last year and in line with our previous guidance for earnings in the range of $1.09-$1.11 a share. This was despite absorbing cost inflation that was well above our previous expectation. Third, we continued to deploy cash in shareholder-friendly ways. Our fourth quarter share repurchases and dividend payments brought the full year total to more than $3.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to review some of the details of our results and I will start with the top line for each of our segments. In Personal Care, sales climbed 16% driven by strong volume growth of 10% and currency benefits of 5%. In North America, we delivered broad-based volume growth of 10 plus percent as our brands continue to benefit from innovation. Huggies posted double-digit volume growth in both diapers and baby-wipes fueled by premium-tier innovations. Volumes also rose at a double-digit rate in Child Care with good early benefits from our new GoodNites Sleep Boxers and Sleep Shorts. And, in Adult Care, volumes advanced 7% behind improvements to both Poise and Depends.</p>
          <p>Moving to Europe, fourth quarter sales volumes for Personal Care rose 3%. Growth was led by Huggies diapers and baby wipes and our PULL-UPS and DryNites childcare brands. In the developing and emerging markets, Personal Care sales jumped nearly 25%. That is the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth; sales volumes increased 14% with a number of strong performers. Highlights included high-teens volume growth in the fast-growing BRIC countries, double-digit volume growth in Latin America overall and also in South Korea. Our D&amp;E team executed very well throughout 2007 and we continue to be excited about our growth prospects in this part of the world.</p>
          <p>Turning to Consumer tissues, sales rose 7% including five points of benefit from currency. Improved product mix and higher net selling prices each contributed one point of growth. In North America, sales volumes fell 1%, we had solid growth in bathroom tissue and paper towels spurred by Scott Bath and Viva Towels. That growth was offset by lower Kleenex facial tissue volumes in conjunction with a very slow start to the cold and flu season this year. Net selling prices in North American consumer tissue were off about 2% in the quarter. That reflects heightened levels of competitive promotion activity in premium bathroom tissue and support for Kleenex in anticipation of a seasonal pick up in volumes that has not yet occurred. Now switching to Europe sales volumes gained 4%, that included strong Kleenex facial tissue performance along with higher sales of Andrex bathroom tissue in the UK.</p>
          <p>Moving to K-C Professional and Other, sales increased 8% including five points from currency. Higher volumes, net selling prices and improved mix each added one point of top line growth. We had another good quarter with key growth initiatives. Global wiper sales continued to expand with a fourth quarter increase of about 8%. At the same time, KCP's business building efforts helped drive a strong double-digit increase in sales across the developing and emerging markets. We also had a solid quarter in North America with good volume growth in our washroom business. European volumes were down, however, compared to strong results in the year-ago period.</p>
          <p>I will finish the review of the top line with Health Care segment sales being up 1% including two points of favorable currency. Product mix improved sales by 2% offset by lower net selling prices. Volumes were off 1% compared to the year-ago period. Although down versus prior years, sales volumes in our comparisons improved nicely from the past few quarters as we expected. In the fourth quarter, we started to anniversary much of the impact of our transition out of the latex glove category and sales of higher-margin nitrile gloves continue to grow. We also generated solid growth in medical devices led by our Ballard Airway Management offerings. With most of the latex exam glove sales comparisons now behind us, we are targeting solid volume growth in Health Care overall in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, I want to move to operating profit and cost savings. And, for this discussion I will refer to adjusted operating profit and margin which excludes certain charges detailed in this morning's news release . Fourth quarter operating profit rose 3 plus percent to $697 million with an operating margin of 14.6%. Profitability was impacted by significant cost inflation which totaled about $115 million in the quarter. Due to the run-up in oil prices, the inflationary impact on our bottom line was several cents per share worse than our fourth quarter plan. Despite the inflation, we are continuing to invest in strategic marketing. In the fourth quarter, spending was up $10 million supporting growth in areas such as Personal Care in the developing and emerging markets and Viva towels here in North America. Now, turning to cost savings, we delivered total savings of about $60 million in the fourth quarter. Our ongoing FORCE program generated savings of $30 million in the quarter despite higher spending levels at some of our facilities. At the same time, we realized $30 million of year on year benefit from our strategic cost reduction plan.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a brief look at fourth quarter segment operating margins. Personal Care continues to perform at a very high level with strong improvement versus year-ago fueled by our top line momentum. K-C Professional and Other margins fell primarily due to fiber cost increases. Because of the continued cost pressures, KCP will start to implement another price increase in the US later in the first quarter. Health Care margins were down reflecting lower sales volumes and higher costs. And, finally, in Consumer Tissue, as we have seen all year, margins continued to be impacted by pulp cost inflation. Fourth quarter profitability was also impacted by the higher trade promotion and weak cold and flu season in North America.</p>
          <p>Now, switching to taxes, there are plenty of details in the news release and in our presentation on the website so I won't repeat them here but the bottom line is that taxes overall were about a $0.02 benefit relative to our fourth quarter plan. That benefit was driven by benefits realized in the majority-own affiliates in Latin America partially offset by a net expense from our synthetic fuels initiative caused by the high price of oil throughout the quarter. Now, looking ahead based on what we know now, the first quarter 2008 adjusted effective tax rate should be in the 26 to 28% range.</p>
          <p>Now, shifting to cash flow on the balance sheet, cash provided by operations was $685 million compared to $813 million in the prior-year. Now, the year-on-year comparison was impacted by the $123 million special dividend we received in the fourth quarter of 2006 from KC de Mexico following the sale of their pulp and paper business.</p>
          <p>Looking at capital spending, we invested $213 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year total to $989 million. That was at the high end of our 900 to $1 billion target, consistent with what we communicated last quarter. Our full year spending was in line with our long-term target of 5 to 6% of sales. Regarding share repurchases, we bought 3.9 million shares of KMB stock at a cost of about $269 million during the quarter. For the year, we repurchased 41.2 million shares of our stock at a cost of $2.8 billion and we reduced our share count by 8% from the beginning of 2007. We also paid out more than $900 million in dividends this year. So, that wraps up the financial review. To recap the quarter, we achieved strong top line growth, we delivered solid bottom line results in line with our commitment and we continue to allocate cash in shareholder-friendly ways. Now, I will turn it over to Tom.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. I will comment briefly about our progress during 2007 and then I will go over the outlook for the coming year. Our headline for 2007 is that we again delivered on our commitments while strengthening our platform for future growth. For the year, our top line growth was better than we expected as we started the year and that improvement in top line really contributed to the solid improvement in adjusted operating profit and earnings per share and those were inline with our long-term targets. That is despite significantly higher inflation and it includes a stepped up level of marketing expend for the year. So, here are the numbers. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings were $4.25 per share, that is an increase of about 9% versus 2006 compared with our original growth in the 5 to 8% range that we targeted for the year. Meanwhile, inflation totaled about 350 million, that's more than double the top end of the range we anticipated at this time last year and then marketing spending for the year increased by about $50 million.</p>
          <p>We achieved all these results because our KC teams around the world continued to execute our Global Business Plan very well. They are delivering on the promise of our targeted growth strategies; they are driving costs out of the system; they are taking our capabilities in innovation, marketing and customer development to a much higher level. So, looking back on the year, there is much that I am encouraged about. I would like to highlight several accomplishments that we achieved this year in particular. First of all, our sales increased by more than 9% and organic sales growth was 6%, and that's above our long-term target. Sales volume were up a solid 4%, which is great. I am particularly encouraged by the strength of our Personal Care business, which posted a 12% increase in sales and a 140 basis point increase in operating profit margin. So, we have got strong brands, we had great innovation this year and that coupled with the double-digit growth we have achieved in developing and emerging markets is really fueling the performance of our Personal Care segment. In fact, for our D&amp;E markets overall, sales were up 18% for the year with operating profit improving at an even faster rate.</p>
          <p>So, today our operations in developing and emerging markets account for 29% of Kimberly-Clark's consolidated sales, that's up from 21% in 2003. So, really a significant move in the makeup of the Company, which is great. In our Consumer Tissue and KC Professional and Other segments, our sales rose about 8%. Consumer Tissue brands benefited from increased marketing investment and KC Professional brought a significant amount of innovation to market throughout the year. In Health Care, our sales declined as the result of our strategy to exit the latex exam glove business, but we delivered solid growth in higher margin medical devices all year long. And, as Mark mentioned, we are well positioned for improved top line performance in this business in 2008. We continued to do a great job on cost and our success in reducing costs stands out among the things that I would call as our significant accomplishments in 2007. Through our ongoing FORCE program and our strategic cost reduction plan, we saved a total of about $265 million in 2007, and that exceeds our original target for the year of savings in the 200 to $250 million range. And, with regard to the strategic cost reduction program specifically, we are now about 90% through the charges and we are in great shape on delivering our savings commitments. Delivering cost savings is hard work but it is vitally important work that makes us a leaner and stronger company.</p>
          <p>As an example, our savings efforts have contributed to another year of solid margin improvement in our European business, and that further built on the 130 basis point margin gain we posted in 2006. And, when you take into consideration that our cost savings also provide the ability to reinvest in innovation, brand building and customer development, the benefits of these cost savings programs really multiply and further enhance our competitive position. And, with regard to capabilities, we're also making very good strides in this area. We have raised our marketing investment levels and we have taken more innovative approaches that connect better with consumers in highly relevant ways. Importantly, our increase in marketing spending is leading to higher top line growth. On the customer development growth, I am very pleased with the recognition that we are receiving. We are making great progress against our vision of becoming an indispensable partner with our strategic customers and I am looking forward to even more progress going forward. As for innovation, I am very pleased by the contributions that new and improved products made to our top line growth in 2007. And, then finally, I am proud of the shareholder-friendly manner in which we have continued to deploy our cash. We've boosted our dividend by a healthy amount and continued to buy back KC's shares.</p>
          <p>In fact, the confidence in our Global Business Plan lead us to undertake a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase last year and that was funded by an according increase in our leverage. This move better aligns our capital structure with the strategies of our Global Business Plan. So, overall, I am pleased with our accomplishments in 2007. Still, because of the impact inflation has had on our Consumer Tissue and KC Professional margins, we are not satisfied with our current position in every area and recently announced price increases are among the steps that we are taking to improve revenue realization in those businesses. So, that is sort of a wrap up of 2007.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the outlook. The underlying strength of our business results throughout 2007 gives me confidence that we will continue to execute our Global Business Plan well in the coming year. We expect good top line growth in 2008 as we build on our momentum in Personal Care and developing and emerging markets and continue to successfully drive our other targeted growth initiatives. We will also continue to aggressively reduce costs through our FORCE and strategic cost reduction efforts. At the same time, we will invest more to strengthen key capabilities in innovation, marketing and customer development. And these investments will help us to continue to deliver sustainable growth into the future. And, then finally, we will remain focused on increasing cash flow and deploying it in shareholder-friendly ways.</p>
          <p>We are planning for a high single-digit dividend increase that will be effective in April and that's subject, of course, to approval by the Board. Plus, we are targeting to repurchase about 800 to $1 billion worth of KMB stock during the year subject to market conditions. So more details about our 2008 planning assumptions are included in our news release. All in all, we expect adjusted earnings in 2008 will be in the range of $4.45 to $4.60 per share, and that's up 5 to 8% from the $4.25 per share we earned in 2007. This growth is in line with our long-term objective despite expected cost inflation in 2008 that we believe will total at least $400 million. And we plan for another hefty increase in marketing spending. And I believe this range of guidance is prudent given the potential for variability in raw material input costs that we've seen.</p>
          <p>As for the first quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.05 to $1.08 per share and this reflects recent increases in pulp, polymer, resin and oil-based costs as well as the timing of previously announced price increases for key consumer brands in the US which are scheduled to be implemented in mid-February. Our earnings momentum will accelerate later in the year as those price increases are realized and our top line growth and 2008 cost savings initiatives gain further traction. So, to summarize, 2007 was a very good year with top and bottom line growth ahead of our original plan and we expect continued solid growth in 2008. We have been doing what we have said we would do and we intend to continue driving our targeted growth initiatives, further strengthening our brands, and continually improving our capabilities and cost-effectiveness. And, though cost inflation will likely remain a challenge for us in 2008, we are confident we can continue to overcome it. We believe we are investing in the right areas to build for the future and will remain focused on delivering sustainable growth in sales and earnings and deploying our cash in shareholder-friendly ways. Overall, we believe we have the right strategies in place to create value for our shareholders and that's the bottom line objective of all of our efforts. With that, thank you for your interest today and, now, we will be happy to begin to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the floor is now open for your questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj from Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Ali, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, a couple of question. One is, just wanted to get underneath mix a little bit. I am looking at two things. One is, it looks like across the board, mix was more or less positive except for Personal Care. And, at the same time, you've paired that up with &#x2013; developing and emerging markets, doing well for Personal Care but not as well for the other pieces of the business? Want to understand the interaction there and how we should think about how the margin mix affect the developing markets become bigger going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just kind of looking at the numbers, Ali, if you look at mix on Personal Care, mix and Other was basically flat. If you break it down, I do not see any big impact in developing and emerging markets on that. It is probably more of a rounding issue. As you look at our US business we had solid growth in PULL-UPS, which is a positive mix for us. The launch of Sleep Boxers and Sleep Shorts was positive and so I do not think you are seeing anything there that we are concerned about at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, I guess on the larger piece of business, say Consumer Tissue where volumes were down, on the one hand you can argue that, look, that's OK for my margins, but on the flip side I want to get underneath understanding the fixed leverage issue that you may be losing if the volume continues to go down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are never happy when our volumes go down. There are a couple of factors going on in Consumer Tissue; facial tissue is the big driver of it and you had a real weak cold and flu season. For us, if you looked at the symptomology reports that we track, they were down about 9% in the fourth quarter versus prior-year, so that is a factor. I think the other factor is with the desheeting that we did on Cottonelle, which will give us revenue increase but also the way we track thousands of sheets sold for our volume calculations so that shows up as a volume negative and a price positive as you roll that through the market. So, those are probably the two biggest factors in the volume drag in Consumer Tissue in the quarter. We had good volume growth on Scott tissue, good volume growth on Viva. Viva in particular is mixed enhancing for us, which is the right thing. I guess the good news for our consumers is they were generally healthier in the fourth quarter and there wasn't any big flu pandemics floating around and, so far even into the New Year, the cold and flu symptomology seems to be a little lower than usual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, now I wanted to ask you about that in particular, help us think about the amount of selling that you plan for the cold and flu season. What inventory levels are right now in retailers and how long will that take to bleed off, particularly given that there will be price increases, and that may be a difficult time? Can you just help us think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we saw, I don't think there's a big inventory issue. We have very high velocity category so retailers typically do not let inventory build. The fact that you saw our volume is down in facial tissue would say that basically our promotions did not generate the lift that we thought and so the retailers translated that into lower orders. So, I am not too concerned about it from a retail standpoint. Now, typically in the holiday season you are not going to see retailers loading a lot of our categories anyway even with the pricing coming in February. And most of the big manufacturers are pretty good at trying to manage the environment to try to prevent a lot of loading from occurring because it just messes up everybody's supply train.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just one last question if I could squeeze it in. Thinking about the kind of FORCE in FDR savings for next year, 200 to 250 million, how confident are you in getting those numbers and where are they coming from? It sounds like 90% of the charges are already done. Sounds like these are all plans are in progress. Is that a fair statement or are they new plans that you are thinking of going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'd say, as you break it into two buckets; the competitive improvement initiatives, there were still some facilities that were closed during the year in 2007 including one that was closed in December of 2007 and so we will have the full year benefit of those in 2008 so we feel very confident on those. I think that other thing we went through in 2007 was a lot of our business processing outsourcing activities and so really there was relatively little savings from all of that in '07 as we went through those changes and so '08 will be when those savings begin to show up. We have got those budgeted and planned for and we feel very confident about the competitive improvement initiatives. On the FORCE cost savings, which are our day in and day out activities, once again, we had a very solid year. The momentum on the fourth quarter was good and our teams have got targets set and plans in place to deliver on their FORCE expectations in 2008 as well. A lot of it is going to be productivity driven, it's going to be materials; substitution driven. In this high inflationary environment, it is tougher to get negotiated cost savings but we've got lots of opportunities to continue to drive FORCE across the program.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My first question was on the consumer trends in the US. You gave a pretty clear explanation around Cottonelle in the US so I know one question on everybody's mind is what is the consumer doing? Are we seeing any trade down or signs of less interest in trading up and consumer tissue is probably one of the categories that people worry about first. Can you just comment on that and also is there any change through the quarter? You know, sort of October versus December and then even first couple of weeks in January?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I was just looking at this morning earlier I was looking at private label shares across our categories for both the fourth quarter and the full year and the trends are pretty similar. If you look at private label shares in diapers they are down about a point, full-year and fourth quarter, quarter-to-quarter they're down a little bit sequentially, third quarter to fourth quarter. If you looked at training pants, you'd see pretty much the same phenomena. In fact, if you look across all of those categories, about the only category where private label shares are up a little bit and all of it was in the fourth quarter is facial tissue and they are still at a very low level there. So, we're not really seeing in the data yet any major changes in consumer behavior in our categories and I think the general feeling at this point is the consumer, for a little luxury, is willing to reach into their pocket and pay a bit more for a better quality product and that is exciting to us because it shows up in the things where we have launched premium variants &#x2013; our tier five diaper volume has gone well in the US this year. We've continued to do well with superpremium baby wipes offerings and so I think we have to continue to drive innovation and earn that consumers' trust and value into 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great and then in Europe, particularly in Personal Care, certainly in the Big Five markets, sort of a deceleration there, can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment, was it anything against consumer perspective, or who was running more effective promotions or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was on a conference call with our European team earlier this week and we were going through their fourth quarter and full-year outlook and there's a bit of a retail price war in the UK, some of the big retailers are seeing their same-store's comp sales decline and so they're spending more in key categories particularly diapers is the destination category. So, there was a lot of promotion activity in the UK in the fourth quarter in particular and so that drove pricing levels down. Some of it was funded by manufacturers, some of it may have been funded by retailers, it was difficult to tell but it certainly showed up in our pricing in the quarter in Personal Care in Europe. Here you have seen waves of that earlier in the year where there was some buy one, get one free activity in France on diapers. You saw some of that in Italy as well, but the UK in the fourth quarter was probably where the biggest competitive activity happened. That seems to have moderated a little bit as the quarter came to a close but that is something obviously we will be watching pretty closely in 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, great, let me, just one thing is to follow up on my, the first question about private label. Can you just comment on what you guys have seen or saw in prior recessions? Let's just make that daring assumption that we're in one, what have the trends actually been during recessions in terms of private label and your volume growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in most recent economic swings in the US, you do not see consumers changing patterns that much. The part of our business that would tend to be more exposed to the economy is KC Professional, but if you go back to 9/11, where the economy kind of dipped hard after 9/11 you saw things slow down in KC Professional. You did not see that much of a swing in any of our consumer categories. I am more bullish on the consumer. They look for value, they know how they're spending their money and I am more confident in the outlook than maybe what you read in the newspaper these days.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Could we just start with Mexico? I know KC de Mexico numbers didn't come out yet but it seems like the top line was a little soft this quarter. Is there sort of a carry on for the US going down there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark and I were just down in Mexico on Tuesday and met with, at one of the annual board meetings we go to down there. There were some tax law changes in the fourth quarter that a lot of the traditional trade really curtailed their buying at the end of December and so a lot of industries had kind of a weak December, which affected their fourth quarter comparison. But, they will be doing their earnings call tomorrow so you will be able to get more color from them on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, and then with respect to Kleenex sort of issue or softness, is this going to be endemic because if you look at the amount of people getting flu shots, is it sort of a one off this year or should we look for the incidence of cold and flu to come down as more and more people are proactive with this kind of thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do not think we have seen a trend yet. You see some years where there is a stronger cold and flu season and some years where there's not. So, I think this is one that so far seems to be little weaker than others, but it is not over yet either. I would say at this point we would continue to want to be there to care for our consumers in whatever their needs are. Thank you for noticing that Kleenex is softer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A couple of housekeeping things, growth margin assumptions for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think for us, the key for 2008 is going to be price realization. So, as we bring these price increases through the first quarter to the bottom line that's going to drive our gross margin performance. So, obviously, we are not satisfied where the gross margins are, in particular, in the tissue businesses and so that will be a key focus for us for 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, because if you look at your guidance you're kind of talking 5 to 7% sales with currency and so it seems there is not a whole lot of margin expansion and I imagine there is a lot of savings coming through the SG&amp;A line so it sounds like you are guiding the GM sort of flat to down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually we are expecting to continue to invest in strategic marketing in 2008 so you will see, you won't see as much leverage in the SG&amp;A line as you might be expecting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Bill, this is Mike, we would expect our gross margin to be up based on our planning assumptions and that operating profit growth would be pretty similar to sales growth, maybe a little higher than sales growth, with probably flat or up 10 basis points in operating margin.</p>

          <p>Absolutely. Scott Tissue had a very solid year in North America.

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Especially when you look at the volume growth in diapers in the US. I think this is the third straight quarter where you are up close to a double-digit range. I know that we can't see the biggest retailer and some of the club stores and the Nielsen numbers but can you just talk a little bit about how sustainable that is? I mean, obviously, we've got, we don't have population growth anywhere near that level and I just wonder, did you think it will moderate a bit this year? And do you think you can still maintain the share you have obviously gained?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we picked up share in the fourth quarter by our estimation it looks like it was up about a point or so. We had a solid year in diapers with a lot of innovation driven behind it and we look for that momentum to continue. Now, obviously, those growth rates are higher as you correctly say than the birth rate and as you are going into a price increase scenario, we're probably going to get a little more focused on realizing revenue than driving volume harder. But again, we are not in the business to give up share so we'd look to at least hold on to our share and hopefully build it a bit during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And now, in terms of a range of strategic marketing and increase, you said that would go up again. I know it was 50 in '07, can you give us kind of a ballpark range of how much you would target for that to go up in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're not going to give you probably as much specificity as you would like, but look for us to continue to invest a meaningful amount in growing our brands, given the amount of inflation that we've got and the range around that, that is probably the other variable that we are watching.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the last question is, as I look at the outlook, it just seems to me that on the revenue side you are anticipating this current round of price increases, especially in tissue, to go through. But it also equally looks like you're assuming that you're not looking for any fall-off in fiber costs. I do not think you are necessarily looking for any increases but it looks like you are keeping pulp sort of where it is at least, is that fair to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I look at it, I think pulp is being propped up, really, by the weak US dollar and I do not see that swinging back so our currency and our commodity cost assumptions we think are pretty consistent with each other and so when you look at where the dollar is today relative to the C-dollar, even at current pulp prices, the Canadian and Scandinavian producers are not making a ton of money and capacity is tight. I think maybe the wild card out there is if the economy does slow down a bit, does that cause commodity prices to pull back? You're seeing that a little bit in oil as we speak so I think that may be the only other variable that we have not really figured out how to model in this forecast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Year on year, of our 400 plus million of inflation expectations about half of that's going to be fiber. It's not just virgin but recycled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it is basically holding where we are at and just that year-over-year impact is a couple of hundred million bucks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We thought it would be going down by now but, obviously, we're both not, have not seen that yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'd did too but it has not happened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, last quick question is when you look at the UK, which I think people view as being maybe the weakest link in Europe right now, my question is, any evidence since they tend to be less private-label oriented in the Continent of people shifting to that area? And, then, secondly, you mentioned how the fourth quarter was pretty brutal in the retail channels among the retailers, do you see positive comparisons before the fourth quarter in the UK or is it going to take until then before you have a real chance, if you were just looking at that country alone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think your point on the UK economy is one that I think everybody is wondering about. Their housing market is probably a bit more overheated than even the US one has. But, we still see &#x2013; we do not see a big enough economic change there to shift purchasing patterns. So, we are continuing to expect to have a solid year on Huggies, a solid year on Andrex. We had a good year actually in the UK on facial issue in 2007, they had a stronger cold and flu season so they had a nice fourth quarter increase in facial tissue. So I think the retail environment will probably continue to be volatile and we are going to make sure we are prepared to compete in that environment. But, for us, it's one of our strongest markets in Europe and we plan to continue to build and grow in that environment.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jason Gere with Wachovia Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys. I just wanted to talk maybe a little bit more about Europe and certainly in North America we have heard about the price increases that have been coming through and sounds like maybe there could be more as the year progresses, but Europe obviously has been absent with price increases. It has also been a bit more promotional there too. Can you just talk a little bit about the ability at some point during the year to take pricing &#x2013; I will leave it at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, a lot of the pricing in the US is driven by commodity cost increases which in large part are driven by the weaker dollar. With the relatively strong euro and sterling during the year, European producers who are buying dollar-based commodities did not see anywhere near the level of inflation in their local currency. And so the need for price in some of those markets has not been as significant as you would have seen in the US market. Now, having said that, the fiber's run up enough that I think there will be some fiber price increases taken in '08. I know we're leading some on KC Professional and we will likely be taking some tissue prices in several markets during the year in 2008. But, at this point, I probably would not see a lot of price changes &#x2013; list price changes at least on the Personal Care side. You might see more of a bit of a pullback in promotional levels would be the most likely response there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then secondly, I think in your release you talked about the net for your outlook for '08 &#x2013; the net selling pricing would be 1 to 2%. Can you talk a little about, obviously, that is net of promotional spending, can you talk about what you are anticipating in 2008, especially in North America? And kind of going back to seeing a softer economy, and going into a recession, and taking pricing at the same time, kind of that slippery slope. And I was wondering, I know obviously you are stepping up on advertising side, but I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the promotional levels as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, a lot of the purpose of promotion is to get your innovation tried by your consumers. We are trying to make sure that we're competitive with the promotional environment but we're also targeting it to support a lot of our innovations, to help drive mix in appropriate ways and then to help line up with our customers and help them accomplish their objectives for the category. And so that's really the focal point for what we're trying to do with a lot of our promotional activity is to accomplish strategic objectives for each of our brands. So, from an economy standpoint, I do not see a huge shift or reaction to that just based on a slowdown in the economy. I think we will continue to execute the plan, continue to drive innovation and, again, I'm more bullish. I do not see a huge pullback here. If there's anything I think you are going to see a fairly short correction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, two small housekeeping questions. One, can you talk a little bit about the timing of the cost savings? Of the 200-250, I think in '07 it was a little bit more heavier in the second quarter. Is there any type of guidance you can give there? And, then, also in terms of the cost inflation expectations between the fiber costs, the polymer and, then, the energy. Can you talk, maybe relative to 2007 how you see that $400 million kind of broken down? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost saves, I do not think you'll see huge quarterly swings. It should be more consistent. Obviously, on the foreside, you tend to build a bit during the year but other than that, I think you will see a fairly consistent pattern. And, then, what was the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the cost inflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cost inflation? Yes, just in the first quarter you are going to see a pretty good hit from pulp. Pulp alone in the first quarter is probably going to be $50 million. We're assuming things are roughly staying at the level that they're at with pulp at this level, with oil in the low 90s. You are going to see that, at least, front end loaded and maybe moderating a bit in the back half.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, how are you? Can you talk about cap spending? I guess the '08 outlook calls for, basing your sales growth estimate, 4.4 to 4.9% of sales. Why is that lower and, I guess, why wouldn't that be the normal rate as opposed to a heavier restructuring here in '07 that ran more in line with what your long-term guidance has been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you look at our plan for the year, we set the target last June, where Mark and I looked at where we were coming out, what we expected sales to be, set a target that was really at the low end of our sales growth rate. Currency has kind of picked up in the back half of the year and so as a result our sales are higher in part because of currency. A lot of our capital spending is US dollar-based equipment that you're buying to put in various markets around the world. So, we're not inflating capital spending at that same rate. I think the other point would be, if you look at the past couple of years, we had a big tissue machine expansion in the US, we do not have that in 2008 and so it is going to pull back a little bit below our long-term averages as a result of that. I don't know Mark if you've got any other color you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's, I think that's right, you notice we're at the kind of the high end of our range this year and part of that was driven by &#x2013; some capacity we needed as we've exceeded our sales volumes. And so I think we're getting back to a little more normal spending pattern and you do not have that one big tissue machine investment to bump up the number.</p>

          <p>And I get that there's going to be a currency impact in '08 too, but I mean you are still comfortable that five to six call it 5.5 midpoint is what we should look for for '09 and '10 like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that those are the long-range assumptions. The thing that will spike it a little bit is when you have a tissue expansion in a major market that could pop it a bit in a particular year. Again, we're using that to focus on hitting our return on investment capital goals and so to do that we got to spend roughly around the rate of depreciation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it and then on working cap, do you think and will there be working cap improvement, particularly inventories next year? I know you've spent a lot of time talking about it but I'm wondering if you can update us a little bit on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I know, we're, that's one area that's really I am not happy about this year and neither is Mark. Mark's performance review is tomorrow so that is one of the things we will likely be talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for bringing it up, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, I'm going from this call into a call with our top one thousand leaders to talk about our 2008 objectives and working capital, particularly inventories, is going to play a key role in that. We've got more inventory than I'm comfortable with, we made a little bit of progress in the fourth quarter but not where we needed to be. That's obviously one that we didn't deliver on relative to our expectations this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Chris, the other thing we're going to try to do to drive a little more teeth into this is incorporating it into our finance and line managers' objectives all the way down through the organization and we're kind of going to expand the scope of FORCE a little bit to try to leverage our FORCE network around the world to more rapidly share best practices across the organization. I think the other systemic this is become, we are almost 90% through the competitive improvement initiatives investment phase, if you will, a lot of which had to do with impacts on our production facilities and there was an impact to our inventory levels. So, I think the combination of those things, I'd expect us to make a good bit of progress in '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just to be fair though, it sounds like, obviously the interruption of the supply chain improvements you guys have been making and your effort to improve service levels are only part of the inventory expansion we have seen? I mean, the rest I guess you have some systemic issues that you're trying to take it through? Is that a fair characterization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess I would say the systemic issue has been our volume has continually exceeded our expectations and so the teams tend to protect to the high-side inventory levels so we can provide customer service. As we better at forecasting, we will be able to carry a lot safety stock and manage the inventory better.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, and not to nitpick but one last item. When you guys say, Tom, commodity costs are going to be at least $400 million, does that mean that something greater than 400 is actually baked into your planning assumptions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the number is probably slightly higher than that, but it is in that ballpark.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, just going back to Consumer Tissue, when you talk about price only being part of the solution for the low margins, are there any specific other actions you can point to other than the promotional spending or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think as our Consumer Tissue team is looking at their P&amp;L, they're not happy with the way the margins are structured so it's going to be driving mix, it's going to make we're investing the marketing resources behind the right initiatives that are going to give us the right revenue for the productive capacity that we've got. As we drive things like improving our facial tissue volume, driving Cottonelle, driving Viva, in the North American markets, those are all mix enhancing opportunities for us. And, as you look at the rest of the world, it's been primarily a price realization game but they've also got an opportunity there to drive better mix. So, there are a number of initiatives that are underway to really help improve that but it is likely going to be in the revenue area somewhere, whether it is price, mix, reduce trade spend, all those factors will be things that we will be focusing on. We will continue to drive FORCE. We have got all of our competitive improvement plans underway. But this isn't one where we are probably going to cost-save our way to prosperity. We're going to have to do it by better marketing, better innovation, and driving the top line on that business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'm looking at Europe, your prices were actually up a little bit in the quarter, which is I think an improvement over the last few quarters. Anything specific there, and also just in terms of European tissue, any change of behavior with SVA pangea position? Do you see any changes in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think in Europe, I think we had a price increase in Italy late in the year, that probably is what showed up in the fourth quarter numbers but nothing significant other than that. And, then, in terms of the Procter SVA activity it's too early to tell, really, I think that things just came together in the fourth quarter and so I would not say we have seen really any fundamental changes in behavior by anybody in Europe lately.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and looking at the volume growth, particularly, in Personal Care and the extended products. I was just wondering if there's anything you can flag for your new product pipeline moving into 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Other than good momentum, coming out of 2007 was the tier-five diaper initiative, Sleep Boxers and Sleep Shorts. And you will expect to see continued innovation across our Personal Care category in 2008.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry to belabor the point but just going back to pulp. Your forecast says 885 for MDSK is actually a little bit higher than current prices. Is it safe to assume that you are assuming a little bit of further price increases in the near-term but then maybe some relief later in the year?</p>

          <p>Pretty good, how are you?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good thanks. Just on the pricing. You have these price increases that are coming on February 1st, I just wanted to know if you're hearing anything different from the retailers as you go about implementing those price increases than what you've heard over the last couple of years, number one. And, then, number two, in light of the consumer being weaker, are you expecting that these price increases will have any more of a volume impact this go-around than they did over the last couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, look at the pricing on bathroom tissue and diapers, which are really kind of the big categories, we did not take any price yet on facial tissue, which has typically been the most sensitive category from a volume standpoint. So, we won't have that volume risk on facial at this point in time. And from a bath tissue standpoint it looks like all of the players have basically lined up. Some of the retail price changes are already starting to happen in the marketplace, even ahead of the date which is good, it looks like some of the promotional prices that are being scheduled for the first quarter are starting to move up. At least in our businesses. So far, so good on the Tissue side. On the Personal Care side, again, the two major players in diapers have moved up. Those will happen on February 1st. Luv's is not going up and private label is probably going to be a mixed bag. I think no one really knows yet what's going to happen on private label. We will have to wait and see what happens in the retail marketplace. Obviously with the Covidien/First Quality deal you have some new ownership there and we will just have to wait and see what happens on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, I guess, just from a consumer standpoint, are you sensing that she's going to start to, you know, basically deload her pantry in light of what is going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These price increases are not of a size that are going to cause you to change a lot of behavior. You're talking 5, 6% price increases and so and then if you look at that kind of pricing has happened across lots of categories in the last year. These are a couple of categories that have not had much price and you've seen this kind of pricing in toothpaste and shampoo and deodorants and other categories and you have not seen much shift in consumer purchasing behavior. They buy basically the same products that meet the needs of their family and we would expect to see that continue in these categories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I guess the basis of my question was just that this year may be different than last year in terms of the health of the consumer and the amount of money that they have to spend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I may be more bullish. As you look at overall employment levels and household formation and some of the fundamental economics, you are still seeing those as relatively strong. Again, you may have a pullback lead by housing and some of the issues in the financial sector but I do not think if you look at the underlying strength of the economy I am more bullish than what seems to be written in the newspaper these days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and last but not least, given the $400 million commodity number, do you anticipate having to take more pricing above and beyond the February 1 price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point in time, as you look around the world, there will be other price increases among others of our businesses but for the big US businesses that you're talking about, that is the primary price increase that we have in our plan for the year. So, obviously we will have to wait and see what happens in the marketplace.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, I just have one quick question given everyone has asked a lot of questions already. D&amp;A for next year or for 2008, can you walk us through what your assumptions are there? Obviously, a big drop off this year, is there any benefit for the operating margin from lower D&amp;A as we look out to 2008? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, John, the ongoing depreciation rate should be pretty similar, it has been running around 180, $190 million a quarter and that will continue. There is extra depreciation in the numbers this year above what we will have next year related to our restructuring costs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I guess I would like to tie together some of the questions that have been asked on the macro level. If there is an economic slowdown that results in demand destruction, even if very modest and dollar weakness notwithstanding, raw material costs start to decline, what do you imagine or plan for the result to be at the retail level? Do you think that the competitors will keep all their list prices the same and just promote a little bit more to stimulate demand or would you think that from past experience retailers would want some of the prices to be rolled back to capture some of the margin that might come from lower costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Connie, I going to go even more macro for you. I would say, in any kind of an economy, consumers still need to use bathroom tissue and diapers every day. And so, I do not see fundamental shifts in the demand level for our products. Now, will they decide if the economy gets really bad, will they start to shift to other categories? I'd say if you at really big economic shocks that have happened around the world; if you go back and look at the Asian currency crisis and what happened in markets like Korea and Thailand or you look at Argentina when you had a 3 for 1 devaluation and you really destroyed the purchasing power of the middle class, then you would see big shifts in category consumption. Categories that were much more discretionary would suddenly disappear. But, in the kind of swing that I think is possible or likely in the US economy, I do not see any major changes in consumer purchasing patterns. You look at how much the low income consumer has gotten squeezed with higher gasoline costs in the last year, and you really have not seen in our categories, any kind of a shift in private label share or, in fact, you've actually seen the superpremium segments of the categories growing. So, could you see a little bit slower growth in superpremium categories? Maybe. But, it's up to us to continue to drive innovation and make those suprepremium categories really worth the value that they're delivering to the consumer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. Are you a subscriber to the notion that with new capacity likely to add 30% to the worldwide supply of resin, that resin costs will moderate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the end the question is going to come down to what actually happens to refining margin. When oil was up in the low 90s and some polymers hadn't moved, the refining margin was really getting squeezed and so either oil had to come down or some of those polymer rates went up and we saw some of that in the fourth quarter and was one of the reasons why our inflation number was a little higher than we expected heading into the quarter. So that is sort of what we're watching. Obviously, the capacity balance in the molymers and some of the polymers will have an impact in the short term, but over the long term, eventually it is going to line up with oil price to some extent.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Tom, first question, a couple of quick ones. You took a lot of care in putting in your marketing organization and getting in a CMO. Do you think you are at the point now where if costs came down that you would be able to handle a lot more programs that you've ramped up or will it take more time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say we're still building out Tony's organization so he is continuing to fill roles. Most of the actual marketing work gets done in our business units and Tony and his team are really helping share ideas back and forth, helping drive best practices, helping build capability, and really help leverage the talent that we have throughout the organization to take it to another level. And so I think for us it is more about how do we increase the efficiency and the effectiveness of our marketing. And we are seeing that as ideas get shared around the world as we've got a consistent view of our brands around the world. And we're beginning to measure and develop metrics that we can find out what works and why and share those practices with a lot more confidence. Once again, it is how you make the investments that we are making more effective. We're probably a little bit behind on our long-range goal of increasing marketing spend by 100 basis points and we may not get to that ultimate level of spend, but we are actually on track to spend the dollar amounts that we thought that we would spend and I think the marketing organization that we have got in place will help us get more value from that. Quite honestly our top line growth has been exceeding our expectations even with the modest increase in marketing that we have had and I think part of that has been because we have gotten more efficiency from our marketing spend than we had thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's the other, you just sort of segued into my other question there Tom. I am not suggesting you take up your top line targets but if you're getting 6% now and your organization is just starting on the marketing initiatives and Personal Care is going great and it seems you're gaining some share there. When we think about a 3 to 5% rate, what really can get worse here than what you're seeing right now? It looks like things are actually improving. What should we be worried about that would take those numbers down lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we look at setting that 3 to 5% rate it was done thoughtfully, looking at what the categories were doing and recognizing that we have tough competitors that do a great job as well, that are very good marketers around the world. And for us to assume we are going to take share in every category in every market every year to get to above that range of category growth is probably unrealistic. So I still think the 3 to 5 is a realistic long-term target. If we see sustained performance above that, obviously, we'll revisit that over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, just one more thing, to be fair to Mark, I mean his performance review, what would you share with investors about probably the best job that we have seen on the cost side? What should we be looking at and saying, wow, this is going well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Mark's teams really are heavily involved in the FORCE initiative and supporting that and they had a great year this year. So FORCE cost savings were solid. We thought actually with all the competitive improvement initiatives and a lot of our team supporting that in 2007 that we would not see as much FORCE activity and we actually exceeded our expectations there. I think the other thing that happened behind the scenes is all of the business process outsourcing work was primarily in a lot of Mark's organization and that happened at a very high level without any significant business disruption. And, now we're poised to start to get some of the benefits from that in 2008, so.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think the key is that it really is an integrated effort with the business teams. They're doing all the work and the heavy lifting. Our organization is just a catalyst to help pull stuff together but I think, given the inflationary pressures, we have got the businesses that have really done a terrific job managing costs and that is the way it ought to work. That is the way we will translate that to working capital next year.</p>

          <p>Hey Mark, is it fair, do you still have hundreds, thousands of cost reduction initiatives in the pipeline? Or, am I exaggerating?</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Filippe Goossens with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, I was a little bit late dialing in because I was on another earnings call but I hope that my questions will not be repetitive. Tom, Lauren asked about the state of the US consumer. If I can just bring it a little bit more global the question. What I have been talking a lot with investors about over the last few weeks is the whole topic about, are we going to see global decoupling or the emerging markets which really have been a great engine for the world economy as well as for yourself? Are they going to start slowing down as well? Can you perhaps give your point of view in terms of whether you see emerging markets and particularly the BRICs for you to continue to significantly outperform your overall company average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I guess I would say that our developing emerging markets was consistent all year long and, if anything, seem to be accelerating at the end of the year. My own personal view for the global economy is that the global economy is very much more diversified, stronger network than it ever has been and so it is not just relying on the US economy to provide growth for all of the emerging economies. The consumer market in India, the consumer market in China, the consumer market in Brazil, are healthy and growing in their own right as those consumers want improved products and are willing to spend more of their income to deliver those kinds of improved products. I think actually having a slowdown in the US, if that occurs, will have less of an impact than it would have had historically because of the strength in growth in those other markets. Again, as we look at developing and emerging markets we still see tons of opportunity. And, we are more excited than ever about markets like Russia, India and China. That is not to say that there can't be bumps in the road, there always will be but even when I look at a market like Latin America where we've been for years and you could look at all of the half empty parts of the glass down there and talk about political issues or other things and yet we had a terrific year, really, across the board in Central and South America and delivered huge growth despite other things that are happening, politically, down there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then, moving on Tom to commodity prices. Obviously, there are two parts to the equation in terms of bringing prices down. On one side, obviously, supply, we have spoken about that already on the call. The other one is demand and then kind of connecting that with my first question. Let's say that there were to be a material slowdown in the global economy therefore commodity prices supposedly are going to come down. That margin benefit that you would generate to commodity prices coming down, would you not lose that benefit actually by your top line growth engine in emerging markets slowing down or net net you still think it will be positive to your margin going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we are focused on growing the bottom line faster than the top line in emerging markets while we are increasing our strategic marketing spending in those markets and that's been a formula that's worked for us. I think that if there is a slowdown a bit in economies you could well see a pullback in commodity prices then you wind up with is maybe a little bit less price realization overall than we're planning but, on the other hand, we think if you look at the last three years, we started out the year with an inflation assumption that wound up being nowhere near where it actually turned out. We think we have got a conservative set of assumptions here, but as we have also seen and how volatile markets can be, oil can move from $70 to $90 a barrel in what seems like a heartbeat. We will have to watch and see how this plays out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then, question going back to your Analyst Day last year in New York. Is it still pretty much your anticipation that for the near term we should not expect any type of strategic transaction that would transform the portfolio towards, let's say, higher margins by buying businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of a transforming M&amp;A, that is not part of our Global Business Plan. Would we look at M&amp;A in areas that are of strategic interest to us as tuck-ins and something in health care that would help us broaden that portfolio or something in a part of KC Professional? There are certainly things that we would take a look at there but nothing that I would consider to be a transforming acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then kind of connection with Mexico there was a question earlier as well, now, if I recall correctly, you have bought in some of the shares that you did not already own in one of your subsidiaries in Brazil. Is there any reason to believe for us that KC Mexico would not be another type of opportunity where you would say we ought to bring that in-house or are you pretty much happy with the current set up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am very happy with the current structure. That is a little different in that in Brazil we had a partner that wanted to sell their stake. KC de Mexico is a public company where 52% of the shares are held by public investors and we own the balance. We've got a great company there with a terrific franchise and great market shares in that market. It has been a great partnership and a great investment for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then, two more questions if I may. On the marketing spent, the increase last year and what you're budgeting for '08. Can you give us a rough feel for what percentage is in the US versus emerging markets, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We may have to follow up and give you the details on that unless you have those handy, Mike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is that the marketing spending in developing and emerging markets continue to grow at a faster rate than sales across those markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then my final question perhaps for Tom again. We talked a bit about pricing initiatives both on this call as well as on the last call. Any initial read or additional read in terms of how &#x2013; not consumers might be reacting to this, but retailers. If I recall correctly, on the last earnings call for Albertsons, I think it was actually the first CEO, who that mentioned that he had seen some trading down so just kind of additional comments would be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we have not seen that yet but these prices have not gone into effect yet at this stage. And, again, the amounts we're talking about, I don't think you're going to see a huge sticker shock from a consumer standpoint. Our expectation is that this is going to be pretty consistent with what consumers are seeing across a lot of categories and with the weaker US dollar you're going to see more risk of more inflation, particularly in the first half of '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes Lauren Lieberman with Lehman Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, sorry, I just had a very quick follow-up. Tom, you made comments about potentially there being some pricing in consumer tissue later this year in Europe. I just want to know if that is built into the planning assumptions now or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends, in Europe you take price at different times. In some markets, you tend to take it earlier in the year and some markets you tend to take it late in the year like in '07 we wound up with a price increase in Italy that happened late in the year. So, if you're going to take price in that market it will probably happen later in the year. Some of it depends on when your agreements with customers open up and when you are able to go in and take price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But for our modeling assumptions is it safe to really to think about, to be I guess, more conservative, just think about what we know in terms of KC Professional and what we know of in terms of the US pricing? Anything else would be kind of gravy if you end up able to do it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that is fair. We gave you kind of overall price assumptions for the year which include what we know and expect to realize which I think are reasonable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, sorry, also had a quick follow-up. Tom, you mentioned the ad spend pace and that you guys are progressing toward or you're on track to do in dollar amounts the ad spend increase that you want. And I just wanted to go back and reconcile that. So, I think in '05 you guys said that you were going to increase ad spending by $200 million. Is that right? Is that off of the '04 base of $421 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were basically targeting about 100 basis point increase as a percent of sales in strategic A&amp;P which I think would have &#x2013; when you ultimately get to the sales level that we would have gotten to by 2010 that would have translated into a couple of hundred million dollars. I think what we're finding is our sales are actually ahead of expectations, in part due to currency, but in part due to stronger volume growth and better mix than we would have expected the Global Business Plan. We're actually on track. We're probably a little bit behind for 2007 but as we look at where we're going in '08 and beyond we are on track to getting close to that same dollar amount of spending but we won't get to the 100 basis point increase I don't think at our current trajectory. On the other hand we are getting better top line volume than we expected with the marketing spend levels that we've got so I feel good about the investment levels we have been able to put into the marketing despite the cost increases we've had.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, again, when you refer to that dollar number &#x2013; that is, I agree with you, that translated to about $200 million. So, off of the '04 base that implies you are on pace to getting near or are you still planning getting near $620+ million by '09. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's fair. Mike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is even more than that because your sales go up too. So, the 200 million is an incremental number and so you get the debt spending plus the spending that goes along with the rise in sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In other words, assuming you add margin flat, that 225 is an incremental on top of the margin? Assuming a flat margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Mike. Well, once again, we had a solid year in 2007. We delivered on all of our commitments, again, under our Global Business Plan and we are poised to continue to deliver in 2008. Thank you again for your support.</p>
