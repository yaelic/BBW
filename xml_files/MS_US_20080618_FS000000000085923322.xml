      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you for joining us.  What I'm going to review with you today will be consistent with what we have been saying about business conditions in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Strong client flows characterized the first quarter.  Second quarter flows were very severely disrupted by the Bear Stearns situation and the fallout of the forced liquidation of hedge funds and financial institutions continuing to raise capital and recognize further write-downs an ongoing theme.  Following the events in March that froze the markets, client activity improved but remained subdued throughout the remainder of the quarter and had a significant impact on revenues in our institutional securities business.</p>
          <p>There were few attractive risk adjusted opportunities and we continued to be prudent in our use of capital.  The strength and health of our balance sheet will be evident when we disclose our tier 1 ratio in the 10-Q.  While we are still finalizing the numbers, we expect our tier 1 ratio will be between 11.5 and 12%.</p>
          <p>The themes that we laid out last quarter including market deleveraging and de-risking continue.  We further reduced our leverage to 25.1 times, adjusted leverage to 14.1 times and increased our period-end liquidity to $169 billion and feel we have navigated through this difficult quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me begin with an overview of our firm wide results outlined on pages 1 and 2 of our financial supplement.  We generated net income of $1 billion, diluted earnings per share of 95 cents and a return on equity of 12%.  These results included the divestiture of our Spanish onshore mass affluent wealth management business reported in Global Wealth Management which affected profit before tax by $698 million, an EPS, earnings per share, of 43 cents.</p>
          <p>We also completed a partial sale of our investment of MSCI through a secondary offering that had an additional impact on our profit before tax 732 million and a 45 cent impact on earnings per share.  Results also included severance charges related to our recent reduction in force that reduced EPS by 15 cents.</p>
          <p>While extremely challenging markets had a broad impact, several franchise businesses performed well including prime brokerage, cash equity trading and foreign exchange.  Our Global Wealth Management business contributed strong results due to the momentum we have established with increasingly productive brokers and the fact that retail investors remain relatively engaged.  Firm wide net revenues were $6.5 billion. Our PBT [Profit Before Tax] margin was 22%.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses were 5.1 billion, down 17% from the first quarter driven by lower compensation that included severance expenses of approximately $245 million.</p>
          <p>On page 3 of the financial supplement, you can see that total global head count decreased by 4% from the year end reflecting our continued efforts to resize certain businesses in this difficult operating environment.  The compensation to net revenue ratio was 46% or 54% excluding the severance and the impact from the gains.  Our current estimate of compensation to net revenue ratio for the next two quarters would be closer to first quarter of '08 excluding severance charges, or 47%.  This is the ratio you should model going forward.</p>
          <p>Non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion.  Our non-comp levels were consistent with prior periods as we are using operating efficiencies to fund investments in technology and geographic expansion to enhance our client servicing capabilities.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the businesses.  Starting with Institutional Securities detailed on page 5 of the supplement, these results were significantly affected by the ongoing market challenges and the corresponding decrease in client activity that we experienced this quarter.  Net revenues of $3.6 billion were 42% lower than the first quarter and included 744 million from the secondary offering of MSCI that you will see in other revenues in the Institutional Securities income statement.  Excluding the gain, revenues decreased 54%.  Non-interest expense of 2.9 billion decreased 28% from the first quarter of '08.  Excluding the severance charges in both quarters, these expenses decreased 31% from the first quarter, primarily driven by lower compensation as a result of lower revenues.  Pre-tax income was 679 million with an ROE of 9%.</p>
          <p>Revenues in Investment Banking decreased 11% from the first quarter although our overall pipelines continue to be healthy with corporates maintaining high levels of strategic dialogue.  This quarter, we participated in several high-profile deals including Time Warner Cable's $42 billion separation transaction, Northwest Airlines announced merger with Delta, GE Capital's $8.5 billion debt offering, New World Resources' $2.5 billion IPO and CIT Group's 1.5 billion concurrent common and convertible offering.</p>
          <p>Looking at page 6 of the supplement, Investment Banking revenues were 875 million.  Advisory revenues were $367 million, a 17% decrease from the first quarter in line with completed industry volumes.  Underwriting revenues decreased 5% to 508 million as higher equity underwriting revenues were offset by lower revenues in fixed income underwriting.  Sequentially equity underwriting revenues of 298 million were up 14% driven by improved activity levels from the first quarter of '08.  Fixed income underwriting decreased 24% to 210 million reflecting lower revenues from loans and securitized products which offset strong results in bond issuance, particularly investment grade.</p>
          <p>Page 6 of the supplement shows total sales and trading revenues of $2 billion down 61% from the strong results of last quarter.  Last quarter, our trading businesses produced exceptional results on the back of our client franchise.  Since then, client activity, illiquid credit markets and poor positioning drove trading revenue significantly lower particularly in fixed income.</p>
          <p>Total fixed income sales and trading revenues were 414, 4-1-4 million, down 85% from the first quarter of '08 on lower revenues across all major categories as the difficult credit environment continued to weigh on the corporate credit and mortgage businesses.  While volumes in interest rate and currency businesses remain strong, unfavorable rates positioning drove revenues lower.  Interest rate, credit and currency trading revenues combined were down 63% from the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Credit trading generated a loss.  In addition to overall subdued customer activity levels, our results included losses of $390 million, which I'll refer to again later from monoline exposures.  The credit trading loss also included $120 million negative adjustment to marks previously taken in our London traders' book that did not comply with firm policies.  Let me add here that our valuation review group and business unit controllers, in the course of a valuation, review became aware of some anomalies in marks and reacted accordingly.</p>
          <p>We continue to work out our mortgage proprietary trading business and significantly reduced losses versus last quarter.  Our commodities business declined 67% from last quarter on poor positioning in North American electricity.  Firm issued structured notes have little impact on this quarter's fixed income results.  Equities sales and trading revenue of 2.1 billion were 39% lower than last quarter's record results as the market environment led to significantly lower derivatives and proprietary trading revenues which offset continued strength in prime brokerage and cash trading.</p>
          <p>Despite the severe drop in volumes in the credit markets, global equity volumes remained strong resulting in slightly higher cash equity revenues.  Derivative revenues were 25% lower than the first quarter as volatility levels decreased creating fewer trading opportunities.  Prime brokerage business produced strong revenues with average customer balances up slightly from last quarter.  The quarter's equity results also benefited from a $19 million gain on firm issued structured notes.</p>
          <p>Let me now update you on our progress in managing down our exposures in those areas most affected by the credit cycle downturn that began last summer.  At that time, our exposures were at peak levels in areas that concerned us most, namely leveraged lending, commercial real estate and residual subprime.  Today and in our 10-Q, we will be disclosing broader gross exposure information to help you understand the financial impact of the marks we have taken in commercial mortgage backed and monolines.</p>
          <p>Our leveraged acquisition portfolio is now down to $12.7 billion from a peak of $35 billion in the third quarter.  This number is embedded in the non-investment grade loans and commitments of 22.3 billion on page 7 of the supplement.  Some liquidity did return here to the marketplace this quarter.  We had net positive market movements of 430 million on non-investment grade loans and commitments which were offset by losses on hedges of 910 million resulting in net losses of $496 million.  These losses were primarily in the leveraged acquisition portfolio.  These are the major components of the 590 million loss reported in other sales and trading.</p>
          <p>Last year, we anticipated CMBS [Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities] commercial whole loan issues early and repositioned our portfolio across regions with a greater proportion of the reduction in net exposure coming out of the U.S.  We have provided details of our gross and net exposure to CMBS and commercial whole loans on page 17 of our financial supplement.  We continue to get observable market prices from executed trades and as you can see in the supplement, we reduced our net exposure to $6.4 billion from 11.6 billion and our gross exposure to 22.1 from 23.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Please note that included in the gross exposure are other secured financings that we do not consider to be at risk assets.  Total losses this quarter here were $100 million.</p>
          <p>On page 16 of the supplement, we reduced our total ABS CDO [Assed Backed Security Collateralized Debt Obligation] subprime net exposure this quarter to $300 million from 1.8 billion.  As stated earlier, we optimized our subprime portfolio with exposure primarily in higher quality vintages, which we are managing more efficiently.  Our hedges have performed well producing a $300 million gain and we reduced our super senior mezzanine exposure by 1.2 billion from last quarter through dispositions and write-downs.</p>
          <p>In other mortgage related exposures including Alt-A, RMBS [Residential Mortgage Backed Security] bonds and European mortgage loans we reduced our net exposure to 6.7 billion from 8.7 billion.  Our gross exposure was 12.3 billion at quarter end, down from 14.5 billion last quarter.  Within the 6.7 billion, there was 2.4 billion in Alt-A exposure down from 4.6 billion last quarter through executed trades and corresponding marks calibrated to those trades.  Total write-downs were 300 million and are the main driver of our losses in mortgage proprietary trading.</p>
          <p>RMBS bonds and European mortgage loans make up the remaining net exposure in the non-subprime residential category were flat to last quarter and did not include any significant net losses or write-downs.  Our aggregate direct exposure to monolines is down 1.9 billion to 2.8 billion.  Our net exposure includes $1 billion of ABS wrapped bonds held by our subsidiary banks, 1.3 billion of insured municipal bond securities and net counterparty exposure to monolines of $500 million which represents gross exposure of $3.6 billion net of hedges and cumulative credit valuation adjustments of $900 million.  As I mentioned our losses related to monolines were $390 million this quarter which includes an increase in credit valuation adjustment of $250 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital liquidity, we are still very focused on maintaining a strong capital position, high levels of liquidity, and prudent leverage ratios.  Page 4 of the supplement highlights our current capital position.  We continue to be well capitalized with excess capital.  As I mentioned before, while we're still finalizing the numbers, we expect our tier 1 ratio will be between 11.5 and 12% in our 10-Q.  This ratio represents the overall strength of our balance sheet.  We are still placing a significant emphasis on our capital liquidity to ensure we have enough dry powder to continue investing in our businesses and to take advantage of attractive risk-adjusted opportunities.</p>
          <p>We further strengthened our liquidity position and built on the momentum of the previous few quarters.  We ended the quarter with total liquidity of $169 billion, up $46 billion from the prior quarter end.  Let me take you through the components.  During the quarter, we accessed the Capital Markets to raise 14.3 billion in unsecured parent company debt bringing our year-to-date public long-term debt issuance activity to $22.9 billion.  This amount, together with incremental non-public issuance activity, exceeds our scheduled maturities for 2008.  We continue to actually manage down positions requiring cash funding and reallocate to balance sheet to liquid assets with significant two-way customer flows and lastly with higher levels in our liquidity reserve, we reduced our commercial paper outstanding to 12.3 billion for this quarter end a reduction of roughly $5 billion from the first quarter and down from a peak of $28 billion.</p>
          <p>Total liquidity which we have added to our financial supplements on page 3 includes liquidity at the parent company, bank and non-bank subsidiary levels.  Total liquidity averaged $135 billion in the quarter, up 11% from the record levels of 122 billion in the first quarter.  Parent company liquidity was $80 billion at quarter end, and averaged 74 billion, up from 71 billion average in the first quarter.  Bank and non-bank subsidiary liquidity position was $89 billion at quarter end and averaged 61 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Last quarter, I told you that the weighted average maturity of our fixed income repo book turning to secured financing was 34 days, which is a relatively long duration.  Recently that book's average repo maturity has been around 48 days.  The more comprehensive metric that we plan to disclose for you in our 10-Q filings going forward is the weighted average maturity across all asset classes in our repo and stock lending books.  The weighted average maturity of these books has recently been about 45 days.  We continue to work to extend the term of this book as part of our overall liquidity planning and financing capabilities.</p>
          <p>We are managing our balance sheet prudently and further reduced the total and adjusted assets during the quarter.  Our discipline in maintaining an appropriately sized balance sheet in today's environment along with our strong capital position has brought our total leverage ratio down to 25.1 times from 27.4 and our adjusted leverage ratio down to 14.1 from 16 times.  This combination of our strong capital, high liquidity and reduced leverage positions us to take advantage of market opportunities.</p>
          <p>As regard to Value at Risk [VaR], total average trading and non-trading VaR increased to 112 million from 103 million last quarter.  Average trading value at risk was up slightly to 99 million from 97.  Moderate increases in VaR were driven primarily by higher realized market volatilities that more than offset reductions in key trading risks.  In addition, the increase in aggregate trading and non-trading VaR was also driven by the issuance of long-term debt referred to earlier used to fund the increase in the company's total capital.</p>
          <p>In our 10-Q filing, in addition to our tier 1 ratio, we will be reporting risk weighted assets attributable to market credit and operational risk.  This will provide you an additional tool to evaluate our risk taking each period.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 8 of the supplement and our Global Wealth Management business, as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we divested our Spanish onshore mass affluent wealth management business during the quarter and our results reflect the impact of that transaction.  The net gain on the sale after accounting for related expenses was $698 million of PBT.  Excluding this gain, PBT for the quarter was $291 million and the PBT margin was 17%.  Revenues excluding the divestiture increased 6% sequentially, reflecting a significant amount of new issue activities that increased Investment Banking revenues by 46% primarily in fixed income underwriting.</p>
          <p>Fees and commissions declined slightly from last quarter on lower market levels and client activity.  The increase in principal transaction revenues reflects stronger volumes primarily in municipals and corporate equities.  Excluding certain expenses related to divestiture, non-interest expenses increased 4% from last quarter.  The increase was primarily driven by higher business development expenses and an increase in legal reserves.  Excluding the divestiture, ROE for the business was 51%.</p>
          <p>On page 9, you can see the productivity metrics: net new assets of $13.3 billion represent our ninth consecutive quarter of positive client inflows and our second highest ever.  Assets in the $1 million plus household segment increased 4% from last quarter to 511 billion and representing 72% of our total client asset base.  Total client assets increased 2% from last quarter to $739 billion, largely reflecting market levels and net new assets an average FA production excluding the divestiture increased to $810,000 as a result of increased revenues.  Average assets per FA $89 million increased also 5% compared to last quarter reflective of asset levels in the quarter and if you exclude the reduction in brokers from the divestiture, FA head count increased slightly compared to the first quarter of '08 while bank deposits grew to 34.3 billion of client assets in cash due to the volatile markets.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to Asset Management which continued to be negatively impacted by the turmoil in the markets.  On page 10 of the supplement our Asset Management business reported a pre-tax loss of $227 million.  Revenues were down 10% sequentially, primarily reflecting investment losses in merchant banking, partially offset by higher revenues in our core business.  Merchant banking posted losses on principal investments of $212 million primarily driven by markdowns in real estate.</p>
          <p>$150 million of these markdowns relate to the write-down of one major investment that was acquired in 2007 as part of the building of a future real estate fund.  Crescent, a REIT, includes high quality office buildings and investments in resorts and residential developments located in select high growth markets across the United States.  Due to factors including changes in market conditions, the timing, valuation and size of the investment, we will not include Crescent in the investor fund.  As a result, $4.6 billion of assets have been consolidated onto our balance sheets. We will continue to evaluate these assets and position them for sale as opportunities arise.</p>
          <p>Core results include lower management and administration fees primarily reflecting lower performance fees in our alternatives business and lower trading losses.  The trading results include losses of approximately $86 million related to marking securities issued by Structured Investment Vehicles held on balance sheet by Asset Management.  The total Structured Investment Vehicle or SIV exposure in our money fund as of quarter end was $1.3 billion which are all bank sponsored, down from 3.6 billion at the end of last quarter.  This decrease came from maturities, sales and pay-downs.  The current balance is approximately 1 billion, but will drop below $600 million by the end of June.</p>
          <p>The value of assets relating to SIVs on our balance sheet is approximately 500 million at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expense of $715 million increased slightly from the first quarter driven by higher compensation, partially offset by lower non-compensation expenses.  These results contrast sharply from the strong results we delivered last year. There has been a significant fall-off in this business and it continues to be a difficult environment particularly for real estate.  The primary driver of the volatility in revenue is negative marks for the real estate portfolio compared to substantial gains in the prior year and to a lesser extent the SIV related marks for our proprietary positions.  We continue to see investor interest in real estate because of our strong track record and ability to take advantage of the distressed market.</p>
          <p>Turning to pages 11, 12 and 13 of the supplement, you can see the assets under management and asset flow data.  This quarter we revised our disclosure to provide more transparency around assets and flows by production channel including a break down of our merchant banking business.</p>
          <p>Total assets under management increased 5% to a record $605 billion.  We generated $15.5 billion in flows, our seventh consecutive quarter of positive flows.  From a product perspective, we now show asset flows in both the core and merchant banking business.  There were $13.8 billion of inflows into core with strong inflows to fixed income and alternative products and we had outflows from equity.  Core inflows were driven by primarily by institutional money markets.</p>
          <p>Flows into merchant banking products remained positive while we recorded 1.7 billion in asset flows in the quarter.  We continue to show positive flows of our non-U.S. and U.S. institutional channels while retain channels recorded outflows in the quarter.  As we have said earlier, we are committed to improving our performance in the retail mutual fund space which continues to be a major focus of the management team.</p>
          <p>On page 3 of the supplement, you can see the regional revenue disclosure at the firm wide level.  This quarter, 57% of our revenues are international with 43% from Europe, the Middle East, Africa and 14% from Asia while 43% have come from the Americas.</p>
          <p>Finally, a few words on the outlook: after a difficult start to the quarter, customer flow activity returned to more normal levels in May and these flows have continued into June.  Clearly, the markets are still nervous and whilst there are encouraging signs of a trend, many issues remain.  Rising inflation, higher energy prices, rising unemployment and the ongoing housing downturn will continue to pressure the U.S. consumer.</p>
          <p>Uncertainty remains surrounding potential regulatory and accounting changes.  Against this backdrop, the underlying trends in our customer businesses are good.  We are starting to see an increase in risk taking and leveraged loans and financial bonds, credits and emergence of interest in CLOs.  While securitization markets are relatively quiet, we have been able to reduce gross exposures with cash sales.  In particular, we have seen non-leveraged buyers of distressed assets in this class.  Retail clients remain engaged albeit in safe and low margin investments and our emerging market pipelines are robust.</p>
          <p>So we will continue to stay close to shore given the current market conditions.  Importantly, we continue to focus on liquidity, capital and balance sheet transparency and we are very focused on servicing our clients.  We are confident that our global platform is strongly positioned to capture the opportunities of the market dislocations and to look for risk adjusted returns.</p>
          <p>Thank you and I will now be happy to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  The first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Merrill Lynn.  Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Colm.  First question, just a very quick one: could you remind us in calculating your liability marks, do you use CDS spreads, or do you use specific bond spreads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On our liability marks, we use bond spreads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, bond spreads.  I would like to talk for a minute about the leveraged finance hedge loss.  Can you give us a sense for what sort of mix of hedges, type of hedges you use in hedging that portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Well in broad terms, I mean, we actually have hedge losses across our whole book on non-investment grade as well.  The preponderance of those losses was in the, what I would call, the bridge facilities and the reason for that, Guy, is that it's much harder to either get specific CDS against them and you have to use by and large indexes of proxy.  So we've been dynamically managing it on that basis and that really has been the bulk of the loss on those hedges because as you know there is huge idiosyncratic risk there.  It's very name specific, and very concentrated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess basically then, what we saw was, despite the attempt to use single-name hedges, an inability to get enough of those to really protect you and therefore some macro level hedges which just had a lot of basis risk this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the next thing I would like to talk about and I think this is probably a little bit more of a complex discussion is maybe if we can go to page 16 of the supplement and what I would like to try to do on the subprime and Resi [Residential] analysis is relate the exposures and P&amp;L impact that we see here to the 430 some odd million dollars net mark that you talked about for the prop mortgage business?</p>
          <p>And then separately, how can we interpret these exposure numbers to really get comfortable that your exposure here is being brought down through sales and losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So let's start.  Our mortgage proprietary trading as disclosed on the page 16 includes most of our legacy U.S. subprime positions.  But also-- sorry, our mortgage proprietary trading in total includes most of our legacy U.S. subprime positions but also Alt-A and a few commercial positions.  So if you look at the loss itself, the net 300 is made up of a gross 400 loss on mortgage proprietary trading and a 100 gain on credit trading and I will break that down for you.  Within that, within mortgage proprietary trading, subprime there was a write-up of 100 million, a commercial write-down of 200 million, a non-subprime residential which is primarily the Alt-A which is the 300 million mark: that's 400 million.  In credit trading you have 100 million which is made up of a write-up in the subprime of 200, so that 200 plus 100 gives you the 300 write-up you see on the schedule.  The commercial write-up of 100 in credit trading nets against the 200 write-down in the prop desk to give you the net write-down of 100 that is on the schedule on page 17, right?  And that kind of balances it for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just clarify one thing.  The schedules present all of our direct exposures.  They include positions that are outside what were the legacy proprietary trading desks.  So that credit trading number I'm giving you offsets those mortgage proprietary trading desks which is what you relate to in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I think I get that.  And then just &#x2013; not to beat the dead horse, but I just want to essentially get some comfort around the idea that because of the losses that you talked about as well as actual portfolio sales, it's really a fair analysis to say that your exposure is being significantly wound down here such that for example in subprime, we really are at 300 million?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Look, as you know, the financial supplement, the analysis we present, presents all our U.S. subprime gross and net exposure. Now, we're continually, and we have said we would manage down our exposure in the areas where we incurred our greatest losses in 2007 and that was through a combination of dispositions and write-downs and that has been calibrated in our valuations and so on.  That's clearly evidenced by the 1.8 billion decline you see in the net exposure in our super senior mezz line, right?  And the ABS bond positions.  But I also said last quarter; given market dynamics we will continue to look for opportunities to manage our overall risk exposure on this portfolio so there is some dynamic hedging from the short side which means you should feel very comfortable that we are managing this exposure now.</p>

          <p>Well, it's not quite that simple because we have to go through process.  The person responsible is suspended.  There is an investigation involving a number of bodies, which we reported.  We immediately informed the FSA when we discovered this through our controls.  There's a full internal review of this matter.  I'm sure we know what the sentence is going to be, but I don't want to be like the Queen of Hearts.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, Colm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Roger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what I would like to ask is as you think about all the changes you've made around risk management, you talk about the sort of federal, local, sort of split, how fully has that been implemented and how is it working so far?  And I guess tied to that, you kind of look in the trading results this quarter, you see a number of places where the results are not up to par, where bets were taken, whether it was in electricity, mortgage trading losses, positioning for, I guess, spreads widening when they compressed.  How is that factoring into the risk management and how do we get confidence that maybe some of that volatility decreases? In fact VaR actually went up in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I am very &#x2013; there are a number of questions there, Roger.  I'm very glad you asked them, so let me address them one at a time.  First of all I would say that and I will end up with risk management as the conclusion from what we come through, right?</p>
          <p>First of all, the mortgage proprietary trading losses we're taking are related to by and large, as I just explained to Guy, the previous legacy portfolios we have.  Along these things, we need more efficient markets to reduce the exposures, right?  So I don't think there's an issue there.  I do think actually if you look at the bulk of the charges we've taken, they relate to legacy positions.</p>
          <p>In terms of the commodities position, look, we have got a great commodities business.  Year in, year out, they've been one of the two top businesses.  Occasionally they made a strategic bet: well thought out, well reasoned on the basis of the information they had.  We got it wrong.  We're in the risk game.  Occasionally we get things wrong.  We're not blas&#xE9; about it, but that's &#x2013; we get more right than we get wrong, fortunately this quarter.  So we're not worried about that.  The risk was well managed.  It was just the wrong view and so on.</p>
          <p>In terms of level three assets that you mentioned, we've got those under control.  They're 7% of the others &#x2013; 7% of the total balance sheet so they're in line even though we reduced our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So I think we've got these positions where we &#x2013; under control.  Now, risk management has played a very active role in this whole process.  The reason we disclosed this loss from the London trader is to be open to the Street.  I don't want to be blas&#xE9; about the fact that we discovered it because we're very angry about it but in this sort of environment of stressed markets, one would expect to see people try not to behave improperly.  The issue is do you have the controls to catch them?  We believe we do, right?</p>
          <p>So that's where I would end up.  I think Ken deRegt is our Chief Risk Officer, the hiring of Kayshe Hotsuki as head of MRD [Market Risk Development] and a thorough overhaul of where we were, I feel very comfortable that our balance sheet is in good order and we understand our risks.  Did I leave anything out?</p>
          <p>Oh! VaR; sorry. VaR, you say it's gone up, well it has gone up marginally but actually if you look at the inputs on that, volatility itself particularly feeding it, you're going to see that I would say that if we were to normalize it versus previous inputs, it has gone down.  Our balance sheet has come down.  Our gross exposures have come down.  Our net exposures have come down, so what you are seeing is a dynamic of the market that is driving VaR up for &#x2013; if we had taken more trading risk that VaR would be significantly more pronounced.  Non-trading VaR is up purely as a function of the increase funding we did and what I propose to do next quarter is to try and see if we can work on better disclosure around non-trading VaR.  Or the quarter after, but we'll work on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful.  Then switching to your commercial, you know, commercial mortgage securities loan exposure, can you just help me think through any basis risk that, you know, sort of basis losses that apparently you didn't have in the quarter that I guess I would have expected given the big difference between gross and net there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  We disclosed that we had a $100 million loss in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We didn't take losses managing this position down.  There are different risks in this book.  We show gross and net.  If you look at the bottom line, you know, you'll see that we have an accounting gross-up that nets that off.  The statement of financial condition which is bonds, warehouse, lines and loans, grace exposure was reduced $2.5 million.  The net exposure reduced 3.6 billion, you can see that and it's reasonably well distributed regionally and in terms of the loans themselves, more disclosure, commercial loans are 71% senior, 29% mezzanine.</p>
          <p>So I think if you look at it, take out the gross-ups, I think we've actually got this position under control well down from the peak which we had of I believe 35 billion to where we are now and we have taken a lot of the basis risk out.  In addition, remember, I've always said that the best basis for our valuation to preempt these questions is we calibrate the trades to external marks.  We have been justified on the marks that we have been taking on that, Roger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but the primary mechanism for hedging those exposures is it more single name CDS or CMBS...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on the name.  It could be credit default indexed to total rate of return swaps.  You know, it depends.  What we're showing you is that the way we're managing this, zero loss from the management of the position in the first quarter, $100 million this quarter in what is a very stressed environment for basis risk and index performance.  I think &#x2013; look, effectively the best hedges get your gross exposures down.  That's what we've been doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the mix between fixed and floating, what's the average duration of the floating rate on the loan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh!  I can tell you.  Float is 94%, fixed 6%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I guess with respect to these CSE ratios, your tier 1 ratio actually obviously looks pretty good relative to what we have heard so far this quarter.  How useful do you think that ratio is going to be given &#x2013; I think you have talked about some of the risk components in the Q but one piece that's not captured is the liquidity risk.  Do you think that is going to end up having to get reworked?  Do you think it's going to be a useful metric?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really don't want to comment on that one.  We're clearly heavily involved.  The fact that we're running liquidity the way we are is telling you that we think liquidity is a main input.  I do think as a measurement of risk, I do think that Basel II and the trading book review is a very thorough exercise.  So personally, when you see the risk weighted assets disclosed and the composition of those, I think it will be a much more useful tool than actually accounting classifications.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Colm.  Just on the loss of $120 million, I mean, you know, obviously you guys also had losses, I think it was in the fourth quarter of last year as it related to the CDO book.  Just can you elaborate and help us understand exactly where these losses stem from?</p>
          <p>Exactly, you know, what didn't comply and you know, as you think about these losses, you know, 120 million for, I guess, a single trader is significant.  Just trying to understand over what timeframe this had occurred as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's &#x2013; a very different set of circumstances.</p>
          <p>What we had in the fourth quarter was a proprietary trade.  There was never any issue of financial control, mismarking, anything.  It was a bad trade that went south very badly, and we have given you the data points on that, right?</p>
          <p>What we've had here this quarter is we've had a trader who was mismarking his book, right?  And you know, we found it.  Our controls picked it up.  Obviously, in an environment like this, you will get more of that.  There was some involvement going back to the previous quarter, possibly the quarter below that &#x2013; before that, it is subjective.  We did not think it was material but we certainly did think it was time to disclose it to people and to send a very strong message that we have zero tolerance of this sort of behavior.</p>
          <p>So I do believe it's isolated.  I think it's a very different situation from a prop trading bet going wrong.  You know, I think it's just something we caught, our controls caught and we dealt with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then I guess on the prop trading side, I mean, obviously there are numerous businesses that seem to be negatively impacted by prop trading this quarter even on the equity side, you know, I know one of the big initiatives that John Mack had implemented when he got there was increased risk taking and you know, I am just wondering whether or not you guys are kind of rethinking your ability or willingness to take risks just given some of these losses this quarter or was it just a perfect storm of events of bad luck for you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I think losses this quarter, as I said before, a lot of these losses relate to previous positions.  Our equity division still produced $2.1 billion this quarter, which is one of our best quarters ever.  So you know, I don't think that that impacted that business.  It shows the breadth, diversification and so on.</p>
          <p>In terms of risk taking, look, we will take risks but we want to take risk adjusted risk.  Right?  We did not believe &#x2013; we flagged throughout this quarter that we felt these were very, very treacherous waters.  We thought events that took place, as you say, it's a perfect storm.  People cannot gloss over lightly the event that took place in March and the effect it had on the market and since then, you had a number of other deteriorations in the consumer lending sector and so on.  That is what made us pull down the sails, sail close to shore, preserve our ammunition.  We do have excess capital.  We do have excess liquidity.  We do have leverage if we want to where we can take risks and we can optimize our balance sheet.  That is our priority.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.  Lastly in terms of the regional revenue breakout, you know, when you strip out the gains that you had highlighted from MSCI as well as the wealth management business, it looks like all the regions were down anywhere from 25 to 50%.  You know, were the losses that you highlighted in kind of the trading businesses across all the regions, or were the core international trends really that weak this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  Core international trends were strong.  It was just-- the way I would answer it, the first quarter we did well because we had very good client activity.  And that's really our edge.  That's where we had a good ROE.  This quarter, we saw generally a fall-off in client activity in broad terms, right?  And that's what has affected us.  In Asia, if you look at it down a little bit primarily in sales and trading, investment banking was up slightly.  Europe was fine.  We were 57% international of our revenues.  If you normalize that for the losses, it is still very much round about the 50/50 level.  Not losses; sorry, the mark-downs we are taking on legacy positions and so on.  I think our diversification is paying off.  You know, and I say also if you were to look at a normalized operating rate, yes, you can look at some of these gains taken but you've also got to look at the losses we've taken and work out the run rate and hopefully we have given you enough information for you to be able to compute that.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Follow-up question on FICC [Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities].  We can stay at the high level because I know I'm not going to get the specific numbers.  If we're at 2.8 billion last quarter, we go to 400 or so million this quarter, we have the prop mortgage issues, we have lower customer volume issue and then we have the commodity.  It still feels like, wow, there's &#x2013; were customer volumes that soft across the board, or was the commodity number actually that big?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, customer volumes were off and I know some of our competitors have come out with slightly different stories; I will tell you customer volumes were off and I think we have a good market position in March.  I have never seen anything like the drop-off that we saw and we went back to test that.  April, if I scale it this way, I have done this to you before so I apologize for repeating if you say zero was no volume, five is very good volume,  March was zero, April was two, May came up to about a four.  We definitely have seen an improvement since June, but yes, we were hit hard by the lack of customer volume.</p>

          <p>I guess everyone is going to try to think about the impossible task of modeling going forward.  Can you box in &#x2013; 67% fall-off in commodities seems like a big fall-off because I know that the commodity business has been doing pretty well so it seems like a reasonably large number, and is that normal that a directional that can account for such a big chunk of commodities?

          <p>Okay.  And who are the swaps with?  And I don't mean exactly who, but I'm just curious in general buckets.  Who do you tend to do the swaps against?  That's one of the major differences between your gross and net exposure so I'm just trying to think about counterparty exposure there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there's &#x2013; I don't think there's any one person.  It's a diversified portfolio of people, most of which is done on a collateralized basis anyway.  As you know in the 10-Q, we will be publishing and disclosing who our swap counterparties are anyway.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I just don't &#x2013; I would rather wait and get the right numbers.  What I would say to you is, look, we're very comfortable with our swap counterparties.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood and then maybe last quickie, always in a lower volume environment it becomes a very slippery slope to bother even asking, but market share and rank have moved lower in a bunch of the banking categories.  Is that a function of just you got less of the FIG storm in terms of banking it because that's where there's been a lot of activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are a number of things there Glen.  It's certainly true that we got less of the U.S. FIG but as you know, in Europe, which is probably going to be more of a third quarter event, we did five out of the seven rights issues.  If I look at my pipeline, I think that our pipeline in terms of ECM/DCM; sorry Equity Capital Markets, debt capital markets and M&amp;A are all up on the last quarter and we have a very healthy pipeline.  I think there's a development in time and I have no doubt we will reassert our rankings, but there is a bit of a lag, and I think there's some temporary distortion because of volumes in markets which have been a bit lopsided.</p>

          <p>Cool.  Last one is end on something good.  Wealth management flows were pretty awesome considering the environment.  Can you talk about how much of that is coming from, say, the existing FA base versus your-- what appeared to be a great ability to recruit during a tough time?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a combination of both.  We're getting very good productivity from the existing FA base but as you know, that has a good cumulative effect but in addition, we have clearly been doing very well on what they call the balance of payments in hiring versus losses, so I think James and now Ellyn McColgan who is running GWM have really done a fantastic job there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment on the investment banking pipeline?  You said it was healthy, but can you quantify that a little bit more?</p>
          <p>And also, down 11% is a bit worse than some of your competitors if you can give some more color on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I would say-- it would be very difficult for me to give you specifics on that.  We are up in the first quarter significantly in announced and pending on M&amp;A pipeline and also on a probability-weighted revenue on that basis, and we are marginally up to a reasonable number up in equity and debt capital markets.  I think that's all I want to say on that, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then Asia was down 1/4 linked quarter and it looks like the lowest level since quarter ending around late '06.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the real swing factor as I said before in Asia was sales and trading which is the swing factor there.  What I can tell you is I mean, our investment banking business in Asia slightly positive.  Our pipelines in Asia are very, very strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the sales and trading, did that relate to the legacy mortgage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not at all in Asia.  That was just literally reduced client volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was there any outside loss there? Because that's still a pretty big swing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Just going back to the big picture here, I tried to add up all the numbers you gave on the call and I got 1.7 billion of write-downs and losses.  I can go through the list.  You said it but kind of quickly: monoline 390 million; the mismarking on the trade, 120 million; leveraged loans write-downs, 496 million;...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...commercial real estate, CMBS, 100 million; Alt-A 300 million; the trade loss on FIS, 86 million; and then markdowns and private equity of 200 million. Is that...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct, yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there's nothing missing there?  So as we think about go forward, I think what you are implying here if you are marking everything correctly in the perfect world if nothing changed so it's 1.7 billion of marks would go away, or not necessarily?  Kind of where do we stand with these kind of write-downs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I'm not going to give specific details on marks.  I will tell you why.  I think we've been very clear about our philosophy on marking itself.  We calibrate the trades.  If you look at the subprime exposure, let me give you an example which is anecdotal.  If you look at page 16 which is subprime exposure on-- if you look at that now, we've marked that down.  We've got the exposure down to a net of 300 million, but if you look at the footnotes, we have now got marks that are implying losses in the range of 18 to 41%.  Those cumulative loss levels at a severity rate of 55% are implying defaults of 73 to 84%.</p>
          <p>So if you take that as an example, and the fact that we disclosed this all fully, we've calibrated trades, we've have done that in CMBS, we've done that in leveraged lending, my view is the marks are what they are. We've improved them with subsequent trades but they're the right marks.  Sometimes we have done better than that, obviously.  Whether we're going to get continued deterioration in them or not, I don't know.  There's been a big write-down already.  They're marked appropriately and it is a function of whether the markets return or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the tier 1 ratio, you mentioned you want to keep dry powder, the tier 1, 11.5 to 12% preliminary, does that reflect dry powder, or is that where you would want to run it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, you are going to have to judge that for yourself when you look at our-- look, there's a lot of uncertainty in the market.  We know where our contemporaries are in tier 1.  We feel pretty good about that, but also we have uncertainty in the market generally so it does give us a capital buffer, which is the way I look at it.  So yes, I feel good about our capital buffer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Prashant Bhatia with Citi.  Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.  Just your comment that you're going to continue to stay close to shore, does that imply that it's too early in the cycle right here to take more or deploy capital more aggressively and you're okay to let some opportunities pass by, or it is more the view that you just don't think there will be much near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we actually think if you remember at the end of last quarter, I gave a more positive outlook.  Not that I have ever been Mr. Happy, but the issue is there were definitely better signs of recovery in the market and then March actually was a pretty nasty event, right?</p>
          <p>So when we looked at the outlook this time, it clearly is not as rosy as it would have been at the end of the first quarter when various people were talking about sports innings and so on, right?  I do think there's going to be an opportunity to make money here, right?</p>
          <p>So it is an issue of taking advantage of dislocation, taking advantage of opportunities that will present themselves.  We were hoping that would be the case this year, but-- this quarter, sorry.  But the key for us, Prashant, is risk adjusted and we really did not feel, and you see that in our VaR numbers, we really did not feel that on a risk adjusted basis we dipped.  It was worth taking bets away from areas where we were comfortable with.  Clearly in commodities, we made a trade on the basis of a good fundamentals and so on.  It didn't work but more often than not we get those right.  I'm not saying we're in risk reduction mode.  We clearly have reduced the risk.  We reduced the balance sheet.  We're liquid.  We've got capital.  We clearly feel we can make money through bear cycles and bull cycles and we're just waiting for the right risk adjusted opportunity to come along.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's helpful and just on the size of the asset base, the trillion gross, 580 net, where do you think that ends up settling?  Is there a fair amount more to go, or would you stay at these levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I kind of think we're at the right sort of spot at the moment in terms of giving us the optionality we need to be opportunistic and to be defensive.  Obviously, we would like more normalized markets to get rid of some of this legacy portfolio so we can optimize the returns to the balance sheet, but I kind of think we feel comfortable that we have got optionality sitting where we are at the moment given all the uncertainty around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on the 6 billion of commercial loans in your disclosure, do you have at hand what the delinquency rate is on that loan portfolio, or just anything else that you could provide, you know, to just help people understand the quality there?  It seems pretty good because I don't think you have taken any...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe it is very good quality, which is our view, and that's evidenced in our marks as well, but we'll see what we can, you know-- I just think generally we consider it to be very good quality and well marked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just on the asset management side, it looks like the alternative asset flows are actually pretty strong over the past several quarters.  That's a little different than what we have seen in some of the peers.  Can you just talk about, is that partly driven by distributing into retail, or what's the driver there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's a number of drivers.  I mean we've had some very good performance within that historically.  We've got a broad suite of products and, and it is being led by retail as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just one final.  Can you just elaborate...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing as well, I would point out, is that remember one of the big drivers this quarter has been institutional money markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just on &#x2013; could you point out areas in the business where you are actually seeing higher returns on the capital you are deploying, that pricing power you talked about a little bit in prime brokerage in the past.  Are there other areas where you are seeing -- you are basically getting paid more on capital being deployed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our equity business is strong and our ratios there look good, prime brokerage is good. Obviously we are improving our profit margin in our retail business. That's kind of where I'd point to. I mean, drawing a trend away from this quarter away from those which I mentioned before is kind of hard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then finally on head count, any &#x2013; could you share maybe what your budget is to end the year at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't look at head count. We look at cost. We have done some pretty big moves on cost as you can see. Headcount is a secondary consideration. We are really looking at comp expense and by that you get a proxy for head count but you can clearly see that we are with a smaller reduction in head count than some others but a big reduction in comp. What we are trying to do is really to get our bang for our buck in that allocation of resources.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  That's helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have time for one more question from the line of Michael Hecht with Banc of America.  Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you doing? Can you give us a sense of where Level 3 assets ended the period and just any components of the change, transfers in and out, that kind of stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is a bit early yet to get into that much detail on, Mike, that counts as a dangerous thing to do, but we are at 7% of the balance sheet roughly proportionally decreased with the overall balance sheet itself as we took it down. The Q will give you the full disclosure on that so there is no specific story for us in Level 3 and the same sort of stuff you would expect in there will all be proportionately will be in there at the end of the Q.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair. The 90 million in structured note gains you noted in equities, what were the total firm wide gains on structured notes this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was it, 90 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just 90 million, okay. On the monoline exposure, the mark that you guys took, can you give us a sense of how you guys come up with the credit valuation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We've always done &#x2013; we do our &#x2013; we don't do our credit valuation on ratings, we do it on spread. So if spread is wide we take increasing reserve and it is on that basis. I think that is conservative. This time around we showed our gross exposures as well because obviously monolines have been more topical on that basis.  So you can see that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on the gross and net leverage which came in quite a bit, I think you kind of said you think the balance sheet is appropriately sized. Should we expect leverage to continue to fall and what do you think the implications are for the type of ROE you guys can earn through the cycle and are you seeing any pressure here from regulators, rating agencies, investors to kind of bring leverage down further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are obviously in constant touch with a broad array of regulators. What we have been doing is taking down the balance sheet because on a risk adjusted basis that's what we want to do.  And that's the same thing.  We have been running cash because we wanted to do that given our risk profile. So the answer is, we are in constant dialog, but we are not getting any pressure.</p>
          <p>In the terms of cycle ROE, it's clear that increased leverage has been popping up ROEs and I do think it top slices our return off it, but I think you can make up a good chunk of that by optimizing your balance sheet more efficiently.  To do that, however, we are going to need more normalized markets to liquidate positions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair.  Just a quick follow-up on the equities business. It sounds like the flow businesses and cash and derivatives were pretty strong, prime brokerage as well, but it is all really a function of the prop trading losses.  Can you give us any additional color on those? Was it more of the just bad positioning versus environmental?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. I think some of those small &#x2013; as I have said to you before some of those small prop trading desks we have wound down so I think generally &#x2013; look, let me just restate, equities was $2.1 billion. Our record quarter was 2.5. It was still a very strong quarter. It was broad based. I think it was our fourth best quarter but I will have to confirm that, I think that's right. I think it is just testament to the strength of that business. The story this quarter was clearly our fixed income fall-off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe a quick housekeeping one, just any color on the tax rate?  It was a little bit lower than expected this quarter.  Should we &#x2013; where it's running...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is just reflecting the changing nature of our business globally. That's what it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks</p>
