        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. We're going to begin the presentation of the Results for the First Nine Months of 2010. When we come to the questions-and-answers session, the procedure will be as usual, that we'll have priority for questions from the room, then via phone and finally via the web.</p>
          <p>So I want to immediately hand over to the Chairman of IBERDROLA, Jos&#xE9; Ignacio Gal&#xE1;n.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you very much, everyone. I want to thank you for attending and also those that are following the presentation by phone or over the web.</p>
          <p>The structure for today will be, I will first briefly describe the main aspects for the results of these first nine months, then the CFO will analyze these results in detail and the financial position for the group, and I will end up with some brief conclusions, and then we will move on to the questions.</p>
          <p>The first nine months of this year had a gross operating profit of &#x20AC;5,563 million. This is 12.4% more than in the same period last year. It must also be highlighted that all businesses have shown a positive performance during the period. And this shows that the investments carried out during the period have provided the group with a portfolio of activities in geographic areas capable of providing a path of sustainable growth, even at times like these. So our renewable and liberalized businesses have been driven by an increase of 10.2% in output, thanks to the greater contribution of emission-free technologies and which in recent years &#x2013; or last year, we invested &#x20AC;2.3 billion.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the regulated business has also benefited from the good performance of our subsidiaries in the U.K. and especially in the U.S. As a result of this, the gross margin for the group grew by 9.2%. On the other hand the expansion to new geographic areas is giving greater drive to the efficiency improving process, which, as you know, has always been a trademark for the group.</p>
          <p>In this sense, the best practice exchange measures together with a deep review of corporate expenses have made it possible to reduce net operating cost by 2% in nominal terms. This together with the strong increase in the gross margin already mentioned has led to a further improvement of more than 10% in the operating efficiency of the group.</p>
          <p>I would also like to highlight the excellent results obtained in the optimization process in the U.S. network business. The efforts made by IBERDROLA USA together with the positive impact of the tariff review in the State of New York will enable this company to face up to the major growth opportunities that will be found in near future in the areas of electricity distribution and transport.</p>
          <p>The growth in the activity of the group has been reflected in the developments of the group's operating cash flow, which have grown by 14% and come close to &#x20AC;4 billion in just nine months. This fund generation capacity together with the proactive management of the balance sheet is enabling IBERDROLA strength that will grow quarter after quarter, as shown by our financial ratios.</p>
          <p>Regarding the debt profile, in the last two months, we have carried out a six-year bond issue amounting to &#x20AC;750 million, and we have exchanged &#x20AC;600 million in bonds with maturity in 2011 and 2013, which has been replaced with the new issue with maturity in 2020 at a cost that is 150 basis points lower. The average life of the debt therefore is now 6.2 years.</p>
          <p>Also liquidity has increased up to &#x20AC;10.166 billion, sufficient to cover the needs of the group for the next two years. Additionally, and as the CFO will explain in detail, the process to collect the tariff deficit in Spain has continued the process through its registration in the stock market commission next week, and with a road show with investors by representatives from the Ministries of Economy and Industry. So we can state that IBERDROLA enjoys excellent financial health. This will enable us to take on the investment opportunities in the main markets in order to maintain the path of growth of recent years.</p>
          <p>Moving onto more specific items, group output in the first nine-months of 2010 raised 115,000 gigawatt hours with a growth of 10.2% with respect to the same period last year. And investments made in recent years have improved our portfolio by increasing the output of emission-free output.</p>
          <p>The wind, hydro and nuclear technologies have increased their joint contribution by close to 10 points in the last 12 months, amounting to 50% of total production. This has also increased the diversification of our generation facilities. So in September 2010, no technology contributes more than 20% of the total, excluding combined cycle in Mexico which as you know, has a practically independent economic regime in operating hours and fuel costs.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight that the 14% increase in production in Spain, thanks to the increase in hydro and wind generation, as well as the performance in demand, which in spite of having slowed down in recent months, continues to grow at a rate of around 3% this year. Regarding hydro reserves in Spain, they are currently more than 6,800 gigawatt hours. This represents an increase of 45% over the figures recorded in June 2009. The increase in output and the good performance of the regulated businesses mean that the gross margin for the group is &#x20AC;8.7 billion, driven by the growth in all our businesses.</p>
          <p>Regarding performance in operating expenses, IBERDROLA has continued to improve its efficiency during the period. We can highlight the major reduction in outsourcing, a net reduction of 6%. Personnel expenses, on the other hand, have increased slightly, somewhat under 2% due to the effect of the exchange rate. Excluding this effect, personnel expenses have dropped by 0.3%.</p>
          <p>We must also highlight the good performance of IBERDROLA USA with a reduction of 18% in these expenses, and ScottishPower that, again, has improved this item in pounds after discounting the non-recurrent earnings obtained through insurances. All this has taken us to a gross operating profit of more than &#x20AC;5.5 billion.</p>
          <p>By businesses, there is a positive performance in IBERDROLA Renewables, a growth of 19% and in the regulated businesses, EBITDA has grown by 16% and again, we must highlight developments in the U.S. driven by these efficiency improvements. We must also mention the growth in the Latin American business, whose gross operating profit has increased by 14%, thanks to the major growth in demand of our Brazilian distributors, amounting to close to 10%.</p>
          <p>The liberalizing activities have developed in different ways. In Spain, results have been benefited by an increase of 13% in output and growth in variable low cost technologies, while in the U.K., the business margins have been reduced compared to 2009, which was exceptional. However, global EBITDA for this business increased 9% during the period and as I was saying, 2010 is representing a major transformation period for the network activity in the U.S.</p>
          <p>From the regulatory point of view, IBERDROLA U.S.A. in New York is part of the new framework and contributes two-thirds of its results. The company is also ensured a period of stability that will last until 2014, once all the main subsidiary tariffs are also established. The new tariff regimen in New York will significantly improve and the profitability over equity is 10%, as well as an equity ratio of up to 48% of the regulated assets.</p>
          <p>And also, the framework promotes operating improvements and serving improvements and the increases efficiency will be shared on reasonable basis between companies and consumers. Also the risk of companies are reduced. Their remuneration will no longer be subject to risk and will be protected against exogenous factors such as storms, increases in taxes or pension costs.</p>
          <p>Regarding new development areas in IBERDROLA USA, the beginning of the works for the main transport line now to Canada is, without a doubt, a major landmark for the company. This new infrastructure will have a length of 800 kilometers and its construction will last until 2014. And will represent a total investment of $1.4 billion that will be obtained from our divestment in the Connecticut and Massachusetts gas companies.</p>
          <p>I also want to highlight that the ORE of this project is close to 13% and it will immediately begin to be connected as soon as payments are made. We don't have to wait for the completion of the whole investment. The major transformation process of IBERDROLA in the U.S. is clearly reflected in the results for the first nine months of 2010, where the company's EBITDA has grown by 56%, thanks to this 11% growth in gross margin and the efficiency improvements, which have brought about a reduction of 18% in the not-operating expenses in Euros.</p>
          <p>Regarding, the management of the balance sheet for the group, the result for the first nine months showed the positive impact of the various measures implemented in the last few quarters,0 in order to optimize the liability structure.</p>
          <p>The increase in cash flow together with investment controls has enabled the debt to be reduced by almost &#x20AC;700 million during this period, while equity has increased to almost &#x2013; by &#x20AC;2 billion, exceeding &#x20AC;31 billion. The leverage is 45.3%, more than two points lower than 12 months ago, and the main financial ratios have also improved considerably, as the CFO will explain.</p>
          <p>Finally, the solid operating developments in the semester have improved the financial position of the company by 6.7% in the recurrent net profits with &#x20AC;1,840 million, 14% of the operating cash flow, which is already closer to &#x20AC;4 billion. And now, Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, the CFO, will explain the results for the period.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chairman. Good morning. We will now review the most important aspects of the results in these first nine months of 2010 and the operating developments in our businesses to end up with an analysis of the financial situation for the group. After a good quarter, the company has high growth in the main operating results.</p>
          <p> Sales grow 16%, gross margin. EBITDA grows 12.4%, in line with the end of June, which was 11.7%. Regarding the recurrent net profit, a growth of 6.7% to &#x20AC;1,840 million, also in line with what was reflected in June. The reported net profits grew by 2% to &#x20AC;2,070 million. And the cash flow for the group reached 3,596 (sic) [3,956] million and grew 14.4%.</p>
          <p>The sales figure grew 16.1% to 22,978 million. With larger volumes in Spain that offset the lower price of our liberalized business and the lower remuneration and distribution, with major growth in Renewables in Latin America. Regarding suppliers for the group, they grew 21.9% to 14,032 million especially in the national energy business and Latin America.</p>
          <p>The gross margin increased 9.2% to &#x20AC;8,674 million. And there has been growth in all business areas. Additionally, IBERDROLA has benefited from the good developments in the exchange rate set, representing &#x20AC;207 million. The basic margin, that reflects the net effect of the issue rights on the operating accounts, increased by 8.4%, somewhat less than the gross margin because of the lower pricing consumption of CO2 in 2010.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses are still evolving positively and dropped 2.2% and now stand at &#x20AC;2.578 billion and this means that we've had an improvement of 0.8 relative to June, although as the President said, there have been increases in the rate of exchange that represent &#x20AC;57 million.</p>
          <p>Net staff expenses have grown 1.8% and now stand at &#x20AC;1.295 billion, meaning that there has been a 3.9 improvement relative to June. And the net external services have been reduced by 6% and now stand at &#x20AC;1.283 billion. And they've improved by means of a reduction of 5.2% relative to June, but it has to be pointed out that we have the issue of the reclassification of the nuclear rate, which I will be talking about later on, because of the facilities that have been provided according to IFRIC 18.</p>
          <p>And as regards taxation, there has been a 22.8% increase, reaching &#x20AC;695 million. This represents the increase in reclassification of the nuclear rate or tax, 62 million more than in 2009 and which in the first months represents &#x20AC;141 million that the group is paying in terms of nuclear tax. And then we have the social bonus and another taxes in the United States, U.K. and Spain.</p>
          <p>And if you add-up all these effects, they compensate the elimination of the detraction of CO2 rights that represented &#x20AC;98 million. That is a clawback in 2009. And the consolidated EBITDA of the group stands at &#x20AC;5.563 billion, which is a 12.4% increase.</p>
          <p>And this evolution of the EBITDA has improved the basic margin by 8.4%, thanks to the cost contingent efforts and thanks to the efficiency improvements made by the group. The strength of the currencies in which the IBERDROLA group operates has been significant, especially in the second and third quarters of the year, which is beneficial for the group.</p>
          <p>So that the final net impact on the operating accounts, as far as the EBITDA is concerned, represents another &#x20AC;143 million and the rate of exchange of the dollar and the pound have been appreciated by 3% and the Brazilian Real by 17.8%. But regardless of this, the EBITDA has grown very strongly by 9.5%.</p>
          <p>I would now like to move on to the operating profit by businesses and starting off with the liberalized business in Spain. That includes generation, commercial and non-regulated gas. It has to be underscored that IBERDROLA has increased its production by 13% in the ordinary regime.</p>
          <p>And there is also been a much better progression of the system, which has shown a slump in the ordinary regime of nearly 2%. And this positive evolution can be explained by the growth in the demand of the system, 3.4% or 3% when adjusted, and the significant increase in hydraulic production, as the President pointed out, which represents 134% more.</p>
          <p>And in addition, our nuclear production has grown 12.8% and thermal technologies have declined 40% in the case of cycles and coal, 48%. An average sale price, total sale price, stands at &#x20AC;57 per megawatt hour with a production level that is higher than we expected it to be. And all the production for 2010 and something like 50 terawatt hour of those estimated for 2011 have been sold at prices above &#x20AC;50 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>And the forwards of the European and Spanish markets show that there is price stability, or there will be in 2011, which means that the prices for next year will be in line with those of this year. We also have to underscore that the Spanish forwards maintained a difference between &#x20AC;5 and &#x20AC;10 below those of France and Germany. So this proves that the problem with the tariff deficit is not generated by the ordinary regime, but rather, it is the opposite.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of the liberalized business in Spain has grown 23% and has now reached &#x20AC;1.242 billion because there has been an increase, an improvement, in the basic margins, 18.3%, which now stands at &#x20AC;2.087 billion because of higher volumes, because of a better production mix and because we've limited operating expenses. But these operating expenses have been reduced 1.1% in the context of strong growth of the basic margin.</p>
          <p>The increase of expenses linked to more commercial activities is &#x2013; has been compensated by the efficiency actions implemented and by the impact produced by the nuclear tax that is under the tax heading. And tax has gone up 46% and now stands at a figure of &#x20AC;299 million, because of the incorporation of the nuclear, the tax, &#x20AC;141 million, the social bonus and the increase of the eco-tax in Extremadura, which is another 15 million and the taxes paid by IBERDROLA in relation to TUR and commercial. And these four effects have a much greater impact than the &#x20AC;98 million of less CO2 in the year 2010.</p>
          <p>And the EBITDA of the regulated business in Spain has grown 10.2% and now stands at &#x20AC;928 million. This means that there has been an improvement relative to the 3.6 slump that we had in the gross margin, thanks to the significant improvement we've had in terms of net operating expenses, that have been reduced by nearly 29%. Because the area is not only continuing its efficiency, but there are also other effects that explain this, like the transferring to the liberalized business those costs related to TUR, as I mentioned before, and the impact of IFRIC 18.</p>
          <p>So that means that here, we have the results that have been placed under the heading of the facilities that have been surrendered to the subscribers, and in the case of IBERDROLA, we're talking about &#x20AC;15 million, which have been included under other income. And in September 2009, there were also maintenance expenses because of the storms, whereas in 2010, we did not have these effects.</p>
          <p>As regards the 3.6% reduction of the gross margin, this is the consequence of the reduction &#x2013; the temporary reduction in the remuneration of the business. So, it brought about temporary remunerations, but we have to wait for the definitive remuneration that is based on the reference model and on the investments made in 2009, as mentioned by the National Energy Council in the report of June of this year.</p>
          <p>This decline in remuneration has been partially compensated by resettlements that have taken place in this third quarter of the year, and the gross margin of renewables grew 18.6% and now stands at &#x20AC;1.412 billion, thanks to a strong increase in production, 20.2%, and because there is more operating capacity. That has grown 16.1%, and now stands at 11,434 megawatts and also because there have been improvements in Spain and the U.S.A.</p>
          <p>Prices now have reached &#x20AC;68.4 per megawatt hour, similar to 2009. And this means that the EBITDA of the renewable business has grown nearly 25%. And this has furthered the total growth of the consolidated EBITDA of IBERDROLA RENOVABLES, which now stands at &#x20AC;972 million, which has grown 19.4% in spite of the smaller contribution of the gas business. And the growth in 14.2% of the operating costs has slowed down in the third quarter relative to the second one, and is now four points below the growth we have in the gross margins, because of the efficiency efforts of the business that has managed to improve the expense per operating megawatt by 3.8%.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of ScottishPower in local currency has dropped 12.6% and now stands at &#xA3;850 million, after an 8.9% slump we had in the basic margin because of the worst behavior of the wholesale and retail business, which has been partially compensated by an improvement in networks. Whereas the net operating expenses, as was mentioned by the President, have been reduced 4.7%.</p>
          <p>In euros, the EBITDA, well, it's reduced, it's declined. It now stands at 9.9%, in other words, &#x20AC;989 million after having a positive impact in the case of the exchange rate, wholesale and retail has provided &#x20AC;438 million for EBITDA with a 21.2% slump because of the retail business, where there were less volumes, and also less margins related to price reduction in 2009, which have not been compensated by the average cost of fuel.</p>
          <p>And fundamentally, the worst behavior can be found in the electrical business, because the gas business improved its results in 2010. And it has to be said that 2009 was an especially strong year in the electric retail business of ScottishPower and that 2010 is more of an average year, like 2008.</p>
          <p>Networks provide 550 &#x2013; &#x20AC;547 million, which is 7.1% growth. And this stems from the 10.1% increase in the gross margin, which of the new remuneration system, has produced a favorable impact, which has been applied or which was first applied in April the 1st of 2010. And the EBITDA of IBERDROLA United States, as the President pointed out, now stands &#x20AC;521 million, which means that it's a 56% increase vis-&#xE0;-vis the &#x20AC;338 million in September 2009.</p>
          <p>And as you will remember, we already said that there was an impact there of something like &#x20AC;100 million because of the transfer to IFRS and basically because of incurred expenses that have been recovered in the tariff and which were not recognized at that point in time in the books &#x2013; in the books of IFRS. But there has been 53 &#x2013; there has been an increase of &#x20AC;53 million, thanks to the operating improvements.</p>
          <p>So the gross margin has gone up 10.8% and now stands at &#x20AC;1.173 billion and most of this growth has been produced by the IFRS adjustments, because the best margins have been compensated by lower sales because of the weather.</p>
          <p>The net operating expenses have improved substantially, nearly 18% and most of this has to do with the efficiency actions implemented by the company last year. The workforce has been reduced 15% and there have been new initiatives that have reduced external services by 28%.</p>
          <p>And as the President pointed out, the approval of the rate case in New York, that has improved the businesses' profitability perspectives and the construction of the line in Maine, as well as the efficiency improvements allow us has to be optimistic as regards the evolution of the business of IBERDROLA in the United States that will compensate the sales of the gas distributors in Connecticut.</p>
          <p>The EBTIDA of Latin America has grown 14.4% and now stands at &#x20AC;738 million, which is the outcome of the evolution we've had in terms of the gross margin, 23.7%.</p>
          <p>And we also have an increase in net operating expenses because of the extraordinary adjustments of &#x20AC;36 million in Brazil, with a positive effect in 2009 which has not been repeated in 2010. And this splendid operating progression of the business in Mexico and Brazil has been improved by the positive effect of the rate of exchange of the Real and the dollar.</p>
          <p>And by business &#x2013; by businesses, Brazil has made a contribution of &#x20AC;419 billion for the EBITDA with an 18% growth, because there has been an increase of 9.6% in demand and because there has been a greater adjustment of prices to inflation and because the rate of exchange has a part of influence and despite of sales of assets in Chile that has been compensated by the exploitation of new hydraulic power stations. And Mexico has a contribution of &#x20AC;319 million to the EBITDA, meaning that this is a 10% growth rate. And the effect of the rate of exchange has a positive effect, 3%. And the EBITDA of Non Energy &amp; Engineering businesses had a 4.0% slump and now stands at &#x20AC;197 million.</p>
          <p>And the lower levels of activity in the real estate business and engineering, means that there will be further slumps. And engineering still is the area that has made the biggest contribution with 43%. And where it has to be underscored that the 7.3 reduction that we've seen in net operating expenses produced by the adjustment measures have meant that the EBITDA has dropped less than the gross margin, down to 4.2%.</p>
          <p>And the EBIT of the group grew by 9.1%, which is somewhat lower than the growth we had in terms of the EBITDA after an 18.6% increase in amortizations and provisions, which now stands at &#x20AC;1.994 billion, of which amortizations represent 1.9 billion and which is 17.1% more, have to do with increases in renewables with more installed power.</p>
          <p>In ScottishPower, with an effect that has to do with the appreciation of the power and more assets under exploitation in the networks area and also because there have been more environmental investments that have been made in Spain. And the reclassification of the deferred income and facilities that have been surrendered to subscribers in the distribution area in the case of gone, there has been a negative impact for the group of &#x20AC;54 million in terms of net operating expenses, and the provisions have been increased by 35 million and now stand at &#x20AC;94 million, which is somewhat lower than the 103 million we had in June.</p>
          <p>Because some, after having made some reversions in the third quarter, and after improving our provisions in our U.K. business, and the improvement of the debt has been reduced. So that means that we have an average balance that is stable. However, the net financial results show an increase of 131 million, 15.2% and now we have a figure of 904 &#x2013; 994 million.</p>
          <p>And the main items that explained this evolution are not in principle linked to debt management and they are the following. First, a lower rate of deficit remuneration that has negative impact of 66 million. So it's a remuneration system that is linked to the euro however three months of the previous year, so last year, it was 4.3% and this year, it's 0.73. And the sum of less dividends that have been collected through EDP, and the effect of the hedging derivatives. As you know, we are covering the currency issue in the accounts and others which have an impact of &#x20AC;34 million. Other items, most basically financial provisions linked to tax updatings and pensions explain the other 68 million of negative impact.</p>
          <p>The net recurrent profit show a growth of 6.7%, 1,840 million. The lower contribution of non-recurrent profit and a tax rate of 21.5% versus 20.8% one year ago mean that the net profits go up 2% versus 6.7% for recurrent profits. The improvement in operating results increases by 14.4% and the operating cash flow for the group, as the Chairman said, reaches almost &#x20AC;4 billion.</p>
          <p>Regarding the funding issues, as the Chairman also said, we start this part talking about the tariff deficit. The tariff deficit in the first nine months of the year represented &#x20AC;803 million more for IBERDROLA. &#x20AC;1.111 billion gross and since some is being collected from the deficit, the net is around &#x20AC;803 million. It has to be stated that the process to place the tariff deficit has continued to move forward as planned, as the Chairman said.</p>
          <p>The road shows have already been held to position the deficit, and we now just require the approval of the brochure. And once this has been done, the first step will take place, in the coming weeks we expect, because we expect that the approval of the brochure will take place next week. The IBERDROLA board also approved in its meeting yesterday the implementation of a new scrip dividend for the year &#x2013; dividend for 2010.</p>
          <p>The price for the purchase of the rights by IBERDROLA would be a minimum of &#x20AC;0.143, the level of the dividend per share was paid in 2009. And the mathematical expectation for the price of the share would be 0.146%, which would represent an increase of 2.1% with respect to the dividend per share.</p>
          <p>And to provide maximum transparency in the market, we attach the plan schedule. Pending final confirmation, payment will be made on December 28 and new shares would start to be listed on December 29, 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding the financial situation of the group, equity at the end of 2010 were over &#x20AC;31 billion, 1.85 billion more than a year ago, while net debt without considering the tariff deficit was &#x20AC;25.67 billion, 661 million less than a year ago and 896 million less than the closing of the first semester.</p>
          <p>Leverage finally was 45.3%, 390 basis points better than in September 2009, 49.2%, and it also lower than that recorded at the closing of the first semester. If we include the tariff deficit, the debt is &#x20AC;30 billion, 450 million more than last year. Although leverage also improved by 120 basis points and is 49.2% including the tariff deficit. This improvement in the group's leverage is in line with the objectives for 2010.</p>
          <p>This strict debt control together with growth achieved in the generation of operating cash flow enables the company to increase the financial ratio significantly versus the same period last year. And the management scales of the company have made it possible to more than observe the effect of the tariff deficit. So that ratios in September 2010 including the tariff deficit are even better than those of September 2009.</p>
          <p>Even if we excluded the effect of the tariff deficit, the FFO over debt net ratio improved 4.5 points to 21.3%. Including the tariff deficit, it would be 18.2%, as I said, improving the figure for September 2009. The recurring cash flow over net debt improved by 6.4 points. That is 60% in one year, reaching a figure of 17%. Including the tariff deficit, it would also reach a level of 14.5%, again, comparing very favorably with the data for September, 2009.</p>
          <p>We also have had the good business developments and the positive effects derived from the scrip dividend, the divestment of the Connecticut gas distributors and other divestments that will be announced soon. And all this will enable us to more than comply with the financial objectives, financial solvency objectives for 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding the debt breakdown by sources of funding, we have suitable diversification and important weight of finance debt is in the capital market. The recent issue of bonds that the Chairman mentioned, &#x20AC;750 million, will slightly increase the weight of the bonds market over debt in line with the group's policy.</p>
          <p>Regarding the debt structure by currency the exchange rate hedging policy reduces risk in the operating accounts by funding businesses in the local or functional currency. The debt in euros represents 52.9% of the total, while the debt in pounds and dollars is 24 and 20% respectively.</p>
          <p>Regarding the debt structure by interest rate, we maintained the prudent structure, with 45% of debt at a variable rate and 55% at a fixed rate. In September, the group is closer to its objective structure, or to have it increased by almost two points the percentage of fixed rate debt compared to June. And in September this year, the company, as the Chairman said, successfully did a bond re-buy for &#x20AC;600 million.</p>
          <p>These bonds have a maturity of 2011 and 2013, while the issued bonds have a maturity of 2020. And this way, the half life of the debt has been increased by more than two months. The improvement of the liquidity position by reducing liquidities in 2011 and 2013 and 10-year funding at a very competitive cost, 4.12%, which improves the average cost of the all &#x2013; amortized debt of 5.63%.</p>
          <p>And in October, a six-year issue was made of &#x20AC;750 million with a 3.5% coupon. All this has led to an even further improvement in our excellent liquidity position. We currently have over &#x20AC;10 billion in liquidity and available credit lines. It's a very comfortable situation that enables us to face the fourth quarter in 2011 very calmly.</p>
          <p>What we will foreseeably do with this liquidity is to use it to continue to amortize expensive debt, including the final part of the live syndicated debt of ScottishPower. The average life for the debt is 6.2 years after having increased it by more than two months in this last quarter. The maturity schedule shows a comfortable and stable profile, and as the Chairman said, thanks to its liquidity position, its needs are covered until 2012.</p>
          <p>And now, the Chairman will conclude the presentation of results. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that after this magnificent presentation by the CFO, there's little I can add. I'm just going to try to ratify once again that the results of these first nine months of 2010 show that capability of the group to grow in a sustainable way and the word sustainable is something that we use all the time in this firm, thanks to that diversified business portfolio, diversified by activities and geographic areas. In the first nine months, we have obtained an increase of 12.4% in operating results and 6% in recurrent net profits. And it has been possible, thanks to this increase in output of 10% in production with a major contribution from the reduced variable cost and emission-free technologies.</p>
          <p>In all countries where we operate, there has been a contribution to this increase, 14% contribution in Spain. The good situation of the wind power business in the U.S., where output increased by 22%, production in the U.K. that grew by 8%. And finally energy generated in Latin America, which grew 2% and the renewable assets in the various countries in Europe and Latin America have also increased their output by 22%.</p>
          <p>And the results are an effect of something that we're very proud of in the firm and that is the ongoing efficiency improvements implemented in the various businesses. And we are exporting this knowledge, ideas and actions from one country to another. And thanks to this effort, we have increased the gross margin by 9%, reducing expenses in the period by 2.2%.</p>
          <p>And I said earlier that all businesses have contributed to this. In Spain, the group is carrying out the transition to a fully liberalized market or almost completely liberalized market efficiency. And we have done this by dropping expenses 2% on a like-to-like basis. And in the U.K. ScottishPower has also reduced its recurrent expenses in pounds by 1% and in the U.S. they have been reduced by 18%. Renewables has improved its cost per installed megawatt and is still a growing business by almost 4%.</p>
          <p>The other key element has been the improvement, as the CFO said, of our financial situation, thanks on the one hand to the increase in equity and that debt reduction, our leverage has dropped to a level of 45% with a substantial improvement compared to last year. The financial ratios have also undergone a major strengthening, thanks to this cash generation of more than 14% during the period.</p>
          <p>We have a liquidity of more than 10 billion, which provides complete coverage for our possible financial needs over the next two years. And talking about prospects for the business in the rest of the year, we hope on the one hand that the regulated businesses will improve in all our geographic areas.</p>
          <p>In the United States, with the coming into effect of the new tariffs for New York. In Brazil, where we expect that demand will continue to grow with this positive trend in the first nine months of the year. In the U.K., because it will continue to maintain this positive trend, thanks to the tariff increases that came into effect at the beginning of the year and that will continue during this period.</p>
          <p>In Renewables, because we believe that if the wind blows, there will continue to be a strong growth, thanks to the increase in output and price stability. And in liberalized businesses, because of the good development in Spain, a market where all the energy, as the CFO said, is completely sold for the year and this will partially offset or completely offset the weaker situation in the U.K. Unlike what happened last year, we will continue to maintain our approach on operating efficiency in all businesses, and we hope that in the U.S. this will materialize significantly.</p>
          <p>And finally, the solid financial position of the group will continue to be reinforced, thanks on the one hand to the improvement in the maturity profile, as the CFO said, to that reduction in debt the result of investment controls on the one hand, and the expected collection of the outstanding amounts from the tariff deficit.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, this collection process for the tariff deficit is being slower than we all expected, but as has also been said, we believe that the final steps are being taken. This means that we have improved our expectations as regards operating results and that we're going to maintain the expectations we had for recurrent net profit.</p>
          <p>As regards remuneration of the shareholder, we have maintained our policy of recent years, which means that we will maintain or improve our dividend in line with the evolution of the total net profit. And to finish and beyond 2010, I would like to underscore the excellent position of the group as regards growing in a sustainable manner in the medium and long-term.</p>
          <p>In recent years, IBERDROLA has set up a portfolio of businesses in markets that provide recurrent flow of funds. And this cash generation capability linked to cautious and active management of our liabilities have allowed us to strengthen the balance sheet of our company in a period in which the situation of the financial markets has not been stable. And we have seen this in the accounts that have just been presented.</p>
          <p>So we have maintained our commitment in very difficult market situations with an A credit rating and we've continued with our remuneration policy for the shareholder. So, that means that IBERDROLA is looking at the future in the markets with the growth potential, with the necessary investment capability to make use of the many opportunities that these markets are offering.</p>
          <p>And in the United States, we have wonderful development prospects in terms of renewables and grids. And in the case of the LatAm, apart from the investment in our distributor, will also include our line to Maine. And the U.K. is going to be investing a lot in energy infrastructures, which the Ministry of Energy could soon have said that they will be investing more than &#xA3;200 million until the end of 2020.</p>
          <p>And we hope that ScottishPower will carry on developing its distribution of grids within the revision that has been issued and that they will increase the investments in transport, so that they can reinforce the current grids and increase the interconnection between Scotland and England and also provide connections for the many onshore wind projects and offshore wind projects.</p>
          <p>And with the scenario &#x2013; the certain scenario defined by the strategic group of energy and networks which has been jointly presided over by the Ministry of Energy and the Ofgem regulator means that total investments in the transport business are going to be in excess of &#xA3;20 billion in 2011 and &#x2013; between 2011 and 2018. As you know, ScottishPower is the second most important transport in the U.K. after National Grid.</p>
          <p>As regards the liberalized business, the U.K. now is facing the challenge of renovating a significant part of its current generation park. And as you know, the group has an extensive portfolio of projects in the nuclear, gas and clean coal technologies. And IBERDROLA RENOVABLES is a leader in the onshore wind business in the U.K. and has a large portfolio of projects in marine wind technology and that will be constructed as from 2012 with the West of Duddon Sands park or wind farm.</p>
          <p>And as regards Brazil, the group can grow in the distribution business in which demand is growing a lot, as I've said before, as well as in the field of hydroelectric generation. And before the end of this fiscal year, we'll be commissioning three new hydroelectric power stations that will be incorporated to the other six built over the last few years.</p>
          <p>And likewise, we have an extensive portfolio of hydroelectric projects. And the most important one has to do with the involvement of Bello Montaigne in &#x2013; you know that it's a macro project and it's going to have an installed power of 11,000 hydraulic megawatts.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, next year, we will initiate the construction of 250 megawatts in wind power in addition to those that we already have, thanks to the tender we just won in August. And in Mexico, we are putting our stakes on any new opportunities cropping up in the generation business and we'll grow to in the wind business, where apart from the 80 megawatts we have in operation, we have another additional under construction.</p>
          <p>IBERDROLA RENOVABLES is also starting to grow in other European countries like Romania and Poland and in the near future, in the German offshore operations, where we are developing a 500 megawatt project. And to this matter, IBERDROLA will not only working to achieve the objectives that were set for the 2010, 2012 period that we presented a few months ago and which we are presenting again here today, but also in the long-term, because that's going to be full of opportunities to carry on growing in a sustainable manner. And you can be sure that all the men and women of this group will be working as hard as we can to maximize results, so that we can benefit all of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And now, we're going to move on to the Q&amp;A session. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I'm Raimundo Fern&#xE1;ndez-Cuesta [Nomura] is the name. Three questions. Two that are more of a general nature, one has to do with what we really think about, which is regulation in Spain, and recently, we've had a tariff increase that has been positive. And then we have the issue of the domestic coal, which it seems that you have filed an appeal against that. And you also underscored the fact that you are already collecting the costs of the nuclear tax and the social bonus. But what do you think things are like two months later, now that we've seen several uncertainties? Any progress made in recent months and what do you think about next year?</p>
          <p>And challenges for 2010, I'd like to ask the President, what is your biggest concern for next year? Would it be the pricing or would it be the hedging in the U.K. and Spain or the regulation in Spain? Or would it be improving the balance sheet of IBERDROLA U.S.A.? And finally, could you please tell us what has happened with the resignation of the CEO of ScottishPower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll answer the easiest question. The CEO said that he wanted to change his life. And we accepted his change of life and it's true that our main business and our headquarters are in Scotland, because somebody that lives in London, and has to fly up to Scotland all the time could have certain difficulties. But it was &#x2013; well, a moment in his life that he wanted to leave it due to personal reasons.</p>
          <p>I think that the work he has done has been very reasonable during this period of time and that now he will walk down another path. And our plan right now is firstly, the company &#x2013; there is a wonderful management team for grids and for generation and commercial and finance. It's a company that is firmly consolidated and the Director of International Affairs, Amparo Moraleda, will have to go there, will have to go more frequently to the U.K.</p>
          <p>But we are now looking for somebody that has to be British and we will try to avoid having this person traveling from remote distances and we'll try to have this person living in Scotland, whether it be a Scotsman or not, I don't know. But we'll do as much as we can so that this person is closer to the production centers of the company that are on the area of Scotland.</p>
          <p>Now, as regards the issues we are concerned about for 2011, well, I think that the usual concerns, in other words the variables that we're permanently working on, how can we maximize our revenues, how can we optimize our expenses, how can we improve our balance sheet? So it's the conclusions that I've presented before.</p>
          <p>There are a number of countries with a number of opportunities. In some countries, opportunities are much more related to efficiency improvements, in other countries, they are much more linked to growth opportunities and in other countries, they are much more linked to the potential growth. And next year is going to be an important year as regards renewables, as regards offshore launches. And we'll initiate constructions in the Irish Sea in the early months of 2012, but everything has to be prepared in 2011. It's a new landmark for the company. The investments are going to be very sizable.</p>
          <p>And then as far as grids are concerned, we have a very significant challenge with the transmission line from Canada to New England, 800 kilometers. It's like connecting Idun in the north of Spain to Cadiz down in the South. It's like crossing all of Spain from North to South, when we're talking about this in terms of kilometers. It's like &#x2013; no, it's like installing a first post and ending up somewhere close to Africa, in Cadiz and that's what we have to do. So this is a challenge and we have to cross a country full of forest and many obstacles. So that's a very significant effort.</p>
          <p>And then we have some very important efforts. We have to carry on optimizing our efficiency in the case of the States. We have a framework that provides us incentives to be efficient, so we will try to benefit from those measures, from those challenges that the North American regulator has given us to improve efficiencies, so we will be working in that field.</p>
          <p>In the United Kingdom, we have potential discussion of all those aspects related to transport and Gene has asked for the investment plans so that we can set up a regulatory framework, not for four years as we have in distribution, but for eight years, that's a much larger time horizon. So we have to define that plan and we have to negotiate the terms and see how the remuneration can work. So we have some significant regulatory challenges in that country.</p>
          <p>And as far as Spain is concerned, I think that the big challenge we had this year was to put an end to the problem of the deficit. And I think that with the approval, I hope that this will take place next year, the approval of the brochures and with the road shows already done by the ministries involved. We hope that the placements will be immediate. So, that means that this is an issue that will be fully overcome.</p>
          <p>But then in the case of Spain, we have to be fully realistic. Why? Because in Spain, we have a situation that we've experienced in recent years as the CFO pointed out very clearly, that prices of the ordinary regime are lower, lower than those of most of the &#x2013; of our competitors. We're talking about &#x20AC;15 less in Spain. So the problem of energy cost does not linked to the production, the traditional cost. But the &#x2013; what &#x2013; this has been caused in Spain by some very generous premiums for technologies that are basically solar and this is something that everybody should understand.</p>
          <p>This means that in some technologies, we have much more than any other neighboring countries, although these countries are smaller, when they are investments for other areas and other technologies that more than a solution, more than energy solution, this is a financial solution. It's a financial product because the energy contribution they can make is very low and the cost is tremendously high.</p>
          <p>And for instance, this year, it could be &#x20AC;7 billion, of which more than two-thirds have to do with solar technologies that only provide 2% of the total energy versus the rest of it, which is wind power, which provides 17 to 18% and it only receives one-third of those premiums. So we have to address this issue and I think that the administration is looking into this, but this is the big challenge.</p>
          <p>If we want to have as the British said, if we want to have expensive technology, we'll have to convince the Spaniards that, that costs a certain amount of money. If you want to be the first in the class in immature technology, somebody has to pay and this is I think that what we are facing now.</p>
          <p>Spain needs infrastructures and we'll have to make investment and they will have to be remunerated adequately. And finally, regulation in Spain, I think that I've already mentioned this only as domestic coal. What do we think about the issue of domestic coal? I think that the appeal has been filed and we think that in terms of coal, there is an issue. But it is a little bit contradictory, because on the one hand we are giving our support to emission free fuels and then by investing lots of money, we are also giving support in technologies that produce more emissions.</p>
          <p>This in the long run is an additional cost and it doesn't benefit consumers and it's also distorting the market and so on and so forth. So I believe that it's a distortion &#x2013; distorting element and it's a little bit contradictory in relation to the policy that has to do with climate change, the policy that has been implemented in the country.</p>
          <p>I've said this in previous forums. I think that there is a social problem and I also believe that it's not only a non-social problem. So we have to find a solution, we have to find a solution to this problem. But the social problem cannot be found by spoiling the market structure and by spoiling climate change model or by spoiling the model that has to do with those strategic decisions that we've taken in the country. So we have to solve the social problem as we solved other social problems some time ago, like the shipyards or the steel factories, but not spoiling an overall market framework, which could even be conducive to issues that could be related to state aid, which is what has been denunciated by the main stakeholders.</p>
          <p>But in any case, I would like to say that at Iberdrola, you know that coal is a pretty small operation in our mix. So in this field, we are just looking at our colleagues who are playing a much more relevant role in the field of coal and they are using it much more than we are.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Virginia Sanz from Deutsche Bank. I had several questions. First of all, regarding the securitization, I would like to know whether you can give us some feedback on how that had been welcomed by investors? And in this current political environment and environment or uncertainty in the regulatory environment, do you think there might be problems in placement? Because the people I talked are still quite skeptical, even though there is a sovereign guarantee behind this.</p>
          <p>And I would also like to ask whether you can explain developments in forward prices in Spain? I see that the differential with Germany in the first quarter compared to the third has greatly diminished and why sincerely, I don't understand it, since there is quite a lot of water and wind in the system and over capacity? Could you explain this development?</p>
          <p>And also continuing with the price issue, I would like to know all this is happening with Sonatrach and the gas contract. Could this have any future replications on electricity prices? I don't know whether that gas is used to produce electricity or not?</p>
          <p>And directly related to the company, I would like to know whether you could give us some estimates for ScottishPower for generation in retail for 2011? What should we expect there and also CapEx for 2011 for IBERDROLA? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll answer the last question. We're still in the kitchen working on the budget, so I can't give you any figures. The budget is usually ready in November, when we start to have some realistic data to be approved in the last Board Meeting in December, which is usually held around December 15, 20. So I currently don't have anything I can give you. Regarding the effect of gas, the prices of natural gas, well, Paco, you can give us more details. It doesn't affect us at all.</p>
          <p>We have agreements with the Algerians in the prices we have. But the other gas we buy from Gas Natural is indexed to the other prices, so it's absolutely independent. However, if it has some kind of effect, Paco, perhaps you can comment on this and also developments on forward prices and you can say something about securitization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, starting with forward price conversions, what has happened is that prices in Germany and France are coming closer to the Spanish prices, which are very stable prices since some months ago and as Virginia said, reflect the availability of water and wind in Spain. So it's a marginal price, a pure marginal gas price and in Germany and France, where there was a certain spread in that marginal price, a certain possibility of remuneration to the fixed cost that's closing.</p>
          <p>And regarding Sonatrach and Gas Natural, this dates back a long time. It's an arbitration from 2007 and it is complicated, because arbitration of such an impressive amount, 25 Bcms over three years, 2007, 2008 and 2009, is a very complicated arbitration.</p>
          <p>We are constantly reviewing contracts and with exception of Gas Natural, do we go to arbitration. So it's very complicated to go to arbitration. And it's arbitration where Sonatrach has been told that they are right, and it's very difficult to transfer that to the customers. Certainly not in our case, our contract has nothing to do with that. We've been through two arbitrations with Gas Natural regarding these prices.</p>
          <p>The tariff in Spain, well, in 2008, the gas tariff has nothing to do with the supply contract either. And before, the tariff didn't used to be sent based on the prices of natural gas with a pass through. Another method was used. So it seems very unlikely for this arbitration to be passed on to the customers.</p>
          <p>I don't know whether there are any contracts with any customers that include this, but it would be a marginal thing. And prices in Spain, I don't think there is going to be any effect on market prices, and on customer prices. It will have to be digested by Gas Natural. And I assume that they have taken the proper accounting measures, but it's not going to affect us at all.</p>
          <p>Lithuania, I think that regarding the securitization, the investor that buys the securitization is not the investor that's concerned about the regulatory aspects. It's an investor in fixed income, and it's covered by the Spanish treasury. And therefore the spread will be referred to an equal placement. So the investor that this operation is aimed at is a fixed income investor that probably has lot to do with sovereign risk. And the rating agencies have assessed the treasury guarantee and they are giving it the rating of an issue with the guarantee of the Spanish treasury.</p>
          <p>And we are probably in the best Spanish treasury issuing conditions in the last seven or eight months. And if the operation were carried out now, I believe that there would be a very good demand for this operation because as you know, the Spanish treasury spread is improving, and fortunately, the Spanish treasury is getting out of, let's say, the contagion area.</p>
          <p>So, the conditions for the placement of the deficit are good and we think that there can be considerable demand and the price will depend on the spread, let's say. That will be established by the fixed income investors in relation to the sovereign risk. It is not the variable income investor. It's somebody that's going to buy a bond because the treasury guarantee is behind it. So, we think, that these are very good conditions right now for the operation to take place and for it to take place successfully. We've issued, as you've seen, and the treasury is issuing. So, I think, that the conditions are right now are suitable for a good operation to take place.</p>
          <p>Very good. Next question from the floor?</p>

          <p>Hello, good morning. Alejandro Vigil from Cygnus Asset Management. I have three questions. One would be on the liberalized business in Spain. You've given an average price of &#x20AC;57 per megawatt hour. And I would like to know what concepts this price includes? And also the vision for 2011, you said stability, so I assume it will be a similar price, but can you elaborate on this?</p>
          <p>And another question on liberalized business, in the U.K., we've seen the strong drop in EBITDA. Do you consider that's been normalized for 2011? Will that level be a recurrent EBITDA, the one we saw for 2010?</p>
          <p>And the last question on renewables, you mentioned it on Monday, but if you could be a bit more explicit regarding the regulatory schedule, whether this uncertainty will be clarified regarding the wind and solar tariffs before the end of the year? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can say yesterday it was denied by the Ministry, the news that was published in the media saying that the decrease or the ministerial orders for these small adjustments, because in the end, what they want to bring out are small adjustments. And they said that the delegate commission have taken a step back and we had an interview with the Minister yesterday. And the Minister said it also yesterday, that it's absolutely false that no documents had been taken to the delegate committee on that. And that there are no snags or objectives and they just are trying to cover other collateral issues. So he said yesterday and authorized me to say that it's absolutely false. These are literally the words the Minister used yesterday. So there has been nothing regarding this issue, and they're going through the internal processes.</p>
          <p>Having said this, the problem &#x2013; if we want to talk about a problem in renewables, it's not in wind energy. In wind energy, some improvements or adjustments can be made. But we're having remuneration levels and earning levels that are much similar to neighboring countries. The problem in Spain is called solar energy, photovoltaic energy in the past and the statement was made that 466 megawatt hour, now thermal solar energy and this is gas plus sun and when there is no sun, they run on gas.</p>
          <p>But we are paying gas at the same price as sun at &#x20AC;300-odd per megawatt hour, and this means that the price when there is sun is close to &#x20AC;700. And this is what's going to take us, if measures aren't taken, to an increase of around 3 billion per year more. And there are two ways of handling this, by increasing prices, increasing the toll or shutting down. And I think that's it. What done is done and what hasn't been done, well, you can take the necessary steps not to do it. Because if you do it, you're going to make the system 10 or 12% more expensive just in tolls alone to provide 2% energy. 2% energy, 20% costs and a lot of that energy is produced with gas paying the price of gas at the price of sunlight.</p>
          <p>That's the reality, and it has to be said that clearly and those that want to understand will understand. It's is not a wind problem. Wind power is an energy solution, 18, 20% of the energy in Spain. And all logical countries are using it as the big energy solution as an alternative, not the only one, but another one. Thermal solar, like photovoltaic energy in the past, in photovoltaic energy, we made the major investment at the top of the learning curve. If they were done today, they would cost 70% less, we made a mistake, or we didn't establish the proper framework to do it.</p>
          <p>In thermal solar energy we are about to repeat the same, but we're still in time to stop it. And if we don't want to stop it, we have to say to Spaniards, we have the most expensive energy in Spain, because we have the power stations that nobody else has, the most expensive in the world. And we pay thermal solar energy at &#x20AC;700 megawatt hour. And we have to say that clearly, gas plus sun, we pay at the price of sun, &#x20AC;700 per megawatt hour or at 300 or 300-odd when we have both gas and sun. And storage, storage runs on gas. If there is no sun, you have to use gas. And nobody does solar storage, only in Spain.</p>
          <p>I think it's fine technologically to have two or three plants in Spain for research purposes, perfect, but not to develop technology on a massive stage, if they are just at the early stages of development, unless we are willing to pay it. The British are saying, Go Green, &#xA3;60 more per consumer and that's it.</p>
          <p>Paco, the average price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. As we mentioned out on page 19 of the presentation, I think it was in the footnote, this average price includes, well, first, it's awaiting of what we sell in the different markets, as I think was mentioned some time ago, it's very difficult to find two kilowatt hour at the same price and the price can range from &#x20AC;30-something up to &#x20AC;80-something as a function of your needs and many other things.</p>
          <p>Well, this is a wait effect of what we sell in all the markets and what the footnote says on page 19 of the presentation, it include spot sales and the commercial margin for the nine months that have gone by.</p>
          <p>And prospects for 2011, well as we've also said, they are stable at those pricing levels, not at levels are 57, because 57 are levels of nine months. And the year will not close at that figure, it would be somewhat lower, because these sales don't back quite a lot when you renovate the sales chain. They adapt to the market that is somewhat lower than when those sales were made some time ago.</p>
          <p>So 50 quite a lot, well, perhaps not 57, perhaps 56 or 55 something like that or 54 and stable, which is what we're seeing from next year. And we've already closed or we've already placed or we've already committed out up 50 gigawatt hour, which is basically the sum of our emission free generations, hydraulic nuclear plus some wind power, which as you know, we purchased through a contract with our renewables firm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As regards the situation of margins in the U.K. and prospects for the future, firstly, the situation we have in 2010 has to do with the market dynamic. And for instance, prices were reduced by 3% in the first semester, in electricity; 7.5% in gas, and gas has gone down 8%, and that they're now buying &#x2013; we've been buying with a reduction for nine months plus the price revision from the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>So, a price slump &#x2013; slump in demand of 2% and also a slump in imports, so that means that the levels have gone down, generally speaking. But in any case and as regards the U.K. prices, we hope that there will be a recovery in prices, because we're seeing that there is a growing trend in the case of raw materials and also an increase in environmental costs that are being connected to the tariff. And we operators have to do something about this, because this was published by Ofgem and we can see in that segment, the margins are basically very narrow.</p>
          <p>But in any case, I would like to stress again the situation of the market that we have right now and we think that it's going to be recovered in terms of prices in the mid-term. And in wholesale and generation, it has to be said that we are improving the availability levels and that the generation margins in the U.K. are objectively low. And we hope that they will increase and that our slump in results can be explained by a lower activity of National Grid in our areas of influence. In other words, they have had less opportunities as regards the restrictions this year. There have been much less opportunities of doing anything along these lines. But in any case, we're still focusing on efficiency and efficacy, and on cost reduction and we are convinced that we will eventually fully recover these figures.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, any more questions from the room?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. Hello, yesterday on the radio, an academic mentioned, in the U.K., he mentioned that he thought that the solution for this was to take the costs out of the electrical system and to take them out of other items, because the costs at the social level were aggressive, do you have any views on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are all sorts of opinions, of course. And Ofgem last year published a document, a very extensive document, where they described all the alternatives. And then Ofgem said that, yes, but the only alternative that was not being discussed was the market alternative, that they were not going to go back in any fields because they're not allowed to go back because they are very convinced that that is how things should be done.</p>
          <p>So, I have to say, for instance ,and in these conversations I've held with Ofgem, or comments and that is talking about 2018, the British people are looking far away now. And I said before that the transport groups are planning investments 10 years in advance, that we're now going to discuss with them a 10-year investment plan with a remuneration system established for that period, that we have a framework for investments and distribution for five years, or four-point-something years, with a perfectly defined framework.</p>
          <p>And one of the issues that they've been thinking about, and this is something they've published in their documents, is that the fact that you're massively introducing unpredictable technologies like offshore wind power requires a back-up of thermal power for those moments when there is no wind. And the only way you can have that backup is by paying &#x2013; by making capacity payments.</p>
          <p>In Spain, we've done the opposite. We've placed a back-up. We've used renewables massively. We had a backup that was using that power guarantee and it was reduced. It was cut back and it's like walking in two directions, one with long-term planning and giving assurances for investments and one has to do with a very short-term modality that is ever-changing.</p>
          <p>So this is why I think that this is just another of the elements of the discussion. But it's very clear that the U.K., in our conversations with them and in what they've said publicly, is all about market, market, market and market. And this is something you can find in the programs of both political parties. How can they attract investments to the country by giving them as many assurances as possible, so that the investment costs are as low as possible, so that we can make our citizens pay less, so both the Liberal Democrat party and the Conservative party and the Labour party, all of them are in agreement with that approach.</p>
          <p>Well, if there are no further questions in the room, let's move on to the telephone questions. There is a question coming in now, I think. Yes, the first question will be asked by Mr. Pablo Cuadrado from Merrill Lynch. Pablo, please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I have four or five questions, but I'll try to be very brief. The first question has to do with the distribution business in Spain. We've seen some very good results, although, in terms of regulation, it has to be updated with investments, and you have explained this very well, that there's been an improvement in efficiency and that costs have been allocated to TUR and that you've also spoken about changes in the books that have proved &#x2013; and improved a bit. Could you please tell us what you expect, in terms of growth, for the end of the year, and do you think that you can maintain double-digit EBITDA growth?</p>
          <p>And the second question has to do with the business in Latin America and Brazil. And the regulator has proposed regulatory changes based on reducing capital costs and also based on eliminating part of the revenue profile, because of the growth in demand. And could you please give us the time schedule for this revision and do you think there's going to be a big impact? And then, could you please quantify the impact of the social bonus in this year in the liberalized business?</p>
          <p>And secondly, could you give us a forecast of the rate of taxation for the end of the year, because between the first half and the second half, there has been a reduction, there is variance. And finally, you've also said that you've increased your stakes in Gamesa. Could you tell us why?</p>
          <p>I think that the President also already said that in IBERDROLA RENOVABLES, it's because there was a liquidity commitment. They were going to do that in renewables. But why have you increased your stake in that company? And are you going to carry on along those same lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that you can ask &#x2013; answer practically all these questions, Paul. Gamesa, we have always invested in Gamesa. Gamesa submitted strategic plans a short time ago and there is an important part that has linked to the product, because we have some wonderful engineers in this company and they've told us that the products that they want to launch, both time-wise and design-wise and quality-wise, are going to be magnificent.</p>
          <p>And they are going to have a magnificent technological platform, because these are products that are not only going to be standard products, but they can also be improved from an operating perspective and a qualitative perceptive. And they're going to be much more competitive too, compared to other manufacturers' products.</p>
          <p>So our engineers believe that this is a very favorable issue. But we believe, well, and we have <mark type="inaudible" /> but in the next few months, we'll be placing the first order for the machines of 4.5 to 4.7 megawatts. 4.5 megawatts, which is the machine they have prototypes for and that's highly probable. Then in the next few weeks or months, we'll be making or placing our orders for these machines to be installed in 2012, so that they can be delivered in 2012 and they can be up and running in 2013. So this is the state-of-the-art machine, it's a giant.</p>
          <p>And they have some already installed in Arag&#xF3;n and we're going to be placing the first orders for these with this company, because our engineers believe that the product is perfectly finished. And our economic and financial experts have studied the plan and they like the plan. So it seems that it is a coherent plan. It seems that it makes sense from the industrial point of view.</p>
          <p>And that it's going to improve our executions and in these two parameters, we believe that the product that they're going to be launching is good and the plan, our people, our staff, that there is much more than those of us that are here think that it's been properly drawn up and it makes sense. We believe that the share is cheap and if there is something that's good and cheap and we've been investors all our lives, we've bought it and we'll possibly carry on buying. Won't we, Pepe?</p>
          <p>But in any case, what I do have to say is that our point of view in this issue, you know that we've always been in the scenario of 15 or 26-point something, it's always been the scenario and we have no interest in exceeding that limit of 30. This has to be very clear. I don't want everybody to be thinking things incorrectly. So, we sold 10% and perhaps we might buy another package in these coming months, but this is what the scenario's like, but always with this vision of remaining with this company and supporting this company, because we believe that our engineers and Xavier has some wonderful engineers under his charge. And they say that the products that they are developing are very valid, very good and that they are going to be reasonably priced and their operating costs are going to be lower than the operating costs we have right now. Growth in Spain, Jos&#xE9; Luis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you pointed out before, in the remuneration EBITDA, you &#x2013; we can find both things. There's an accounting issue on the one hand. And this is something that is done every year. So, in other words, the remuneration or distribution is established through these liquidations or settlements by the National Energy Commission. The settlements are temporary and provisional. And then after that, the definitive settlement is made.</p>
          <p>But in our closings, what we have estimated is a definitive closing, which is normally based on a criteria of caution. Because in last month, we have the definitive settlements of the years 2006 and 2007 and that has given us a remuneration of &#x20AC;100 million, which means that if this &#x2013; but that's last year, wasn't it?</p>
          <p>Without this extra remuneration, the increase of the EBITDA would have been something like 9% which is somewhat lower, slightly lower. Because there has also been a reduction in costs, as you pointed out before. But what we have maintained, in terms of remuneration for 2009 and 2010, is the provisional remuneration from the Ministry, which we hope will possibly by the end of this year, will be made definitive. And this is what has been determined by the National Energy Commission. And this could provide us with an increase of something like &#x20AC;150 million from now until the end of the year.</p>
          <p>That is, if the government follows the recommendations made by the National Energy Commission in the distribution decree that said that the new remuneration system had to be established as soon as the reference model was implemented for the group. And it's already up and running and the remuneration system is not up and running, and we hope that this will be so by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Then as far as Brazil goes, I have to say about Brazil that, yes, there has been a change in remuneration by Anil. They are reducing the capital costs and this has been produced by the reduction of interest rates and this is affecting the new rate cases.</p>
          <p>And it has to be said, too, that the two main companies, Goelba and Gossede, underwent their revision last year and they won't undergo another one until another three or four years go by and the first revision is going to be <mark type="inaudible" /> and I think that's going to be in 2012. So these new remuneration systems will not affect us until &#x2013; well, three years have gone by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Paco, what about the social bonus, how many people are affected by the social bonus on &#x2013; in the country? And do you have any data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that it's about 4 million in Spain, and it's 1.3 million, so there has been a massive acceptance, yes. There has been a very big acceptance, something along those lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what about the tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the tax rate this month has been reduced. Why? Because they've applied a one point reduction in the corporate tax structure in the U.K. So this reduction of one point has influenced us in relation to all the deferred taxes that we've included on our balance sheet, that we've had to recalculate with the reduction of the tax rate. And that means that we've had a reduction of, I think of &#x20AC;6 million to &#x20AC;8 million in the consolidated results. And this is something that is not going to be repeated again in December. So the rate in December perhaps will have a slight increase.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Alberto Gandolfi from UBS. Go ahead, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. Alberto Gandolfi, UBS. And I also have some questions, but fairly quick questions. First of all, in slide 13, there are 129 million in non-recurrent figures, could you give a breakdown by items, please? And could you also tell us how much the tax &#x2013; the recurrent tax rate could be next year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in the non-regulated business, starting with Spain, you're talking about &#x20AC;2 to &#x20AC;3 megawatt hour in price drop for next year. Could you also talk about thermal margins, the spreads? What are your expectations? And since the hydro situation is fairly positive this year, how much do you think it could be in a normal hydro year, regarding Spanish generation next year?</p>
          <p>And a follow-up on Alejandro's question. I don't &#x2013; didn't exactly understand whether you think the EBITDA for generation and supply in England in the first half could be considered to be recurrent or not?</p>
          <p>And another question, a bit more on the big picture. Do you think, if there was an unforeseeable event, such as delay in securitization or unplanned regulatory measure, would your aim be to continue to be A-minus, or would A triple plus be sufficient in view of the economic framework?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll answer the last question. It could be an earthquake, a nuclear bomb catastrophe where the dams could burst, lots of things could happen. But in the scenario we're considering, we believe that, in general, well, I don't say, it's said by all the gurus, that the worst of the crisis is over. And I think that we've obtained good grades.</p>
          <p>The financial situation at the FCO is very comfortable, 10 billion in liquidity, equity of 31 billion, debt-EBITDA ratios or generated cash flow over debt ratios, that have boomed in the, say, last few months and we don't see any circumstances or reasons to believe otherwise. There was a drop in demand of 4% in most markets last year. And now we're talking about an increase in demand in practically all markets last year. We went from a situation of an economic decrease in practically all markets. And this year, with the exception of Spain, all the other markets are growing positively and the expectations for next year in all markets, including the Spanish market, is that there will be a positive growth.</p>
          <p>So I think that we've already been through the catastrophe in 2009 and in this first three quarters of 2010. And we've survived, and we have results that show that our balance sheet is being consolidated and permanently improved regarding debt, equity et cetera and cash generation.</p>
          <p>Regarding the beta for 2011, I'll say the same I said to Virginia. I'd be delighted to share them once I have them, but we're still working on them. I don't have data. I don't know whether <mark type="inaudible" /> is here. He must be in the kitchen working on these data. I don't have the data, so &#x2013; but as soon as I have, I assure you that, as usual, we'll provide them with transparency. But I don't have them, all the data being brought in from all the companies in general.</p>
          <p>And there is an issue I would like to clarify, which is a recurrent issue. The thermal spread, well, in Spain, it doesn't have much of an influence. We sell a product with a price and that's it and the cost isn't influenced by this. It's not the Central European market, it's a different market.</p>
          <p>Our cost, or our results, have nothing to do with that spread. Our results have to do a lot more with that 60% of hydro reserves. We still have 45% more than last year. That has a lot more to do with the availability of our nuclear plants and it has a lot more to do with the wind we're going to have during the year.</p>
          <p>The Liberalized Business Director has just said that we've already sold practically all the production, at a price of more than &#x20AC;50, without resulting to thermal heat. That is, hydro and nuclear and wind power right, Paco? So the others will produce more or less depending on the market price. And this year, we've dropped thermal production by 40% and results not only have not dropped, they have improved substantially. And the tax rate, Jos&#xE9; Luis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the question was, what are recurrent profits and what are non-recurrent profits? Our results are based on the economic magnitude that have to do with our business, and we set aside those economic magnitudes that don't have to do with the business itself. For example, under non-recurrent, we have the dividends, the divestment cost of restructuring plans, and for example, the tax rate that affects us this year and in next two years, but it's been included as something foreign to the business.</p>
          <p>I don't know whether that answered the question. I don't know the tax rate for next year. See, I am not the only one, if that's any comfort. We'll have it once we have the budget ready. Yes, next question, please?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everyone. I have several questions on the same theme and regarding the Spanish market. In the strategic presentation, if I remember correctly, you said that the gas contract wasn't closed yet, and I would like to know whether you could give us an idea about this contract and whether you expect this contract to have a cost below the average gas cost in Spain and also, when met gas is going to come into operation? And finally, what the impact is going to be on liberalized gas and the generation business as result of the 8 Bcms that can come through met gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paco, will you answer that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see, met gas. To be very concise, as partners of met gas, we have access, obviously, to the developments in the project and the project is planned to come into operation in several stages. And at the beginning of 2011, from the physical point of view, the project could come into commercial operation and supply gas. From the contractual point of view, we have no idea what our Spanish colleagues are signing. Colleagues in the council and competitors for the energy in the pipe, competitors for the gas inside the pipe and the partners on the council are building the pipe. So I can't give you an answer on that.</p>
          <p>And if we don't know the figures for others, obviously, we cannot reveal the situation of our contract, and there are confidentiality aspects, and the met gas contract will have a build up, like all contracts, and incremental build-up in the gas volume coming into Spain. And that build-up will logically be done over one, two or three years. And my impression, or my perception, is that the influence it's going to have regarding prices on the Spanish market is practically nil.</p>
          <p>None of the agents in met gas starting with Sonatrach, which is a company that we've had a relationship with for 10 years, an excellent relationship. It's a reliable company, a serious company and a company with which we've never had any problems; very tough meetings, but no problems. Sonatrach is very knowledgeable about the Spanish market and starting with Sonatrach and the other agents, nobody is going to do anything wild and there will be a build-up in met gas that will adopt to the Spanish market, or apply other gases that are currently coming in through Metanet.</p>
          <p>So I think that we can rest assure regarding what's going happen with met gas, although as everyone will understand, I can't give any specific data</p>

          <p>The next question is from Bruno Silva from BPI.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. And thank you for taking my questions. I have three questions. I think they're quick questions. The first is, can you tell us about the impact of the hedging with IBERDROLA RENOVABLES in Spain and the U.K. regarding the EBITDA of the liberalized business after nine months and whether there is any reference price in the U.K. for hedging in 2011?</p>
          <p>The second question is, can you give us some more information on the impact on your estimated results for a full year after the changes in the regulation in the United States?</p>
          <p>And the third question is related to the divestment issue. Can you give us an idea of what's in the pipeline regarding real estate assets and financial stakes? Could you give that some visibility? Are you planning to sell your stakes in regulated businesses in some countries, or are you going to do what you did in the U.S. and sell the whole Connecticut gas assets, for example, can you tell us something about that? And just a detail, I don't know whether you gave it, the impact of the social bonus, or premium, in Spain regarding the impact on costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, divestments &#x2013; as I said, we manage the balance sheet in the most suitable way, properly. And the CFO said that in the next few days, you'll see some other divestments that are about to be concluded. And we'll do it in the same way we've done it in the past, which, well, we'll see.</p>
          <p>We've divested in Connecticut, nobody expected it and we've done other things that nobody expected in Chile or elsewhere. And we'll see in the next few days another divestment that I think is also interesting.</p>
          <p>The social bonus, well, we don't have the figures yet, we have to wait for the end of the year because the major impact comes at the end of the year with higher consumption and, as Paco said, in Spain, we're saying that there are 4 million customers under this bonus. And we have around over 1 million that we are currently supplying. It will be some tens of million of euros, but we'll have it in the results presentation at the end of the year. I'm sure that by then, we'll have these figures.</p>
          <p>The regulatory changes in the United States, well, we haven't worked out the budget for next year, but we have a framework, as I said, which is much more favorable than it was. The new regulatory framework is only going to cover one quarter. The ROE is higher, as well as all the efficiencies that we will achieve over the next four years. That will be shared out between the company and the consumers.</p>
          <p>And we're working very seriously right now to maximize those efficiencies, because that is what is going to substantially improve that nominal ROE. How much next year? Well, again, it's still in the kitchen. But in the next few years, we think that there is going to be a substantial growth. We're going to go from less to more. The efficiency improvements, the base is the same. The base is the same one we have now, but with an improved debt equity ratio and therefore, that gives us more earnings because of that. And then as we gain inefficiency, well, we'll see that progressively from here to 2014.</p>
          <p>Regarding the impact of hedging with RENOVABLES, Paco, you can comment on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The contract with RENOVABLES is a beneficial contract for both sides. It's a long-term contract where both sides benefit. So it doesn't make sense to analyze the specific impact of a few months. And when you look at a few specific months in the year, since it's been thought for the long-term, the figures wouldn't be representative.</p>
          <p>I think that the price at which that contract we signed was a price that was included in the communication given to the stock exchange commission. And I think it's very much inline with the wholesale market right now. So without working out the figures, the exact figures, as the questioner realizes, I think that it's a draw. Neither one of the side wins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that's right. The latest figures, I think that the figure was exactly the same. And seeing how prices are going to evolve a year and a half in advance, there's a lot in favor of you and your team, guessing what the market price is going to be. And you got it right. I can't remember what the price was, but it certainly was a published price, 46, 47 years, I can't remember the figure, but yes, the figures are exactly the actual figures now.</p>

          <p>Well, one hour and fifty minutes have gone by since we started the presentation. We know that there are still questions, but we have to finish. And from the Department of Relations with the investors will be answering your questions. So Ignacio, whenever you want.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much and I only hope and trust that as I said before, that the end of this year results will maintain or improve our performance of the last nine months.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much for your support. And I hope to see you again at the beginning of the year. Thank you very much. Good bye.</p>
