        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by.  Welcome to the First Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call.  At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.  Later we will conduct a question and answer session with instructions being given at that time.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, VP of Investor Relations, Mr. David Myers.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning, everyone.  With me today on the call are George Paz, our CEO, and Jeff Hall, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement.  Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include but are not necessarily limited to financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions.</p>
          <p>These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties.  The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors which are discussed in detail in our SEC filings. In addition, the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can be found in our earnings release, which is posted on our website.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, who will discuss our financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David.  Before I begin my comments on the quarter, I have two administrative comments.  First, as we have said, we expect the NextRx acquisition to close in the second half of 2009.  As a result, neither the first quarter results we provide today nor any forward guidance includes any impact related to NextRx.</p>
          <p>Second, last night we found a typo in the 10-Q we filed, a comment that said we had $2.6 million one-time tax benefit in the first quarter of 2009 should have read that we had a $2.6 million one-time tax benefit in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>With that said, Express Scripts is off to a strong start in 2009. Q1 EPS was $0.86, up 23% year-over-year and better than expectations as a result of strong margin growth and tight SG&amp;A control.  Cash flow from operations was 286 million, up 15% from the prior quarter and EBITDA per Rx grew to $3.06, up 24% from the prior year.  And we are increasing guidance for the year for EBITDA per Rx to $3.20 to $3.30, an annual increase of 20%.</p>
          <p>We attribute this success to the unwavering focus on our model of alignment.  We make money when our clients save money.  And now more than ever, this focus on cost savings combined with our behavior-centric approach is resonating in the marketplace.  As a result, we are also increasing our EPS guidance for the year.</p>
          <p>Before I get into the details, let me just spend a minute talking about our segments.  As I've been telling you for the past few quarters, in order to improve the growth and profitability of our specialty business, we have been integrating the sales and back office support functions with the PBM [Pharmacy Benefit Management].  This consolidation helped our specialty business realize an 84% growth in profitability for 2008.  This consolidation is now complete and as a result, going forward our specialty results will be included with our PBM results.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our quarterly results in a bit more detail.  Our gross profit increased almost 15% from the prior year and was better than our prior guidance.  The primary driver of this performance was our model of alignment and focus on driving cost savings.  We are seeing high levels of interest in our behavior-centric cost savings program and we expect this strong margin performance to continue.</p>
          <p>Our generic fill rate reached 67.7% in the quarter, up 2.6 points from last year.  We believe there is significantly more room to grow the use of generics and low cost brands and further increase the savings for plan sponsors and members.  As we've discussed in the past, the impact of generics is more back end loaded this year, with two thirds of the benefit from new generics coming in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>As expected, SG&amp;A expenses were down significantly in Q1, as seasonal and one-time costs in Q4 did not recur. We finished several projects and we successfully completed the implementation of 226 new clients.  That said, strong expense controls brought in SG&amp;A expense lower than our previous forecast.  Going forward, we expect SG&amp;A to increase as we began a new set of growth projects and making the investments necessary to support our growth.  But as we said last quarter, we still expect SG&amp;A for 2009 to be at 2008 levels.</p>
          <p>The combination of these results led to record EBITDA per script of $3.06 in the quarter.  This is a metric we're extremely proud of because it reflects the tremendous value we create for our clients and members by driving greater use of generics, home delivery, and enhanced specialty management.  Last quarter we told you that adjusted claims would be down 2 to 3% for the year and we're still on track to meet that original guidance.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, we expect to close the acquisition of NextRx in the second half of 2009.  And as a result, we have suspended our share repurchase program.  The lack of repurchases in the year reduces our previous EPS guidance by 0.07 to $0.09.  This decline is more than offset by lower interest rates and improvements in profitability.</p>
          <p>We've added a table with the detail to our press release, but the bottom line is excluding the negative impact from share repurchases, we are increasing our EPS guidance for the year by 0.11 to $0.13 to $3.67 to $3.70.  At the mid point, this represents 20% growth over the prior year and is entirely driven by operating income.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, this guidance range excludes the costs attributable to the NextRx transaction and NextRx results, and we now expect EBITDA per Rx to be in a range of $3.20 to $3.30, and we expect SG&amp;A to be relatively flat from last year.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to George for more commentary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.  We logged another solid quarter at Express Scripts by executing on our business model alignment and achieving our mission of making the use of prescription drugs safer and more affordable, which in turn translates into increased returns for our shareholders.  We have a healthy outlook for the future and the early results from our selling season are promising.  We have won over 60 new accounts including three signature accounts and we expect to see 95% client retention again this year.</p>
          <p>I spent last week at our Annual Outcomes Conference here in St. Louis.  We met with hundreds of clients and prospects to discuss the pharmacy landscape.  I received feedback from our innovative behavior-centric approach to pharmacy benefit management is resonating well with our clients. In addition, they are very interested in our integrated suite of trend and health programs that will drive lowest net cost while optimizing health outcomes.</p>
          <p>In conjunction with our Outcomes Conference we released our Drug Trend Report, which noted that overall cost trend for our clients was at a record low. We also found that failure to take full advantage of clinically appropriate lower cost alternatives to more expensive brand drugs cost Americans $42 billion in 2008.  Therefore, a significant opportunity exists for us to do what we do best, eliminating this waste from the pharmacy benefit while optimizing health outcomes.</p>
          <p>We have been pioneers in applying the principles of behavioral economics to healthcare since we launched our Center for Cost-Effective Consumerism last year.  We've deployed effective segmentation by tailoring individual messaging to change behavior.  In addition, we've taken the application of behavioral economics further by using certain proven psychological principles to develop tools and products that encourage positive choices.</p>
          <p>An example of success in this area comes from our pilot of our Select Home Delivery program that we began at the beginning of the year with over two dozen of our clients.  Many of our clients have seen home delivery penetration nearly triple, and we moved this offering from pilot phase to full production.  We're delivering innovation that matters today and it's clear the marketplace is adopting our approach.</p>
          <p>As the call for healthcare reform intensifies, our proven track records of managing out waste while improving health outcomes will be an important component of this reform.  We support the administration's focus on healthcare information technology including e-prescribing. We've seen an uptick in electronic prescriptions that are encouraged by increased adoption by doctors.</p>
          <p>We are optimistic about the bipartisan support we've seen for creation of a pathway to introduce generic versions of expensive biotech drugs.  The availability of these lower cost drugs will significantly change the industry landscape and provide opportunities to leverage our expertise in innovative ways.</p>
          <p>Finally, I wanted to briefly mention our proposed acquisition of WellPoint's NextRx subsidiaries.  When we announced the transaction, we spoke about the alliance as a great strategic fit for advancing healthcare and the strong cultural fit between our two organizations.  Now a little over two weeks post announcement, we've had the opportunity to speak with clients and prospects, and have spent time with our counterparts from WellPoint. Due to these discussions we are more confident than ever that this transaction is the right move for us.  Our shared commitment to improving health outcomes and driving out waste positions both Express Scripts and WellPoint for significant growth.</p>
          <p>We are excited about our strong first quarter results, which further validates our business model of alignment, which is structured to eliminate waste while improving health outcomes, and therefore paving the way for continued shareholder value creation.</p>
          <p>That concludes our prepared remarks and now I'd be happy to answer any questions.  Operator?</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Our first question comes from the line of John Kreger. Please go ahead &#x2013; of William Blair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much.  George and Jeff, if you're willing, could you just talk a bit more about your expectations for NextRx once that deal is closed, and maybe elaborate a bit on where you think the synergies are going to come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll take a shot at this and then, Jeff, you should certainly feel free to chime in.  We are, as I think we talked about what we announced the transaction, this transaction is not similar to &#x2013; or different from other acquisitions that we've done in the past in that there's a two-pronged approach here. One is the &#x2013; a new contract to provide PBM services to WellPoint. That creates value for both entities.</p>
          <p>And then in addition to that, there's the typical synergies that are created such as better fixed cost leverage, applying our approach to driving generics, mail order, step therapy, prior authorizations, specialty drugs, all those things come together to help improve the economics as well.</p>
          <p>As we said earlier, we're very early into this. It's only a little over two weeks since we announced and I think what we'd like to do is leave any discussion about specifics until the point at which time we actually close the deal, get in, get deeper, and come up with more formidable guidance for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And a follow-on then, realizing that now specialty is part of your core PBM, can you &#x2013; do you have enough visibility to just give us a sense about how that business is doing &#x2013; or the strong improvement that you were seeing at the tail end of last year, are you seeing that continue here in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Feel free to jump in here, but just to make sure everyone's clear, when we go to a finals presentation, specialty is a very important component of the overall PBM sale.  It's the fastest growing piece of the healthcare cost trend.  We talked earlier about having a record all-time low of drug trends in our book of business.  We've achieved that while experiencing double-digit growth in specialty drugs.</p>
          <p>So this is becoming a hotter and hotter issue.  Five years ago we had to go in and talk to our plan sponsors about specialty.  Today an RFP doesn't come out where specialty isn't a very important component of that RFP.  So as times evolve here, our account management teams, our sales people, our clinicians, everyone at the PBM as had to become very fluent, conversive in the area of specialty drugs and understand the impacts.</p>
          <p>That doesn't mean we don't have specialists by disease state that administer the programs and understand the quality of care and the expertise that goes along with providing for these high touch very expensive drug programs.  But part of the fundamental program again is managing overall drug trends. If we delivered a negative 2% trend to a client but had a 40% trend &#x2013; just making up numbers, in specialty we would consider that a failure at Express Scripts. Our job is to manage the overall drug trend, not just the traditional fees.</p>
          <p>That's the reason we've merged these components together, because it's to the same customer that has the same need, which is driving the waste out of the program and especially in the area of such high cost drugs. So that's the reason for putting this together. To be honest with you, through the course of last year, it became harder and harder to actually report the segment separately because the costs were starting to run into each other if you will.</p>
          <p>Having said all that, we still get a great look at profitability by that area because we can see down to the gross margin level very easily on those drugs, and that area still doing very well. And we're excited about the addition of the NextRx business into ours to take us to that next level, and really give us even additional resources and expertise to really improve our offering to all of our clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, so should we assume that the specialty gross profits are trending about with your core business or a little better or a little worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they're consistent with what you've seen last year on that &#x2013; on that, we're at ramp.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby of Banc of America-Merrill Lynch.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jeff or George, just given some of the moving contract parts, some things that trailed &#x2013; faded off last year and what you won this year, can you give us any indication about kind of volumes that were lost versus what kind of came in from new customers in the quarter, and maybe the delta on the profitability they're on? I really can't see exactly what you won in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably the biggest driver, Robert, we talked a lot about this last year and it continues into this year.  As you know, historically, drug utilization trends have been in the 3 to 5% range.  We usually budget it at the 4% to 3% range to be somewhat conservative. And then we were always pleasantly surprised when part of the reasons for our earnings expansion in the past was the fact that drug utilization trends came in stronger than we had budgeted.  That's not the case over the last year and into to this year.</p>
          <p>I think we reported last year that drug utilization was down to the 1% to zero percent range and we're seeing that again this year. So it depends on how &#x2013; when you consider the component pieces, but that's a pretty big number.  When you look at 500 million adjusted scripts and utilization not growing versus growing to 5%, you can do the math pretty easily to understand the impact that utilization has on overall claim count.</p>
          <p>Having said all that though, what we did lose at the end of last year was some very large mail order providers, where we provided mail only services to certain clients.  And if you normalize for that, our mail claims would have been up roughly 6% year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter on an annualized basis. So mail continues to be a big driver for us.</p>
          <p>But again, it's very important for us to get clients that are aligned with our business model of driving out the waste.  It's very important that when we sign up clients, they share a common interest with us to take out those costs, to promote the generics, the lower cost brands, to move people to mail, and I think that's what we look for. So we don't believe in growing at any cost.</p>
          <p>We believe in growing to find clients that have a shared need.  When we can put together thousands of clients that are all driven in the same direction, I think the evidence of that, that combination, are the results you see in our profitability.  Keep in mind we grew our profits in a very difficult time. But as Jeff said in his prepared comments, the result of that is significant, tremendous cost savings for our clients.</p>
          <p>And I think that's the reason our profitability and our future is sustainable because as we grow our profits, we save our clients so much money.  I know that's been a long answer to your question, Robert, but mail would have been up significantly with the decline in utilization. If you look year-over-year, adjusted scripts would have only been up slightly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just in terms of that Emerging Markets business now, what is going to be the management structure on that? Who's in charge of that?  And how are we thinking about modeling that business given the revenue trajectory it's been on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, those businesses are &#x2013; the reason those are in a separate segment is because they have a different buyer.  The PBM business and the specialty business goes to plan sponsors, whether it would be a labor union or state government, a large employer, a managed care organization, et cetera. Those businesses are usually sold most prominently to doctors.</p>
          <p>So our distribution business for example is sold to doctors' offices. Our specialty &#x2013; our fertility business is again sold to doctors' offices. That's typically the way that business is geared. Michael Holmes, who is our Chief Administrative Officer, is in charge of those subsidiaries.  So he will be responsible for managing the profitability and the growth of those companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  And next we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser of UBS.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and congratulations on the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions.  First of all, if you can provide some additional color around the 2010 selling season just in terms of the contract opportunities there that are &#x2013; comprise new business opportunities in the jumbo accounts?  And then obviously you just suspended your buyback program, but as you think about it conceptually, when do you think you could resume buybacks? Would it be year one post closing the transaction or should we expect it to be further out?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...do the latter one first and I'll go to the selling season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  So as regards to share repurchase program it's going to depend on what our final capital structure here is. And certainly our initial goal of any new capital structure would be to pay down debt as quickly as possible and get to the low levels of debt to EBITDA.  So really that's going to be our primary focus here.  So it's hard to comment any more detail than that without knowing when it's going to close and what the final capital structure is going to be.  But bottom line is debt repayment is going to be very high on our list of goals for cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's your ideal ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It hasn't changed.  It's one to two times which is what we've always said, so that's where we'd like to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the selling season's concerned, yes, actually at this time of year, there's several jumbos, what we call signature accounts, where there's more than a million scripts outstanding.  Some of them will be decided as early as tomorrow and others will be decided over the next couple of months. So &#x2013; but there's a lot of them in different phases.</p>
          <p>There's quite a bit of activity that's going on this year which we're pleased about and I think we're hopeful and we're confident that we have a business model that resonates. And we'll see how &#x2013; in fact we'll keep you posted on how those decisions are ultimately made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the activity for the 2010, the strong activity you're commenting about, do you view that as kind of  abnormally high versus previous years, given the fact that these clients prefer to put things out to bid?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I think especially in this day and age most clients are going out for bids, but keep in mind &#x2013; and I think Medco spoke about this on their conference calls as well, most of us have a 90 plus percent retention rate.  So just by definition, it's pretty hard to dislodge large accounts. And I think that's &#x2013; at the end of the day, these are relationship businesses. And if you have a very good clinical manager and a very strong account team that's taking care of that client, it's &#x2013; that's usually what you need to maintain those relationships that meet the needs.</p>
          <p>We've maintained greater than a 95% client retention rate for quite some time. And that includes &#x2013; we include in those numbers our clients that we lose because they get purchased, which is inevitable over time, clients buy or are sold.  So it is a highest stick rate. Having said that though, we try to go in with our sales team and show them how we can make a difference, and our business model, and clearly we've had 60 wins so far this year, three of them large accounts.  So I think our model's resonating. But it's always easier when you're the incumbent to hold volume for that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, one thing I'll just add is that it is, for us, a lower than average renewal year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we &#x2013; and to that point that we've already &#x2013; well upon the path of renewal.  I mean, that...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm curious, George, on the e-prescribing comment, it seems like that confirms what we've seen on the IT side as well in terms of industry.  Is it doing anything to make you think longer term about the cost structure of the business and the number of pharmacists you need to keep on hand?</p>
          <p>And then two, in terms of the opportunity to impact mail, if a doctor has sort of a point of care device in the office that he can use to select the mail channel, is there any thought to making that process more simplified, more electronic too, in terms of the ramp up? Because obviously one of the big negatives for mail has always been the fact that you have to go through the paperwork to sign up, but I know your Select program helps to kind of offset that as well.  So any comments on either of those would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.  We have seen a significant uptick in e-prescribing and as you know, Medicare's put incentives and penalties in place to drive that even further.  We're excited about it.  Quite honestly, we have a lot of pharmacists on staff and unfortunately a lot of those pharmacists are doing things that probably aren't in the best interest of promoting overall healthcare outcomes. In other words, they're hearing step therapy programs, prior authorization programs, dealing with plan design situations.</p>
          <p>And I think what most pharmacists would like to do is be more consultative in helping a patient with side effect profiles, understanding the drug regimens and helping adherence.  Keep in mind one of the biggest problems America faces today is the lack of adherence in key disease states. If we could take those pharmacists through e-prescribing and relieve them of the responsibility to try and administer a formulary because that information comes automatically to the doctor's office; instead focus them into the value-added items of staying adherent and improving their overall healthcare regimen, I think that's huge benefits for our shareholders, our clients and our plans &#x2013; our members, and I think that's where we'd like to see this go.</p>
          <p>So there should be some significant savings when we go into e-prescribing and &#x2013; but some of those dollars quite frankly will be reinvested if you will, to driving better healthcare outcomes, which I think is good for all of us in America.  And did you &#x2013; I'm sorry if there was another question there and I might have missed it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the mail side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, the mail side, yes.  Well, Dr. [Steve] Miller's our &#x2013; he's the guy to talk about a lot about being our &#x2013; he's our Chief Medical Officer.  Well, he also sits in the Board of CuraScript.  And his mission there is to help drive e-prescribing and healthcare outcomes.  He's passionate about his work and I would tell you that one of the sides of this is also driving cost, right, taking out the waste.</p>
          <p>So we do try to work in partnership with all the different Board members of CuraScript to make sure that the patient does understand what their alternatives are and what's most appropriate for any given situation.  So we're appropriate that mail order option should be presented in the option to drive mail utilization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll say &#x2013; one thing I'll add, one of the &#x2013; certainly one of the interesting things we're looking at here is as e-prescribing gets more and more into the day to day operations, we think there's actually pretty interesting potential to have almost next day delivery, and take first fill straight into mail and bypass retail altogether with a solid presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And Jeff, I don't know if you commented, maybe I missed &#x2013; didn't hear it, but on the return on capital for the quarter, I was curious as to what that was? And how should we think about that metric as we approach sort of the closing of the WellPoint deal in terms of any investment that needs to happen or kind of what potentially that could do to that from an accretion/dilution perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we don't actually calculate return on investment capital quarter to quarter because the numbers tend to move around a little bit.  We were 27% for the year. Certainly we see that continuing to grow that &#x2013; for 2008. That is certainly one of the primary focuses of the management team. As we look at WellPoint, we think it is absolutely positive to our return on invested capital with the plans we have in place for that.  So it should be incrementally positive over the long term.</p>
          <p>The other thing on incremental investment for WellPoint, I think it's hard to know the precise details, but I think the bottom line there is we don't see any meaningful material additions to capital as a result of this acquisition.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Alex Pekler for Randall, good morning.  Just a couple quick ones.  First of all, I was wondering if we could get your updated thoughts on the specialty distribution business and what your expectations are going forward from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Specialty distribution is included in that Emerging Markets segment.  And one of things we are trying to determine is the impact that long-term oncology drugs will have on overall drug costs and medical cost inflation.  As you know, when you look at the pipeline, especially drugs coming to market, a tremendous level of those, close to 50% are oncology related, very high cost products which are going to require very special handling, often administrated in the doctors' or the clinics' office.</p>
          <p>What we're trying to do is develop an answer for the oncology situation. And we're holding on to our distribution business because we think it could be a key factor in that ultimate solution. And we'll just have to keep you posted over time as to how that unfolds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just a quick follow-up, the Emerging Markets segment revenue run rate of about 300 million in the quarter, is that similar to the quarterly run rate you're assuming for the rest of the year for that segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's about right.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.  Just a couple quick things.  George, I know there's only so much you can talk about with consolidation with NextRx, but just are you able to characterize even any anecdotal client or customer feedback you're getting in some of these vested files as conversations after you've announced this transaction? What kind of things are you hearing from people? And it sounds like &#x2013; are you in any position to talk about sort of top priorities once you close the deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple things, first of all, I did meet a lot with the prospects and clients as I said earlier in our Outcomes Conference.  It's a great opportunity to bring our clients together every year where we all focus on our shared value of driving out waste and improving healthcare outcomes. We invite prospects to that as well. And so a lot of the conversation was around the pending acquisition.</p>
          <p>Quite honestly it's very positively seen.  It fits really nicely into our model.  As you've heard Angela [Braly] discuss &#x2013; and I discuss in the past we have a shared vision here for taking out the waste and improving health outcomes. I think that as we look at healthcare reform, what the country needs is new and innovative approaches to the delivery of healthcare in this country.</p>
          <p>And we are both &#x2013; both organizations are focused on that.  And I think we'll continue to work together to figure out innovative solutions for what America needs most today. So I think all that means a lot to our existing clients.  They're with us because we have a track record of being innovative, and being creative, and delivering workable solutions for our clients and this will further that.  And so we're really excited about the prospects.</p>
          <p>As far as day one and getting things done, the most important thing we do coming out of the chute is really to get to the single platform. There is tremendous value to be had when you have one platform because then what you have is a standardized delivery approach across all your books of business.  Some companies run multiple platforms. When you do that it creates a lot of issues because when you roll out a change, when you roll out an option, something like Select Home Delivery, you got to update each of the platforms.</p>
          <p>So by definition, if you're on the second platform to be updated, you don't get the options as quickly as the first. And so I think there's tremendous value both on efficiencies and delivery and consistency of delivery when you get to single platform. So that'll be one of the first things we're going to go after from an operational perspective.</p>
          <p>Obviously from a management perspective, we really believe we can do a lot to help improve the drug trends of the WellPoint's book of business.  And so we're going to focus on working with WellPoint to create &#x2013; to generate creative programs to further take up their generic fill rates and drive their mail penetration.  So those two items will be major from a client perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.  And just a quick follow-up from that on generic fill rate,  I guess you're communicating really on an adjusted base here, home delivery generic fill rate was flat sequentially.  I just want to confirm that. And do you think of &#x2013; you haven't disclosed a generic fill rate for Wellpoint's home delivery segment, but is there a big opportunity specifically or even &#x2013; can you talk about what their generic fill rate is for their business or no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so generic fill rates and home delivery was flat sequentially. For WellPoint &#x2013; we're just not going to get into the details of the WellPoint.  What George just said is exactly right. We think there's lots of opportunities for us to not only help WellPoint but help all their members to lower their cost and improve health outcomes, and the opportunities are in both of our firms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And finally, something special you've already been reporting up through ad, so I guess this kind of confirms that from an external reporting standpoint.  George, do you think about it &#x2013; is there a cost benefit or an integration benefit of having that all integrated up through one platform versus having a separate report?  Is that one of the key benefits here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you know it's actually &#x2013; yes, the answer to that is clearly yes.  But it's even more important on the client side.  When we first bought CuraScript, especially it was thought of as a different animal.  And so when we went and visited with our clients, we would bring out two different clinicians, two different account managers, two different teams that would sit at the table and talk to our clients about &#x2013; one group would talk about managing the traditional businesses and the other traditional drugs, and the other work group would talk about managing specialty.</p>
          <p>Well, at the end of the day the client really doesn't care about that.  They want to manage overall drug trends while optimizing those healthcare outcomes, which means that the account managers, your specialists on the field that are dealing with that client on a day to day basis, have to have a knowledge of all the drugs including the specialty products. So we've worked very hard to make sure that our team is well positioned.</p>
          <p>Now when you get into the idiosyncrasies and the complexities of the specialty products, we still call upon them.  So if the client has a special area that's causing them a lot of money or a high prevalence of a certain drug type, we'll bring out specialty but they'll be under the direction of that account management team and not a standalone unit.</p>
          <p>So it's &#x2013; and then reporting it's also very important, providing consolidated reporting back to the clients so they can see the whole picture and understand what's taking place.  Keep in mind more than 95% of all the people on a specialty product are also on an oral solid.  So again combining the program to manage the overall drug outcome for that member is critically important, and that was the idea behind the consolidation.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, and our next question will come from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and good morning.  George, can you just talk about any mid year plan design changes that you're seeing?  Just a little surprised to see that you haven't really talked about the economic environment and what it means for your clients, and obviously I think that the increase in mail is maybe partially due to the programs you have, but do you think any of it has to do with the overall economic environment, one?</p>
          <p>And then two, Jeff, just your comment about this year being a lower renewal year, is that because you have some contracts that are more than three years in length? If you could just give us any additional thoughts around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously the economic environment is not a pleasant situation. Many of my peers and my friends in the industry are facing very difficult times and we try to work very closely to meet their needs.  I'd tell you we've &#x2013; I've been at this for a lot of years and I've seen a lot of economic turns, never one to the extent that we're in today.</p>
          <p>But at the end of the day, when things are tough and we see that through the utilization numbers and I referred to that earlier, we see utilization trends from zero to 1%, that's not historic. And so clearly that's having an impact on our business.  But to your point, Lisa, I think what we're seeing more than offsetting that decline in trend and more than offsetting the layoff of employees, is that those people that really do need the drugs, that really need the outreach, are reaching for the lower cost alternatives.</p>
          <p>Our plans sponsors are &#x2013; a lot of them have already gone to mandatory generic programs; where they haven't, they've put in multiples or multitudes of step therapy programs.  We have many, many clients that are running our whole suite, 14 different step therapy programs, because they understand the value of the generics and the value of monitoring these overall health outcomes.</p>
          <p>Mail, you're exactly right. Even though our script counts were slightly &#x2013; just slightly up for the year, mail would have been up 6% had we not had the two clients leave us, mail only clients. And so clients are in fact allowing us to get more engaged with their membership to drive to the mail to take more of the cost out of the equation.</p>
          <p>So I think it is tough economic times, but the beauty of our model of alignment of making money as we save our clients money really does at the end of the day drive the results you're seeing. Jeff talked about it earlier, but we've given guidance on a 20% of growth and that's all coming from or predominantly coming from earnings; a little bit I guess from the present capital structure on the interest side, but the majority of that is all earnings driven, which is a testament back to the model and coming out of the core.  So I do think it's our tools are more important than ever to meet the needs of the business place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you have any mid year kind of plan design changes, George, that we'll potentially see an acceleration in the back half of the year or primarily you saw it for January 1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things that we firmly &#x2013; is we understand that clients can't just be tied to certain points in time to try to get savings because their business may not allow for that.  The economic challenges they face don't necessarily need &#x2013; can't wait six months to have the solution.  So things like our Select Home Delivery program, we can put that in for a client tomorrow, and it can just roll out because there's not a benefit design change.  Dr. Miller works with our clinicians in developing step therapy programs and other things that don't require necessarily benefit design changes we can implement and roll those things out, so in &#x2013; effectively shutting down formulary changes without actually doing it, where you have to file the paperwork and do all the notification.</p>
          <p>So there's a &#x2013; I do think our focus is not focusing on 7/1 but rolling out programs that matter today, that can be administered today, that can impact the behavior of the members today and drive the cost savings needed for our clients today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then, Jeff, any thoughts around your comments around this year being unusually low as far as a renewal year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  So the way to think about it is we have two large clients that are not on three year contracts.  First the Department of Defense, which is approximately 20 plus percent of our scripts.  And the way &#x2013; that is a five year contract, it starts in late 2009. Probably one important point for &#x2013; at least for your modeling perspective, the way we look at -the current DoD contract, we don't actually have &#x2013; we don't do adjudication and some other services. In the new contract we're going to start doing that and others.</p>
          <p>The net result of that is that we currently record revenue on a net basis starting in late 2009. When the new contract starts we're going to be recording revenue on a gross basis, which is how we record for the rest of our clients.  The net impact of that is you're going to see revenue increase by about $8 billion in 2010. It doesn't change margin, it just changes revenue.  The other side of that is of course NextRx &#x2013; and DoD is a five year contract with two one-year extensions.</p>
          <p>The other is now NextRx, which is as you know a 10 year contract. So essentially we're less than 50 &#x2013; about 50% of our book which is now contracted for seven plus years.  So that would leave you with on average, what, 16.5, 17% of our book was renewing every year. And my comment was this year just the way that the contracts have fallen, it's actually a little bit less than that that's up for renewal.  And as George said, we're off to a strong start here and we expect to end with better than 95% retention. Of that, less than 16, 17% is actually up for renewal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Lisa, this is a very important point Jeff just made. There's not a lot of businesses out there that can look to their book of business and understand that 50% of &#x2013; actually a little greater than 50% is you've got a line that's tied to your margins for the next 7 to 10 years.  I mean that's an incredible situation for us.  And it really does allow us to be pretty bold in our forecasting and understanding what the future holds for us. So we are really excited.</p>
          <p>And I think the other side to this, certainly I think WellPoint would speak to this, is that we're at the tip of that.  So although we can forecast our margins today based on the underlying business, I think we are both fixated on changing the delivery of healthcare in this country and coming up with ways to save money.  And hopefully those savings will materialize in some greater opportunities for us.  So we're really excited about where we sit.</p>
