          <p>Good afternoon, and welcome to the BMO Financial Group's Q1 2013 Earnings Release and Conference Call for February 26, 2013. Your host for today is Ms. Sharon Haward-Laird, Head, Investor Relations. Ms. Haward-Laird, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Our agenda for today's investor presentation is as follows: We will begin the call with remarks from Bill Downe, BMO's CEO; followed by presentations from Tom Flynn, the Bank's Chief Financial Officer; and Surjit Rajpal, our Chief Risk Officer. After their presentations, we will have a short question-and-answer period, where we will take questions from prequalified analysts. To give everyone an opportunity to participate, I would ask that you please keep it to one or two questions and then re-queue.</p>
          <p>Also with us this afternoon to take questions are BMO's business unit heads: Tom Milroy from BMO Capital Markets; Gilles Ouellette from the Private Client Group; Frank Techar, Head of P&amp;C Canada; and Mark Furlong, Head of P&amp;C U.S.</p>
          <p>On behalf of those speaking today, I note that forward-looking statements may be made during this call. Actual results could differ materially from forecasts, projections or conclusions in these statements. Information about material factors that could cause results to differ and the material assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements can be found in our annual MD&amp;A and our first quarter report to shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that said, I will now hand things over to Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sharon, and good afternoon, everyone. BMO had strong first quarter results. Our focus on customers, efficiency, and prudent risk management continues to serve us well. This is reflected in the financial performance underpinned by good operating group performance and also in the progress we've made in advancing our strategic agenda.</p>
          <p>Reported net income was CAD 1 billion or CAD 1.53 per share. On an adjusted basis, net income was also CAD 1 billion, CAD 1.52 per share, 7% ahead of last year. Revenues increased to CAD 3.9 billion and ROE was 14.8%. Progress was particularly evident in our U.S. businesses. Personal and Commercial Banking U.S. had very good adjusted earnings and loan growth in the quarter. We focused our collective efforts on growing BMO's customer base and capturing opportunities in our redefined home market and we've been highly visible in the Midwest, increasing our advertising support post-integration. Wealth management and capital markets businesses in the U.S. also had good quarters.</p>
          <p>We're seeing the benefits of disciplined expense management as we continue to focus on efficiencies to find ways to deliver superior service to our customers and to drive performance across the bank. Excluding costs related to employees eligible to retire booked in Q1, adjusted operating efficiency improved for the bank and all the business groups, quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>Core credit performance was good. Provision for credit losses was down sequentially and relatively stable year-over-year. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.4%. We increased our quarterly dividend by 3% to CAD 0.74 a share, reflecting our strong capital position and the success of our business strategies. We delivered adjusted earnings of over CAD 1 billion for the third consecutive quarter. We also gained market share against the backdrop of a cooling housing market in Canada, moderate consumer spending, and continued government restraint. The U.S. economy is gradually improving, led especially by a rebound in housing.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we're optimistic about the opportunities for growth and expect the economy to improve in our markets throughout the year. BMO is very well positioned in this environment with a proven strength in commercial banking across our large North American platform.</p>
          <p>Turning to the operating groups, P&amp;C Canada's adjusted net income for Q1 was CAD 461 million, up 4% from a year ago. Loan growth was robust with the total portfolio up 9%. The lift in commercial lending was the strongest we've seen since 2008. In personal banking, we're seeing the payoff from our focus on sales force productivity, which has improved over the past few years with our frontline selling significantly more, we're booking more appointments and having better quality conversations with our customers. We're generating good results in the areas we're focused on, while continuing to increase customer loyalty that will support future growth. P&amp;C U.S.'s adjusted net income was $197 million in source currency, up 25% quarter-over-quarter and 13% ahead of last year.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, our loan book had very good growth, up CAD 800 million or approximately 2% from the fourth quarter. We continue to drive good balance sheet momentum in this business. Core C&amp;I loans were up CAD 3.3 billion or 18% from a year ago and total deposits have increased by CAD 1.3 billion. We have strong deposit share in our key Midwest markets that positions us well and provides the source of competitive advantage. Our ongoing campaign to introduce BMO Harris Bank across our expanded U.S. footprint is driving customer recognition and producing good results.</p>
          <p>Here are some examples of how creative brand support is resonating with customers. In Milwaukee, just a few weeks into our newest advertising campaign, brand awareness of the bank has increased significantly. In Minneapolis, frontline staff are telling us ad recognition has brought customers into branches to open new accounts and we premiered BMO advertising at the Super Bowl with good coverage in our U.S. regional markets and across Canada.</p>
          <p>BMO Capital Markets delivered Q1 adjusted net income of CAD 310 million with ROE of 21.3%. Results were highlighted by strong revenue growth driven by M&amp;A activity, debt underwriting and trading revenues. The 56.9% efficiency ratio reflects improved expense management.</p>
          <p>Private Client Group produced first quarter adjusted net income of CAD 169 million. Traditional wealth was up 36%, excluding a gain on strategic investment last year and insurance rebounded to a more normal level. Results benefited from higher revenue driven by growth in client assets and focused cost management.</p>
          <p>While continuing to post strong financial results, we're making particularly good progress in two areas that are strategically important, institutional asset management and private banking. Consolidation under one platform, BMO Global Asset Management has traction. We continue to add new asset classes, investment capabilities and distribution in North America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East resulting in continued net asset inflows. We've grown to more than CAD 120 billion in AUM, earning a place in the top 100 worldwide rankings.</p>
          <p>In private banking, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a Hong Kong and Singapore-based wealth management provider and are now operating as BMO Private Bank Asia, providing services to high net worth clients in the Asia-Pacific region. With experienced private bankers and a well-developed universe of products, our clients will benefit from our investment expertise and an integrated platform that bridges North American and Asian markets. And looking ahead, this corridor creates opportunities for growth.</p>
          <p>We also continue to make progress with capital markets' client coverage efforts in Asia, best demonstrated by recent high profile advisory mandates and successful transactions completed by our clients.</p>
          <p>In sum, we had a strong quarter and demonstrated continued momentum in commercial banking on both sides of the border. Commercial banking is an important contributor to the performance of the bank, positioning us well in an environment of business expansion. At the same time, we're maintaining prudent risk management and improving efficiency. And we're seeing the payoff from the investments we've made in our U.S. businesses with operating levels &#x2013; with operating leverage rather from an expanded platform.</p>
          <p>As we look forward to the rest of the year, continue our focus on delivering industry-leading customer experience, helping businesses expand and customers control their financial lives, allowing them to make better decisions with better information and have confidence in the choices they make.</p>
          <p>And with that, Tom, I'll turn it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on slide 8. BMO had a strong first quarter, with good operating group results. Reported net income was CAD 1.048 billion. On an adjusted basis, net income was CAD 1.041 billion, up 7% and EPS was CAD 1.52, also up 7%. ROE was 14.8% on a very strong capital position.</p>
          <p>Each of our businesses showed continued momentum in the quarter. There was strong loan growth in both personal and commercial in Canada, and in core C&amp;I in the U.S. And the Private Client Group and Capital Markets had strong quarters. Our retail businesses contributed over 75% of operating group revenues.</p>
          <p>As you have seen, beginning this quarter we changed the way we report our operating group segments to reflect provisions for credit losses on an actual loss basis in each segment. Previously we had charged the operating groups with the credit losses on an expected loss basis. This change will help with comparing our segment results to other banks. Prior period results have been restated for the change. We continue to record all acquisition credit related items in the corporate segment. Items removed to arrive at adjusted income were similar in character to prior quarters and totaled just CAD 7 million. Slide 30 shows details on the adjusting items.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 9. Adjusted revenue in Q1 was CAD 3.9 billion up 3% year-over-year and slightly down from a fourth quarter that was strong. Adjusted net interest income was up 2% quarter-over-quarter benefiting from growth in all operating groups particularly BMO Capital Markets. Year-over-year net interest income declined 4% due to lower NIM in the P&amp;C businesses and higher than usual revenue from a strategic investment in PCG last year. Adjusted NIM excluding trading of 203 basis points was up 1 basis point from last quarter on better capital market results.</p>
          <p>Adjusted non-interest revenue was up 13% year-over-year on good capital market performance and improved insurance revenues. Quarter-over-quarter it was down 5% due to lower trading revenue and insurance results and corporate results were down due to a variety of items, none of which were individually significant.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 10. Q1 adjusted expenses of CAD 2.5 billion include CAD 73 million of compensation for employees eligible to retire, which is expensed in the first quarter of each year. Excluding these costs, adjusted expenses declined 2% quarter-over-quarter. The efficiency ratio improved and the operating leverage was positive. Year-over-year adjusted expenses increased largely due to higher employee-related costs, including performance-based compensation given higher revenue.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 11, capital ratios strengthened in the quarter. Effective Q1 2013 regulatory capital ratios are determined on a Basel III basis. With a Basel III common equity ratio of 9.4%, BMO's capital position is strong. OSFI's deferral of the effective date for adoption of the credit valuation adjustment, RWA improved the ratio by approximately 35 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 12, in Q1, P&amp;C Canada adjusted net income was CAD 461 million, up 4% year-over-year. Results reflect a combination of good volume growth, lower credit provisions and lower margins. Loan growth was strong in the quarter with total loans up approximately 9% from last year. There was also a good sequential loan growth of over 2% for the third straight quarter.</p>
          <p>NIM compression moderated this quarter with a decline of 3 basis points being primarily due to changes in mix, including loan growth exceeding deposit growth and lower deposit spreads in the low rate environment.</p>
          <p>Lastly, expenses were relatively flat reflecting active expense management with selective investments being made in the business.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 13, P&amp;C U.S. adjusted net income was $197 million. Loan loss provisions were down significantly in the quarter to $33 million. The combination of low credit losses and good non-interest revenue this quarter produced very strong results. Revenue of $755 million was up 1% quarter-over-quarter due to higher gains on the sale of originated mortgages and strong commercial lending fees. NIM was down 9 basis points from Q4, primarily due to lower deposit spreads and changes in mix as loan growth exceeded deposit growth.</p>
          <p>Adjusted expenses were down primarily due to synergies net of investments being made in the business. The efficiency ratio improved to 57.1% in the quarter. Loans and source currency were up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Loan growth exceeded runoff for the first time post-acquisition. Core C&amp;I loan growth continue to be strong with balances up 7% quarter-over-quarter and 18% year-over-year, and the pipeline remains strong.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 14, BMO Capital Markets delivered very strong results with net income of &#x2013; up CAD 310 million and ROE of 21.3%. Earnings were up 38% year-over-year and in line with the good results of the fourth quarter. The performance compared to a year ago reflects good execution, benefits of diversification, and a better environment. The efficiency ratio improved quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year to 56.9%.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 15, Private Client Group adjusted net income was CAD 169 million, up 54% year-over-year and in line with the fourth quarter. These results were consistent with our view of the underlying earnings potential of the business. Revenue was up 12% from a year ago, driven by a bounce back in insurance results, largely due to a lower impact from long-term rates. Wealth results in PCG were up 8% year-over-year and up 36%, excluding a gain on our strategic investment a year ago. Assets under management and administration of CAD 479 billion were up nicely, 10% or CAD 44 billion year-over-year and 3% or CAD 14 billion quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 16, corporate reported a net loss of CAD 65 million and CAD 95 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted revenues were down year-over-year and sequentially. Contributing factors included lower security gains, a higher TEB group offset in the current quarter and a variety of items, including treasury related items, none of which were individually significant. Adjusted recoveries of credit losses were down, reflecting lower recoveries on purchased credit impaired loans. As a reminder, we record all acquired loan credit accounting items in the corporate segment.</p>
          <p>Adjusted expenses were higher primarily due to increased benefits, costs, including pension costs, timing of technology, investment spending and higher severance. To conclude, we had a strong start to the year and feel good about our operating group performance and momentum.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will turn it over to Surjit.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon. It has been another good quarter from a risk perspective. Referring to slide 19, specific provisions excluding the purchased portfolio were CAD 155 million, down from CAD 245 million in the prior quarter. This improvement is a result of higher recoveries and reversals and a decline in new reservations.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, last quarter provisions were elevated based on regulatory guidance relating to certain performing U.S. consumer loans. The improvement we have this quarter was evident across major businesses in both Canada and in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Provisions for the purchased performing portfolio, at CAD 82 million, were up CAD 17 million quarter-over-quarter, after adjusting from last quarter's regulatory guidance. As I said in earlier quarters, there will be timing differences between when losses occur and when we recognize income from this portfolio.</p>
          <p>We continue our proactive management of the purchased credit impaired portfolio, resulting in a recovery this quarter of CAD 59 million. This portfolio is now down to roughly 40% of its original size. Our strong workout skills and loan sales capability will ensure us satisfactory resolution to this portfolio. I have mentioned on previous calls, we have been managing down this portfolio and as the portfolio shrinks along with the associated mark, future recoveries will moderate from last year's levels.</p>
          <p>Total impaired formations at CAD 630 million are slightly lower than &#x2013; are slightly lower this quarter, after excluding last quarter CAD 142 million from previously mentioned regulatory guidance.</p>
          <p>Looking at the trend on slide 20, it would appear that formations peaked in the second quarter of 2012. Excluding purchased portfolios, total gross impaired loans declined this quarter, as did the ratio of impaired loans to gross loans and acceptances. The ratio now stands at 0.8% versus 1.02% in the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>In closing, we are encouraged by the reduction in provisions and increase in recoveries. We are comfortable with our risk profile in both Canada and the U.S. and we believe are well-positioned in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of today's presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now take questions from the telephone lines. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Gabriel Dechaine from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to first ask you about &#x2013; oh, sorry, good afternoon. The Canadian retail margin, so 3 basis points of decline sequentially, that's about half of or less than half of what we've seen over the past three quarters. I'm wondering if you think there is a sustainable ability of &#x2013; to that number. What's changed &#x2013; I think for commercial deposit, the growth was pretty good and you cited that is a factor to stabilize the margin, does that help at all?</p>
          <p>And then also as the balance sheet mix changes, particularly in mortgages with the cross-selling success kind have been. I shall now &#x2013; I'll throw in my last one here. The asset to capital multiple jumped up a little bit and you cite Basel III transitional modifications, is that a BMO specific issue? Can you kind of delve into that a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Gabriel, it's Frank. I'll start. And since you took the liberty of asking three questions, I'm going to take the liberty of maybe answering more than what you asked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Go for it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a solid quarter in P&amp;C Canada. Our net income as you saw was up 4% this quarter and we continue to have the confidence in our strategy. There's no doubt it's a challenging environment. But we are continuing to build a better business in P&amp;C Canada. And I think you'll have noticed that the balance sheet growth this quarter is very strong. Our consumer loan growth was up 9.5%. Our large commercial business is strengthening. Deposit growth was up 6.3%, the strongest we've seen in a year and loan growth was 9.4%, which is the strongest as Bill mentioned that we've seen since 2008. On top of that mutual fund growth was 12.8%.</p>
          <p>And as you point out, our margin declines are moderating. So consistent with what I've said in previous quarters, we expect to see continuing moderate declines in NIM over the next few quarters, given the environment that we're operating in and the reason we are seeing moderation is, the mix is changing in the balance sheet. We are seeing more growth in loans with higher spreads and we would expect that to continue in future quarters.</p>
          <p>Relative to cross-sell, I think I've mentioned this in previous quarters, our 5-year fix; 25-year am mortgage product was very successful last year, in bringing new customers into the company. And in fact, every &#x2013; for everyone that took that product last year, about 40% of them were new customers to BMO. And for those new customers coming into BMO, we sold in excess of two other products to them. So we know that is one thing that's contributing to the growth that we're seeing overall in the balance sheet and as we continue to bring those customers in, I have a huge amount of confidence in our sales capabilities in our branches at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, it's Tom. I'll answer the asset to capital multiple question. The multiple that we're showing on our slide 11 is the Basel III multiple. We're transitioning in under the rules, which means that we're including all of our capital with the non-common capital being subject to the phase-out rules that are applicable under Basel III. The ratio moved up a bit in the quarter and that's a function of having asset growth in the quarter and also one redemption of capital security. So I'd say nothing unusual in terms of the movement and nothing unusual in terms of how we will look at this ratio versus others.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. My questions are for Surjit. And if we start with the purchased credit impaired portfolio. Last quarter you answered one of my questions on the call by saying you would think CAD 200 million to CAD 250 million will be an estimate for what we could expect in recoveries from that portfolio, but there was no real basis behind that estimate. Three months later I'm sure you've got a chance to think about that estimate and I was hoping you'd give us an update on what you're seeing there taking into account those statements of the book is down to 40% of the original level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me start off by saying, the reason I said there was not much of a basis is because the strategy that we are adopting is one of value maximization. And I didn't want to give you a number and then put myself on the pressure to deliver that number, because we'd like to get the best we can for this portfolio. My guidance has not changed. I still believe that the number I gave you before would hold and that's about it really, Sumit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's stay with the credit for a second, because I think we can agree that there's been differing treatment on how people look at the earnings results whether the purchased credit impaired should be core or not. Maybe &#x2013; let's not go into that. So if I look at the provisions, the adjusted provisions that you call them ex of the PCI recovery, still a pretty substantial decline on both the quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year basis. I think its CAD 90 million sequentially. So when I hear your comments on the core part of the portfolio with provisions down in each of your segments formations relatively stable, am I right to say, it doesn't seem like you're of the view that there's going to be a material change in the non-PCI portion of your credit portfolio in terms of losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If you &#x2013; let's examine the numbers a little carefully because you do &#x2013; you're right on focusing on the non-PCI of purchased portfolios. When you look at our current quarter, most of our provisions relate to consumer book. Because we've had very good recoveries and repayments, as well as lower provisions in our commercial and corporate books, particularly in the U.S. And if you look at the chart, you'll see negative numbers over there.</p>
          <p>Now, while the economic environment continues to improve, you do know that when you're talking about commercial or corporate, given the nature of that business, it always introduces an element of variability. So my &#x2013; the sense I can give you that we certainly are having a much better year than last year when it comes to PCLs for our core book, if I can call it that and we will definitely do better than last year. But there will be quarter-to-quarter over quarter variability. And at 24 basis points, I think we had a good quarter last quarter and I would expect that if the market stay, the market doesn't deteriorate, we'll have good quarters going forward.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. With your outlook for both the interest rates from the fed and the bank, it kind of remained stable through the remainder of the year, is there anything that we can actually do to stem the margin compression? Are we going to just continue to see this tick down on both sides of the border?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>John, it's Frank. I mean, I'll just reiterate what I said a minute ago, in Canada, at least the P&amp;C business, no change from what we've seen in the past. We expect continuing moderate declines in NIM over the next few quarters. Without a change in rates, I think we're in that environment for the foreseeable future.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Mark Furlong. In the U.S. side, as we talked last quarter, we said, we expected about a 5 basis point decline due to the low interest rates and deposits and we're still sticking with that. The 2 basis points was really related to conversion just the machinations you go through and kind of resetting some of the stuff we're doing. That won't repeat.</p>
          <p>And then, the other 2 basis points was extremely strong C&amp;I loan growth. And when you look at the portfolio, the new business we're generating has spreads that are under our current margin. So necessarily, that would have a little bit of drag on the margin, but we see that as a positive because that's growing relationships and growing the business. So that &#x2013; there's kind of give-and-take to that and if that's the driver for the rest of the year, that's probably a pretty good driver of growth for the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, on the C&amp;I growth, the margin or at least sort of the margins you're pulling in, is that competitive pressures just the environment? And on the competitive side, are you seeing competitors actually do anything on the covenant life side that's giving you pause?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know our spreads in commercial were stable this quarter. And it's just that they're not at the 400 basis point level of the current margin right now. So, I mean, that just kind of gives you a sense of what's going on competitively, at least where we are &#x2013; have chosen to compete.</p>
          <p>From a competition standpoint, I think if you're in like the large leverage loan deals, I think there are some pretty ferocious competition to take big holds and to take &#x2013; and from a pricing and structure standpoint, but that's not really where we compete. We've been kind of in that true middle market space and there may be more competition. It moves its way down there at some point in time. It's certainly competitive today. But the weakness in structure and kind of going to the floor and pricing hasn't gotten there yet.</p>

          <p>Its Tom Flynn, John. I just add one thing to the NIM discussion, and we do think it's notable that this quarter the adjusted NIM for the bank consolidated, excluding trading, was actually up a bp quarter-over-quarter and that reflected the retail performance that we've talked about, but also capital markets being up nicely in the quarter which was partly driven by corporate lending activity in the U.S. and partly by the AFS security portfolio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Surjit, I'd like to come back to Sumit's issue on or question on the loan loss line. In answering this question you noted that commercial recoveries were a significant factor, but if I look at slide 19, the personal side was also down in pretty much every bucket that you list there as well. So it sounds like what you're saying is perhaps this quarter was a little on the low side from a provisioning level but last year it was perhaps a little on the high side from what we can expect going forward. Is it fair to assume something in the low 30s from a provisioning ratio is about what we should be expecting this year with some variability, obviously, around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would say so. I think, we &#x2013; as I said, I think if you look at the average for last year, we have 42 basis points, and I think to make that assumption if the economy holds, I think it's not an unreasonable assumption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you can count me among those that's happy to see the backside of expected loss methodology. But if we <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:34) methodology, what kind of expectations might that have kicked out for the Q1 numbers? Let's say, would they be similar to what we ultimately saw or would they have been higher than what we ultimately saw?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Tom. I guess a couple of things in reaction to that. The expected loss numbers, historically, through time didn't change much quarter-over-quarter and the biggest change was in Q1 of each year when we looked at things in greater detail. And so, it's really impossible to answer your question precisely because we have moved on. But I would take a look at the fourth quarter of last year as the best indication of what we think make sense from an EL perspective.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. First on loans. Commercial loans in the U.S., obviously, improving the growth we see this quarter, particularly, but also last quarter. It seems like it coincides with perhaps slower growth in IBG or in wholesale lending. Was there any &#x2013; is there any change in classification that would cause those two to go hand-in-hand at slower growth than IBG offset by better growth in commercial, particularly, in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, okay. So, this is Mark Furlong. Let me start out. I'll do the P&amp;C side. We're not competing in the same space. So the growth in the P&amp;C business, it's really &#x2013; just like last quarter, it's across every geography and it's across all of our specialty segments. And it is really truly broad based, particularly the last two quarters, and I don't think we're at all &#x2013; I think it's absolutely unrelated to anything going on in any of the segment. I'd say, a little pickup, of course, you see at year-end related to changes in tax rules and changes in dividend rules and things like that. But it was so broad based and it was not weighted toward acquisition or leverage that really this is the kind of the long-term efforts of sustained calling and service and a little bit of expansion by existing customers and kind of all those pieces to build up to that loan growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe just to follow up then on the wholesale side, assuming it's entirely like there's no connection there. Why do you figure &#x2013; what &#x2013; appear to be some very healthy growth in IBG may have tapered off in the last couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; first of all, I think &#x2013; we think it continues to be pretty perspective. But we've seen some &#x2013; a lot of refinancings that have gone into the market. But we continue to do business. And you'll see we've managed to &#x2013; it's basically flat quarter-over-quarter. And so, we would expect &#x2013; if our view of what's happening in the economy is correct, Mario, I think we'd expect to see more financing and more growth in that loan as we go forward through 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then maybe just for perfect clarity then for Tom Flynn. The bank hasn't changed the definition of where you would book the loan and nothing has changed in the last couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. And then just finally, back to the PCLs for a moment, Surjit &#x2013; in the U.S., 25 basis points of PCLs, am I thinking about it correctly to say that part of the reason why the PCLs are light or look really low the ratio looks low now is because the deal was only a year, a year-and-a-half ago since you fair valued those assets. And that over time, we'd expect that PCL's ratio to migrate back up to in the U.S. specifically 40, 50 basis points. Is that a reasonable expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really depends. You're talking about the acquired portfolio around?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. I'm talking about excluding anything to the &#x2013; oh, actually, you're right. I'm talking about the entire U.S. business, but I don't want to take into account anything to do with recoveries. I'm just saying the pure PCLs that are emerging from your U.S. P&amp;C business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. So I wanted to be clear whether you were talking about the combined business.</p>
          <p>&lt; Q &#x2013; [05KZNW-E Mario Mendonca]&gt;: I am.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I &#x2013; so I don't look at it so much on a combined basis, because I think even if you look at it on a combined basis over time, the businesses are getting fully harmonized from a risk perspective. So I would think that the long-term trend would be lower than the one you indicated. I think it'll be more like 40, 45 basis points. It's not going to be that high. It's not going to be in the 50s.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks very much. Just on that last comment about the U.S. economy. I noted that the impaired loan levels in the consumer portfolios, both the residential mortgage and the installment in other consumer loans were up quite substantially, sequentially.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I can give you a flavor for what's happening in the U.S. In the U.S., last quarter, we did have a large number of performing loans that we put into impaired as a consequence of regulatory guidance. And if I recall right, that number was CAD 142 million. So, you're seeing that CAD 142 million of performing loans embedded in that number and that's why it seems elevated, but I don't have the breakdown for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And that's the same thing happened the quarter before I take it, because it went to CAD 856 million from CAD 712 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You recall &#x2013; I think if you go back in time, some of the impairments that you had in the U.S. were really &#x2013; I think I've described them as label changes because as we were reviewing our smaller accounts, which already had provisions &#x2013; a mark against them, we had moved them to impaired once we took a look at them through our processes. And so, really it didn't have an impact on any factor from a loss perspective because the mark was more than adequately covered it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I ask you to venture where that number will be next quarter when we sit here? Will it be higher or lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think the trend is positive, absolutely positive. I think given where we are, I would suggest that the number is coming down, which is why when I spoke; I said the formation seems to have peaked a few quarters back. They're coming down nicely.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But I mean to be clear, the trend is not positive. Its 50% higher in that portfolio, in the consumer portfolio than it was a year ago. So I don't understand how that becomes a positive trend?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. You know and show in your U.S. P&amp;C business expenses declining sequentially in year-over-year. Can you update us on how much of your synergies have been achieved related to the M&amp;I transaction, and then how much is left to go from the current run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Tom. So we'd a similar question in Q4 and we said that, around two-thirds or a little over two-thirds of the synergies were baked into the Q4 run rate. And the answer this quarter would be that the number would be approaching the 75% level.</p>
          <p>And by the end of the year we would expect to be above the 90% level. And so, we're continuing to make progress on the integration. We completed the large systems conversion in the fourth quarter and have supported that with the brand change that we've talked about advertising, to make people aware of the new name. But the synergies are coming in pretty much on expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And integration costs will continue to cause noise going forward, or is that all behind?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not all behind. You saw the number in the current quarter. There is still work going on. So the number will trail down through time. But it's not done as of the end of this quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And am I right to say that the numbers now in excess of what you originally targeted on integration costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not in excess of the update on the target that we gave in the last quarter. And I think it is above the estimate that we had when we announced the transaction, but the synergies as you know are now CAD 400 million versus CAD 250 million that we talked about when we announced. So the ratio between synergies and one-time costs, we think is still good. But we said in Q4 that the one-time costs would be around in mix, CAD 650 million. We're now a little above CAD 600 million and we're likely to go a little above the CAD 650 million number through time.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'm sort of following up on a couple of other questions. So how long should we expect that the net interest revenue releases related to the purchased credit portfolio will continue at a <mark type="ph" /> now (42:28) elevated level and how long will the integration costs continue at an elevated level also, where they seem to largely offset each other this quarter? And I have a couple of other questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Tom. The amortization of a portion of the credit mark will continue probably for about the next two years. It will decline through time. It bumps up in certain quarters because of repayments of loans and we had some of that this quarter. So it's hard to predict exactly when it will be unusually high because it's a function of the repayment activity. But I'd expect the number to sort of trend down through time over the course of the next year, year and a half.</p>

          <p>Okay. And my last question. You had a high level of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:01) sales and repayments this quarter, was this one or two big loans that got fixed and came out or was it sort of across the board and was there any unusual interest recapture?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This was spread over a large number of loans, but not &#x2013; in Capital Markets, it's a little lumpy. This is a &#x2013; so while there was a large number of loans, there were &#x2013; there are, obviously, larger recoveries as well. But I would suggest this is where I'm telling you the trend is a lot better because we are seeing recoveries in a large number of small loans on the commercial side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>First, a quick question for Surjit and related to Brad's question. Retail formations are up. I don't have a question about the U.S. In Canada, are there any signs of deteriorating credit quality &#x2013; retail credit quality in your <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:29)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at the moment. There's a lot of concern that you keep reading about, but as of now, the &#x2013; a lot of personal depends on the employment rate and the employment rate is pretty good at 7%, it's come down. And so, we haven't seen anything yet that would cause me concern.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Bill, you're sitting at 9.4% on the CET 1 ratio. You've got the NCIB approved, a quick question, maybe it's not a quick answer, but what's the probability that an acquisition opportunity might interrupt your planned share buybacks?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say in the short run, it's pretty low.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Just the dynamics of the market, sellers are feeling better about the future. And even if they would intend to do a transaction, at some point down the road I think the tendency will be to delay. And that certainly would be in personal and commercial banking. Smaller probability in the wealth area. It's about the same as it always has been.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. Two questions. First one is for Frank. Frank, I've seen some rival banks raise fees for deposit accounts in a whole bunch of little transactions. I'm wondering if you could comment on whether or not any of that is in the future for BMO it will be material.</p>
          <p>And then my second question is also on the buyback, but I'll take a slightly different approach to it. There's a sentence in there with respect to your &#x2013; it's on page 17 of your shareholder report. It says that bank will only initiate any purchases into the bid after consulting with OSFI. And I find that a peculiar sentence and maybe it's just me and I could be reading into this too much. But I thought in the past if you had it approved, you can just sort of set up a formulaic buyback and you sort of go on. What's the need for a consultation with OSFI and what is that they'd have to say on the matter after they've already approved your NCIB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Darko, it's Frank. Just on the first one quickly. We're always looking at our fee schedules relative to the competition. I'd say the opportunities that exist are pretty small at this point in time. We'll be opportunistic, but it's not going to play a big role in our revenue growth going forward over the course of 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Again (49:04), it's Tom. On the buyback question, we've got the approval for the program in its totality, but in the current environment in the new environment, I'd say it's customary to keep an active dialogue with your principal regulator on capital related matters and that would include checking in through the course of the year on intentions with respect to a buyback. And so, we don't think there's anything unusual about that. We think it's a reflection of the heightened focus on capital and the new way of doing things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, Tom, it doesn't mean that if you decide to buy back every day you're phoning up OSFI for permission or their...?</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Steve Theriault from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon. A couple of questions for Mark Furlong. Mark, I heard that there were some pulling forward of demand on C&amp;I lending towards the end of the year, potentially due to some tax fears coming into year-end. So was that the case and if so how much pull-forward was there and if not, has the pipeline just grown to the level where this level of growth is sustainable going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So with some pulled forward, I don't think there's any doubt about that, that some of the transactions that occurred near and pulled a little bit forward, but the pipelines are still full. And as I mentioned earlier, I can't recall whose question I was answering, but the &#x2013; that the growth was really broad-based across the portfolio, so it wasn't really all acquisition related. It was new customers and just expansion of things going on with the existing customers. So it was kind of a variety of areas, but one piece was some financing for some acquisition. So that would be the normal part.</p>
          <p>And then sustainability going forward, the pipelines are still pretty strong and they're kind of strong broadly across the portfolio. So it's hard to pin it into any one quarter, but if you said look out into the rest of 2013, how do you feel about loan growth? The answer is I feel really good about loan growth and kind of broadly across the commercial portfolio and broadly across geographies. So &#x2013; and I'd say it's kind of that result of we've had about two years together kind of the pre-integration, then integration, post-closing timeframe. And the teams really worked together well and they're various seasoned and they've been through several cycles. So, I mean, we expect them to be successful and I think we're seeing some of the result of that. It's hard to pick any one quarter, but overall feel very good about where we're at and very good about what the future holds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. The other question I wanted to ask was on expenses. If I go back, Mark, to the Investor Day last year, in the slides you target mid-to-low 50s for U.S. P&amp;C efficiency ratio. You've got the majority of the synergies now in the run rate. You've cracked the 60% level for efficiency. So the question is, are you targeting something in the 53% to 55% range over the next two or three years or is this a longer data target or am I missing anything here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we targeted kind of the low-to-mid 50s. And &#x2013; but part of that has to be. It's not just driving expenses, part of that is the revenue growth. So there's kind of two sides to the equation. But we do feel like we can get far more efficient and we do feel like a big piece of that is on the revenue side and we're beginning to see a little bit of that right now. But yes, we're not going to change those numbers. That's where we have to be to be competitive from profitability standpoint long term.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for letting me in again. A couple of questions on the buyback, so let me just ask this one directly. With the NCIB now approved and with the capital ratio strengthening again over 9% even after the eventual deduction of the CVA, do you plan to start the repurchase activity imminently, or is it still something that you're putting on hold until later in the year?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Just one on the U.S. expenses and another on the U.S. margins. U.S. expenses, they were down 7% quarter &#x2013; year-over-year, sorry. What would that decline have been if you hadn't reinvested in various growth initiatives and what are those growth initiatives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me think. If we hadn't reinvested...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, the growth initiatives are continuing to build out commercial banking, continuing to build out our mortgage platform and build out our mortgage capability. I mean those are probably the two single biggest on their own that then the third piece is not so expense related. It's the premier banking program which we talked about, which is the partnership between my business and Gilles' business and that's more fee-income related in.</p>
          <p>But there's a few people related, there'll be no material <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:36). So when we added a few personnel, that's not going to have a material impact in the averages for the quarter. So I &#x2013; and we'll have a few personnel ads for things like that through the rest of the year. But particularly focused in the mortgage side of the business and in the commercial banking side, where the growth opportunities sits today.</p>

          <p>It's &#x2013; well, we will have that, too. But we've &#x2013; we had &#x2013; if you looked at it, so kind of give you a perspective. The last 12 months we've mailed 7 million pieces of paper to customers and 7 million mailings. And about 80% of that was into the former M&amp;I franchise. The advertising and branding campaign has &#x2013; that launched kind of mid-November and has created all these brand awareness as will continue in various paces throughout the rest of the year. But that's kind of been planned into our run rate and our thinking about efficiency ratio and expenses and all that. So of course, that will continue just because that's part of running the business. But I don't think there isn't any unusual expenses you should expect or think is going to happen other than kind of the trends you're looking at.</p>

I'm sure we'll add over the course of the year, 150, 200 people predominantly in sales or sales support roles in P&amp;C U.S. if you went from very beginning to very end. And so, I suppose that averages 100-ish or something like that. We don't really look at it like that. It was more or so how do we build out the business correctly in every one of the markets we're in relative to the size we're in those markets. So, I mean, that &#x2013; I know that does quite good to your answer, but I &#x2013; so some small amount of the synergies are reinvested.</p>

          <p>Well I mean I &#x2013; yes, I think that's possible. I guess the way we look at the deposit side is if you looked at core checking year-over-year, consumer is up about CAD 1.2 billion. If you'll look at the commercial side, it's up over CAD 3 billion. So commercial has grown 18% in DDA and interestingly enough the commercial portfolio has grown 18% year-over-year. So we really think those two are matching each other very well.</p>
          <p>On the personal side, we've brought down some of the higher costing money market and CD products over the course of the year and that's just kind of excess funds, gradually bringing down pricing, kind of the normal stuff that you'd see in a portfolio, but we still have significant excess funding and I think we have a pretty good sense of elasticity of deposit pricing on that customer base. So we think we can move that back if in fact that's what we want to do. And so, we feel pretty good about both of them. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if we have another quarter or so where we actually bring down deposits based on pricing. If that's the right thing to do based on what our views are and kind of long &#x2013; on the near term pricing that's going out in the market. So I think we probably have a little more flexibility there than maybe some would give us credit.</p>
