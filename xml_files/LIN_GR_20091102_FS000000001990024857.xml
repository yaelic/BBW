          <p>Hello and good afternoon, everybody. It's Thomas Eisenlohr. Thank you for joining the call for our nine-month results today. Georg Denoke, CFO, will be hosting the call, and Aldo Belloni, Member of the Executive Board, is also available for your questions. We would like to ask you to restrain yourself to one question in the first part of the Q&amp;A session, in order to allow everyone to get through.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Georg and we will open the line again for your questions at the end of the presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everybody. Welcome to our nine-month analysts' call also from my side. Let me start with the key facts and figures, on page three of the presentation. Group sales reached &#x20AC;8.313 billion per end of September, with Group operating profit at &#x20AC;1.741 billion.</p>
          <p>Sales were hence down 11.5% from last year, while the profit decline was less pronounced at minus 8.8%. As you know, we are booking the restructuring charges linked to the acceleration of our HPO program in the reported operating profit. So if we look at the underlying operational performance by excluding these one-time charges, our operating profit for the nine-months period was actually down by 4.7% only.</p>
          <p>And let me add that, on the same basis, the third-quarter operating profit was on the same level as in the previous year. Reported EPS in the first nine months declined by 25% to &#x20AC;2.47, while the adjusted EPS decreased by 18% to &#x20AC;3.38. Note also here that before restructuring charges, the adjusted EPS declined by 9.9% only. Our strong cash flow performance has continued and actually even further improved in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Despite lower volumes, the operating cash flow for the first nine months 2009 was up by 9.5% to &#x20AC;1.424 billion. This strong performance obviously shows that our hard work regarding the optimization of our cost structure and the working capital management is paying off. This is what you can see throughout our figures published today. The effects of our HPO program are more-and-more visible.</p>
          <p>Among others, they have driven a further increase in profitability. While the recovery in end demand remains in a very early phase and volumes are still below last year's level, our Group margin before restructuring charges is up by 180 basis points to 21.9%. As we will see later, the margin in our Gases Division indeed further improved on the high level of the second quarter, driven by a ramp-up of cost-saving across all regions. Our outlook for 2009 is unchanged.</p>
          <p>As expected, the general market environment has continued to stabilize over the third quarter. With the rate of recovery further taking hold, our business performance in the second half-year should be better than in the first six months of the year. Nevertheless, sales and earnings levels as in the record year 2008 remain unattainable.</p>
          <p>Let's move into more details, starting with the overview of the Group sales by division on page four. Sales in the Gases Division in the nine-month period were down 7.4% on a reported basis, to &#x20AC;6.629 billion. The comparable sales development was minus 6.4% or minus 2.9% if we include the contribution of bolt-on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering Division, sales in the reporting period reached &#x20AC;1.677 billion, 18.7% below the high level of last year. The order backlog was 3.9 billion by the end of September. On the Other and Consolidation line, the sales contribution was slightly negative again as, during the course of the year, we had a high consolidation effect between the Engineering and the Gases Division.</p>
          <p>Turning to the operating profit development on page five, the Group figure in the first nine months was down 8.8% to &#x20AC;1.741 billion. Our operating margin hence increased, year-on-year, by 60 basis points to 20.9%. Adjusted for restructuring charges, the operating profit declined only 4.7%. The underlying margin improvement was 160 basis points.</p>
          <p>In the Gases Division, the operating profit in the nine-month period retreated by 3.1% to &#x20AC;1.763 billion. The operating margin hence increased by 120 basis points to 26.6% from 25.4% in the previous year. This positive development is of course also supported by the pass-through of the lower natural gas price but, as we will see later, also our internal actions delivered a strong contribution. Synergies, our accelerated implementation of HPO measures and positive pricing cushion lower volumes.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering Division, the year-on-year reduction in operating profit reflects the lower recognition of sales versus the previous-year period. The margin contribution remains strong and we are well on track towards our 8% target level. Finally, as you know, the restructuring charges are booked within the EBITDA of the Other/Consolidation segment and are hence fully visible in our reported operating profit figure. Due to the accelerated implementation of HPO, total restructuring expenses reached &#x20AC;80 million by the end of September.</p>
          <p>Let me start the overview of the Gases Division with the focus on the last quarter performance on page six of the presentation.</p>
          <p>There are some trends that we can see in the sequential development over the crisis year 2009. The first observation is that the improving sales trend that started in quarter two has stabilized and actually accelerated in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>With &#x20AC;2.279 billion of sales in quarter three, the Gases Division grew 3.9% on the previous quarter. The operating profit improved by 5.6% versus the second quarter, to &#x20AC;625 million. This means that the Gases Division again achieved an operating profit on par with the third quarter of 2008, despite the lower sales level.</p>
          <p>This strong operating performance clearly shows that our HPO acceleration is successful. With an operating margin of 27.4% in the third quarter, profitability even further increased from the strong second quarter figure.</p>
          <p>Also, the 190 basis points improvement versus the previous year figure shows very well the impact of our HPO measures. Even excluding the pass-through effect from lower natural gas prices, the operating margin increased by 90 basis points.</p>
          <p>When we look into the sequential trend by operating segments on page seven, you see a continuous growth in Asia and Eastern Europe, as well as in South Pacific and Africa. And also, in Western Europe and Americas, we have seen first signs of a recovery.</p>
          <p>The underlying improvement in Americas is not visible here as the reported sales figure for the third quarter was impacted by the lower natural gas price and the U.S. dollar weakness. Besides the first slight improvement in North America, the development in the region was supported by South America, as you will see later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Our sales run rates and factory loadings in the more mature countries show an improvement in trends and some encouraging signals, especially in September. Volume increases are slowly coming through. Recovery trends seem to be more solid in the emerging economies.</p>
          <p>The positive trend observed over the course of the year in regions like China, South and East Asia, Eastern Europe, as well as in South Africa, is reflecting a gradual recovery of end demand in these markets since the volume collapsed at the turn of the year.</p>
          <p>Of course, also in the emerging markets, the economic development is currently supported by stimulus packages and restocking effects, so we do not get carried away by these improvement trends.</p>
          <p>However, we are quite confident that these developing regions will keep offering an above-average growth opportunity in the years to come. And with an above 30% share of sales from these emerging markets and our good local market positions, we are well-positioned to benefit from the renewing economic dynamics in these regions.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a look at our four operating segments, starting with Western Europe on slide eight. Sales of &#x20AC;2.801 billion were 10.5% below the previous year figure, while the operating profit in Western Europe was down 8.4% to &#x20AC;782 million.</p>
          <p>Despite the lower volume demand, the operating margin hence stayed strong at 27.9%, supported by our HPO measures and positive pricing. Looking at the reported year-on-year decline in sales and operating profit, the currency effect from the British pound weakness has still a significant impact.</p>
          <p>On a comparable basis, so adjusted for currency, natural gas price and consolidation effects, the sales decline was indeed only 5.4%. As we have seen in the sequential picture, the demand has further stabilized but it is too early to call it a broad-based recovery yet. Within the product areas, healthcare keeps standing out with an ongoing solid year-on-year growth contribution throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to page nine, sales in the operating segment Americas of &#x20AC;1.485 billion showed a decline of 10.1% on a reported and 8.3% on a comparable basis. The operating profit, meanwhile, was about flat, with a minus 1.3% change to &#x20AC;316 million. This is a margin increase of 190 basis points to 21.3%.</p>
          <p>The development reflects, on the one side, the natural gas price effect of our hydrogen tonnage schemes and, on the other side, the benefit of positive pricing and the early implementation of HPO initiatives compensating for volume losses.</p>
          <p>Just as in Western Europe, we have seen the market further stabilizing during the third quarter. Some end markets also started to show first signals of a potential volume recovery. Sequential trends in North America are positive, and also the tonnage area has shown an improving momentum.</p>
          <p>Our activities in South America have fared quite well through the crisis, showing, by the end of September, not only growth in the healthcare but also in the cylinder product area, supported by the pricing.</p>
          <p>The overview of the operating segment Asia and Eastern Europe, on page 10, shows sales reduction of 8% on a reported basis to &#x20AC;1.343 billion. On a comparable basis, the decline was 6.4%. However, the operating profit was, with &#x20AC;415 million, on last year's level.</p>
          <p>Our operating margin for this emerging market segment hence improved again strongly, by 230 basis points to 30.9%. This strong performance reflects our HPO initiatives, as well as the contribution of our joint venture activities in this segment. The recovery in the emerging markets, which we have seen already towards the end of the second quarter, further continued.</p>
          <p>The development in Eastern Europe is thereby still somewhat lagging the recovery momentum observed in the Asian markets. Low grades in our tonnage schemes keep improving, with customers, especially in China, moving back again to higher capacity usage levels.</p>
          <p>With the recovery momentum gaining strength, we have also seen a stronger interest for potential new projects among our customers in these emerging markets. As you have probably seen, we signed last week a major tonnage contract with our longstanding Indian customer, Tata Steel.</p>
          <p>With an investment of around &#x20AC;85 million at the steelmaker site in Jamshedpur, we will extend the existing gases facilities. Upon completion in 2012, this site will operate the largest air separation unit in India. This contract shows, again, how we can build on our leading local set-up in Eastern Europe, Middle East, as well as in South and East Asia and China, to leverage the long-term economic potential in these regions.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the operating segment South Pacific and Africa, on page 11. Sales in these region increased in the first nine months by 8.6% to &#x20AC;1.052 billion. The adverse currency exchange rate effect from the Australian dollar was here more than offset by the new consolidation of Elgas, the Australian LPG business, formerly run in a joint venture structure. On a comparable basis, sales were down by 6.1%.</p>
          <p>Operating profit, of &#x20AC;250 million, was up 9.6% per end of September. The margin hence also strengthened in this operating segment, with 23.8% after 23.5% in the previous year. Again, positive pricing, HPO initiatives made major contribution to this profitability enhancement.</p>
          <p>As the worldwide economic environment is stabilizing, the relatively strong behavior of the Australian economy throughout this crisis is also reflected in our very robust business performance in the South Pacific region. While general volume trends were also affected, our operations had continued support from the pricing environment, the rental income, as well as our healthcare activities.</p>
          <p>In Africa, we have seen first slight signs of a market recovery. All in all, our performance in the operating segment has hence confirmed the first indications observed towards the end of the second quarter. The emerging market regions seem able to embark on a gradual recovery trend, while economic conditions in the more mature countries are slowly improving.</p>
          <p>In our Gases sales bridge, on page 12, this slowly improving momentum is reflected in the trend turnaround of our comparable sales growth rate embedded in the minus 6.4% figure for the nine-month period. After minus 4.4% in the first quarter and minus 8.8% in the second quarter, the price/volume effect for the third quarter recovered to minus 5.8%. And let me make it clear that this improvement is not due to an easing comparison base.</p>
          <p>We did not have any significant impact from the economic crisis on our business figures in the third quarter of 2008, so the minus 5.8% reflects the still negative but improving volume comparison, partly offset by positive pricing. Let me also remind you here again that the comparable sales figure is excluding bolt-on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Among the external factors affecting our reported sales growth, the natural gas price intensified to minus 3.1% over the course of the third quarter. As you know, the contractual pass-through of natural gas prices towards our tonnage customers does not affect the operating profit figure. It does only impact sales and margin.</p>
          <p>Please be hence aware that our reported sales growth was held back by the decline in natural gas prices, while the equivalent positive operating profit effect is embedded in our margin. The currency exchange rate effect stayed stable versus our last reported figure per end of June, at minus 1.4%. Among the major currency, the US dollar has weakened again over the last quarter, while the translational effect of the Australian dollar has continuously improved during the course of the year.</p>
          <p>The positive consolidation effect of 3.5% reflects the acquisition of our former joint venture Elgas in Australia and the Saudi Arabian Gases business, SIGAS. Business trends in the product areas of our Gases Division, on page 13, also reflect the general economic development over the course of the year. For the nine-month period, the bulk and cylinder business showed the biggest impact of the generally lower activity levels, with, on a comparable basis, bulk sales down 8.7% to &#x20AC;1.636 billion and cylinder sales reduced by 9.1% to &#x20AC;2.713 billion.</p>
          <p>In the tonnage product area, underlying volume reductions are cushioned by the contract structure of our take-or-pay clauses. Therefore, sales per end of September were only down by 4.2% to &#x20AC;1.513 million. The healthcare product area meanwhile achieved a very stable growth pattern throughout the year, with a 5.6% comparable sales increase to &#x20AC;767 million in the reporting period. If we look into the sequential development of the third quarter versus the second quarter, the upturn in general economic conditions is visible. The merchant segments are directly reflecting the underlying volume trends in their broad-based industrial customer segments, with bulk sales up strong by 4.5% and cylinder revenues increasing by 2.9%. Tonnage sales are meanwhile up 6.9% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the gradual ramp-up of capacity utilization rates.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 14, if you look into our pipeline of major Gases projects, let me try to give you a feeling on where we are standing in the investment cycle. First of all, on the existing project pipeline, our number of 64 start-ups with a minimum investment size of 10 million by 2011 is confirmed. You know that we have been in a very close contact with our customers throughout the crisis. Given the advanced stage of most of the projects and the recent improvement of general market conditions, we do not see our pipeline exposed to the risk of major changes in customer plans anymore now.</p>
          <p>And 2010 should be, as expected, the year with the strongest new revenue contribution from these 64 projects. If we turn towards the longer-term picture, then of course activity in new customer signings is still low. However, we have seen customer interest revive somewhat recently. Discussions on some projects that were frozen during the recession are now taking up again. And the new Tata contract in India is one strong example of typical success factors for a major tonnage project win, a longstanding customer relationship, bidding on a strong local market position in an attractive growth region.</p>
          <p>The strongest prospects are likely to come from the emerging markets. Again, with our strong local Gases market shares, as well as the customer relationships from our combined Gases and Engineering set-up, we are very confident regarding our competitive position here. Let me round up the review of our Gases performance with the joint venture figures on page 15. The development is quite in line with the broader picture we had in the first half-year. Proportionate sales, which are, as always, not included in our top-line figure, are strongly below last year's levels due to the full consolidation of our former joint venture, Elgas, as of October 2008. The share of net income shown on the right-hand side, however, is up strongly versus last year.</p>
          <p>The 23% increase reflects, among others, growing contributions from our joint venture schemes in Mexico and the continuous ramp-up of earlier start-ups, especially in China. Please remember that we are looking at a net income figure here, and this tends to be more volatile than a sales or EBITDA number. Let me remind you that we expect the contribution of our joint ventures to be at the upper end of the 50 to &#x20AC;60 million range that we target for this year.</p>
          <p>I'm now moving over to the Engineering Division on page 16 of the presentation. The order backlog of &#x20AC;3.9 billion is the base for a relatively stable sales development in the coming one to two years. I can also reconfirm that the cancellation rate we are currently seeing is not different from a usual level. Sales in the first nine months decreased by 18.7% to &#x20AC;1.677 billion. This decline is mainly due to the different project structure and state of completion of projects. The margin of 8.6%, per end of September, is in line with our 8% target level.</p>
          <p>As we have always pointed out, you cannot measure the Engineering business on a quarterly basis. From a year-to-date perspective, the order intake is down by 34% to &#x20AC;1.5 billion, against the record level of last year. At this stage, we see an increased activity level of project development, especially in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>I'm very pleased with the cash flow development, which you find on page 17, as it shows that all our efforts are really paying off. The operating cash flow after nine months reached &#x20AC;1.424 billion, exceeding the previous-year figure by 9.5%, despite the fall in revenues. This positive performance is mainly the result of the optimized cost structure and of the stronger working capital management. The investment cash flow for the first nine months was minus &#x20AC;715 million, in line with &#x20AC;716 million in 2008. The cash outflow for investments was net &#x20AC;653 million. We expect, like in the past years, an increase of cash outflow for investments for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The main part of our capital expenditure was dedicated to the execution of our tonnage and project pipeline, which are related to our long-term take-or-pay contracts. Payments for acquisitions and financial assets of &#x20AC;81 million mainly relate to the acquisition of our subsidiary, SIGAS, in Saudi Arabia and business activity in the Middle East. Driven by the strong operating cash flow development, our free cash flow before financing activities for the reporting period also improved significantly, by 21% to &#x20AC;709 million. After financing activities of minus &#x20AC;564 million, including our dividend and net interest payments, we had &#x20AC;145 million of free cash flow left to use for net debt reduction.</p>
          <p>This brings me to our next slide, the overview of our financial position, on page 18. Driven by the strong cash flow generation, net debt per end of September is back to &#x20AC;6.443 billion, in line with the year-end figure of &#x20AC;6.423 billion. The maturity profile of our financial debt remains well spread and very long-term oriented. The most significant development in the third quarter is the reduction of the short-term financial debt, down from &#x20AC;1.29 billion to &#x20AC;749 million. 90% of the financial debt is now due beyond 2010.</p>
          <p>As you know, also the short end of our maturity profile is very well covered. Our cash position of &#x20AC;857 million per end of September actually now exceeds the short-term financial debt by more than &#x20AC;100 million. Together with our &#x20AC;2 billion syndicated loan credit facility, we hence have a strong liquidity reserve of &#x20AC;2.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me also remind you here that we have signed a forward start agreement for the &#x20AC;1.6 billion credit facility to follow up on the expiry of the existing facility in 2011 and expand our financial flexibility up to 2013.</p>
          <p>Our outlook for 2009 on the last slide, page 19, is unchanged. The third quarter did indeed confirm our expectations regarding a moderate economic recovery in the second half-year. Nevertheless, global economic output will still be significantly below last year's level.</p>
          <p>I can therefore confirm our expectations for Group figures to further recover in the second half-year, compared to the first half. However, based on the economic background and the business figures per end of September, sales and earnings in 2009 will not achieve the record level of the previous year.</p>
          <p>I also confirm our target for the HPO program of &#x20AC;650 to &#x20AC;800 million gross cost savings between 2009 and 2012. For this year, we continue to expect &#x20AC;200 million gross cost reduction. The guidance for the divisions is also unchanged.</p>
          <p>In the Gases Division, we continue to expect a better business performance in the second half-year, compared with the first six months. However, this improvement will not be sufficient to reach the sales and earnings level of 2008.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering Division, we have a strong cushion embedded in our order backlog. However, sales for the full year 2009 will remain below the high previous-year figure. The target for our operating margin in this business stays at 8%.</p>
          <p>All in all, we are pleased with the development of our business in the third quarter. We see that our internal initiatives under the HPO umbrella bear fruits. We have strengthened our profitability and our cash generation in a very difficult economic environment.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we are seeing further signs of improvement in most of our end markets now. This is encouraging but be sure that we will not get carried away. We cannot drive our economic environment, but we can make sure that we are keeping improving our processes and our cost structures, as reflected in the improvement of the profit margin.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. We are happy to answer your questions now. And operator, please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much. It's Citi in London. I think you just said one question, so if I -- can you -- within your EBITDA or your profit, as you call EBITDA, break down the impact of price, the cost savings, acquisitions and any other key factors, just so we get a good idea of what is driving the quite impressive margin improvement? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, Andrew. Thank you for your question. I think we are never pointing out in detail volume and price analysis, but of course we want to give you a hint. And overall I think from the volume/price figure which is presented in our sales bridge, you can assume that in the last quarter roughly 3% is from the pricing side. And the big contribution of course comes from the HPO initiatives and the cost improvement here in the cost structure. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Matthias Cornu from Exane in Paris. I've got three questions. First, can you make some comment on what you see in October in terms of the main trend? There is a quote on Reuters suggesting that October was clearly below last year. Can you make a second short comment how do you see October compared to September?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of contribution of JVs, you mentioned some volatility here. Last year you had a pretty strong Q4. And what makes you believe that you will not beat the 50 to 60 million target you set for the year? At least you said it would be the upper range. But it looks like it means that Q4 will be pretty low. And last question, one of your competitors suggested that part of the reductions in CapEx and on clients could be replaced with some acquisition of existing plans. Just wanting to have your view on that please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you for three questions. I think we had this morning in a press conference and I think there was a misunderstanding in the comparison of figures and previous year's numbers. I think we haven't given any guidance about October. So we are talking about the nine-month period here and we haven't given any guidance also this morning. I think what people we were talking about was that October last year, October 2008, was the best month in history from an gases' perspective in Linde and that is what people are, I think, mixed up here.</p>
          <p>On your second question of the development of the net income contribution from joint ventures, we have the range of 50 to 60 million. You know that this is a volatile range, so we reconfirm that we are at the upper end of that 60 million range. I think we do not want to go further here. Of course, there is hope for improvement, but I think at this stage we do want to confirm that we are in the range at the upper end.</p>
          <p>Regarding the reduction of investment, I think we pointed out that against previous year's figures on the investment side where we had roughly 1.5 billion, we are below this number 10% probably this year. And this is still a very strong number, I think because we are working through the permits pipeline and project pipeline, which I was referring to in my presentation. So it's still a bold number, I think in a year of crisis like the year 2009.</p>
          <p>On the acquisitional side, I think we are opportunistic here as we were in the last year, I think we did a couple of bolt-on acquisitions. I refer here to the SIGAS acquisition mainly in the Middle East, which was a bolt-on acquisition to cover Saudi Arabia here and the Middle East activity, which was very helpful for us because we also can make use of our liquid product, which is coming through in the years to come in our joint venture with the ADNOC activity. And then we have consolidated &#x2013; fully consolidated post-acquisition of the minority path, the Elgas business here. So we have 100% of the LPG business in Australia. You will see us in the market doing small acquisitions as we did in the past. So now strategic change here. Thank you for your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>No. I think we don't have the number here which we can share with you because we are in the nine-month call and not in the 10-month call. And I think we are very early in November. So it would be really undiligent if we don't give you this number.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. It's SoGen [Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale] in London. The West European trends looked very favorable in Q3 on an underlying basis against Q2. I mean, my calculation is it is half the underlying decline. I know you've referred to obviously some pricing. You've referred to the rental income in cylinder. Just wondering what's behind that because the healthcare looks pretty similar in terms of growth rate on Q2 and Q3.</p>
          <p>So it's quite some improvement. Just wondering really, as it is &#x2013; is it the rental? Is it just the pricing, et cetera because you say stabilization in terms of the volume of that? Within that as well, the packaged or the cylinder gas business, particularly in the major markets. I mean, obviously, Germany was one where the activity trends were still down in terms of volume, even if the rental was holding up very well. I'm just wondering if that sort of business has also now stabilized and then you've got the rental pick on top. So those are the two questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Peter, for your question. I think what we try to point out is really that we have seen a stabilization in the third quarter in Western Europe. This is driven by the effects you were referring to. This is an additional, I think, against quarter two volume increase. And I would like to hand over to Aldo regarding the packaged gas development in the region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I can confirm that there is a stabilization, although at a lower level obviously. We have in the packaged gas business, in Europe, Western Europe, a different picture between the gases, which are used in the manufacturing industry for cutting and welding, so oxygen or special mixture, which are, of course, hit the worst. And then there is a better performance of other gases, like nitrogen and argon in the packaged gas business, which are about 10 points better. So &#x2013; but in general there is a stabilization at a lower level, like previous years, and the rental are also holding. The cylinder holdings are still quite good.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's J.P. Morgan in London. A couple of questions, please. Firstly, I wonder if you could give a little bit of perspective on the impact of changing mix on the margin, the higher or rather the less significant decline in the tonnage business and how that's supported the gases' operating margin?</p>
          <p>Also back to the joint ventures, and you stressed, and I understand that you shouldn't be looking at this on a quarterly basis, but as a percentage of sales the contribution is declining through the year, is that something that we ought to sort of assume remains at the Q3 level or would we expect the post-tax margin to improve?</p>
          <p>And then finally in the cash flow statement, I wonder if you could give a little bit of color on the &#x2013; on quantifying the signing-on fee for the ADNOC contract and what that contributed in the quarter, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Neil, thank you for your questions. I think when we talk about the improvement in margin, we definitely have to point out that we are participating in some respect regarding the volume reduction, as we said, in the second quarter. But this is not on the same level now in the third quarter. So we have less, much less planned shutdowns than in the second quarter, which is normally the weaker performing assets, which you shutdown some years and limited impact in quarter three compared to quarter two.</p>
          <p>I think the main point really comes from the improvement on the cost side. So we have improved our cost structure significantly compared to third quarter 2008. I can give this here. The main contribution, and of course we have pointed out that out of the margin improvement, roughly 100 basis points is related to the natural gas price impact from an overall perspective. I think on your second question, is this related to joint ventures again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, as I pointed out earlier to the other question, I think this is the full answer we really want to give at that stage. Yes, we have a ramp up of joint venture activities in the Chinese market especially, and here we see the progress over the year that is not coming out of 2009 only, it also comes out of the previous years. But the guidance is exactly where we have it pointed out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's Lutz Grueten, Kepler Capital Markets in Frankfurt. And just follow up on the HPO program, could you give us a bit more detail on what was achieved in the third quarter after nine months and also on the breakdown by region or segment? That would be really helpful. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you for your question Lutz. I think we definitely understand that this is very helpful on a regional basis. I think we are not there with our transparency. But definitely we can confirm that we were looking for an overall gross cost reduction target of 650 to 800 million until the year 2012. And the acceleration of the HPO program really brought us here for this year up to a number of 200 million.</p>
          <p>And we are confident that we will get that. That is a full mixture of a lot of initiatives. And some of these are fully sustainable. Some others will be not fully sustainable when it comes to a full recovery of the economy. So from that perspective, a full set of initiatives related to all aspects of the P&amp;L, so in the production cost, in the distribution costs, in the admin costs, in selling and in administration. So from that perspective I think we want to stay on that level.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Markus Mayer from UniCredit in Munich. Two questions from me. First, Praxair has reported a price decline in Europe quarter-over-quarter. And have you also seen such a negative price and development? And if not, when do you expect this should happen? And second question, can you give us an indication of how much of this 10% cash flow improvement comes from lower prepayment in engineering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming to the price effect, I think. You have to compare here, I think, the different structures between the competitors. I only can talk about Linde here. And I can confirm that we do not have a negative pricing impact in Europe in the last quarter at all. So from that perspective I think it's related and embedded in our different setups in Europe, with very strong market positions, for example, in U.K., very strong market positions in Scandinavia, and of course also here in some of the areas of Continental Europe. So I think this is not comparable.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Tony Jones from Redburn in London. With the HPO program being accelerated slightly, should we expect more than the 80 million of costs associated with that for the full year, so should there be some extra cost in Q4? And do you have any sort of rough guidance for the early part of next year? And also should we be shifting some of the amortization? If a big chunk of that is due to the BOC acquisition, should we be moving some of that into this year from next? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Referring to the 80 million which we have seen until September in our books, I think this is more or less the expected number, as we pointed out earlier. The expected number was 70, now it's 80. I think there's no big deviation which we expect in the next quarter. Regarding your amortization question, can you repeat that for me, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. It's Peter Mackey here from Morgan Stanley in London. Thank you for taking my question. Firstly, I just wanted to ask if you could give us an idea how much of your tonnage business is now actually on the take-or-pay levels at the moment, please? And whether you could give us a little idea of how that splits regionally?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just a quick question on the engineering business. How sustainable is that nearly 10% margin in the third quarter? Is there anything unusual in that Q3 number that we should be aware of when forecasting Q4 and beyond? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Peter, thank you for your questions. I start with the second question. We have an 8% target margin on an EBITDA level. I think this is the number which you should calculate with. The rest is coming through project progress and project structure in the progress over the quarter. And as I pointed out in my presentation, you should not compare that on a quarterly basis. I think please work with the 8% target margin over the quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just check then, that sort of indicates a number of perhaps 5.5 or 6% in the fourth quarter. Is that a number that you're comfortable with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think I'm not comfortable with this number. And it is been target, which is really, as I said earlier, not driven by quarterly performance only. It comes over the cycle in a way. And it comes over the project structure and project type. So overall, of course, five to 6% would be below our expectation at that stage. I can confirm that for the fourth quarter in engineering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Benoit Trochu. Please go ahead announcing your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi guys, Benoit Trochu from Cheuvreux, Paris. Two questions, first I would like to make a follow-up on the question of Matthias Cornu as regards the new projects, because it's a very important point for us, because it is clearly designed to enhance your growth after the crisis.</p>
          <p>So first, I would like to understand, first, if you estimate that you will be able to in fact ramp up all the projects you missed during the years? So meaning that you would have a clear acceleration of the new projects in the next quarter. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second is, you didn't answer the question of Matthias as regards what was mentioned earlier during this conference call, meaning the emergence of new projects coming from more outsourcing from companies in the tonnage business, which could be clear and good opportunities for us in order to fill the missing opportunities on greenfield projects.</p>
          <p>That was my first questions. And my third and last question is regarding the pricing. You mentioned 3% of contribution in pricing. I'd just like to understand, because there is -- it's always a bit confusing this point on pricing. It's to understand, if it's the pricing which is just for you a pass through of you cost, or if beyond this 3%, there is a gain in margin? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I start with the final question, I think, on the pricing side. Of course, here is the range which is 2.5 to 3%, I think, which we see. It's of course, depending on how is the comparable situation. So, we exclude volume and pricing and the number I was talking to, it's a comparable number, so excluding all the other impacts. So that is offsetting some of the negative volume components which we see all over the regions in the performance of the quarter.</p>
          <p>I come then to your first question and hand over for the second question related to the outsourcing to Dr. Belloni. I think we did not miss any projects over the crisis, if you say we missed projects. I think we have to admit that the market was here, at that stage, of course, in very different situations. And all our customers were working through crisis management instead of focusing on growth. So there was nothing which we missed. I think the Indian project now for Tata is a very good indication what we can do in emerging markets like India. And we were working through the crisis with the customer on that project. And now I would like over -- I would like to hand over to Dr. Belloni.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we also can confirm that the trend towards the acquisition of existing assets, as somebody called this, de-captivation; this is also a factor of our growth. Actually, even in the Tata projects, if you look at our press release, there is a component -- significant component of acquisition of existing assets through our separation plan, at this type in juncture four . Also last year, we announced the acquisition of the Arcelor assets in Romania which are already, of course, generating sales and profits for Linde.</p>
          <p>Normally, this de-captivation though takes place when there is an investment coming up. So it's not just the acquisition of existing assets. There is also always a project, a new investment which we would look for. But the beauty of this de-captivation is that the sales generation starts to be different.</p>

I just have a question with regards maybe helping a little for the modeling of our fourth quarter estimates. If we would estimate that we don't see any big further changes in currencies and natural gas prices for the remainder of this year, how -- could you give us a slight feeling how these two factors -- the top line impact of these two factors would come out for the fourth quarter? Thank you. Year-on-year comparison obviously, sorry.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we do not want to give really here the further details, Stephan, please understand that. And of course you could calculate it in a way on your own. I think it is only one quarter performance. And if you keep currency and natural gas flat, then I think you'll really find that out on your own. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. Just to return to what Peter Mackey was talking about, the engineering, if you can just confirm that you would expect plus or minus the normal fourth quarter strength.</p>
          <p>The second thing, on debt reduction, you've indicated you're unlikely to -- or you're initially thinking that you're going to see a cash outflow. It looks a little bit better than that. I just wondered if you could give an idea of whether you believe you're going to see some sort of debt reduction. And then I know it's a bit of a crystal ball, but just give an idea of what you might aspire to in terms of debt reduction in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your questions, Andrew. I think on the Engineering, again, on the fourth quarter, I think if you want to work with a number, then work please with the 8% target margin. I think this is --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I didn't mean the target margin. I'm just wondering whether there'll be the seasonal kind of bounce in volumes that you normally get in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah we will see from -- this is related also to your net debt reduction, I think. You will see a higher investment level overall, driven by our project map which we shared with you. So we expect investment in quarter four 2008, we expect a higher investment number compared to quarter three. This was more than 500 million in quarter four 2008. So we expect a similar trend in the fourth quarter 2009 and some of that is related, of course, to our engineering activity too, because it's a planned sales into our Gases division. So from that perspective, you will also see this little bit in the Engineering numbers.</p>
          <p>From an overall net debt reduction, you pointed out rightly that we here see roughly 150 million. Of course, you have to differentiate between here the cash flow number and the comparison of the year-end in the balance sheet. The year-end the balance sheet is also impacted by currencies. So if you would keep currencies on the same level of 2008, the number would be even further down compared to the &#x20AC;6.443 billion in net debt.</p>
          <p>So having said that, that we expect an increase in CapEx, I wouldn't plan for an aggressive net debt reduction in 2009. And we come to 2010 when we meet, let's say, in March 2010. Thank you for your understanding. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Rhian Tucker. Please go ahead announcing your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Rhian Tucker with Credit Suisse in London. I've only got two questions left, so I'll go through them now. The first is on Gist. I mean, there was no specific reference to it, but it was in the others line. It looks like the sales were down substantially year-on-year. Is that due to Marks &amp; Spencer's pulling back from Gist or are there any other factors there? And what you expect going forward on a kind of quarterly basis from Gist?</p>
          <p>Second question, I know we have gone a lot through pricing. But looking at tonnage in particular, Air Liquide said the pass-through energy costs were lower pass-through energy costs year-on-year and that their tonnage pricing was down. Is that true for you and is there a regional difference that explains why your energy costs are maybe up year-on-year compared to Air Liquide's being down? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rhian, I think the -- the Gist question is possibly detailed question. We also refer that the operational performance is, on a local basis, very strong and it comes mainly through the currency impact on an year-on-year comparison. Coming to the pass through of energy cost, I think we only can refer to one region, which is the U.K. region, where we have a positive impact out of that. I think all other things are quite similar, but I only want to focus on our part, which is U.K. is different in our numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you can confirm that your energy costs as a whole were -- were still up year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the U.K. level, that is what I am referring to. I think on a global basket level, I think it's down because of the volume reduction and the shutdown of air separation units, you will see this also in the energy-related number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just looking at energy pricing year-on-year for Q3, which should impact your tonnage pricing from an air separation unit, can you confirm that those energy prices are still up year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that is not the point. That is on a year-on-year basis up. The only exception is, on a regional basis, U.K.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Robert Heberger. Please go ahead announcing your company and location?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. This is Robert Heberger from Merck Finck speaking in Munich. First question is regarding the order intake in Engineering. You had a pretty weak quarter, I guess, in the third quarter. I think I remember that your guidance for full -- or your target for full 2009 was once roughly 2.5 billion. Is this target still valid or will it be lower?</p>
          <p>And also the consequence maybe for the sales level in 2010 in engineering, can we expect further growth in sales? And maybe also a vague, let's say, a vague outlook regarding revenue growth in the Gases division, assuming that, FX and consolidation, natural gas will be flat, will -- can we expect moderate growth or do we rather expect flat revenues in gases or maybe even a decline? Thanks. For 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you for your questions, Robert. I think we are still in the 2009 conference call. This is confirmation of our guidance for 2009. I do not want to move too much into 2010. Definitely, starting with your last question, when everything is continuing as it is expected at that stage with a further slowly improvement, then there is growth in the Gases division. On the Engineering part, we never had the guidance on order intake up to now and we will not give the guidance on order intake because we always point out that this is a very bumpy business. And I hand over for the description of the activity level in order intake to Dr. Belloni.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Your observation is correct, that Q3 was particularly slow in terms of order intake. We bagged the order of ADNOC at the end of June, before we accounted the order intake in the Q2, at the end of Q2. However, there's been an increased activity, project development. Of course, companies that's taking more time in order to hedge the market, settling on new contracts.</p>
          <p>I can tell you that there is a quite even distribution of new prospects for the coming months. We have oxygen projects for steel, for gasification in different geographies. We have hydrogen for refineries, that's in the U.S., in Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Russia. There is activity in mid-sized LNG. And there are very few other projects like this, so these are Latin America and Russia. So I can report on this increased level of activity. And the geographies, of course, are more conducive in emerging markets, like Middle East, China, India and former Soviet Union. Also Central Asia is offering new prospects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Jean de Watteville. Please go ahead announcing your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Jean de Watteville from Nomura. First question is on onsite. Like for Air Liquide, despite the sharp recovery of operating rates for fee customers in industries like chemical and steel, the improvement is not clearly visible from Q2 to Q3, which suggests that a lot of the recovery happened in sites that were below take-or-pay levels in Q2.</p>
          <p>I appreciate you don't want to share the figures of what is under take-or-pay at the end of Q3. But if you could give us some qualitative comments of how did that turn out on the Q2 to Q3 performance. And would -- and if you are recommending us to be cautious about similar phenomenon when you get into Q4 if operating risk continued to improve in customer's industry. So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on capital expenditures. I think you kind of confirmed in a previous question on that call, that the guidance for CapEx for this year is between 1.3 to 1.4 billion, which assumes CapEx of 500 to 600 million in Q4. It's a really big jump up. And I was just wondering if you could confirm that.</p>
          <p>The third question, order intakes in engineering. I appreciate it's a bumpy business, but as a matter of fact, in previous calls, Mr. Belloni, you have been quite optimistic about the fact that there is decent commercial activity. And effectively, you talked about 2.5 billion order intake. So I'm not asking you to give a figure. But could you just qualitatively tell us of what are the sectors still active and if the portfolio of projects you're pitching on is diminishing or still intact?</p>
          <p>And the very last question is an accounting one. Can you just give us the share of the order backlog in engineering that is related to Linde Gas projects? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, Jean, I just answered the question referring to the industries and the geographies which are particularly active at the moment in terms of engineering projects. So I think you can refer to that. In terms of our sentiment of the engineering market, definitely the Q3 was more conservative, or less aggressive than expected, for the reasons which I mentioned, they were that the customers are thinking twice before committing to especially big projects. And that would be difficult to give you a guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis.</p>
          <p>With regards to the tonnage business, your first question, we have geographies like China, for instance, where none of the upside plans is on take-or-pay or below take-or-pay. All the projects, all the plants are operating at close to nameplate capacity, some of that even above. Other geographies, of course, Western Europe, U.K. especially, they are quite depressed. And then the steel industry is minus 30% in terms of orders. So I now hand over to Georg for the CapEx question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean, when you take our last year's CapEx number in the gases arena, this was roughly 1.46 billion. So if you come to a reduction of 10%, you are close to 1.3 billion rather than to 1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>I think I would like to motivate you to see rather 1.3 than definitely 1.4, which is unlikely that the still insignificant improvement of the CapEx number in the fourth quarter. On your accounting related question, I think it's not an accounting related question. Only I do not give any guidance here on the order backlog from an internal perspective. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If I can just ask a follow-up, Mr. Belloni. You gave us the answer for China that is running at capacity. But can you give any color on the businesses that are operating below? Presumably they have improved. I think it's important for us because if you keep having improvement in chemical and steel activity in Q4 in Europe and North America, should we take that into account and forecasting and improve of the base business in tonnage, or there is still some phenomenon related to the take-or-pay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually we have a decent performance in our accounts in petrochemicals, also in North America. And I don't see any significant change in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So where are the activities still below take-or-pay? Is this metals in Europe, or what is still under take-or-pay right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we had that question earlier. I think we do not refer to a regional discussion here. Overall, I think you have seen a significant improvement in quarter two. You see a decent development on quarter three numbers. And, as pointed out, do not expect major changes, otherwise we would communicate more aggressively on that part. And I think the biggest contribution in the end comes through new onsite in 2010, independent of the level which is improved at that stage.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Thomas Swoboda from MainFirst in Frankfurt. I have just one question left, and I'm wondering if you could give us a feeling on the volume development in gases on monthly basis. I'm especially interested how strong was the summer dip you saw this year, and how was the up take in volumes in September compared to August? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we &#x2013; as we said in the second quarter call, we saw a ramp up in the month until June, continuing then and good performance in July. And then we saw the &#x2013; I would argue, the normal summer and not an extended summer. This is &#x2013; which were discussed, of course. But this I would argue was a normal summer dip compared to the previous year. So lower activity level overall to 2008, but continuing the trend in the third quarter as we have experienced it in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also, if I may ask, was there a significant up take in volumes in September compared to August?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think September was coming back because it was post summer break.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was post summer. And if I can risk a follow-up, looking obviously forward into Q4, I know you don't want to share too much detail, but looking at September and the progress of the business in Q4, do you see any major changes to the developments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we come back to the point that we rely on our customers. And as we pointed out, we expect in the second half year stronger than the first half year, which we have included in our guidance. And to remind you, October last year was the best months from a gas perspective in history. And then we saw in November, a decent decline continuing then in December 2008. So from that perspective, I think we do not want to give further detail. We hope that the trend which we have experienced now will continue, as we experienced also in the September post summer break.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello again. I wanted to just ask Dr. Belloni a question about the competitive environment at the moment in terms of those projects that are available. I've read in a couple of different places that one of your competitors, Messer, is more active perhaps than they have been for a couple of years in both Germany, but also in China. And I wonder if you have seen any experience of that, and your take on that in terms of whether you think they're even making inroads in terms of market share. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, that question, are you referring to engineering or gas projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gas projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well I think that in terms of gas projects, the competition is, of course, confined to the usual suspects. And yes, Messer has increased their activities, especially in the countries of Eastern Europe and China, as you mentioned. But this is not going to change the overall picture dramatically. There are also very, very large projects being tendered at the moment. And these are beyond the capacity of this company. But in general the competition is as it was before.</p>
