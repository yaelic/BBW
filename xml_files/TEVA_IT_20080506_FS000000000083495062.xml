          <p>Greetings and welcome to the Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited First Quarter 2008 Results Conference Call.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  .</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Kevin Mannix, Senior Director of Investor Relations.  Thank you.  You may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Diego.  Good morning and good afternoon everyone.  Welcome to Teva's first quarter 2008 earnings call.  We hope you've had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning.  A copy of the press release is available on our website at www.tevapharm.com.  Additionally, we are conducting a live webcast of this call that is also available on our website.</p>
          <p>Today, we are joined by Shlomo Yanai, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dan Suesskind, Chief Financial Officer; Bill Marth, President and CEO of Teva North America; and Moshe Manor, Group Vice President of Global Innovative Resources. Shlomo and Dan will begin by providing an overview of our results.  We will then open the call for question-and-answer period.</p>
          <p>Before we proceed with the call, I would like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language contained in today's press release also pertains to this conference call and webcast.  Shlomo?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kevin. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today as we review Teva's results for the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>I'm very pleased to report that the year is off to a strong start for Teva in terms of both our financial performance and our strategic achievements.  Today I would like to briefly review the financial highlights of our quarter and then I would like to share with you some of the quarter's strategic highlights.</p>
          <p>Teva's net sales in Q1 reached $2.6 billion with gross margins of 53.3%. Our adjusted operating profit was $679 million with adjusted net profit of $529 million; and all of this ultimately brought us to adjusted diluted EPS of $0.64.</p>
          <p>Strong contributions from Teva's many businesses and geographies drove our results in Q1.  Teva USA had an excellent quarter, extending its leading market share in the US among all pharmaceutical companies, both generics and brand, to 12.4% of total prescriptions and capturing 42% of the growing and total prescriptions of the entire pharmaceutical market for the 12 months ended March 2008.</p>
          <p>North American pharmaceutical sales in Q1 were up 28% over Q1 '07.  Quarterly sales benefited from the launch of alendronate in February, the launch of pantoprazole in December, and the continued strength of amlodipine benazepril, which was launched in May 2007.  And as we look ahead, we are equally enthusiastic about the planned launches of bupropion XL, risperidone, and lamotrigine later this year.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline of products is robust with 155 product applications representing $98 billion in branded sales waiting FDA approval.  Of these, 88 were Paragraph IV applications challenging patents of branded products.  We believe we were the first to file on 49 of these products, the branded versions which have had US sales of over $38 billion in 2007.  We anticipate final approval for most of these applications within the next three years.</p>
          <p>Our Paragraph IV applications are at their highest historical levels.  We are involved in complex litigation of some of these applications. And while the outcome of each individual case and the timing of each product's eventual launch are of course uncertain, what is certain is that Teva has more significant opportunities for new product launches than any of our competitors.  And this is all before we double our R&amp;D capabilities as we plan to do over the next few years.  Because our pipeline is so robust, even legal setbacks in one case or another won't affect our long term business fundamentals.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we did some reorganizing of our European and international businesses, so that what we call our European business will now consist of all EU members.  Dan will elaborate on this during his review of the quarter.  No matter how we organize the management of these businesses though, it was a good quarter in both our European and international markets with sales up 17% over Q1 '07 in Europe and up 29% in our international region. Our performance in these regions was driven primarily by strong sales in Germany, France, Poland, Italy, Russia, and across Latin America.</p>
          <p>This was an outstanding quarter for Teva's Innovative business as in-market sales of Copaxone grew 35% over the first quarter of 2007.  In the US, in-market sales increased by 20%. Outside the US, in-market sales increased by an extraordinary 64%, driven by primarily European sales.  I would like to note that while we of course expect Copaxone to continue growing, we do not anticipate that this truly extraordinary pace of growth is to be expected in future quarters. This is the third quarter in which Copaxone led the market in US net sales and the first quarter in which it also led in global sales.  Copaxone continues to outpace the market growth and we expect it to continue to perform extremely well.</p>
          <p>A number of recent studies once again confirmed Copaxone's efficacy, including the PreCISe study, which showed that in patients with a first clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis, Copaxone delayed the time to clinically defined MS by 45%.  Based on this data, an application for an extension of Copaxone's label was submitted both to the EMEA [European Medicines Agency] and the FDA.  Copaxone efficacy, its superior safety and tolerability profile, and the fact that it is the only MS therapy on the market with competitive long term data, we would believe continue to make it the first choice of physicians.</p>
          <p>Dan will provide you with more detail about our financial performance this quarter.  I would like to turn now to some of the strategic highlights of the year thus far.  At our Investor Day in February, we told you about what we called Teva's 20/20 target, to achieve $20 billion in revenues with more than 20% net income margin by the year 2012.  At the heart of the strategy that will allow us to reach our targets is our focus on market leadership, specifically on enhancing our market leadership by increasing market share and widening the gap between Teva and our competitors.</p>
          <p>In February, we laid out for you some of the key pillars of our strategy.  But since any strategy is ultimately only as good as its execution, I would like today to share with you just a few of the ways in which we have already begun implementing our plan in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>As we discussed with you, in order to support our growth, we planned to double our manufacturing and R&amp;D output by 2012.  We are already making significant progress in doing so.  During Q1, we began expanding our existing facilities in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Ireland, and Israel.  We believe this expansion will enable us to deliver even more quickly on our goals of doubling our business and redefining customer service in our industry.</p>
          <p>On the last day of Q1, Teva signed an agreement to acquire Bentley Pharmaceuticals.  This acquisition will provide us a strong platform in the fast growing generics market in Spain, one of our high priority countries in one of our high priority regions, Europe. Combining our existing Spanish operations with Bentley's will enable us to offer over 170 products in Spain, a product portfolio comparable to that of Spanish market leaders, And we will have other 45 products pending registration. We are very impressed with Bentley's strong local managers and employees who have achieved excellent results in the past and who will be invaluable to our success moving forward.  We are looking forward to welcoming them into the Teva family.  We expect the acquisition of Bentley to close by the beginning of Q3 or perhaps even earlier and to become accretive within 12 months of closing.</p>
          <p>Another major goal of our strategy is to become a leading player in biogenerics, a field that we believe is both the next wave of technology and the next wave of generics.  During the first quarter, we closed the CoGenesys acquisition, an important step in reaching our goals in this arena.  We are very excited about the projects we are undertaking at CoGenesys and the many opportunities that they will offer us in biogenerics.  These are just the few examples of the many ways in which we are already executing our strategy.  We have been able to make great strides very quickly because the entire Teva family and because our many businesses around the world are truly on board with this plan.  There is a real feeling of excitement in the air here and a tremendous sense of the determination and commitment to meeting and perhaps even surpassing the ambitious target we have set.  We'll continue to keep you updated on our progress.</p>
          <p>For the last 103 quarters, this has been the point at which the Teva quarterly conference call would be turned over to Dan to review the financials.  Today, I have the honor of introducing Dan's remarks for the final time.  Although Dan and I have only worked together for a short time, he has been a truly wonderful colleague and a trusted advisor.  Indeed, like so many others at Teva and like so many of you who are joining us today, it is hard for me to imagine Teva without Dan.  I'm very pleased that we will not have to, for although Dan is retiring from his role as CFO, he will continue to walk with us in many other roles and in many other ways in the future.  On behalf of the entire Teva family, Dan, I want to express our gratitude for all of your tremendous accomplishments in your 31 years at Teva and to wish you every happiness in the years to come.</p>
          <p>I would also like to warmly welcome Eyal Desheh, our new CFO, to this firm.  Eyal, we are very happy to have you back at Teva after your 12 years away at other companies.</p>
          <p>And now, I would like to turn the call over to Dan for the 104th and final time for an in depth review of the quarter's financials. Dan?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Shlomo, for your warm words and wishes, much appreciated; and good day to all of our friends around the world.  I hope you have had the chance to review the excellent quarterly figures we released this morning, a nice start of the new year.</p>
          <p>As we previously announced, we closed our acquisition of CoGenesys during the first quarter.  This acquisition resulted in an in-process R&amp;D charge of $382 million. As we have done with acquisitions in the past, we have factored out this in-process R&amp;D charge in our as-adjusted presentation; and throughout today's call, I will largely refer to that presentation.  We strongly believe that the as-adjusted results, which are the results used by management and our Board, provide a better indication of Teva's operations and business trends.</p>
          <p>But first, let me give you a synopsis of our US GAAP figures: sales at $2.57 billion, up 24% over Q1 of last year; gross profit 1.4 billion; net income $147 million; EPS $0.18.  In Q1 of last year, there were no adjustments, so all comparisons with '07 first quarter will be to US GAAP figures.</p>
          <p>And now to the as-adjusted figures, in the first quarter of '08, adjusted net income was $529 million, a 55% increase over net income of Q1 '07. And adjusted EPS was $0.64, an increase of 52% over the comparable quarter.  Shareholders' equity on March 31 '08 reached $14.4 billion, a $672 million increase over December 31 '07.  Once again, we generated very significant cash from operations, amounting to $746 million for the quarter, while free cash flow after CapEx and dividends amounted to $512 million.</p>
          <p>At March 31 '08, our total cash and financial investments reached $3.6 billion after giving effect to the 412 million acquisition cost for CoGenesys and an additional charge of $55 million on the portfolio of auction rate securities which I will discuss a bit later on this call.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, Q1 sales reached close to $2.6 billion, an increase of 24% or approximately $500 million year over year.  Q1 sales benefited about 6% from exchange differences, due mainly to the weakening of the US dollar compared to other currencies.  But let me already mention at this stage that the exchange differences had practically no effect on our bottom line.</p>
          <p>Pharmaceutical sales in North America benefited from strong sales in our generic business in the US and Canada.  In the US, generic sales were up 47% Q over Q and reached $1 billion.  Sales in Q1 benefited from 32 new products that were not sold in the comparable quarter of '07, the most significant being the exclusive launch at the end of '07 of pantoprazole and other products launched in last three quarters of '07 such as amlodipine benazepril and famicyclovir, together with the launch during the quarter of alendronate. In addition, there was still a significant amount of sales of Oxycodone, a product we stopped selling late January '08.</p>
          <p>Pharmaceutical sales in Europe grew 18% to an all-time high of $667 million and represented 28% of global pharmaceutical sales.  It should be noted that we have reclassified our organizational breakdown starting this reported quarter to align our financial reporting with an organizational change which was effective as of April 1 '08.  The CEE countries that became part of the EU, the major ones in terms of Teva sales, or Poland, Czech, and Slovakia, were moved out of our international business unit into the European business.  You will remember that we have previously always included Hungary in our European sales. The comparable Q1 '07 figures were adjusted to this presentation for actual activity. And by the way, in a few days you will find on our website the new what we call the new Europe sales for all the quarters of last year.</p>
          <p>European generics in dollar terms grew about 14%, but they are only slightly up in terms of local currency.  Growth in France, Italy, and Spain was essentially offset by the following factors: a decrease in sales of Humantrade, our Hungarian distribution subsidiary; the impact of the disposition of Teva's blood business in Hungary in Q4 of last year; a reduction in inventory level among UK wholesalers and pharmacies during the first quarter; and anticipated price reductions in the Netherlands, which took place in April '08 which had a negative impact on Q1 sales.</p>
          <p>International pharmaceutical sales, by which we now mean sales outside of the US, Canada, and Europe &#x2013; as you know, the EU countries as mentioned grew 31%, a growth rate that was significantly higher than the group average, mainly due to the acceleration in sales in Teva's main international geographies, including our business in Central Europe, our Latin American business, and our business in Israel. Less than one-third of the increase in our international sales was attributable to local currencies appreciation.</p>
          <p>Global in-market sales of Copaxone amounted to $542 million. This is a 35% increase over the comparable quarter.  In the quarter, Copaxone became for the first time the highest grossing MS product globally. Sales in the US, a relatively mature market, increased 20% to $311 million. And non-US sales increased 64% to $231 million.  Non-US sales of Copaxone accounted this quarter were 43% of total global in-market sales.  In the US, Copaxone increased its market leadership as our market share reached 35.4% in total prescriptions in March '08.  The comparison with '07 was positively affected by the two price increases in '07, which contributed about half of the Copaxone in-market sales increase in the US.  Another 12.5% price increase announced in February '08 had only a minimal impact on the quarterly sales.</p>
          <p>Outside the US, we benefited from solid growth in Europe with increased market share.  The extraordinary increase in sales Q over Q outside the US, as mentioned 64%, is not indicative of expected growth rates in the future quarters but it includes the substantial sales to markets in which sales are not evenly spread over the year compared with the exceptionally low such sales in the comparable quarter.  The non-US sales of Copaxone also benefited from the strengthening of European currencies.</p>
          <p>On April 1 '08, Teva took over the distribution responsibilities for Copaxone in the US and Canada from sanofi-aventis.  First, we are proud to note that this was a seamless transition.  Secondly, we ended up sticking to our original agreement.  According to the agreement, we record as of Q2 '08 all of the in-market sales of Copaxone in North America as compared to booking the sales at the transfer price to sanofi-aventis prior to that date.  Parallel to this change in North America, we will book for the next two years under SG&amp;A a 25% payment on sales payable to sanofi-aventis.</p>
          <p>These two changes more or less offset each other and have particularly no impact on the operating profit of Copaxone as compared to the current arrangement.  This reflects a different accounting treatment from the one which, as you may recall, we originally expected, namely the cash payment to sanofi-aventis would be deducted from sales.  Again, this change in the accounting treatment will have no impact on the operating profit or net income but as compared to the originally expected accounting treatment, it will increase our sales, the gross margin, and the SG&amp;A.  To remind you, SG&amp;A will also increase as a result of the fact that sanofi-aventis will no longer participate in our marketing expenses for Copaxone in the US as of Q2 '08.</p>
          <p>For your models, although there is no change in our expectation, this treatment of recording North American Copaxone sales means that our consolidated sales, which we expected to amount to approximately $10.7 billion in '08, would now be expected to increase to approximately $11 billion, and SG&amp;A would increase correspondingly.  SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales for the rest of '08 could actually reach levels on the order of 22 to 24%.</p>
          <p>I would like to emphasize that all these lengthy explanations relate only to the impact on some line items above operating profit and has no effect whatsoever on operating profit or net income.</p>
          <p>Our global respiratory products business, which is included in the North American and European sales figures, as I have already mentioned, had sales of $168 million in this quarter compared with 193 million in Q1 of '07, which benefit &#x2013; Q1 '07 benefited from particularly strong demand for Teva ProAir product ahead of an anticipated shortage in CFC propellant-based products.  During the first quarter of '08, Teva maintained its overall market leadership with approximately 60% share in the HFA market, which constitutes approximately 60% of the SABA market in the US.</p>
          <p>And next to Teva API business; this quarter, total API sales amounted to $510 million, up 51%.  This includes internal API sales totaling 357 million, an increase of 89% over the comparable quarter of '07, and $153 million of sales to third parties, an increase of 3%.  The quarterly breakdown between third-party sales and internal sales reflects the periodic swings in opportunities of Teva's Pharmaceutical business and those of the third-party clients of Teva's API business.</p>
          <p>Stepping down one line in the P&amp;L to gross profit, the gross profit margin increase reached 53.3% in this reported quarter, the highest in the last six quarters, and very substantially higher than the 49.9% of the comparable quarter, which was the lowest quarter in '07.  This reflects new products, sales in the US, as well as increased margins in Europe API and Teva's Innovative business.</p>
          <p>And from gross margin to R&amp;D, net R&amp;D increased quarter over quarter by 33% to $179 million or 7% of sales, probably the highest ever at Teva.  This record is a direct reflection of the increased emphasis on generic R&amp;D coming out of our internal strategic review process as detailed in our Investor Day held in New York in February.  And we are on track to increase our R&amp;D spending level to 7.5% of total sales.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A, which reached $540 million in the quarter, represents 20% of sales compared to 21.9% in the comparable quarter.  On an annualized basis, SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales amounted to a closer figure of 20.2% in fiscal '07.  As mentioned above, this line item is going to increase substantially since as of Q2 '08 both in terms of dollars and as percentage sales, reflecting the double effect of the termination of our agreement with sanofi-aventis re Copaxone in North America.</p>
          <p>Operating profit this quarter amounted to $679 million or 26.4% of sales, substantially higher than in the comparable quarter and higher than the 25.5 achieved in fiscal '07.</p>
          <p>As to financial expenses, we recorded $57 million of financial expenses in Q1 of '08 compared with $28 million recorded for the comparable quarter of '07.  In addition to our traditional financial expenses and income which amounts <mark type="inaudible" /> [$57 million], this line item also includes a charge against our portfolio of auction rate securities amounting to $52 million before tax, or $0.05 per share. This charge was calculated based on an internally developed model which evaluated every single security in the portfolio.  The balance of our ARS portfolio as of March 31 '08 stands at $334 million.  This balance is after giving effect to this P&amp;L charge this quarter, the amount provided in our balance sheet under other comprehensive income, and after taking into account substantial sales of these securities affected ex par during the past two quarters.</p>
          <p>As to the provision for income tax, the provision this quarter amounted to $93 million or 15% of adjusted pre-tax income.  This is our best current estimate for our expected annual tax rate for the whole of fiscal '08 and is lower than the '07, 17%, reflecting mainly the expected launches in the US over the year which to a large extent which were developed and will be produced in Israel with Teva produced API, the profit on which is taxed at a very low Israeli effective tax rate.  This is another benefit of our vertical integration. However, we are not in a position at this point to assure you that this is a sustainable rate for future years.</p>
          <p>All that leads to our adjusted net income of $529 million, up 55% from last year.  Adjusted EPS based on this income to which about $6 million were added back related to our converts, works out to $0.64 per share.</p>
          <p>And from EPS to cash flow, as mentioned our cash generated from operations amounted to $746 million and our free cash flow after CapEx of $139 million net and dividends of $95 million amounted to $512 million.  As we have mentioned in February, the relative lower cash flow in the last quarter of '07 reflected the end of managed launch of pantoprazole, the receivables of which were settled in this reported quarter and are the main reason for this relatively high cash flow.</p>
          <p>Our working capital increased sequentially by approximately $253 million and at March 31 amounted to $4.7 billion compared to $4.5 billion at the end of '07.  The main reason for the higher working capital level this quarter is increased inventories, reflecting both our continuous effort to improve customer service levels, including inventory buildup for large launches in subsequent quarters in the US, and the impact of exchange differences.  In terms of days, they increased from 176 days to 193 days.</p>
          <p>And now let's move to some other working capital items.  DSO, days sales outstanding amounted to 62 days this quarter compared to 63 days in Q4 of last year.  This mainly reflects lower trade receivables in the US due to the settlement of the receivables recorded the end of '07 in connection with the sales of pantoprazole. On the other hand, non-US trade receivables increased due to the strengthening of non-US dollar currencies.</p>
          <p>When we calculate DSO, as we always do, we do it after netting out from receivables the sales reserve and allowances, the so-called SR&amp;A. To remind you, we record receivables on a gross basis and record the SR&amp;A under current liabilities. But in order to facilitate a more meaningful comparison with some of our peers, when we record receivables net of these reserves, we have used the net figure.</p>
          <p>Total SR&amp;A at March 31 '08 amounted to $1.9 billion, an increase of $204 million from '07.  About 91% of the total reserves are from the US, up $200 million from December '07, most notably due to the chargebacks for new products and the timing of the processing of certain rebate and return credits to customers.</p>
          <p>CapEx reached $142 million in this quarter, slightly lower than Q4 of '07.  We expect CapEx to accelerate significantly as the year evolves, with CapEx exceeding $700 million for the full year, mainly reflecting the recently announced plan/capacity expansions to support our strategic plan.</p>
          <p>As to our debts, $3.3 billion or 62% of our total interest bearing debt at March 31 is long term, of which 1.4 billion is our convert and $1.9 billion is in straight fixed or floating interest debt.  Our leverage measured as debt to debt plus equity at March 31 stood at 0.27, unchanged from the December 31 '07 level.</p>
          <p>Shareholders' equity as March 31 '08 reached 14.4 billion.  It should be noted that of this increase over 2007 year end of $672 million, 590 million represented the increase in our global net assets due to depreciation of the US dollar.</p>
          <p>For the convenience of our audience, I would again like to mention three figures relating to our share count so that we're all on the same page. For the first quarter of '08, our average share count for the purpose of calculating fully diluted adjusted EPS was 836 million shares. While at the end of the quarter, our share count for calculating fully diluted earnings per share going forward is approximately 837 million shares.  And for calculating our market cap, it is approximately 777 million shares.</p>
          <p>Yesterday, the Board approved a first quarter dividend amounting to approximately $106 million.  On a per share basis, our dividend, which is declared in Israeli shekels, amounts to NIS 0.45. And based on the current rate of exchange of the shekel to the dollar, this translates to $0.13 per share.</p>
          <p>And before we go into the Q&amp;A, a few personal words; yes indeed, Shlomo, this is the 104th time I am doing the quarterly reporting of this great company's results; but not less important, it is my last official one.  And I felt this is the moment to add some personal words to this formal presentation and first of all to thank you all. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your patience and thank you for all the things I have learned from you over the years.  I appreciate the friendships created with many of you.  Many of you moved from sell-side to buy-side, from analysts to portfolio managers and beyond, but the friendships followed wherever you went and it is here to stay.</p>
          <p>It's not easy to leave a position like this, but what certainly makes it easier for me is my successor Eyal, who sits next to me in this room, as he sat in February when we also closed the year together.  Knowing that it's Eyal, who I know for so many years, is not only making my condition easier, but it should also give all of you a lot of comfort.  This has been a well-planned and very smooth transition process starting in October of last year when I first announced my plans to retire.</p>
          <p>The development of Teva over the years can be demonstrated through many parameters and statistics. You have probably heard before that in the past 24 years or so, the Teva stock price appreciated about 600-fold.  Another parameter which interests you as a shareholder is that in the first year after I joined Teva, the annual dividend paid amounted to about $700,000. And as you just heard, the Board approved yesterday a quarterly dividend of about $106 million. This is about the same ratio, a 600-fold increase, and who said there is no strong correlation between the stock price and the other underlying dividend.</p>
          <p>I am saying goodbye now, although I hope that I will see many of you in the six conferences Eyal and myself plan to attend between now and midyear.  And to you, Eyal, all the best; you take on yourself a huge challenge but a very rewarding and interesting one. You will soon find out that you will be assisted by a great financial team and have the support of Teva's leader Shlomo and the whole management team. And on top of all that, remember that whenever you need help, I am only one phone call away.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for your time and attention today. Now we will finally take your questions. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First, Dan, obviously we'll miss you, thanks for everything. As far as questions, ProAir you called out in the press release there being down versus last year. Can you give us a sense of what's going on out there? Obviously we're seeing the script trends with the CFC &#x2013; and when is this is going to start to ramp down, and you're going to start to ramp back up? Is this definitely going to happen just in the first quarter or do you think this is going to linger into early next year?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, will you take it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; hey, Marc, good morning. Just to talk about the ProAir for a minute, I would remind that we've maintained about a 60% share of the HFA market, and we continue in that same share. What you saw in the first quarter really was an aberration as opposed to, if you could remember back to '07, Warrick had announced that they were pulling out of the market, and it was unknown at that point in time how much material Armstrong had left. What happened though &#x2013; and so we got a lot of buying in the first quarter last year, and so that was part of the issue. But looking at the past was that Armstrong was able to fill that void very effectively.</p>
          <p>So, the issue then moving forward is we're not exactly sure how long Armstrong supply will last, but what we do know is this ends on December 31, 2008. Obviously January 1, no more of this product is to be dispensed. I would say that we still had a good quarter and we gained about 1 million prescriptions over 2007 versus 2008, or gained in 2008 over 2007.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, on the 7.5% R&amp;D goal, how fast is it going to be when we get there? I mean obviously you guys made a very big move in the first quarter. I had assumed it was going to be a little bit of a slower move throughout the year and into next year. So if you had to pinpoint a quarter when you actually hit the 7.5, when do you think that will be?</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Silver with Lehman Brothers. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and Dan, once again congratulations; wishing you all the best.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rich.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is, just following up on ProAir, not just between CFCs and HFA, but within HFA, we did see some modest share shift. Bill, can you comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; absolutely, Rich. There is definitely more pressure &#x2013; and I would remind everyone. We hold 60% of the HFA market. I believe George [Barrett] started guiding quite some time ago that this is wonderful but when this all converts and this market revalues from what was our arguably a $150 million market to whatever, 1.5 billion, whatever that number ends up being as a truly blended market, we did not anticipate that we would continue to hold 60% in that market. We know that Schering and Glaxo will be more aggressive. There are a lot of reps that they will put in the field, and that we believe that if we &#x2013; in our best day if we hold a 50% share, that will be wonderful, but it's likely slightly lower than that. That said, in the first quarter of 2008 versus the first quarter of 2007, as I had said previously to Marc, we gained about 1 million prescriptions. All other HFA competitors gained about 1.3 million. So, they are beginning to inch up. They're ramping up, they're putting more efforts there, but we're still keeping a good pace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just and then a follow-up really on the guidance and could you comment as to whether the guidance for '08, which has been 2.60 &#x2013; 2.70, is unchanged; and for '09 where you had said exceeding $3, where that stands now, particularly given that we have obviously had the setback on Prevacid and Aricept obviously probability weighted but nonetheless setbacks and the positive on Risperdal and I guess on that point when would you be expecting to introduce Risperdal and for how long would you expect to have exclusivity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, Shlomo speaking, First some general comments, our forecasts, our estimates are still valid. As for the rest of your question, I would ask Bill to take it. But generally speaking, we have enough moving parts, as you call it, to fortify our focus for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Rich; it's Bill. With respect to the risperidone, at this point in time, the FDA has not appealed the decision. We still fully anticipate they will appeal the decision. We do believe as reflected by the earlier ruling that we have the better of the argument, but of course one never knows. So, all we can do is prepare as we are doing. And we will follow the case as it moves along.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so the assumption is that you would be launching in June and as always, you probability weighted that in the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's absolutely probability weighted and of course, we have to do all the things necessary to prepare for that type of launch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one last one back on ProAir, your commentary was more about year over year changes, but I guess my question was about really the changes that we've seen sequentially and the share shift there. So also, can you comment about the discounting and what we've seen on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean on the ProAir, again we have had a consistent trade policy out there and we have also had managed care efforts, and although they are actually working quite well and helping us hold our share, which is again 60% of the market. And the numbers really, Rich, over the last year &#x2013; by and large, there is a little bit of fluctuation quarter to quarter. One would argue that there might have been a little bit weaker flu season this year in the first quarter than there was last. But all in all, again the HFA still is about 60% of the entire market and we're about 60% of that HFA market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I just have one clarification, then a question for Bill. The clarification on guidance; that 2.60 to 2.75 range for this year, that absorbs the $0.05 in auction rate security impact. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Bill, just on the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way, there are quite a few companies which put that into the adjustment. We haven't done that because we follow a more conservative accounting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, exactly. And then, Bill, on Protonix, are you able to comment as to whether you have recognized all the revenue contribution on that product from what you've already launched at this point?  And then the second part of that is, if Wyeth continues to supply its authorized generic, does that at all alter your view of damages potential as you think about potentially launching more products at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randall, I really can't talk about how we recognize the revenue. That's really more of a question for Dan. But in any case, I think that just falls along the lines of our normal accounting.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Wyeth product, again we will have our arguments and we believe the fact that Wyeth is in there. And actually today, we hold about &#x2013; if you look at the market, we held about a 55% market share, and that is of the generic and the generic is about 80% of the total market. So, we have a 45% total share. And Wyeth actually has a greater share of the market at about 50%. So obviously our argument will always be that if Wyeth wants to continue to erode its own market, that's up to it. But there will be a day in court for everyone to argue those points should we not prevail in the litigation, but I would remind you that we believe we will prevail in the litigation.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and congratulations, Dan. Enjoy your well deserved rest. Question is more related to 2009, if I could just ask you guys to if not quantitatively which I'm sure you are not going to do, but qualitatively talk about the US line. There seems to be &#x2013; you are going to have a very good 2008 hopefully when you launch Risperdal. Could you talk about what some of the expectations should be around the US line in 2009? It's more our fault that at least I can't see many major launches. I'm just trying to get an understanding. Are there partnered programs that we just would not be aware of, maybe at-risk launches we would not be aware of? Can you just speak around the US line in 2009, what our expectations in the qualitative sense should be?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Ken; a couple of things. Shlomo mentioned it in his opening comments. I would just go back to the fact that although on donepezil, oral pantoprazole, or even rabeprazole for that matter, we may have lost round one. There is either an appeal outstanding or we are going through the appeals process. And ultimately in our litigation, it's very oftentimes that the real turning point is the appeal. So, these are certainly by any stretch of the imagination not out of our numbers. And in fact I would point out that lansoprazole launches in 2009 one way or another. It's just a matter of how it launches, whether it launches exclusively or not. And there are other products that we feel good about our litigations that we really are not ready to talk about at this point in time. And there could &#x2013; yes, you are absolutely right. There could be some partnered products that we certainly won't talk about at this point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Just one multi-part question on Copaxone, can you talk about what was abnormal about Copaxone sales growth in the quarter? Was there an inventory build of some kind? Second, would Copaxone 40 mgs have any exclusivity other than the three years of Hatch-Waxman plus the 2014 patents that protect the current strength?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually, I mentioned already in my prepared notes, one important factor was sales to markets where sales are not evenly spread over the year. Mainly these are reflecting markets where there are tenders or sort of tenders by different organizations, government or different organizations. And in addition, we mentioned also the exchange differences. There is nothing to the best of our knowledge connected with inventory buildup or anything like that. And, we referred only to the abnormal growth, not to the abnormal total figure.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Moshe. First of all, the Copaxone patent covering 40 milligram is one. In addition, we filed a patent for &#x2013; use patent for 40-milligram in MS. In any case, the 40-milligram is a new formulation that will be granted three years of exclusivity.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we said last time that there may be a change in the original agreement. What I actually said is that finally there was no change. And I only referred to the geography of where we put the income and expenses. We will record as I said 100% of Copaxone and we'll record the payment through sanofi-aventis under SG&amp;A rather than deducting these payments from sales.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Can you hear me?  Good morning. Let me, Dan, add my congratulations to the crowd. A couple of quick questions, first just a clarification around Copaxone on the European business, I understand the rate of growth would clearly decelerate. Do I understand correctly that we still expect a quarter or sequential quarter increases in both those lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't provide any specific guideline, but all in all we have good and solid growth in the European market and we continue this growth to continue &#x2013; to go forward in this year as well. In some countries in the main countries in Europe, we have improved our position. We moved from &#x2013; for example in France in the last year from the fourth position to the second position. In Canada, we are now in the first position. So, we see the growth across Europe and we continue and we believe that the growth will continue in 2008.</p>

          <p>Excellent. And two quick questions about specific products, AstraZeneca just announced that the patent office in Europe has rejected their Symbicort use patent for COPD. I wonder how this changes your plans for launch of respiratory products in Europe? And similarly on G-CSF, how was your early experience I guess with the EMEA? Are you still expecting approval by the end of the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I had a question just about the Copaxone buyback. I think you've provided some sales guidance as well as SG&amp;A expense guidance. I missed the gross margin guidance. Is there going to &#x2013; what's the impact going to be to gross margins? I noticed the gross margins were higher than expected this quarter. Can we expect that to sequentially increase with the Copaxone buyback this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Copaxone has under this accounting that I described has a 1% positive impact on gross margin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just a follow-up, as it relates to the Risperdal case, do you expect a court decision before the patent expires or the exclusivity expires late June?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, are you taking it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Tim, that's hard to say. That's really under the purview of the court and it all depends on when the FDA appeals, whether they see &#x2013; and if they appeal expedited it or not. So, it is tough to answer that at this point in time. I'd say that we will be ready in either case to do whatever we need to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'm just trying to figure out what scenarios might play out at that point. What's the possibility that the FDA would approve only your product once the exclusivity expires and not approve anyone else's, but still wait for this case to transpire?  Is that a likely scenario or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, at this point, absent another ruling, the FDA has an order to only approve our product. We have been essentially awarded exclusivity due to the ruling we have today. And then of course now the next move will be up to the FDA.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, just one question on the non-Copaxone European side. You mentioned there was some weakness in the Netherlands, the UK, and Hungary. Was that Teva specific or was it industry-wide? Are you expecting growth to resume for the rest of 2008?  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>Our next question comes from Rich Silver with Lehman Brothers. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up on the tax rate, Dan, you had mentioned that you didn't know whether it would be sustainable in the future. Can you give us any sense of what sort of range we could expect beyond '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before we calculated in recent weeks our expected tax rate for '08, we thought that the prudent tax rate to put into models is in the 17% range. I don't want to change this figure, despite the fact that for '08 at this point, we see 15% as a good figure. We'll probably address it when we know better about '09, when we finish our plans for '09, and then we can give better guidance on that. That's why I think for the time being, it should be left at the 17% level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But Dan, I mean the point is that it could certainly go in either direction on a go-forward basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right because it really depends &#x2013; we have such a mix and when there is more concentration of products which come out of Israel and/or are based on our own API produced in Israel, it obviously has an impact of lowering the tax rate. If it's more American produced and not API-based, it goes the other way. So I would say that, I would rather say 17% plus minus rather than 15% plus minus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on a quarterly basis, do you think that this year is going to be relatively stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, the process is that the 15% is not Q1 specific. It is our best estimate for the annual figure. So, if we are right in our estimation, it should be 15% every single quarter, which obviously won't be the case. But, this is the theory behind it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just so I am clear, when you mention the 17%, we are talking about post-'08, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome. First on the European market, I guess the answer to the question on whether or not the one-time items for Europe would correct themselves and whether those would be a benefit in the rest of the year; and also can you give an update on where things stand with the German tender market, any developments there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat the question? You are really &#x2013; we could hardly hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the one-time items that you talked about in Europe, the UK inventory issues and also Hungary, do you see those correcting themselves in the second quarter? And can you give an update on the German tender market and also an update on the <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the &#x2013; when were obviously when the British retail market cuts or shrinks the inventory, for them it's a one-time. For us, it's recurrent if it has an impact on current sales; so if they don't decrease it further it's obviously a one-time also for us. And regarding Germany, Shlomo will answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As for Germany, as you well know the tender &#x2013; the country tender actually has been stopped by court and we are all expecting the court decision or the verification of court decision somewhere toward the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the time being, the system in Germany is back on the older way of, let's call it local tenders, which is in a way not as we expected it to be this year, but I am positive in this regard because I believe that the healthcare expenditure or burden will definitely push sooner or later and hopefully sooner, the system therefore the original tenders. And we are looking forward to see that happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one final one if I can sneak it in, just on the guidance range for 2008, it is still a wide $0.15 range and I understand the $0.05 hit from the auction rate securities. But can you comment about whether you feel more comfortable on the lower end, the higher end of the range, the midpoint of the range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't tell anything regarding guidance at this point of time. The guidance are valid. We are positive on 2008 and I am looking forward to update it whenever we will have news or any newer information to provide or share with you.</p>
