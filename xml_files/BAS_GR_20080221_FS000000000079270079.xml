          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the BASF.SE 2007 Analyst Conference in Ludwigshafen. Welcome also to those who are watching the webcast and listening by phone.  With me today are Dr. J&#xFC;rgen Hambrecht, Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors; then Dr. Kurt Bock our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Stefan Marcinowski, Member of the Board of Executive Directors, responsible for the Agriculture Solution Segment and the Coatings Division; and Dr. John Feldmann, Member of the Board of Executive Directors, responsible for the segments oil and gas and performance products, as well as the construction chemicals division.</p>
          <p>In the next 45 minutes, Dr. Hambrecht and Dr. Bock will review 2007, a new record year for BASF and take a closer look at the business development in 2008.  Following their presentation, both gentlemen will take your questions.  And then after a short break you will have the opportunity to listen to two presentations, which I think will be of great, great interest to you.</p>
          <p>First, Dr. Marcinowski will give you an update on our biotech activities and particularly highlight the collaboration with Monsanto for yield and stress tolerance traits.  Subsequently, Dr. Feldmann will present growth and earnings prospects for our oil and gas segment and explain our strategic partnership with Gazprom.  This partnership is unique in the sense that it encompasses the exploration and production of natural gas in West Siberia, its transportation and the distribution via our gas pipeline grid.  Thus, it is the essential element in our gas for Europe strategy.  In his presentation, Dr. Feldmann will also focus on the recently concluded asset swap with Gazprom, for the Siberian gas field, Yuzhno Russkoye.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that we are webcasting this event and that we have already posted the numbers and the charts which we will discuss this afternoon, as well as the press documents on our website, and that is basf.com/share.  I also would like to ask you to please switch off your phones now and your Blackberries.  And with this, I would like to turn the presentation over to Dr. Hambrecht.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Maggie.  Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our full year analyst conference, which in it's composition is almost a half day investors day, explaining a little bit more than we usually do in our analyst conference.  And I'm very short in my introduction, later on I will guide you a little bit more through this, but let me first address &#x2013; we have reached new records, you have seen the figures, sales and income from operations significantly higher than previous year, than 2006. Organic growth and a very positive development of our acquired business have driven this records.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share, 31% up to a record level of &#x20AC; 8.32, &#x20AC; 58 billion in operating cash flow, and of course we also earned a significant premium on our cost of capital at 2.9 billion.  As far as shareholder return is concerned, we undoubtedly have reached new heights in 2007 too.  This morning the board of directors of BASF will post dividend of &#x20AC;3.9 per share, which is 30% up compared to last year, and last year we have increased already by 50%.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we spend approximately &#x20AC;1.9 billion on share buy-backs.  This is the highest annual amount we ever spend in BASF, and lastly this morning we also have announced a proposal of one to two stocks, but it's subject to the approval of this advisory board in early March but also subsequent to the approval of the annual shareholder meeting.</p>
          <p>Before I give you some more details, I will now hand over to Kurt to take a closer look at our sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Thanks, J&#xFC;rgen, and also welcome from my side.  As you heard, 2007 was a very successful year for BASF and I will now present our results in more detail.  Let's start with the sales development.  Sales rose by 10% to almost &#x20AC;58 billion.  Acquisitions added 7% almost exclusively in the first half of the year.  We were able to raise sales price and volume simultaneously by 2 and 5% respectively.  On the other hand, currency effects reduced sales by almost 4% or nearly &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter of 2007, price increases of 3% and increases in volumes of 4% more than compensated for the weaker US dollar, which traded at an average of $1.45 per euro compared with 1.29 per euro in the fourth quarter of  2006.  The strongest volume increases in the first quarter were achieved by the plastics and oils segment; the strongest price increases by the chemicals segment.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2007, sales rose by 2% to &#x20AC;14.7 billion.  Income from operations declined by 3% to &#x20AC;1.6 billion euros, due to the impact of the scheduled plant turnaround in petrochemicals that lasted longer than expected.  Overall, shutdown negatively impacted chemical segments earnings by approximately &#x20AC;150 million in the first quarter alone.  In 2008, there will be fewer turnarounds.</p>
          <p>In 2007 EBIT increased to a record high of &#x20AC;7.3 billion.  As a percentage of sales, this represents a margin of 12.6%.  We were able to largely offset significantly higher raw material costs by increasing sales prices.  Furthermore, the businesses acquired in 2006 contributed significantly to earnings, as did our ongoing programs to optimize and increase efficiency.  The increase in expenses for research and development and higher costs for the BASF option program negatively impacted income for operations however.</p>
          <p>Income from operations contains special charges of &#x20AC;298 million in 2007 compared with more than &#x20AC;500 million in the previous year.  Of this amount, &#x20AC;185 million was due to restructuring measures, &#x20AC;150 million of which was incurred in the fourth quarter alone.  These restructuring measures related to European side and the Coatings division in North America where we incurred an impairment loss on intangible and tangible assets in the industrial coatings business.  The integrat, ion of the businesses acquired in 2006 resulted in special charges of &#x20AC;63 million alone.   In 2007, special gains resulted from the sale of a stake in an ethane cracker in Guisman, Louisiana to Williams Olefins, and from the reversal of provisions established for restructurings in 2006 that were not fully utilized.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, the financial result improved to minus &#x20AC;170 million compared with minus &#x20AC;134 million in the same period of 2006.  Income before taxes and minority interests was almost &#x20AC;1.5 billion, a decrease of less than 3%.   Net income increased by 8% to almost &#x20AC;800 million, EPS increased by 13% to &#x20AC;1.65.  At 42.8% the tax rate was almost 3 percentage points lower than in the fourth quarter of 2006.  As a result of the reduction of the average overall tax rate in Germany as part of the German tax reform, we had a deferred tax asset and liability effect which was a positive of &#x20AC;229 million. This is a non-cash item of which &#x20AC;43 million was incurred in the fourth quarter due to adjustment of the amount booked already in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Foreign taxes for oil production that are non-compensatable, with German-covered income tax amounted to &#x20AC;384 million for the full year &#x2013; sorry, in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>I will now point out a few key numbers in our full year results.  As already mentioned, EBIT increased to a record of &#x20AC;7.3 billion.  Net income rose by 26% to more than &#x20AC;4 billion.  We increased earnings per share by &#x20AC;1.95 euro to a record high of &#x20AC;8.32.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a closer look at our segments in the fourth quarter.  In Chemicals, both sales volumes and earnings were impacted by unusual factors.  Volumes were 8% below the level of last year's fourth quarter mainly due to, or entirely due to scheduled plant turnarounds in the Petrochemicals division.  The fact that these turnarounds took longer than anticipated increased the impact of shut downs on earnings in the Chemical segments &#x20AC;250 million, as already mentioned. We were able to raise prices, but this was not sufficient to compensate for sharply increased  feedstock costs, especially for NAFTA. Insofar, we view Q4 as an exceptional quarter and not as the beginning of a trend. This was also demonstrated by Plastics, where we combined healthy volume growth with improved earnings. Overall, market demand was good despite some looming weaknesses in the US housing and automotive industries.  Our Styrenics business that is up for sale further increased its profitability.</p>
          <p>For performance products, the fourth quarter was a rather challenging one, in particular due to higher raw material costs.  Acrylic monomers continued to lack in profitability and we see no immediate improvement in that respect.  Integration costs, mainly for the standardization of IT, SAP IT systems, in the Construction Chemicals business and costs of the BASF up from program reduced earnings before special items by about &#x20AC;50 million.  Also, this option program also had a substantial negative impact of almost &#x20AC;20 million on earnings before special items of the Agricultural Products and Nutrition segment.</p>
          <p>In Agricultural Products we achieved the level of earnings of the previous quarter due to higher volumes and prices and despite impact of the weak US dollar.</p>
          <p>Business conditions in Europe were relatively weak, while South America continued to perform well, with furthering reduced working capital.  This is the last time that I will report about Fine Chemicals as a separate unit.  As you know, we will change our segment reporting and include Fine Chemicals together with the Detergents and Formulators business in our new performance products segments under the new name Care Chemicals. In 2007, Fine Chemicals tripled its earnings to &#x20AC;154 million.  The Q4 sales decline of 9% was completely attributable to portfolio changes following the exit from the lysine and premix businesses.  Sales in the oil and gas segment were stable, and earnings increased compared with the same period of 2006.</p>
          <p>In exploration and production, lower production was more than offset by higher natural gas production &#x2013; lower oil production was more than offset by higher natural gas reduction due to the successful start of the Yuzhno Russkoye field.   Income from operations before special items was higher than the same quarter of 2006 thanks to higher oil prices.  Natural Gas trading volumes rose compared with the fourth quarter of 2006, while sales declined slightly due to lower prices.  Margins were again negatively impacted by the steady increase in the purchase price of natural gas throughout the year, an effect which we have explained here already several times. The time lag effect caused a significant decline in earnings in natural gas trading, compared with the same period of 2006.</p>
          <p>Finally, we posted higher income in other, in particular due to the higher foreign currency results that are not allocated to our segments and businesses.  Please note that the commodity Styrenics  business will be reported under other as of January 1st until divestiture.  From 2008 on, we will also report the cost of our corporate center in other, a procedure which will make us more comparable to our peers.  In 2007 these costs amounted to about &#x20AC;250 million and were still allocated to the operating divisions.  We will publish adjusted numbers based on the new segment structure for 2006 and 2007 when we release our company report on March 12.</p>
          <p>Since you have had the chance to look at our segment performance details for the full year in 2007, allow me immediately to jump to the analysis of our cash flow statement and our balance sheet.  First cash flow, despite an increase in business and a correlated increase in working capital, cash provided by operating activities of &#x20AC;5.8 billion was comparable with the record level of 2006.  The slight deviation was caused entirely by lower trade payables, a timing factor which we can hardly influence.</p>
          <p>At 40 days, days of inventory invested in the fourth quarter was lower than in the same period of 2006.  Days of sales outstanding increased by one day to 52 days compared with the same quarter of 2006.  At &#x20AC;2.6 billion, payments related to tangible and intangible assets were below the corresponding level of depreciation and amortization as in previous years.  The free cash flow of &#x20AC;3.2 billion was again very strong and healthy.  In 2007, expenditures for acquisitions and divestitures totaled just &#x20AC;536 million and were primarily attributable to the compensation payments for the asset in Gazprom in connection with the Yuzhno Russkoye field.  Additionally, we provide a bridge financing in about the same order of magnitude.  We bought back a total of 21.5 million shares for &#x20AC;1.9 billion in 2007; this corresponds to an average price of &#x20AC; 88.35 per share.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet continues to very strong. The increase of total assets is fully attributable to the assets of Gazprom.  Equity increased despite the large buy-back because of excellent earnings.  Looking at our report you will also note that we booked again from the sawp with Gazprom of &#x20AC;634 million as a contribution to equity and not as a profit.  This concludes my review of our financial performance and with this I would like to hand over to J&#xFC;rgen again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, after the details let me have a short look back for the last seven years to show a little bit about our overall approach, our strategy and our performance.  The first slide indicates we have outperformed market in growth certainly, but as it goes forward I really have to say growth on its own is not of value, it has to be profitable.  And this is then shown in the next chart -- I think the excellent earnings track of BASF clearly tells you the story.  We have increased our EBIT over the last seven years.  We deliberately took 2001 as the last graph whereby 22%.  Higher volumes, higher prices for our products contributed to this growth as well as our portfolio optimization, and you all know about our restructuring measures, healing from within. We do what is necessary -- operational excellence is a top priority in our company.  And this leads then to the premium on our cost of capital, which we constantly increase, coming from 2001 and our reaching new highs.</p>
          <p>Looking at our portfolio optimization, this is one specific chart I personally like very much.  Whether this is convincing at all times, to you is a different story.  But let me tell you what we are striving for.  It's the true square: high earnings stability, high growth.  Growth to customer, innovation driven and this is visible for all, almost all of those applicable in all four directions.  If you look into what we have done concerning our divestitures, you also see that we have focused very much on the commodities side, mainly the Polio Lefins high-growth, but very low earnings stability.</p>
          <p>At this point, let me also address and give you a brief update on our Styrenics.  We are in contract negotiations with one specific partner with whom we want to conclude this deal in the first half of this year.  All these changes, from our perspective, have made BASF a stronger, higher-quality company now than ever before.  And you can expect, going forward, that further acquisitions and divestitures will follow the very same pattern, and I also can ensure you that we will be very disciplined in doing that.</p>
          <p>We have a good track record if you look at acquisitions: Engelhardt in construction chemicals, as well as Johnson Polymer.  We are on our track in integrating these operations going forward.  We have achieved a part of the synergies.  This is on track &#x2013; partly we are ahead of our targets &#x2013; but still there is room for further improvements, and you see the expected synergies of 290 million, and we will make this happen.</p>
          <p>Responsible use of cash, and I don't want to repeat myself, but the first step I'm always looking into R&amp;D expenditures.  As this is an investment into our future, we will increase our R&amp;D expenditure in 2008 again by 5%, especially in our cost clusters.  We'll look into organic growth via CapEx.  For 2008, we have earmarked 2.3 billion, there is not included, I would say, the so-called financial investment into the pipelines where we have a minority shareholding, but 2.3 certainly is below depreciation.  Portfolio optimization certainly is a key topic for us.  Selected acquisitions, strict financial criteria, you know about it, but we'll also look into our portfolio concerning divestitures.</p>
          <p>Dividends and share buyback compliments this, and with regard to dividends you know that we have today announced the increase by 30% again.  Looking over the years, you see our overall</p>
          <p>performance.  We will certainly continue with this, let me say, demanding dividend policy.  We will strive to increase our dividend and we will at least maintain the dividend at the previous year's level.</p>
          <p>Share buyback [audio break]</p>
          <p>2008 has been a record year with 1.9 billion euros and so far until today, Kurt, we have spent...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Another 600 million, roughly, in 2008, 635 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So we will fill out this &#x20AC;3 billion program we have and we will continue to buy back shares going forward.  This is a clear part of our overall policy.</p>
          <p>Last point, a proposal on a one to two stock split, proposed to the annual meeting and as I said, it's up to the approval by the HEM later. This will certainly reflect our confidence in our earnings oriented growth.  We would like to share this with a broader spectrum of investors, this is why we are heading through all this.</p>
          <p>And finally now let's look into the future.  What are the near term challenges?  Here are the most important ones: subprime crisis and consequences on the consumer level, also certainly on the industry level then, the weak US dollar, high volatile and volatile raw materials, weakness in some customer industries, cyclicality in some commodities and the perceived risk of overpriced acquisitions. If I listen very carefully to you, because cash rich company sometimes is tempted to pay too much.  We have not done this, you know about our track record.</p>
          <p>Let me address these very briefly.  Weak US dollar, negative currency effect &#x2013; I really have to say, you know about the sensitivity at our end. $0.10 means a decrease in EBIT of 250 million after non-deductible oil exploration taxes.  We certainly will try to partly hedge this, but the nature and most important thing is we are changing the entire company.  We are producing in the region we are selling, and you have seen this, how we have developed into the future; 98% in the US.  Basically we are balanced there, and we are growing very fast in Asia.</p>
          <p>Concerning higher oil and raw material prices, natural hedge again so our oil and gas business about 50%.  And certainly you have land to look into the demand supply balance, whether we can push price increases through in the respective businesses.  And on top comes our centralized procurement, which gives us a certain power in purchasing.  Weakness in some customer industries &#x2013; again, regional diversification is one of our answers, and of course, the overall set-up of our portfolio, which is much broader compared to other companies, is balancing out once in a while, a weakness in one customer industries whereas there are strengths in others.</p>
          <p>Cyclicality in commodities. First of all, again, you know this, I'm constantly &#x2013; I'm tempted to say breaching this, but we are not a petrochemicals company. Petrochemicals are there as a starting point, as a building block for our added value chains, and only minor surpluses we are really merchandising.  So all in all, we are really reducing the commodity piece of our business.  The divestiture of dynamics will contribute to this, and the increase in specialties that you have seen our portfolio is contributing as well.  Perceived risk of overpriced acquisitions, I have already addressed.  I think we have a track record which you can follow-up, and we certainly will follow this line.  As I said, growth on its own is not an objective, it's profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Now to the outlook, finally. The level of orders so far remains strong.  Capacity utilization is rather high.  We have based our planning as you see, on a moderate slow-down in global economic growth, 2.8% GDP growth, which is at the low end if you look into other company's forecasts comparing these figures, which are 3.5 to 3.6 in 2007.  So this is already a different shaded picture looking into the future.  Now we are not exaggerating, we are not the super optimists, we are seeing an impact from the credit crunch, but we are putting this into our growth figures.  As you see, US 1.6, Japan 1.6, Europe 2.1, and only Asia, excluding Japan, with 7.4.  We see declining interests again, in the US, a moderate reaction in Europe.  This translates into an average euro/dollar exchange rate of $1.45 and an average oil price, interrelated with the GDP growth, of $78 per barrel for Brent in 2008.  This morning it was certainly above 100, and they will say this is crazy, but wait and see what happens in the second quarter, which is usually the weak quarter, and we will then see whether we are right or wrong.</p>
          <p>Given this assumption, we expect BASF group business to develop positively in the next two years, and to finalize this we assume the &#x2013; and based on no change in our portfolio, we aim to increase our sales and to improve our EBIT before special items slightly.</p>
          <p>To finalize this, and you know about our objective, we want to grow above average of the industry.  Profitably is the important underlying word here, again. We expect to earn at least our cost of capital at any given year, and we strive to earn our cost of capital in all segments in any given year.  We have all reason to look confidently into the future.  Our performance in 2007 has a start into the business in year 2008 in our very concrete actions with regard to return cash to our shareholders underlying this confidence.</p>
          <p>With this court, the whole floor will try to answer all kinds of questions you may have.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now moving into the question-and-answer session.  As usual, I would like to ask that you limit your questions to about two questions and maximum of a third follow-up question.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  And then the final recommendation, if you would be so kind and save any questions on biotechnology and maybe on oil and gas then for later for the gentlemen Dr. Marcinowski and Dr. Feldmann.  So with this, actually we can start off.  I also will tell you that I will plug in a couple of questions from the participants that are not here today that have sent them by email.  Okay.  It was Mr. Barth and then Mr. Rodiger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, Norbert Barth speaking from DZ Bank. Mr. Hambrecht, perhaps you showed that you are not too optimistic, but I think the statement what you have given saying you expect slight improvement already in EBIT before special items is a strong commitment on my view. But can you go a little bit more in detail telling how the year has started?  Also perhaps going a little bit in the different major block buildings, how demand and supply looks and perhaps will change during the year?  So how is the pricing situation, and especially perhaps on acrylic monomer, which I think we now talk more than one a year, so no improvement to see.  You expect also a further decline, how you see there the situation perhaps with the restructuring?  And the second question to Mr. Bock about the others line where always for analysts is a little bit difficult to forecast.  So perhaps can you give us a little bit guidance, especially mentioning what will change this year in that line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Let me start this overall approach.  Looking into this year, I think this year has started decently.  The orders on-hand are strong, so just to put it under the headline, facts are much better than the mood.  Of course there is a somehow differentiated figure, and let me just explain this with the construction industry.  Construction industry in North America, especially in the private sector, is of course weak, and has impact on all kinds of business.  Whether this is fiber bonding, whether these are foams or whether these are insulation materials from polyurethane, this is everywhere.  It is different if it comes to governmental investment, infrastructure investment.  However, this pipeline is also not totally full.  This is North America.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn it just to the opposite.  If you then look into South America, this is totally different, it's crazy.  Huge investment in construction everywhere.  If you then go to Europe, you have a mixed picture. Of course, UK is weak, Spain is weak, I would say the Southern part of Europe is somewhat weak.  Germany in some areas, strong, in the private sector also not very strong, the Eastern part of Europe rather strong and then if you go to Asia, this is again a very strong picture, especially also in the infrastructure area.  If you look into other businesses, electronic, fertilizer, polyurethane is very general.  Detergents, cosmetics and pharma, these are all strong, really strong businesses.  Automotive is another area which is very different around the world.  You have in North America the structural problems and you see this.  Just to look into the first, I think it's the first 40 days figures, where we have a reduction in production of 7% in the US, and the same time we have an inventory increase to about, I don't recall, I think it's almost 80 days, which is a &#x2013; it's a very high end, indicating to you yes, there is weakness.</p>
          <p>If you go to Europe, in Europe, especially also looking into Germany, the first months was very strong, production was up.  And Asia again is growing rather fast.  So all in all, you really need to have a differentiated approach to the whole, the entire industry, and then you may end up with a better picture.  There are a few businesses which are in, let me say, not on a global scale, almost, not in the best situation.  This is textile, leather and paper, restructuring issue.  High growth in Asia, low growth in Europe, but a lot of other things going on which entirely puts a lot of pressure on the price side.  So price increases in some industries are getting more difficult.  Very generally speaking, at the price end it's a little bit more difficult because there is an uncertainty coming from the mood, the negative mood from North America, how this will continue, whether the raw material prices will go up or down.  At the end of the day, it tells you only one thing, inventory is certainly not very high.  It's not very high.  It's at the lower end.  I only can translate this.  There will be growth in 2008 going forward.  We may have one or the other quarter which is weaker.  I'm indicating this right away to you because you follow up on a quarterly basis, which will not tell you at the end of the day the overall performance of the year.  Now I'm addressing this right away to you because if I may translate this, I'll be too optimistic.  I think we are not too optimistic.  However, I have to admit challenges are greater this year compared to last year.  Visibility is a little bit lower.  All in all we have translated this in these growth figures which are reflecting what is out in the market, and I think this is the most realistic picture I can draw at this point of time.</p>
          <p>Yes, the specific question on acrylic, it will not get better.  A very simple and quick answer.  It will not get better.   However in 2008 not a lot of additional capacities come on stream.  So it also most probably will not get worse, which is already a positive sign. With this, I will hand over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I got.  I will try to explain what's happening in other, as you know this is quite difficult for us to forecast, but the guidance is still in place roughly 80 million per quarter, which sums up to something like 300 million a year, that was also the case in 2007. However, from quarter-to-quarter there's some degree of volatility basically due to fair value accounting issues.  As of 2008, we will add corporate cost, roughly 250 million, that equates to something like 60 million a quarter, which means you have to put into your models now something like 140 to &#x20AC;150 million per quarter for the future.  But again, high numbers we will see only at 31st of December simply because there are effects which we cannot inference entirely.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Martin Rodiger from Cheuvreux.  Two questions to Mr. Bock.  First, there was &#x2013; concerning the income statement.  There was a big boost in other operating income in Q4, plus 143% to 517 million.  Can you explain this boost in other operating income?  Is it from the reversal of provisions or the gains from your cracker participation?  That is the first question.  The second question is concerning your BASF option program.  How many provisions do you intend to book for 2008 and what is based on this BOP program &#x2013; the share price assumption for BASF?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a nice try.  Starting with the BOP program.  This is again fair value accounting.  IFRS tells us at end of quarter we have to value all of our outstanding option programs at their fair value.  And that means, at the end of 2007, &#x20AC;101 per share was the basis for that evaluation and from today's point of view we would have to reverse some part of the provision which we made in 2007.  But this would become now a quarterly exercise, and frankly we were taken a little bit by a positive surprise in 2007.  Obviously, the expenditures of the cost of the BOP program was much higher than what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year and therefore it also took you a little bit by surprise.  We only clarified this in the third quarter.  Other than Q4, there is a couple of factors.  The main factor is, again, currency results, which we do not allocate to the respective businesses.  But another factor, which most of you probably had saw or tracked, we still have fertilizer production, which we do not market actively any more, but that business has become &#x2013; that production has become much more profitable in 2007 than in 2006 due to market circumstances.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question then comes from Mr. Kohler and then it's Rhian Tucker and then Lutz Gruten.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst.  The first question is actually looking for your outlook, it's based on three assumptions and I would like to look a little bit at that specifically close chemical production assumption of 2.8%.  Which variance would you allow still to meet your target, your outlook?  Have you any thoughts about potential ups and downs you would still send in line with that guidance?  And second question is for Mr. Bock, a more financial question.  Hedging 2008, currency hedging and potentially other hedges like NAFTA or so, can you a little bit update us with what you have done year to date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Outlook. Barely answers. Of course we now can talk along the line, what kind of impacts there may be. And I have talked a little bit about risks before which are the major risks and have shown you what we are going &#x2013; trying to do.  One question is inter-related with this hedging for example.  But looking into our assumption, 2.8, I really have to say this is the best assumption we have today.  It's based on the assumption that there is GDP growth of 2.8.  If there is higher GDP growth and especially higher GDP growth in Asia, this figure may increase.  If you look into the chemical industry and especially, let me say, the manufacturing piece.  I really think we have looked into this in detail.  North America in chemical manufacturing will not grow, has not grown in principle in 2007, will not grow this year, but will grow in 2009.  The same applies to Japan.  Japan most probably will have negative growth rate in chemicals, have it already in 2007 by -2%.  Europe only 1.5%.  It's much lower compared to what we have seen so far in this year.</p>
          <p>Now it reflects the overall economic situation we are seeing going forward.  Of course, if there is a possibility that the recession, or let me say, the mood in North America may turn around, the best early indicator for me looking into mood, would be to look in the, into the unemployment rate in North America.  Because if this increases to a larger extent, I would say consumer confidence it will deteriorate and it may even go further down, looking into North America.  GDP growth of 1.6 &#x2013; some people talk about 1%, some talk about 2.5%.  Now, what kind of variance shall I give you?  I'm only indicating to you, this is what we have based our planning on and going forward, we will see how this develops, and we will then talk quarterly by quarter probably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the question was actually a little bit different.  The question is you are going for slight increase in clean EBIT, and obviously it is based on the production growth of 2.8%.  Would that be still a valid assumption with 2.3 or 2% growth, or where is your variance, your risk so to say when you have to say this slight increase in EBIT is not any longer a valid outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If things are getting worse, if growth rates are getting slimmer, certainly we will have to revise this.  On the other hand, I have to say growth rate of 2.8, we will outperform 2.8% in growth.  This is what I do expect going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we move on to the next question from Rhian Tucker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, sorry.</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I still have to answer your question about risk management and hedging, Mr. K&#xF6;hler.  We are pretty much fully hedged for 2008, with regard to currency, which is basically a U.S. dollar issue.  But again, to put this into perspective, we are talking here about a net exposure of something like &#x20AC;1.5 billion equivalent.  So this is not a sizeable amount, given the size of the overall size of BASF, and you have to keep in mind we have a pretty balanced regional portfolio, for instance North America now is a net exporter for BASF which is something that has changed.  We see acquisition of Engelhardt and it was our construction chemicals. You will find much more information with regard to that in our Annual Report, which we will publish on March 12.  We have to file on our IFRS-7, this will satisfy your intellectual curiosity to a very high degree.  You will get all kinds of data about sensitivities and value at risk, and if you tell me afterwards that you have understood everything which we are doing, I'm just happy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, Rhian Tucker from Credit Suisse. First question on your outlook, you pointed out a slight growth in EBIT pre-exceptionals.  Given that you've got minorities increasing because of the exchange with Gazprom, given the tax rate seemed to be quite low for this year, does that mean that you are basically expecting an EPS decline for 2008, given those pieces of information?  The second question, on CapEx and depreciation.  Depreciation above CapEx, is that sustainable for the long-term, is your plant getting old and how far do you think that you can push asset turns up?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CapEx depreciation first. Looking into what we are reporting on the CapEx, this maybe a little bit different to other companies, we are not talking about maintenance CapEx because this is written off directly in the costs, usually, as long as this is possible.  So all in all, what we do is we have preventive maintenance approach.  Let me just give you one idea, here at the site in Ludwigshafen, we are spending every year about &#x20AC;1 billion in maintenance, preventive maintenance, keeping our plants, let me say, state of the art.  And this is maybe a little bit different to other companies. So I am, with this &#x20AC;2.3 billion CapEx spending, we certainly are not milking our plants, absolutely not.  You will not see plants, and you will visit our plants once in a while, you see this.  We have a very pretty maintenance, not just on the outside, but also from the inside, which is at least as important. So all in all, what I can tell you I think we will be able to grow organically with this number.  However, in one or the other years, it may be even higher, I have to say.  It may reach depreciation levels, it depends, as the projects come along.  And I really &#x2013; this is not the decisive factor at the end of the day.  The decisive factor is we ought to grow profitably with the investments.  And we have made these mistakes in the past. This is a change in attitude. Karl?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then you asked about minority interest and our tax rate, and whether this could lead then in combination to a decline of EPS, in spite of having a higher EBIT.  I think we don't expect that to happen, first of all. The tax rate &#x2013; the tax rate went down by almost or more than 9 percentage points in 2007, that was I think quite a surprise for many of you.  There was one special factor, which was the German Tax Reform, but I think the real underlying issue is that the regional distribution of income has changed dramatically in 2007.  We have much more income now in Asia and many Asian countries where we have very low tax rates, sometimes close to zero, and we expect that to be the case in 2008 as well. Having said that, I think it's prudent to expect in 2008 that our tax rate will not go up drastically. We will have this one-time effect of the assets &#x2013; the deferred tax asset or liability, which was a positive effect of 229, that was a non-recurring item, but other than that you should expect that the tax rate should remain pretty much at the level of 2007.</p>
          <p>However, you have to keep in mind, again, volatility quarter-over-quarter, and that has always been the case in the past as well as that makes the modeling sometimes a little bit difficult.  I'm always talking about the average tax rate then for the entire year. And minority interest, yes.  Minority interest should go up ceteris paribus because now we have a higher participation of Gazprom in our activities in WINGAS predominantly, and also in Libya indirectly. But again, the overall size of those minority interests is quite limited, that is not really a decisive factor in determining our earnings after taxes and minority interests.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm now plugging in one question from Matthias Cornu from Exane.  He has two questions regarding the North American business.  According to your report, you have generated 13.2% growth in local currencies for the full year 2007.  What is the corresponding figure for Q4?  And the second question, could you go through the three divisions; Chemicals, Plastics, and Performance Products, and tell us the percentage of sales generated in North America and how do you see these businesses developing in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we do not provide a regional breakdown of segment sales.  I think we have not done this in the past.  What we do, we give qualitative statements about the  health of our respective businesses. And as you have already said, we have seen a little bit of slowdown in North America already in 2007, overall due to the economic environment. But there is nothing special which we could report which makes those businesses different from what we have seen in other parts of the region.  We certainly had in Chemicals a major turnaround situation in part of the cracker went down because we had a scheduled turnaround, which took a little bit longer. Those are effects which happen from time to time. And because wondering figure for Q4, it should be in our report which we handed out and I would like to refer to that report in local currency.  It's a positive as well.  There was no slowdown in the fourth quarter if that is the question.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lutz Gruten from Kepler. Two questions from my side.  One follow-up regarding the tax ratio.  You mentioned that there is a special tax situation in Asia.  Since when is it lasting?  When do you have to pay taxes in Asia, is the first question.  And the second question is regarding Styrenics.  Could you give us an update there on the operational performance of that business and also on the divestment process please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I propose to take the tax issue first, and then I will ask John Feldmann to answer the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In many cases the relatively low tax rate in Asia is part of incentives that we receive for establishing new business for instance in China but also in Malaysia.  So over time the tax rate will increase.  This will happen over the next four to five years, but even then after that process has been completed, we will be still at a tax rate which are quite low especially compared with German standards, so there's also a tax incentive to be in these countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Styrenics.  We have seen a substantial improvement in the performance of our Styrenics business.  This is particularly true for Europe.  Also in Asia.  Not that much in North America.  As you know, we have decided that we are going to divest the commodity part of this business.  This is the part where we don't see the potential for differentiation in the market versus our competitors where basically raw material costs are driver, value drivers in this business.  We believe companies which are focusing on commodity trading and commodity business models are the better owners of these business.  We are currently in negotiation with one potential buyer which makes progress, and I would estimate that during the first half or at the end of the first half of this year we will finalize agreements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I am plugging in one question from Ruth Lucas from Citigroup.  She's asking within the US, are you seeing any weakness at all outside of the auto and construction industry?  And the second one is, has BASF's stance on acquisitions changed at all?  What level of gearing would you be comfortable with?  Are you looking at large or medium sized acquisitions and could you quantify what will be a large or medium-sized acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I addressed it at the very early, weaknesses outside the auto and construction industries.  I talked a little bit about textile and leather, which is basically no longer a real factor in the US.  I think there is a little bit of weakness also in the furniture industry, but especially looking into our business, translating this, I think construction auto is biggest hit so far, and it's translating in quite a few businesses.  It's not just, let me say, in the most visible ones it's translating almost all business which have a certain supply situation to these industries, and we see this.  We certainly see this and this somehow also reflected a little bit in the Q4.</p>
          <p>Now with regard to the stance on acquisitions, I think again I have said this, we are not changing.  Gearing ratio, we feel comfortable with.  I think equity ratio 40%, we have talked along.  We could also do more than that because cash flow is very strong, would return very quickly to this level.  Large and medium size, what do we define as large?  What do we define as medium?  I think this is a little bit difficult to really, at the end of the day, express.  I would say, yes, we are able to do quite a lot of acquisitions, and in the past we talked about 3 billion several, 3 billion, if we could do  again.  I think it's not of a high value to talk about the size.  The key question is, is there room for profitable growth?  And does this fit to BASF.  And I repeat my most important criteria; it has to be above average industry growth, has to be closer  to the customer, has to be innovation driven, it has to be a business where we really can differentiate through innovation.  And at the end of the day because of that, it will be less cyclical.  These are the most important things.  And you know also about, let me say, the financial criteria accretive in the third year.  Latest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So now I'm moving on with Andreas Heine who has been waiting, and then now Mr. Faitz, and then Mr. Themistocleous.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At first I'd like to ask one more question about the tax rate.  You said that tax rate will not increase very much this year as you had a tax credit in 2007, which was a non-cash item, that would basically mean that you in cash pay less tax this year than last year.  Secondly, you had a lot of turnarounds in the year 2007.  Could you give us a guidance, how big the impact in 2008 will be for turnarounds and maybe also for start-up costs for big plants?</p>
          <p>Then I would like to ask one question regarding the share buyback.  You bought back from the 1.1 billion left for this year already 635 million up to February.  If you go on with this speed, then you would utilize the 1.1 billion up to your annual shareholder meeting.  Will you go for another share buyback program afterwards?  Or what is your thinking about this?</p>
          <p>And last but not least, a little bit more complicated, about the oil price impact and what you call natural hedge.  As far as I understand, you mean a natural hedge against short-term volatility, I would assume, if the oil price goes up steadily then that is positive for your earnings of BASF.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shall I start to give you the tax rate.  I think I maybe didn't explain this enough.  You have to deduct the special effect of 2007.  Those 229 million obviously is not an item that you can expect again to happen in 2008.  But if you deduct that, we think that the tax rate should be in the similar order of magnitude as in 2007.  Turnaround, next question.  Turnarounds 2008 I would give the indication that pack order in the other magnitude 240 between 40 to 50 million euros, impact, it'll come certainly in a different pattern and we will see how this works out throughout the year.  For the time being what you will see is it's certainly much lower in Q4.</p>
          <p>So start-up costs, we do not have in these figures, turn around figures.  We will have one major start up which we have already reflected in our forecast for the polyurethanes business and this is our HPPO plant in Antwerp which is going to start up in the second half of 2008.  Share buyback.  Yeah, you are correct.  Let's wait and see until the end of our shareholder meeting and what I gave you very clearly as an indication.  It is part of our tools to return value to our shareholders, and we will continue to use this.</p>
          <p>Oil price impact.  All-in-all you know our sensitivities.  We have handed out to you.  A $1 rise means for our oil and gas business in principle an EBIT improvement of 45.  And at the end of the day if it comes to net income, it's 10 because of the non-deductible oil taxes.  This is the sensitivity for oil and gas.  Now, I think it's not that easy to translate this all through because a steady increase at the end of the day pushing then higher prices through in our downstream businesses always has to be reflected on the background of supply and demand balance.  So at the end of the day you need to look into the major added value chain and what this means.  So this is not so easy.  I cannot give you a figure for the entire company in this regard.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I have two separate questions.  First of all can you tell us in your chemical segments how long your order book visibility is mainly Englehardt after here is it six weeks?  Is it eight weeks?  Is it 12 weeks?  Just to get a very rough idea of how long your visibility is in your chemical order books.  And then second of all, Dr. Hambrecht, you mentioned that's yes the auto industry and the construction in the U.S. is weak and you can see that, but do you see any still over effect of goods, which continue in a lot of chemicals produced exclusively in Asia for the U.S.?  I mean, the Americans have to over buy some new clothes every now and then, for example, which mainly is in the Asia market now, things like that only we see anything?  Do you hear anything from the sales people?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take all the other part of the chemicals.  I really have to say the only thing I can tell you is inventory levels are low.  Order on hand we are not reporting on each individual segment.  But what I can tell you very generally, inventory is low.  Visibility this isn't an issue, I agree.  Visibility this year certainly is a little bit lower compared to last year.  Under this reflected by channel issue of mood. I think effect at this very moment are better than mood. In fact and mood in Asia is better than the rest of the world.  Let me translate it along this line a little bit.  So the second question of spill over, I really have to say we have not seen here really anything of significance.  You have a small thing here and there, but not of any significance for the time being.  I agree we need to &#x2013; the sensitivity level we need to have this year is higher compared to last year.</p>

You talked in your report about petrochemicals struggling.  Do you see that is structural issue, and if yes what are your thoughts there?  The other question is in polyurethanes.  I think in your outlook statement you sounded a little bit more cautious than you have been in the past talking about new capacities, I was wondering whether you could elaborate a bit in that area?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Themis, you know John very well, he is our expert in polyurethane for a long time. So he will answer this right away, and then I'm coming to the second piece.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Themis, we had this debate since almost four years since you and some of your colleagues have predicted an overcapacity development in MDI.  We haven't seen it in let's say 2006, 2005, 2004.  2007 now we have seen that indeed with capacities coming on stream we had a little bit longer market, but longer market in MDI, I'm still talking about occupancy rates or capacity rates in MDI production above 90%, which typically gives you some confidence that there may be locally and from time to time margin pressure, and we have seen this in MDI, but I don't expect this to continue on that level for 2008.  So we are optimistic that we can somehow keep margins and MDI on the levels where they are.  In TDI the other isocyenide there's a real shortage in the market.  There were some unplanned plant shutdowns, but that's with also some of the competitors, and therefore the TDM is very, very strong, short and strong with excellent margins for time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I have to go back, Themis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I've got it, so Themis, again, high growth rates in polyurethanes going forward.  We see this especially out from Asia though.  I think this is a very decent business as we see it generally. I know we have concerns but going back this has been an issue for quite some time and it's showing that I think our forecast is rather accurate.  Petrochemicals I understand I first got, I was concerned in talking about petrochemicals but then I was corrected, it was Paper Chemicals.  Now Paper Chemicals, as I said before, the paper industry is in a restructuring situation especially in Europe and North America, high growth rates in Asia.  And here we have to look very carefully into how we are positioned, how we can improve through differentiation.  We look into this constantly and if there is a restructuring in the industry, this is certainly an issue we have to look into, no doubt.  But for the time being I only can tell you this business on our side is still a rather reasonable business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we now moving on with Mr. Van Hooven please, and then we have Mr. Waklinen and Sophie Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Bertnoke DeVries in Netherlands Dr. Hambrecht commented on the price hedge for the 50% of this oil and gas.  To follow up on that do you mean that actually 50% of your oil and gas sales do have price collars on them?  Or do you mean that basically 50% is captive use for BASF and that way naturally hedged?</p>
          <p>And second question is on the Fine Chemicals.  You mentioned higher vitamin prices.  I assume that has to do with the China situation.  Do you see those higher prices continue or do they come down again?  And what about the kerotsnoi situation at this time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I will take the Fine Chemical question.  It's surprising, these question always come from the Dutch.  I'm not sure why.  It has been quite a good business for BASF in 2007 and one reason is that there was a price increase across our portfolio to a certain degree.  Is it sustainable?  Needs to be seen.  There are certainly many, many customers who have second thoughts today about sole supply from China, that is certainly the case and we have seen this now several times and that is I think a positive for BASF.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one we see with regard to the hedging on the..</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The hedging, yes.  Your second comment was correct.  So not physically but mathematically we employ 50% of our oil production in our own captive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

          <p>Chemical production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me complement on the Fine Chemical side.  I think it's varying, vitamins are positive because of the Chinese situation.  I think this is overall a positive signal on two aspects.  As Kurt mentioned, people get more sensitive on reliable supply, high quality, also system solution counts again, so you get paid for it. But secondly, I'll turn the chest around, the Chinese government has learned that they cannot continue like that.  They are looking into environmental issues; they are looking into quality issues.  And this is, from a fundamental point of view, positive.</p>
          <p>And secondly, in China, trees are not growing into the sky at all because at the end of the day VAT refund has been reduced quite substantially.  Energy costs are going up.  Raw material costs are also going up.  So from an overall competitive point of view, I think we have improved quite a bit.  Your very specific question on Cariternads, here we have a little bit of a over-supply situation.  So that is very positive on vitamin A E and C, but we have, let me say, especially on the Caritinerad side, there is a little bit of over-supply.  However, in this area again, we are in a very, let me say, a very good situation if you look into our Verbund manufacturing of this product within our matricide, especially here in Ludwigshafen.  This is first class.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we come to Sean de Vat Veil</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sean de Vat Veil from Lehman.  I have three questions.  For the second year in a row, you're surprising the market on dividend payments, so I'm asking again the same question as last year.  Can you just give a little more visibility to the market on what is your dividend policy?  Are you comfortable with the 46% payout?  In a bad year, would you be ready to re-leverage BASF in a high level of dividend payout, just a little more guidance would be, I think, quite useful.</p>
          <p>The second question is a specific question on fertilizers.  Dr. Bock, you talked about the strength in Q4 fertilizers.  I think BASF owns, together with Yara a specific technology on NPK that do not use sulfuric acid.  As far as I can understand, BASF is not using this technology, is not licensing this technology.  If that is wrong, I would appreciate if you can correct my understanding, and I would also be very interested to see what's the, outlook, what are BASF plans to develop this technology in the Fertilizers business.</p>
          <p>The third question is on Verbund investments.  It's really coming back to an old debate.  We understand the size of petrochemicals strategically will decline and BASF is targeting less cyclicality.  And I think we talked a long time ago about the potential of a Verbund site in India, and you came with comments where it were quite pessimistic about the capacity to build such a site in India.  Since the last two to three years we have seen the chemical industry in India growing quite fast I would appreciate if you can just come back on that issue and tell us if indeed we should definitely exclude a plan for BASF Verbund site in India?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well let me just start with the dividend policy.  I think our dividend policy chart is rather straightforward.  Because what we are saying is we are &#x2013; we strive for increasing dividends every year.  And we will keep it at least level.  But this translates into what you have asked for.</p>
          <p>Now if things are, let me say, turning south, in a dramatic way, we certainly will have a different payout ratio.  This is a consequence out of it.  But this is exactly why I'm not saying we will fix it at a payout ratio, let me say at 60, 70 or whatsoever.  I'm saying we strive for a rather demanding dividend policy.  And if you look at our dividend yield, if you take it on today's share price, it's certainly at a 4.5% level.  This is I would say an attractive dividend.  And going forward this is what we are looking for.</p>
          <p>Secondly, with regard to fertilizers, now here I think very generally speaking we are producing fertilizers for our partner, which is kaliunzeit.  This is why at the end of the day we are not investing here in totally new technologies or we are even not looking into life of these technologies.  This is, I would say, be very, let me say rough by saying at our site especially here at Ludwigshafen, this is the kind of a kidney for our site.  Cleaning up all waste streams and putting it into an added value.  It's super top class.  And we have of course at the same site, same time an additional fertilizer activity going on in Antwerp.  It's a major piece in Antwerp.  But these are basically  is the main manufacturing site.  There is one single other site which is in Ottmarsheim in France, but very generally speaking this is not an area which where we are in an operational leadership, we are so to speak a contract manufacture.  This is our overall approach.</p>
          <p>And last but not least with the Verbund investment in India. Now India certainly is growing faster and at that time when we talked about it was 6%, now it's 8%.  And most probably will continue.  It isn't a market where the chemical industry which is growing very, very fast.  The situation is a little bit different compared to China in two aspects; first of all infrastructure is weaker, much weaker compared to China and secondly the competitive scenario in India's also very different.  So these are private companies, like the Reliance and others who are building up capacities there. Now for us, again, as we are no longer striving for basic petrochemicals, and I include basic petrochemicals for example, polyethylenes,  if you are building up a cracker you need to have a base load.  And this base load is very often polyethylene to start with or monoethylene glycol. Those products, if you don't have feed stock advantages in India, which I cannot see, are better made in the Middle East.  This has been the driving force. Looking into the future, India certainly is offering, let me say for us with our very specific added value chain another approach. We can, so to speak, hook in certain areas we don't need to build up an entire petrochemical site as we have done in China.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got two questions. First, across your industrial activities, you've reduced your cost base I think by over $1 billion over the last few years.  I just wondered if you look at those activities today where are the areas where you feel there's greatest potential to continue to reduce the cost base, where perhaps there's structural improvements still to be made?</p>
          <p>And second on the Chemicals division, you've got a pretty positive outlook, in your statement today. Clearly, you won't have or we shouldn't have the shutdown costs that you suffered in the second half.  But if you exclude those, at least in the fourth quarter, the underlying earnings were still down quite substantially.  I just wondered whether you could talk about the outlook for the underlying earnings trends in the Chemicals division as you look into 2008?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me address and I will ask Kurt also to complement on the cost side.  Very clearly, I think this is an ongoing issue.  Where we see still potential is in the overall setup on this earth, with regard to our manufacturing site, especially out of service manufacturing sites we have acquired.  And here there will be a consolidation process which will continue.  We are in the midst of doing this already.</p>
          <p>If you look into very specific cost items, I really have to say even in also looking into benchmarking, reflecting our portfolio we are doing very, very well.  We certainly are striving for operational excellence in all areas but if it comes to real cost reduction programs, it's very much interrelated with our manufacturing operations where we can learn from each other a lot.  We have our internal, let me say, competition for improvement. Energy efficiency is a key, key, key, key point here again and we will certainly strive for improvement in these areas.  So now I will ask Stefan to comment on the chemical side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Sophie I think we had three factors if you compare quarter four '07 with '06.  One thing is indeed the shutdown costs which were unexpectedly high. I mean, we gave some guidance still in December that things took longer time than expected.</p>
          <p>The second thing is that also the cracker margins were squeezed because of the strong increase of the raw material.  I mean, the fourth quarter, that was the first time we came close to the $100 per barrel which was not included in the forecast for the NAFTA price.</p>
          <p>And the third element that's a 2006 base comparison that we had an extremely good, an extremely good result in our precious metal trading in '06.  We had also a good result in  '07 but not an extremely good result. And that altogether translates into this gap if you compare '04 &#x2013; '07 with '06.  The outlook for 2008 for the Chemical segment is that also in this segment, we would like to achieve the same thing, as J&#xFC;rgen said, for the whole company which means top the sales and the EBIT before special items in the segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sophie, let me just say the fourth quarter in Chemicals was a good quarter compared &#x2013; if you look into the fundamentals, and these fundamentals are continuing.  We will have in the cracker margin side in the first quarter this year still some pressure, still some pressure.  Because, again, the quarterly pricing especially in Europe has been settled too early and oil price is still at a level which was not anticipated.</p>
          <p>And if you look at today, for example, today's NAFTA price and going forward, there is basically no degradation in the next month's.  And this tells you a little bit of the story that there is still pressure on the cracker margin.  It's improving in Asia, I have to say.  It's improving in Asia.  In Europe, we still have it in North America, too.  So all in all, but all in all this is reflected in our forecast.  It's reflected in our forecast.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I think we stop here now.  There are still lots of questions but I would propose that we now ask Doctor Marcinowski to continue with his presentation More, Better, Faster, Emerging Value in Yield and Stress.  And should we have time at the very end then we will pick up on some of your questions that we couldn't do right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Maggie, we will have time enough because I suppose that you are joining us tonight for dinner.  So there is a lot of room for discussion further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I'm happy to share with you our plant biotech pipeline with a special focus on where we are in the collaboration with Monsanto, more or less exactly 11 months after we have initiated our joint work, which focuses on improving yield and stress tolerance in the four most important  crops, which is cotton, corn, canola and soy.</p>
          <p>Plant science solution, plant biotech solutions continue to grow double digit.  The very recently published statistics indicate that the global plantation area is now 114 million hectares worldwide with geno modified plants, which all come from first generation, which means input rates.</p>
          <p>The increasing in parallel demand for the 4 Fs which is food, feed, fiber and fuel takes the farmers and the production to the limits.  Agricultural commodities are up.  You all know that and the supply with these goods for those four applications, for those 4 F applications, are very much constrained by the availability of land and water. And by the fact that the productivity gains by classical methods like fertilizer, ag chemicals and conventional plant breeding have been come towards some limits.</p>
          <p>Plant biotech is therefore the most powerful tool to enhance agricultural efficiency on two ways: quantitative wise through higher yields and higher stress tolerance for example against drought and also qualitative wise through improving the mix of the components in the crop, like optimized oil content or amino acid content.  So, plant biotech will fill this gap between demand and supply.  In 2025 the market potential for biotech traits is expected to be around US$50 billion from US$3 billion in 2007.</p>
          <p>Today sales are exclusively based on input rates whereas the growth will primarily be based on output rates and the market opportunities, they range from specialty markets to mass markets covering a broad range of products, the families are indicated here.</p>
          <p>Input rates are primarily substituting inputs, this is like crop protection agents, whereas the output  traits, they generate additional value over the original crop, for example through additional yield or through consumer benefits such as additional healthy ingredients.</p>
          <p>So, BASF has started to participate in this yet untapped market when we decided in '98 to enter this field of plant biotechnology through research and this is when we have founded the BASF plant science company and that's where all our activities are bundled.</p>
          <p>The BASF plant science today is a global R&amp;D network with 700 employees, 40 collaborations worldwide and some 150 external researchers.  Our focus right from the beginning, and it is still our focus, is on research, technology and IP and we did not invest heavily into seed activities as some of our other competitors have done.  And at the same time, we also did not focus on the first generation but on the second and third generation of products, which means the output rates.</p>
          <p>And with our -- with the creation of metanomics and with the investment in crop design, we established a unique gene discovery platform where we have today a leading position and that also was the basis why Monsanto was interested in teaming up with us.  And with this platform, we clearly have a very good position to find better genes, faster and more efficiently than most of our competitors.</p>
          <p>In total, and this is of course also clear to be stated, this does not come for free.  We will have invested in the first 10 years, in the years '98 to 2008, were roughly one billion euros.  But now let's talk about what really matters, and let's focus on the output according to our project pipeline.</p>
          <p>The dark blue bars, they stand for our pure BASF projects, whereas the orange bar stands for our co-operation with Monsanto and I'll come back to this orange bar with the highest market value in the second part of my talk.  The projects of our pipeline are based on different business models because we serve different markets, but they cover efficient agricultural solutions, better and healthier nutrition, and also renewables.  The market values, which you see indicated here for the at least in stage 2 position projects, they reflect the additional value of the biotech solution over the respective value chain.</p>
          <p>Every project is based on specific assumptions on the market size and the penetration.  For example, the herbicide tolerance, represents our project in Brazil, which combines immediately known, our herbicide with tolerant soil.  Fungal resistance stands for our biotech potato, which will be resistant against Late Blight.  For PUFAs, the polyunsaturated fatty acids are healthy oil ingredients, which today are extracted from fish oil, and the fish eat the plankton, so it's a feeding chain, so to say.  And we are aiming to produce those high value oil components in plants, so we can grow the crops and then market the oils through to the food supplement chain.</p>
          <p> Amillopactine, this is our, in the meantime, I think, well known Amflora potato, which is technology-wise ready to go.  The obstacles we are still facing is that we are still waiting for the approval by the European Commissions for the commercial cultivation.  The indicated value here in this case represents the value chain until the starch paper industry.  We expect then that, I think has already been communicated, from this business piece, from the Amillopactine potato, a license business model with some peak license income between 20 and 30 million euros on an annual basis.</p>
          <p>And as you are aware, that BASF decided not to invest heavily in seed and germ planting companies.  We went as the alternative way to go to the market.  We went for partners to commercialize our IP and technology.  With the Monsanto Corporation, with the contract we signed, we made a bold move into this direction by teaming up with the market leader for the four major commodities for this very high attractive stress and yield program and also the nematode resistance project.</p>
          <p>The collaboration with Monsanto is illustrated on this slide.  The focus is establishing a joint technology and to commercialize in the collaboration the expertise of both companies that come together through the discovery program.  And once again the target crops are corn, soya beans, cotton and canola. And with distinct three individual faces of the corporation.</p>
          <p>The first one is the discovery channel where both companies maintain their individual discovery programs.  So the discovery programs are designed to identify genes which have the capability to increase yield or to bring stress resistance to the crop.  Out of those discovery programs, we nominate then jointly, development candidates and then the development will be done with a 50/50 funding split between Monsanto and BASF and this is of course also where Monsanto already today has a strong expertise because they are in the market with their first generation products.</p>
          <p>The commercialization will occur through the existing channels which Monsanto has which are established which are in the market.  We have here after deducting the cost of the market, the split between Monsanto 60 and BASF 40 of all the revenues and all the profits coming out of this commercialization.  And I would like to make it very clear that we do not differentiate out of which discovery program the genes or the traits were designed.  It's a joint program where at the end of the day what counts is what we take to the market and we do not say this has been a Monsanto or a BASF identified gene.  This is something which applies then at a joint approach for those for crops and for those stress &amp; yield tolerance programs.</p>
          <p>So where do we stand after 11 months?  I think both teams are really enthusiastic about what has been glued together and it's a very exciting atmosphere between the two teams. And I just would like to quote Steve Padgette, the Vice President of Biotechnology for Monsanto, who leads the team on the Monsanto side, he said, "What we have achieved in the last six months exceeds my expectations and it exceeds Monsanto's expectations."  And I think that puts us all in a nutshell, I think we are really here full steam ahead and are pretty much aware that we have done the right thing for both partners.</p>
          <p>We target for a six to ten yield increase for every single product generation.  So we are not talking about one generation, but about a number of them because we can also then stack the different genes and create with these combinations then additional yield and stress tolerance.  We have in the last months exchanged hundred of genes constructs between BASF Monsanto.  We have, to our very positive surprise, increased the gene pool significantly, since only 10% of the genes that we brought together had an overlap.  So the discovery engines of both companies really discovered different genes and by that, of course, created a much greater pipeline, a much bigger pool, where we can now really take the best of the good ones and proceed with them in the development.  In total, the transformation in crops is ongoing at Monsanto and our pipeline size has increased roughly by 33% by joining those gene pools.</p>
          <p>Two projects have been advanced in the next stage and, as announced, for our partner recently, the first product out of the drought-tolerant family achieved Stage III and we may target now a commercialization from 2012 onwards.  And this is now the orange bar which I showed you in my first pipeline picture, which exclusively focuses on the cooperation BASF Monsanto on our joint pipeline and here highlighted only what we have now in the pipeline for corn and soy.  It does not, this picture does not include canola and cotton.  And you see the numbers are rather big.  We have here 300 to $500 million of market value and this is a substantial value creation which is based on today's assumption in terms of market penetration.  And it's at that moment, only considering the initial country of launch, which in the majority of the cases is, of course, US or a South American country.</p>
          <p>The projects are valued as families, successive penetration, the generation project will be commercialized prior to the peak penetration of the individual projects.</p>
          <p>And the BASF benefits from the strength of Monsanto's existing platform and Monsanto's ongoing investment in penetrating the market with GMO modified bio-tech solutions.  Of course it's of great value because the higher the market penetration will be the higher the value created also through those stress and yield traits will also be.</p>
          <p>These estimates have been presented by our partner and we wanted to share with you today this view because whatever you see also from Monsanto publication on the stress and yield program in those four crops, this is always something where BASF and Monsanto are sitting in one boat and where the 60/40 split applies to the later on sharing of the profit and of the investment.</p>
          <p>With my last slide I would just like to take you once through how we come to those market valuations because I think that is of great importance to understand how such a calculation is based on.  It's a hypothetical calculation example based on 2007 numbers for corn.  If you take all the harvested acres in 2007 of corn and you take the average yield then you come to the total production in the US of corn in 2007 which is indicated here with these 13 million bushels, 13 billion bushels, right, and you multiply this with the farm price, this is the average market price that was achieved in the US in 2007 and then you end up with the total value of the corn harvest in 2007 in the US.  And now considering that you take here a 10% yield increase, this would mean that with the same water, with the same land, with the same fertilizer, with the same ag chemicals, the farmer will have on the average a 10% higher value that he can sell.</p>
          <p>And then take another hypothetical calculation and this is what we call the trade value.  And then take another hypothetical sharing this additional trade value, two-thirds stays with the farmer, one-third is with the trade provider which in this case would be the Monsanto BASF joint approach.  Of course, you have to deduct the cost for the sales channel then this is what we refer to the market value and that's also what has been indicated in our pipeline value.  And you'll see of course what additional strews for adapting this value is.  This is not only the acreage and the yield and the commodity price, but it is of course also of great importance which other countries will penetrated and of course what will be the actual market share of the Monsanto sales channel by which we can then come to the market.</p>
          <p>So, in total, we are really absolutely committed to this project.  You know that we have here combined a joint investment between Monsanto and BASF, $1.5 billion over roughly the next ten years.  This will be shared 50/50.  But we are absolutely convinced that the size of the market that the idea serving here, the 4 F additional applications will have their tremendous potential for both partners and of course for our shareholders as well.</p>
          <p>So now I'm happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you Dr. Marcinowski for the exciting update and the valuation  metrics that we received today.  And I think I would like to start with Sean de Vat Veil and then Mr. Faitz.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions on drought tolerance specifically.  Monsanto and BASF have realized another step this year in getting into phase three.  Can you just give your understanding on the timing when you expect to commercialize drought tolerance and where do you think the two main competitors in the research in drought tolerance stand, particularly Syngenta and DuPont?  The second question, I just would like to understand your view on the impact on the gene you have developed.  What is the yield impact on a year with no drought?  Is there a cost in a lower yield, or is there still a benefit?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe I'll take the first question.  I'll take the second question first.  Of course if you talk about a drought resistance gene, this is kind of an insurance.  There is kind of a built-in insurance in the plant that it can survive and get enough yield in case there is drought.  But at the same time, of course, we see here regions in the world where drought is becoming more and more a common thing, just think of Australia or other parts, and you might also then increase your acreage into areas which today have a relatively unstable water situation.  That leads me to the first part of your question.</p>
          <p>These will be the most &#x2013; probably first commercialized products.  2012, as I indicated, we believe that we'll see the first ones.  The general yield improvement program has, and you see this from the market value, we indicated a higher value because this is not the insurance, this is the ongoing stable element that we will see here in normal conditions a yield increase.  And we have seen here the proof of concept in the laboratory, in the crop.  We have actually two levels where we have the proof of concept, proof of concept in the model plant and then the proof of concept in the crop.  And this we have seen, and we have seen here up to double-digit, really good double-digit yield increase and we are really very much convinced that there will be a as well as approach, drought resistance and a general yield increase, so this will come also then in stacks and this will be not only one product. I mean, for the different regions, for the different climate situation, that's also the situation of the day, there will be different seeds and I think that's all the expertise which Monsanto has and the channels.  So we will cover this very nicely.  Competitors, I think Monsanto and BASF are convinced that with the combination of our two very, very strong and powerful and very additional discovery engines and with the expertise we are doing really much better than our competitors, but you should never underestimate your competitors, so we watch them carefully.  But I think it's also nice to see how we will in the future see Monsanto developing in their market penetration because the higher the market penetration will be, the higher our direct access to the market through our yield and stress tolerance streams will also be.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming to Mr. Faitz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  I just have one question regarding bioethanol.  I mean in the way I see it, there is two major driving forces behind the up-tick in the accrual of markets in the last couple of years. One was certainly the strive for higher quality food, meat consumption in Asia, etcetera, which fuelled soy beans and the other one was the bioethanol craze particularly in the US, which certainly fueled the extension of acreage in the US on the corn side.  Now if you look at the complete eco-balance, eco-efficiency, it is actually negative for bioethanol.  How do you view that?  What is your view mainly with additional rates, etcetera?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all, if you talk about bioethanol, go to Brazil first.  There 60% sugar cane today transferred into bioethanol, 60% of the houses are sugarcane and that's without any doubt very economical.  In the US, we talk about 20% of the corn harvest which is today converted into bioethanol and which is additivated into the gasoline pool.  The more economic and the more ecological things will be, the more you will harvest from your acreage, and from that point of view, increasing here the yield and increasing here the output which you get per acreage with the same fertilizer input and things like that will of course also significantly increase the eco-balance.  I'm really doubtful about the ecological and economical way to produce here in Europe, let's say, sugar-alcohol base on sugar beets, there I would put a big question mark.  An additional upside potential for bioethanol based on corn or products that bring a lot of cellulose with them while they are growing, which means that you add a special biotechnology enzymes where we also use the cellulosic part of the non-starch particles to make bioethanol of that.  That could give another 50%-plus for the output already with today's yields for bioethanol.  So I think in total, there will be some additional technology available which we'll see at least in the large Corn Belt for the US, I would say some positive impact.  I still have my questions about Europe and the sugar beet-based bioethanol supply.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To that if I may, quickly, I'm sure you're happy about your share price performance last year, but you should be much more happy about the 10% of K+S you still own, which is also certainly a reflection of the bioethanol craze and agro-craze.  Would you be willing and happy to sell, if you could, this 10%?  Or are you just happy with the 10% and so be it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the second part is true.  We are still happy and so be it for the time being.  You know, this is a little bit more complicated.  It's not just this investment, as I've said before.  We are producing for K+S and we have a certain interest in K+S in doing certain things in a certain direction and we are benefiting from it.  The direction we are giving is helping us and is helping them.  Though this is for the time being, the things are changing, world is changing and we will see how we go into the future.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question came from Rhian Tucker and then I had Mr. K&#xF6;hler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  A few questions on the ag portfolio.  First of all, you run your traditional crop protection business and your ag development genetics business very, very separately, different to some of your competitors.  Do you think you're losing out on any technology synergies between the two businesses by doing that?  Second question:  the collaboration with Monsanto, it's a separate unit from Monsanto's own business.  Can you combine these traits you're developing together with Monsanto's existing portfolio with its herbicide tolerance, with its insecticide business?  And thirdly, on a higher-yielding corn, clearly a huge market value there.  Who else do you think is playing in this market and has products in development and how do you think you stack up against them?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the separate situation which we have in our BASF portfolio between a chemical and biotech. First of all, as some of you do, we have something to do we don't have a seed business.  Secondly, we don't have those herbicide tolerant projects, which usually are the backbone of the businesses in Syngenta's or also in Monsanto's situation.  You have seen that one of our projects is that we have the emitters alone herbicide resistant there will be then of course a link to our emitters alone herbicide business.  But we see also that we have with Monsanto some nice talks started how we can use the access of Monsanto to the corn and soy market in particular to have some cross selling or have some synergies from our ag chemicals business.  And you know that in g chemicals we have also, sort of say, created a new market segment which is called Plant-Health where especially our fungicides on a totally different action mode, optimizing, improving the yield on the acreage.  So that's a nice combination.</p>
          <p>The herbicide traits or whatever you are talking about can be what you call stacked.  You can take, and you have today in the market, already two or triple stack biotech solutions where for example the BT, which is the insecticide containing information, is coming together with the herbicide tolerance and by that you will have two genetic modifications in one crop.  And this stacking will occur in the future, this stacking will then have some more genes in there, and as I said before, this depends very much on the application area, what is really needed, whether drought is needed, or whether no drought resistance is needed, whether you have the BT or whether you have the herbicide tolerance, and all that I think is something we see here with a huge opportunity.  The last question was on corn, wasn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the high-yield corn and how you rate versus competitors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the high-yield corn, that is the project which has the single highest value in our portfolios, we've seen the broad corn yield increase.  I think we have seen a number of very striking model plants already, and I think this comes very good along with our crop design investment, where we have the opportunity to screen very quickly in the plants.  We run this here on model plants and identify the genes that have the potential to create more corn in the plant, and this has now exactly been the case that we have transferred those genes into the Monsanto development channels and they have been cross-checked.  And there we have a very, very good hit rate that our model indicates really the genes that are relevant for these yield increases.  And with that, we are also able to say that we believe in this joint approach, and with the combination of the discovery channels and the development experience and the market penetration of Monsanto, we are here a leading partner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I just very briefly only say two words here.  First is we deliberately separate these two businesses in order to achieve transparency internally but also for you.  Secondly, we have a totally different business model compared to Syngenta, Monsanto, all the others, because we are not in the seed business, what we are selling is technology.  It's a totally different approach and you need to understand.  As early as there is a reasonable return, we will implement an additional division which is really dedicated to these gene modified plants.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the next question comes from Mr. K&#xF6;hler and then I would like to fit in Mr. Andrew Benson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mr. Magnosie, actually a question to your Chart 10 with your hypothetical calculation example.  You said market value 1.8 billion and you said this is shared between distribution channel and trade provider, just to make that clear.  Monsanto offers the east a distribution channel, which rough calculation I'd say 50% of that is going to the distribution channel, which is independent from you, the other to the trade provider and that would be then shared 60/40.  That is the calculation behind that, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The rationale of the calculation behind that is correct, but of course, the relative cost of the distribution channel is something which also depends on the yield, what is the percentage then.  If you have only a 5% yield increase, which we probably would not market, then of course there would be a situation where distribution costs would maybe not justify that, but if you have enough then also for the additional yield, then this could go down to a smaller percentage.  So I would not put now here a tag on what is the percentage of the distribution costs, but this has to be seen, as you said, from this calculation as still costs which have to be taken out before we can really take your spoon and eat the soup, which is then left in the pot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>An additional question to overall eco-chemicals in the fourth quarter performance. Agro Europe was down and the question is a little bit, some explanation behind that.  And also the Fungicide business was only slightly up in the fourth quarter.  Any reasoning for that?  It's actually, I heard Asian rusk is not as strong in the Latin America, as an example.  A little bit to Q1 outlook, what is your Fungicide business doing?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hecard can we please save this question because we are really running a little bit short of time?  I would like to catch up on the biotech question and then if I have time we come back on this one.  I think it's an important one but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will answer the question later anyhow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew Benson, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Andrew Benson here, Citigroup. Another question, when do you hope to make a profit?  Which sort of year or range of years do you believe that this enterprise will be profitable?  Secondly, assuming that in that model at 1.8 billion of value is correct, how much of that will actually filter down to BASF, because you talk about sharing it with a distribution channel as well?  Thirdly, can you out license any technology developments to other parties like Tucigenta for example?  And would that be on a 40/60 basis?  And lastly, why aren't you in seeds?  I mean, why &#x2013; you've got &#x2013; it's not as though you haven't got a balance sheet that could afford it.  Why don't you make a move into seeds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wonder what you have asked us if we had the write-off in our balance sheet which others have to take after a strong investment in the seed companies.  But let's go through.  The first thing is, when will we come to the market, that depends very much on the project.  Isaid, for example, I mean the packing potato we could be in the market this year if we had this clearance from the EU Commission.  This still is pending in the case of the herbicide tolerance project, we aim at a first market commercialization, 2010.</p>
          <p>Onwards I said with the drought resistance project, Monsanto and we are optimistic that 2012 might be the first year for commercialization and then it might take maybe another five years until you have really reached peak, but there will be a first generation program and second, third generation will follow.  So it's a wider spread, and if you ask me when we will achieve as BASF here a break-even, that will be somewhere in the next decade, but I would refuse to say now that is the year 2000 exactly.  But I've also indicated, it's still a way to go.  It depends on a number of issues of the penetration of the market, but we are in this field to stay there with our technology, which also could be of course licensed to any other partner. But in the case of the Monsanto and yield, this had to be then done jointly with our partner.  We have in the pipeline, as you have seen, a mixture of 100% pure BASF project, this had been the blue bars of where we have total freedom do. And to cooperate and partner with whoever we are willing to, and in the case of Monsanto operation, this is something we have to do jointly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be very clear, you have to look into the cost and the return.  This is a rather promising business, because if you look at the return, basically this is EBIT.  It's not sales.  It's EBIT, it's licensed income and it's EBIT directly, and then you have to deduct the cost which we have internally in R&amp;D.  So I am looking into this as being very, very promising, and this can be very early birth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just carrying on Andrew, there is a 1.8 billion of the value as to how much of that actually falls through to the BASF between the distributor. And I mean &#x2013; in one of the diagrams you had just a 1.8 billion market value, and just how much of that actually came through, because it said it's shared between the distributor and the trait providers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't give you an exact number at this stage.  The distribution costs will have to be subtracted from this value and then the 60/40 split is applied, but distribution cost is not something which will be that significantly &#x2013; if you have this overall already in a stack trait, because you always have to see &#x2013; and this is something then, of course, we have to see with &#x2013; together with Monsanto, it's a distribution where you don't sell this trait only, but the stack with a number of different properties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. Just a couple of other questions.  Just to clarify, in your presentation you talk about only 10% overlap between your R&amp;D program and Monsanto's.  Just wonder how you go about effecting that and how you go about making sure that you're not just doing the same amount of work with each other.  And then second question, just in terms of your own development products in the pipeline, where you're not in the joint venture with Monsanto and the market values you've given for those, will you be able to commercialize those yourselves or are you looking for alliances for those ones?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, the Monsanto's BASF double work, you can't exclude it from the discovery, can't exclude it per se, and what I said we have a 10% double hit rate, which is extremely low. And that is the reason because we have two different approaches.  We come here with our metabolim approach and with our different technology and this is why we identify different genes.  And even if we had some jointed, this is the chief part, so to say, of the whole thing because that's the early starting point and this is not the really expensive thing where you are really investing a lot of money.  That's the first thing.  The second thing is, about...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yeah.  Our own project, exactly.  So in the case of amylopectin, we don't have our own potatoes.  So we are here really licensing and the potatoes will be grown then by the starch providers.  In the case of the polyunsaturated fatty acid, the intention is that we, through our own BASF channels, through our care chemicals division, will then market the oils that have been grown in the field by colours. And that's, if you take slide #3, that's part of the specialty, that's part of the specialty.  In case of the &#x2013; I mean there's lean resistant soy, that of course would be a package where you sell the amylase Zolinone together with the herbicide resistant crops.  So that's the same business model as you have today with the Roundup Ready or with the liberty link and in the case of the late blight, this also would be a out-licensing to potato growers where we get license. And this would be then a similar business model as we have today with the Bt corn, where you sell to the market a product that is resistant to a certain pest, in this case, late blight.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Once again the question on fungicide which is still open, that's very valid and also the question regarding the Latin American sales growth in Q4.  Others have shown a very strong increase in the Q4.  I have seen one survey where in 2007 sales of BASF should have increased in Brazil by 40% in U.S. dollar terms and what you reported were a decline in fungicide which should be the strongest growth area there, and also Latin America showed no growth.  So, what was the reason behind that and what can we expect from crop protection in this year in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It appears that we have both the same questions about quarter four and outlook, so one answer for two questions, which is very economic.  First of all, I think it's always a little bit difficult thing to compare ag businesses and a quarter-to-quarter only.  If you look to the data we have provided for the full year, you will see that we have in all regions and in all indications in the full year 2007, on the currency exchange adjusted and portfolio adjusted, have done better than in 2006 and in particular in South America.  This is not on dollar, but it's on constant exchange rate.  We have achieved a plus 27 and also in the fungicides, we have plus 11.  If you compare the numbers between Syngenta, which most of you are referring to which published their data in U.S. dollars, with euros of course you have that big gap in the currency exchange rate. In this year in fungicides in South America we maintain our leadership and there is no reason to be concerned about the performance of our business there and we have seen also a good start in the 2008.  And we will also continue to have their -- a policy which is driven by value before volume, and that means that we are trying to sell as close as possible to the application and to the consumption.</p>

          <p>Not yet.  Okay.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to talk with you about these growth and earnings perspectives that we have in our Oil and Gas business.  Doesn't work.</p>
          <p>And I will focus a little bit on the agreement that we have closed by the end of last year with Gazprom on this asset sharing agreement as well as on additional projects we have together with Gazprom.  This does not mean that the development of our Oil and Gas business depends on Gazprom.  We are also developing in other areas.  In the North Sea we are developing in North Africa where we have projects under our own and just focusing for the purpose of getting more clarity on this, on Gazprom, but this is not the only and exclusive partner we are working on.  It's one of the major pillars for our growth development, but not -- certainly not the only one.</p>
          <p>Looking at production in our Oil and Gas business, during the last three years we have been on a level of 1,112 million barrels of oil equivalent per year.  We have now with the agreement with Gazprom reached a completely new stage.  You will see as of 2008 a production level which is at least 10% higher than what we have seen in the recent three years and we will further build on this better development of the usual orders co-effort.</p>
          <p>The second leg of our Oil and Gas business is Gas Trading business, which again we do in partnership with Gazprom.  You may be aware that last year we have seen a decline in gas demand in Western Europe.  We have the actual figures for Germany, gas demand in Germany went down by more than 5% and this is simply explained by the excellent too warm weather that we had last year.  There was no winter and as a major part of the gas is used for heating and cooling houses, obviously there was a negative effect on the demand for gas in Europe.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, despite this declining demand on gas, our Gas Trading businesses have managed to increase their sales by more than 5%.  And WINGAS, our major gas trading company which is operating in Germany and the Western European countries, has increased their sales by 10%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the sales figures of both businesses, we had constant sales in our Gas Trading business.  Sales are based on oil prices, I think we have explained the mechanisms a couple of times.  That's the net result of what we have achieved last year.</p>
          <p>In E&amp;P we have seen a slight reduction of our overall sales, which is a net effect of various portfolio changes.  We have surrendered certain activities in Dubai, we have a higher share of gas in our production portfolio and the end result is this sales development.  More important is the EBIT development.  The EBIT development is impacted by the fact that the oil price, other than some people might assume in euro, has only increased by 1 euro per barrel; from 52 to 53 euro per barrel.  And again, in Oil and Gas, due to the change in our portfolio, the ratio of oil and gas we are producing, we have seen a slight decline in E&amp;P.</p>
          <p>More importantly, we have seen increasing costs in the E&amp;P industry and this is not just the winter sell off BASF effect, this is an overall effect in the industry.  With CERA, the Cambridge Energy Research Associates, have done a study together with all the major players in this field, which indicates that since the end of 2004, costs in the E&amp;P area have increased by 88%.  It's difficult to allocate this to individual years.  Our estimators said just last year, the costs for operating and exploring has increased by more than 20% and this is also reflected in our EBIT figures in E&amp;P.</p>
          <p>As far as gas trading is concerned.  You are aware that the margins in gas trading are depending on this oil price indicator that triggers the pricing for the gas.  Again, you buy the gas based on a oil price, predominantly oil price based formula which reflects that last six months of oil price, where as you sell it for the last nine months.  This logically means in phases of increasing oil prices, you have lower margins.  Hopefully, if oil prices will go down again, we will see, as we have seen in previous years, increasing margins in this business.</p>
          <p>Reserves is a key issue and this again shows which substantial step of improvement we have achieved.  For 2006 we have published 814 million barrels of oil equivalent as reserves.  With a date of the December 31, 2007, we have 1,132,000,000 barrel oil equivalents of reserves, both in oil and gas, which is an increase of something like 39%.  This is obviously due to the reserves we can already book for the usual risk oil field, which is this 48% in red on this pie chart.</p>
          <p>But please be aware, we have followed, strictly followed the SEC rules.  Although no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange, we are following the rules.  And the rules for gas reserves booking under the SEC regulations are substantially different than those from oil.  There's a public figure in the domain which talks about 600 billion cubic meters of gas in the usual risk oil field. We would not be allowed to book these reserves immediately; not only our share, but you can book gas reserves only step wise.</p>
          <p>You can easily conclude from these figures, that we have booked now out of -- if you take the 600 billion cubic meters as the core data, we have booked less than 15% of this now into our reserves as of 31st of December, last year. And we will then, according to the rules, any two to three years, review this booking of reserves, and consequently increase with growing production these reserve figures. It is therefore important for those who like these R&amp;P ratios, these reserves over production ratios, to be carefully aware that gas reserves are not fully booked, but are only booked step wise according to the SEC rules.</p>
          <p>There is one additional effect. If I can draw your attention to the Libya reserves, which I hear counted for 14%. This is after we have Gazprom as a 49% partner in this German inter-site company, which owns the reserves -- has the access to the reserves in Libya. So this is only 50% of 49% of what is there in the ground. But the production last year was 100%. So if you would compare our production last year with this reserve, you would end up with the wrong figure, because you have the full year production, but only 40 -- 51% of the reserves. So some of our R&amp;P ratios for this would give a distorted view, to higher view on gas, too low a view on oil.</p>
          <p>But overall, we are now again back in the range of our R&amp;P, ratio reserves over production, of more than 10 years, but to caveat that, in fact, due to the gas reserves we have there's even better longer term, R&amp;P ratio long term.</p>
          <p>This shot also, according to the SEC guidelines, does not include the reserves for the Antimof reserve, which, for the legal situation under which we are, we currently cannot book. You will see next year the production out of Antimof, but again not the reserves from Antimof.</p>
          <p>But the key message here is, after having had a limited amount of reserves until 2006, we are now in the position to have at least an R&amp;P ratio of, if you compare it to SEC terms, of more than 10 years. And due to the fact that we can add additional reserves, and usually requires in the next years, even if we wouldn't find anything else, we would stay at this level. But certainly in other areas, mostly in North Africa, we are looking for additional reserves as well.</p>
          <p>The structure of the asset swap that we have with Gazprom has been explained in our oil and gas investors' days, and therefore I think I can keep it short. We receive 25% of a stake in Sevet Nier for Gazprom, this is the company that holds the license in this field, plus 10% non-voting share with the economic results. In return, Gazprom receives -- increases their share in WINGAS by 15% from 35 to 50 minus one share, and receives a 49 share in a German company which owns the license to the onshore assets that we own in Libya.</p>
          <p>How would this look like in terms of the gas flow, and more importantly, the money flow in the end of this? The green square in this slightly complicated chart is SNG, Sevet Nier for Gazprom, this is the company which owns the license to explore, produce out of this field. This company is now designed as a company which is working on a cost plus basis; 65% of the gas the company is producing is sold to Gazprom on this cost plus basis. You see this with a green line. 35%, this is the share of gas that we have economic right to, is sold to a gas marketing company. This gas marketing company sells then the gas to Gazprom at a price that is in the agreement between BASF and Gazprom for our economic participation in SNGP. It is a price that reflects a certain ratio between net bank export pricing and domestic pricing for gas in Russia.</p>
          <p>We have agreed not to disclose this figure, and therefore I'm not going to comment it and I'm also not going to comment on certain speculation about that figure that we have seen somewhere in the market.</p>
          <p>SNGP is a cost plus basis company, and therefore according to the shareholding both Gazprom and Winterside, obviously, will receive dividends on this company, but the major cash impact for BASF is in this 100% of the profits of the gas marketing company that we will receive from that gas trader.</p>
          <p>There was a debate about the financial impact of this asset swap. I think to explain the whole story now from today's perspective, as we have finalized it, I would first address the lower part of this chart. We have received assets; this is the participation in SNGP, which according to the way how we value this has a value of 1.448 billion euros. When you do an asset swap, it is important that you agree on certain parameters and you make sure that they are consistent for both assets that you want to swap. You certainly can also agree on other scenarios and this is what we have done, and you may or may not end up with different results.</p>
          <p>The important thing is this is what the agreement basically said.  In our books you will find an intangible assets value of 1.762 billion. You have to deduct from this before taxes in the size of 424 million which is possible under IFRS consolidation rules and there's an investment that we do in SNGP, it's our share and equity in 110 million euros. So, the net value for us is 1.448. So, as we had agreed with Gazprom that we do an asset swap based on fair and equal values, we had to hand over to Gazprom 1.448 billion euro. And this is achieved by the fair value of the assets that we give, this is the 15% share in WINGAS and the 49% share in the German company which holds the assets in Libya, it's a very long sentence. And these were valued and of the same parameters and of which we have valued Yuzhno Russkoye has a value of 850 million.</p>
          <p>Consequently there's an additional cash payment to balance out to come to equal values, which is in the size of 540 million euro. As we have agreed to effectively make this asset swap as per June 1, 2006, Gazprom is entitled to the profits out of our Alubian assets and the WINGAS assets and this is represented by the 58 million that you will find there. The profits out of these assets in 2007 will be distributed by a dividend in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, how would the whole stream, how would you find this back at our profit and loss statement? Starting from the right side, WINGAS. As of today, the 100% of the EBIT of WINGAS is you find in the EBIT of our Oil and Gas segment and in minority interest there is count -- or last year there was deducted to 35% share and now its 50%. So, additional minus 15% and the minority interest. With respect to Yuzhno Russkoye, the company itself operating on cost plus, will pay dividends which you will find in our financial results.</p>
          <p>The result of the trader, this is from the 35% of gas which is sold to Gazprom, profits 100% to us you will find in the EBIT of our Oil and Gas company. The Libya concessions will continue to be fully consolidated because we still own 51% in this, and we will see a minority interest of 49% being deducted. It is a bit complicated, I agree, but this is how you end up when you have to follow certain rules and regulations.</p>
          <p>The net effect of this income -- of this asset swap for us, you will find in this chart. This is slightly better than the chart we have shown in our Investors Day, and also better than the figures that we shown in April 2006 when we explained the basic principals of these deals. The reason is simply that the usual risk quality development was much better than we anticipated.</p>
          <p>At the end of last year, we had reached the production level which annualized, would mean already 9 billion cubic meters per year. So we are developing the field faster. We're expecting that already in 2009 we may reach plateau production, which was anticipated only for 2012. So, the outcome for both Gazprom and as well for us is substantially better.</p>
          <p>Now certainly, there are certain underlying assumptions for these figures. And one, the most important one is obviously the oil price. We are not predicting oil prices, but we do give certain scenarios. And unfortunately on this chart, this scenario is not given. Therefore for all the charts, I'm going to present now on economic effects for BASF, there's two underlying oil prices scenarios.</p>
          <p>One is $60 per barrel, at an exchange rate, euro to dollar, of 1.40. And the other scenario is $75 per barrel, and the exchange rate of 1.45. So we are assuming logically with improvement or with the devaluation of the dollar, we will see higher oil prices. Because certainly OPEC will insist that their net value will remain the same independent of the valuation of the dollar. So once again, 60 or 75, 1.40, 1.45 the exchange rate. This is not the prediction of the oil price in 2010, its just the scenarios under which we are working. And here in this chart you find $60 per barrel, 1.40 as the exchange rate, as the underlying assumption. And you can draw your own conclusions and scenarios on this however you would like to on this.</p>
          <p>This is the impact of the asset swap, which turned out to be substantially better than we had believed when we started the discussions, simply because the development of the usual risk quality is much better, much more promising than we anticipated.</p>
          <p>With Gazprom we have some additional products, one is Action Gas, already talked about. The development of this field, which is a very complex field, which requires a lot of technology, one of the reasons why we were invited by Gazprom to participate in this, is still proceeding. We are currently drilling the sixth well and we are hoping to start the production in the first half of this year. Well test results confirm expectations. We see gas coming up with an even better pressure than we had anticipated.</p>
          <p>The second, and even bigger and more in the public debate, present project is the North Stream project. I think it's very important to understand that the European Union currently imports 60% of the gas we are using. Of the 550 billion cubic meters, 60% of this is imported. And the share of to-be-imported gas will increase because the European Union gas fields are beyond the level of their plateau production. In 2020, Europe will only be able to produce in the range of 25% of the gas.</p>
          <p>We are in Western Europe in an excellent situation because we are in pipeline reach of 75% of the gas reserves of the world. And the biggest owner of gas reserves in this world is Russia, with 25% of gas reserves of the world. Some people say, "Can't you have someone else?" The second biggest is Iran, with 18%, where we would not currently be allowed to do any transaction because of the Iran Sanction Act. The third biggest reserves is Qatar; it's too far away for pipeline gas and anyway over-committed already for a number of projects in this country. And the rest of the reserves, North Africa, Norway, are not sufficient to cover the European gas demand.</p>
          <p>Whether you like it or not, there's no alternative. We will have to cooperate with Russia to make sure that we will have the gas that we will need in the future. And North Stream, this pipeline project, right on the Baltic Sea, is important and necessary step to further developed gas security for the Western European market. We are currently participating with 24.5% in this together with EUN. We are confident that Gassunee, the Dutch partner, will enter and then our share in this pipeline project will be 20%.</p>
          <p>Due to the political debate about this, we are now assuming that the first gas will flow during 2011. The original plan was 2010. There are some delays in the debate. The actual final costs of the whole project will depend on the question how the routing of this pipeline is going to be. We have not indicated any further figures in the last weeks because we are going first to detail -- have the detailed engineering and then we will talk about these figures. There's a lot of figures in the press about the cost; they are all invented and not authorized by a North Stream company. If we add Achenbras and North Stream into our P&amp;L structure, we have seen this, you have seen Libya, you have seen Ushno, you seen WINGAS. Achenbras has 50% in our oil and gas EBIT, this is the simple part of this. North Stream offshore will go the 20% in the financial results that we have.</p>
          <p>If I take now all these projects, the assets swap plus North Stream gas pipeline plus Achenbras altogether, again, with the same oil price scenario that I have indicated to you. You will find here the incremental net income for BASF, the net income effect for BASF out of all the corporations that we have discussed from for 2009/10 and 2015. 2015 then includes, obviously, the North Stream pipelines.</p>
          <p>To summarize this, 2007 we had Oil and Gas production of 112 million barrel oil equivalent. We are confident in 2010 we will reach 140 million as I indicated this year million and 10% more than last year. Natural gas sales we have the strict record of despite even last year decreasing gas market that we and our gas companies are able to sell more gas. We are currently at the range of 37 billion cubic meters, we will increase this by 2010 to 40 billion cubic meters.</p>
          <p>Investments will be in the range of, until 2010, 3 billion, remains to be seen whether there's an additional effect out of the North Stream pipeline. And the net income will be in the range of 780 to 900 million.</p>
          <p>We've got already three requests, how come these figures? It's very simple. It is assumptions about oil price and exchange rate. So please note when you look at these figures, they assume that the oil price in euro in 2010 will be below the current level. That's just to be kept in mind because in euro per barrel the range is 43 to 52 euros per barrel in this range that we have indicated here. It's not that we believe this is going to be the oil price, it's just the scenario to give you some indications where we see our current targets and you can apply your own oil and gas -- your oil price scenarios and exchange rate scenarios to see where we are.</p>
          <p>I think this really shows that, particularly with the deal discussed, we have made a major step forward in improving this business. We will improve our E&amp;P performance. We will continue to develop a very successful gas rating business and beyond the partnership with Gazprom we will also continue to develop our own partnership with others in third parties, in other areas of this world where we are going to do E&amp;P on our own or with other partners.  Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Indeed, very interesting presentation. A few questions, this range you talked about, I would love to apply our projections. Can you help us to understand if it's linear range? Your profits seem to go above the level of, let's say, $75 a barrel to let's say 100, do the profits increase linearly?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Before the partnership in SNGP, we have an unlimited contract for the period until we have exhausted the field.

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. John, I was wondering whether you can give us some guidance of what you expect exploration expenditure to look like maybe in 2008 and 2009?</p>
          <p>The other question, can you sort of talk about the reserves outside Russia? You talked about the successes of what you drilled. I'm more interested outside Russia.</p>
          <p>And the last question, you talked about the increasing costs of exploring, the other development, I think, in the oil market is the fact that governments are trying to take a bigger bite out of what is being produced. Have you seen anything where you're operating, where countries are trying to renegotiate some of the contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I have not -- just acoustically, I haven't got...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Whether we have seen some areas or countries that renegotiate their contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last one. Fifteen years ago, 85% of the reserves in oil and gas globally were at least economically owned by major oil and gas producing companies. Today, 85% of the oil and gas reserves are owned by national oil companies of those countries which own these reserves. So the, let's say, the playing field and the power of negotiating has dramatically changed in recent years and oil and gas companies developed into service companies which offer their service in exploring and producing oil and gas to national oil companies. And there is an ongoing debate, also, about existing contracts in many countries of the world, whether they are still fair and correct and there are attempts everywhere in the world also to adjust them. So far we have been quite successful in defending the economic position that we have. We also see... what was it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Reserves outside of Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, outside of Russia, we have a slight increase in our reserves, not sufficiently. So, we have not replaced the production that we have outside Russia completely. We have only replaced roughly 40%. We have a couple of exploration work, both in the North Sea as well as in North Africa but it takes some time until you have developed something which you can then use to be booked as reserves. And I don't expect -- the next one or two years, that we will have dramatically changed in this area, but in the mid term we will also see that outside Russia, we will have additional reserves which we can then explore economically. And exploration of course, I said increasing by 80%. The usual cost, I have not in my mind. Do you have this one?  Do we have the figure -- the actual figure for usual exploration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can give you this figure. We can come to this back later.  There's a specific figure for 2008 and 2009 I also don't have in my mind. But all in all, the overall cost for E&amp;P, we anticipate for usual is &#x20AC;1.9 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand your question in that direction, why is this huge increase in cost also? And this is certainly that you use rigs, for example. The companies which provide these rigs for drilling and suddenly they have increased their prices. Sometimes they have doubled their prices. If you want people who know how to run a drill, they have simply increased their prices that they ask for.</p>
          <p>So, after many years, in the late 90s, where there was not much drilling and exploring activities, simply there were not many people who were prepared to do this and the assets to do this were not there. Now, with increased activities, you need to understand that we expect this year 2 million barrels per day more production. This is all the result of new exploration activities. There is clearly a shortage in manpower and in machinery to do this and if you have such a situation you have these increases in cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, with this, I would move on to the next question of Olivar Schwartz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, my question goes to Mr. Bock. Mr. Bock, aren't you tempted to treat the non-tax deductible oil production taxes in Libya in the future more like a cost item in the oil and gas part of the business due to the fact that the visibility gets even more clouded with the outflow of minorities due to Gazprom having 50% minus 1 share in those most important Libyan oil fields?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>I think you hit a very good point, Mr. Schwartz and frankly we almost have to apologize now for the complexity of our oil and gas reporting, and having said that, we plan for 2008 to start to report also net income after minority interest for oil and gas because that's really the bottom line of that business. And you see on page 14 of Mr. Feldmann's presentation already the 812 million mentioning for 2007, which roughly equates to 20% of net income for BASF group, which is equal to the share of sales, by the way, of oil and gas. And by providing that number, we basically eliminate that question which you raised about the non-compensated oil tax, because that topic becomes even more difficult now after the German nominal tax rate has declined. It's a complete mess, frankly, so we have to provide you with a better set of numbers to give you better guidance.</p>

          <p>I understand you don't want to divulge your price mix formula, but could you explain the Russian export netback? Is that similar to the west European prices and you apparently assume a constant relationship with the oil prices, is there a time lag?

          <p>Yes, for the first phase, we have agreed this and we are running this program, and we will -- after we have, let's say, good and solid results on how the gas flows out of these reserves, we will then make the decision on the second phase.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Which then will bring us to peak production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then we'll come to Mr. Hedya.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Lars Hedya from Metzler. I have two questions, actually. First one is regarding the tax rate in Russia. So, as far as I know the tax rate in Russia for natural gas is relatively low, it's around 35 to 40%, but there are discussions ongoing here to raise the tax rate. And when you talk about the net effect for the Russian projects, then you must have an assumption for the future. So, I'd be interested to know your expectation here.</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding the production in Argentina. So, in the nine-month statement, you talked about problems in Argentina that burdened the results in Q3, and as far as I understood it, it was something to do with the export of natural gas. So, could you give us here (a) a little more insight in these problems? So, what is this issue really about? And (b) tell us whether the problems here are solved or not? Solved or still ongoing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The problems in Argentina are still there. The point is that the Argentinean government has set some regulations about the quality of the gas that we should produce, which forces us to reduce the share of the liquids which comes associated with the gas, which we in the past separated and sold separately. Now we cannot separate these and therefore the total value of what we are selling is less. And this is what you see both in sales as well as in profit out of Argentina. This is ongoing. This is the result of -- we had a certain discussion with the Argentinean government on this.</p>
          <p>We have assumed the tax rate &#x2013; the corporate tax rate that you have in Russia. You may be aware that under the agreement for Russia to access the WTO, Russia is forced to increase the domestic gas price. This is also reflected in our formula and the way how this is going to be achieved first for the industry and at a later stage for private households.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we're coming then to the next questions from John Juaquin and then Mr. Kohler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just would like to go back to the question on natural gas prices. And I thank you for your answer for the first question. If I understand correctly, the nat gas prices is related to the German border price less transport cost and less taxes. Does that also depend on the mix between what is exported to Germany and what is sold internally in Russia? The reason I'm asking the question is do we need to take into account the evolution of the prices in Russia to our forecast?</p>
          <p>The second question is on tax rate. Just like to know, if the tax rate will have any elasticity with the oil price or the gas price or is it a flat tax rate? Just a question if we should anticipate the same type of phenomenon that we had in Libya. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we have in the agreement with Gazprom, taken a certain share of gas that's going to be exported and the equivalent, then, for the domestic market, this is fixed. So, we will have whatever the gas prices are, a fixed share in this formula which is calculated according to net pick price export and for domestic prices. And this -- there is a certain flexibility in the whole contract in case that this duty that you have to pay, which is deducted from the border price, changes. And there is a certain mechanism which protects us against a situation that we would have an unfavorable situation out of this. So, there is certain provisions that if these duties change substantially, this will be reflected to give us a fair share of the overall deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then we -- another question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Inaudible Question] (158:46)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is what I meant. I call it the duty. This is deducted from the border price &#x2013; the duty plus the cost, and this duty is not a fixed rate; it's a flexible rate. There's a certain flexibility in -- which is derived from what we agreed what would be our fair share in the overall profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Kohler for the final question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, actually, potentially my first question is for Kurt Bock, I guess. I've heard something about a bridge financing for the call it about 500 million, just to explain that a little bit on a cash flow as tax can you say was it cashed out in 2007? How you booked it? Do you get it back quite soon?</p>
          <p>Second question is a clarification question with the reserves you booked. John, you mentioned something like 15% you booked. Is 15% of the 35% share you have or is it 15% of the total, which means that we go over time up to the 35%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what I said is in the public domain, there is a figure of 600 billion cubic meters, and what we booked is in the range of 15% of that figure, means 90 billion cubic meters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In that case, it can go up then to 35?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have the right of 35% of the overall reserve. So we have only booked something like 50, 60% of the reserves that we have access to and this is in line with SEC regulations. Yeah, if you calculate this -- 15 of the total and we have...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah yeah, that meaning you have 40 something booked out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mr. Kohler, with regard to the bridge loan that's cash out, that's real money which we handed over. It will flow back in 2008 and we received a decent interest rate on that loan as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at this point we have exhausted all your questions, I hope, and it brings us to the end of our conference. I would like to thank all of you for joining us and particularly those who had a real trouble with the planes coming in this afternoon for taking the effort. And I also would like to thank you for participating in the lively discussion. Should you have any further questions, we would ask you to please contact any member of the IR team and this evening you also have access to members of our Management Board. At the same time, I would like to ask for your quick attention and I would like to take the opportunity to tell you about our upcoming events.</p>
          <p>As Dr. Bock and Dr. Hambrecht have already indicated, we will release our financial report on March 12. And as a particular service, on Friday, March 14 we will provide you with a reporting fact sheet on the 2006 and 2007 results according to our new segment structure, which has become effective as of January 2008. So, we thought that it might be very helpful and convenient for you if we scheduled a conference call to give you the opportunity to discuss the new segment structure with our top management.</p>
          <p>So, if you could please pencil in Friday, March 14, at 3:00 p.m., German time, that's the time when there will be the conference call. We will next report on our first quarter 2007 results on Thursday, April 24, which is also the day of our annual general meeting. And with this, I would like to say good bye to everybody who was on the web or listened by phone and for all of you who are here, we are now heading to the casino and we hope to see you all there. Thank you so much for coming.</p>
