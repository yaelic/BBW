        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone, and thanks for coming to this year-end conference. Before I start the presentation, I would just like to say a few words about the general picture. I am sure you have read the press release. I mean essentially what you see, if you read between the lines this is a company with very strong fundamentals; good product line that is being renovated with lots of new products coming in; a very fast moving vaccine business; consumer healthcare business that is best in class; an R&amp;D engine that works and works a lot better than a few years ago.</p>
          <p>And then next to it, you have a short-term problem, which is one Avandia and also to some extent generic erosion, which we are reaching the peak of. It's going to get better in '09 and beyond. So that is the configuration on the big picture. I will, however, have also Julian present the detailed financials for '07 and '08. And then we will do a Q&amp;A. We will have Andrew Witty, CEO Elect, Julian and Chris Viehbacher join me and we will take all the questions from you.</p>
          <p>So let me go into the presentation. I really have two topics for you; first of all, explain a little bit the underpinnings of our '07 results and our '08 guidance, and then I want to concentrate on really lessons learnt in '07. In other words, lots of things happened, lots of events affected the pharmaceutical industry in '07. Most of them are not that meaningful, but a couple are and are going to change the environment for everyone. In other words, they have a long-term effect on the industry, on GSK and I will make some comments on that as well.</p>
          <p>Let me start with '07. There were certain things that you and I expected and then there were certain things, which were a surprise. The things that came in as expected, growth drivers, ADVAIR, vaccines, the big products all doing well, and then the new contributors growing faster, the AVODART, the BONIVA, ARIXTRA. That is really helping us and those products are going to be in our product line for the long run. So that was kind of where we anticipated the year to go.</p>
          <p>What was not expected is of course what happened with Avandia. We lost 22% of our revenues of Avandia and this had a knock-on effect on gross margin that was not always picked up in your forecast and that's not surprising, you don't know the integrity of what makes up our gross margin. But when you lose the most profitable product of your line, it has a disproportionate effect on the cost of goods and the gross margin. So it did happen in '07 and I will comment some more about this in the future.</p>
          <p>What did allow us to still make the guidance, in fact to reach the upper hand of the original guidance despite this $1 billion loss on Avandia. Well, first of all, the consumer turnaround was a tad stronger than we anticipated. You see the revenues up 14%; alli was a clear success. It's not even a year on the market and it generated 150 million pounds. We had a good turnaround as expected of Aquafresh in the U.S. on the basis of new innovative line expansions and everything pretty much clicked on the consumer side. So that was a good surprise.</p>
          <p>The second one is, we were able to produce more cost saving than maybe some of you anticipated. We have had a long history of successful continuous improvement and operational excellence. And as you can see '07 was no exception, we have been reducing SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales even in the years where our sales growth is minimum. We were able to do that. We work on it on an ongoing basis and of course that's going to continue in '08.</p>
          <p>The other thing that was a good surprise for some of you was essentially how we did with our campaign to sell pre-pandemic preparation products, such as RELENZA and our H5N1 vaccine; altogether 400 million pounds of revenues. Incidentally, this is going to continue in '08. We are still in conversation with many governments, including large countries. So there is some more potential there.</p>
          <p>For '08, why are we issuing a guidance of mid single-digit on the negative? Well, first of all, the shadow of Avandia will continue and, and in '08. But there is a price to be paid because remember from January to May, we were selling for both Avandia and then it dropped because of the U.S. market issue and that's going to drag on, particularly in the first part of '08.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have products going generic as expected, but it's a peak of generic erosion '08. If you look and I'll show you a slide in a minute, if you look at '07, '08, '09, '07 was pretty heavy, '08 is the highest, '09 comes down a notch, '10 is much better. So we do have to take that into consideration.</p>
          <p>And this is actually, at least, the list of products that we are talking about, WELLBUTRIN XL, yes, we did lose the 300 milligram in '07, but the 150 is still exclusive, and at some point, that's going to go generic. And then among the big ones, LAMICTAL IR is going to start in '08 and just a small piece of Imitrex; the others are not that big. But if you were to calculate all this, and we have done that, you'll see that there is a peak of generic erosion to be expected in '08. So for your forecast, this is an important reminder.</p>
          <p>Now on the other hand, we have growth drivers that are going to continue to propel the company. I just want to give you a brief outlook on ADVAIR. We've had a number of good news on ADVAIR. First of all, the new NIH guidelines, which favor products of that kind that is good news for ADVAIR and Symbicort vis-&#xE0;-vis the others, the Singulair and so forth; secondly, we have filed in October some new clinical data showing that ADVAIR reduced the number of exacerbations in COPD.</p>
          <p>Now, if the FDA gives us a claim that will be a unique claim in the COPD market; that's about 48% of our sales in the U.S. So it's a very important segment, in fact, we're doing well in COPD, not as well in asthma. Secondly, there is also going to be help in terms of overall global growth of ADVAIR through the launch in Japan, which will produce significant growth in '08.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we have noted the market softness in this category starting in the fourth quarter, and I think the origins of this market softness have a lot to do with the extremely mild flu season we have noticed in the U.S. In fact, the flu index that is used by the officials is half what it normally is on a normal-year basis. So that reduces physicians' visits and of course, bronco problems are very often associated with flu and people go back to their physician, get treatments. Well that didn't happen to the same extent in the fourth quarter and the early part of '08. Also of course this is going to go away as we enter the spring season.</p>
          <p>In terms of new products, I'm not going to give you too many details here. Just take a look at this slide. All those products are likely to have a financial impact, a positive financial impact already in '08. Now we might slip on a couple with the FDA those dates, who knows. But the great majority of those products will start to make an impact. So we have to start up the product renewals.</p>
          <p>As we lose some older products, we are replacing them with a number of opportunities which is quite large and of course some of those opportunities are gigantic, like Cervarix. In fact, most of the vaccines on this slide are all big and products like TYKERB and Promacta have a long way to go and a great future.</p>
          <p>The other factor on Cervarix I wanted to give you a brief update is that we are now in the phase where we are going to start to be able to impact the market. We are approved in 51 markets. We have launched in 27, but frankly with that reimbursement it's not much of a launch. So we have to go through the cycle of obtaining reimbursement.</p>
          <p>But in the places where we have reimbursement, in other words, we exist and we can take on GARDASIL, we're doing very well. So now that's a tiny part of the market and I'm not going to comment too much, but I'll just address some of what I've seen in the press. The reality is when we take GARDASIL on in five &#x2013; in six tenders we have had to do that, we have won five out of six. So I cannot believe the comment made in the press by sanofi yesterday at their marketing conference.</p>
          <p>The scientists will tell you the rest. I think we have a very strong offering. We're excited about the head-to-head comparison with GARDASIL. This is not a small study. It's a thousand patients; most patients are in the age bracket that is approved in Europe and U.S. Some of them are above 26 years of age, but it's a small portion, so it's a very relevant study. Clearly antibody titer is a very good predictor of protection and please ask experts, not marketing people of sanofi. They will give you the answer, the right answer.</p>
          <p>So we are excited about our entry into this market with a product which I think will demonstrate better cross-protection over time. We are seeing some clear indicator that that is a fact, and it's just a very exciting opportunity there. And there are so many people who can benefit this product. And needless to say Gardasil will do great, because the market is gigantic. But so will Cervarix.</p>
          <p>Cervarix is a very interesting product. You've seen in the press release, we have filed the answer &#x2013; we will file the answers to the FDA questions in the second quarter of '08, so it's coming up. And then we'll continue the discussion with the FDA; as far as timing, I know you're going to ask so might as well take that question right on. I don't know when the timing of the launch is going to be because frankly the FDA is not going to give us an answer for quite a while, and they would want to go in front of the advisory committee first. So as long as we haven't had an advisory committee and we very likely, it's not official, but we very likely will have one, it's going to be impossible to give you a reasonable forecast. But the file is very strong guys, and as evidenced by the fact we have approvals in 51 markets.</p>
          <p>The Lovaza opportunity I want to single it to you because I think it is a sleeper; I think this product is going to do well and Chris Viehbacher, our President for the Pharma business is here and I think he is also a big fan. So I have a bias, I think it's a great offering and here is why. This is a product that is basically a natural product, the only omega-3 product approved by the FDA, a product with 'no warnings'. And this is a product for people who take multiple medications, where every time you add a new pharmaceutical you got to worry, as a physician you have to worry about potential interactions, side effects and the like.</p>
          <p>Well, with Tricore, the competing entity, you do have to worry about warnings and things to watch out for, not with Lovaza. The start of Lovaza is spectacular as you can see on the graph, and in fact if you look at the first 30 weeks of sales of Lovaza, it's on the trend, it's on an uptick curve very similar to Tricore. And I remind you Tricore is selling right now at $1.2 billion. So we got a long way to go. We got big legs on this product. Incidentally, we are tripling the sales force effort following the acquisition of Reliant, so we'll have 1,500 reps to promote the benefits of Lovaza, which are already well accepted by U.S. physicians.</p>
          <p>Consumer Healthcare is a strength for us right now. The product sales are good in basically all categories. You see that the revenue growth last year was 14%. Now of course that includes alli, and also a little bit of product acquisitions that were undertaken late '06. So that number is not indicative of '08. It will be down a notch in all likelihood, because you won't have as much gross coming out of alli although we hope some.</p>
          <p>And nevertheless if you look at the fundamentals, we are outpacing the OTC market with the kind of trends we have on our basic products line. And this is a product &#x2013; this is a company that is best-in-class in this space, because of the combination of rapid sales growth and very high operating margin with 21 &#x2013; and very sustainable business. We have increased promotion dramatically this year and we still generate a 21% operating margin. So we are excited about this business and I think it has good strong headwinds and we will be able to continue to perform.</p>
          <p>Also in '08, we will benefit from the OE program. You are well aware of this restructuring, savings up to 0.7 billion pounds by 2010. Of course that's including the manufacturing piece, which comes last. It takes a while to close down plants, replace the sourcing and all the rest of it. We have closed many plants in the last seven years, I think over 30, and we are going to continue to concentrate on manufacturing, outsource and globalized access to raw materials and therefore this is clearly a source of future earnings for the company, this continuous effort to rationalize and concentrate the network.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we're going to benefit right away from savings on restructuring of sales force, with the U.S., done, basically, Chris?, and we'll see the same effort also applied in some countries in Europe where we have to go through a more elaborate formal process of consultation. But we expect half of the savings frankly to come in '08, so roughly 350 million pounds of additional savings.</p>
          <p>However, '08 is actually a more difficult year to predict, because we have never seen, since the beginning of GSK, so many swing factors. Now there are things we don't know. Remember last year, we didn't know about Avandia, so I'm not going to tell you that we are so great at predicting the world. But I can predict that the Avandia forecast is difficult because who knows if we are able to recoup and re-grow Avandia, not right away of course, but let's say starting mid-year next year. It's a possibility. We are seeing more and more evidence that when you treat type 2 diabetes patients, it doesn't matter which products you take. You get a small, very faint cardiovascular signal no matter what product you take, that's what the FDA said. That's what the court showed yesterday, that was very interesting. They completely exonerated Avandia, because they did a sub-analysis. There were 2000 patients on Avandia, it's not a small group and they saw that the negative effect on cardiovascular and mortality was due to all products, it wasn't due to Avandia.</p>
          <p>So it is a very interesting thing to see that when the dust settles, the science and the real understanding of how anti-type 2 diabetes drugs work is going to be, and if you see the future there is a chance that we are able to restore Avandia. But we have taken a realistic viewpoint on our guidance on Avandia because it could go either way. Europe, rest of the world, a little better clearly, they haven't had the media onslaught that we have seen in the U.S. and, therefore, they have maintained the market share in most cases. If you exclude North America, most markets are doing well. Europe was up last year and despite tightened label, we hope to continue the franchise successfully.</p>
          <p>Another swing factor is how much are we going to sell of the pandemic vaccine. We don't know. You don't know and we don't know, because governments are very unpredictable. We received some orders; we didn't really expect right now and then some countries that I made commitments to absolutely, absolutely buy from us right now haven't come through. Not that they bought something else; it's just &#x2013; it's the natural process of convincing a large share of the government to go for this program and however I think that this program has legs, it's done well in '07, I hope it will exceed our expectations in '08, but it's early days and we have to take a stand on this which is not easy to do.</p>
          <p>And the last part is Cervarix launch, how successful, how quick are we going to pick up business with Cervarix. It's also a matter of discussions and depending on which scenario you pick, it could be more or less than what we've put in our plan. At this point it's a little too early to make a really good forecast. I'm very confident but that doesn't mean that we should be optimistic to the point of crazy forecasting.</p>
          <p>So we'll have to see, the U.S. situation doesn't really affect '08 but it affects '09 a lot because we didn't expect to get Cervarix approved in early '08; we would have known that before we close our budget down. So there are more swing factors for '08 than I have seen for a long time.</p>
          <p>In terms of the outlook beyond '08, I think it's clear, the situation I was describing is actually on this slide, Avandia, the shadow of Avandia is going to be gone by '08 one way or the other, either it'll turn to a positive or it'll be just a cash cow that slowly declines or stays flat, something like that, we don't know at this point; there is clearly a fork in the road.</p>
          <p>Generic exposure is peaking in '08, still pretty significant in '09 and then it gets better, but the worst year is '08. And then the new product contribution goes the other way around. We have launched seven new products last year, '07. And they are going to start to throw in some serious sales growth to us and that is going to accelerate and we have many more to go and whatever we get is going to be a major positive contributor on our revenue line. And of course operational excellence, which I described, will help starting already in 2008.</p>
          <p>Just on what happened in '07, I think the major fact that is here to stay is this problem of balancing risk and benefit. Clearly some agencies including the FDA have moved quite significantly to the attitude of looking at risk, first and foremost, except maybe for life-saving drugs, but looking at risk in great detail, greater details than in the past and not being obsessed with PDUFA date, and frankly in many case as we have seen with Cervarix, saying well, we are not quite ready, we need more, in other words expanding on their own guidelines to really make sure they have assessed risk to their satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Now their influence by the environment by what's happening was public and all the cases we have seen from our ARCOXIA and Zelnorm and many others and the TN, so forth.</p>
          <p>So this is not totally surprising. I actually put a bit of a cycle together to explain to you why this is long-lasting. This is not like a bad year and then the statistics even out. This is here to stay. I tell you what, it's very simple. If you were a scientist in academia, you can do hard science and try to make a name for yourself, or you can go and do it the other easy way. You mind databases. The database available are unbelievable.</p>
          <p>Most pharmaceutical companies have their entire database, including GSK of clinical trials on the web. It's fairly easy to poke at those databases, combine data sets in different ways until you find some kind of a question to raise. That's what the meta-analysis do. They don't give any answer. They just raise the question; is there, or they are there? And the problem with this is that in the past those meta-analyses were discussed basically between scientists with not much interest from the press and the media. Things have changed. Those kinds of desk researchers, they want to be known, they want publications to get some play and so forth. So the news is then digested by the media.</p>
          <p>And I can't expect the media to know the subtle points between hazard ratios and relative risk and the like. I mean if you think about Avandia, the signal was if you compare Avandia to placebo, out of 10,000 patients, five more on the Avandia group will have some kind of cardiovascular effect. Five out of 10,000 versus not treating the patient, which is not exactly realistic. When you compare that same Avandia towards the type 2 diabetes, the signal goes away. That's what the FDA put in our label. That signal was publicized by newspapers in America saying there is a 43% increase in heart attacks if you take Avandia. Imagine why patient panics would go up, it's pretty easy to understand.</p>
          <p>So the distortion of the media has created the effect obviously. And the other problem is there is no way for the scientists to be able to capture a question coming from a meta-analysis and have an instant answer. They need to look at the entire body of evidence. They need to look at all the long term studies as did the FDA with Avandia and many other products, and then the FDA comes up with the final answer. The problem is the final answer came up in November for us. The media distortion starting in May. What do you think happened in this vacuum? Product damage. 50% of our patients called their physicians, say "Doc, oh my God! I'm taking a product that might kill me."</p>
          <p>And even though the physicians want to fight back because they do get it, it's very difficult when you are besieged by phone calls of people who actually put the butter on our bread incidentally, sometimes you just accept what they say and you take them off the medicine. Incidentally, this is not good for public health. 50% of Avandia patients were not put back on type 2 diabetes treatment. That means those people are getting hurt.</p>
          <p>So this event is not disappearing tomorrow. It's always going to be with us because as you can see the fundamental parts of mechanisms are with us now. And we better be ready as a company to deal with this. And there are lots of lessons learned from what happened in '07 for the pharmaceutical industry. You should do the meta-analysis as we did with Avandia. But then you should absolutely demand that this would be issued and put in context by the appropriate authority.</p>
          <p>That didn't happen in every country. That's why we had a problem in the U.S. where the FDA wanted to do the work first. In Europe they sold it for what it is and then the next day, I wouldn't say it was a non-event, but you know clearly as our sales curve shows has the fact that we still have the same market share, that the effect was very different, the cycle, this vicious circle didn't really take place.</p>
          <p>There are other consequences. We have noticed lately that payers don't necessarily wait for the FDA. Think about it. If you're an insurance company reimbursing Zetia and Zelnorm and products like this including Avandia, you will also get the phone calls from the patients. What you're going to do? Say I'm waiting for the FDA, maybe in six months I have an answer for you? So we have seen payers jump in and take a stand while the dust has clearly not settled and before the body of scientific evidence has been really reviewed in appropriate way, and that is also something that needs to be managed very carefully.</p>
          <p>You could quickly lose former reposition for reasons which are not solid. And then of course the FDA slowdown which you all are aware of, fewer drugs approved, four out of five NDAs get an approvable letter instead of the past where one out of five used to. And of course also black boxes are becoming trivial. It used to be a very rare event to get a black box on your product. If you think about, they have tripled in the last four years. So now there is so many of them, there are dozens of them that frankly they don't make the same impact with the medical profession, which is a pity. Because sometimes we really need you warn our physician.</p>
          <p>So we've taken on, we've already adjusted to this and we're taking on now the role of communicating some of those news to the physician who is out waiting for FDA, because as we have done, we have sent physician letters because in some case we do want to alert them to what is likely to come out based on what we know about the products. So there are many implications in the way we run our business from the legacy of 2007.</p>
          <p>Other consequences: there'll be more demands for outcome studies.  You see now, people who're even questioning was our hemoglobin A1c is a good indicator for diabetes. Well, it's very easy to say well why don't you do outcome studies and show us that over five or six years you can reduce the rate of gangrene and heart attacks and the like. Well, if we have to do that, that's going to be a long time before the product can hit the market. So we're going to have to deal with this issue.</p>
          <p>I think that part of the answer is the development of new chemical entities and new biologicals is going to change. We are going to see that there is a way forward and, in fact some of it would be very good for us, and that is to master the uncertainties better. And to do that, there is only really one way is to slice the patient populations, not to try to put the drug on the market for all the patients that could benefit, but focus on the easiest slice of patient, the ones where they would be the least amount of controversy from a safety efficacy standpoint, develop it fully, get the drug on the market because there you will have the more complete file and easier file for the FDA to react to and then build up your product as an oncology drug. Build it up, get another slice of patient, may be more complicated.</p>
          <p>And by that time you have developed a lot of knowledge about your drug anyway, so it becomes easier to do the right development. But you're not going to get instant blockbuster with this kind of technique, you are going to get progressive blockbusters. Clearly this is not going to happen overnight, but we are clearly focused on trying to meet some of the challenges I was mentioning early on.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D productivity becomes the end of it all. It already was.  But if you had any doubts with this kind of environment, we need not just new products, we need breakthrough new products, we need added value, we need best-in-class and first-in-class, nothing else.</p>
          <p>Line extensions are on the decline, there is no question about it. And thank God, at GSK, we have reacted to this trend a long time ago and I want to give you some update on what we are doing with our R&amp;D department.</p>
          <p>First of all, I have always said to have an effective R&amp;D productivity, kind of organization you need to work on the fundamentals. It's no different from any as a part of the company. And the fundamentals in the R&amp;D are on the slide, its organization, the need to have an open architecture because there is no way you can optimize science on all your programs inside. In other words, some of your programs are not going to be best-in-class and for some scientific program you need to take an insurance company and buy some other programs, competing programs in some cases outside the company. Technology, you have to use it, what to do with it. Disruptive technologies, we have a very good framework. I mean, those three points, I think are our strong suits at GSK.</p>
          <p>What is left to do? Well first of all, in R&amp;D you have this cost and pull and push between functional areas; clinical development, pharmacology and so forth and the project teams.  People who have, who are product champion; they have a team of people to develop products X, Z and Y.  That is hard to manage in an organization and you end up with those cumbersome metrics organization that try to do it all. I think that there is a very strong feeling with Monsef and I know Andrew and myself clearly to break this camel's back once for all.</p>
          <p>I think some of you have heard Monsef talk about it; this is clearly going to be a big area of change in R&amp;D for GSK.</p>
          <p>The winning culture, we're putting in place a very good framework, unique in the industry. Researchers actually get paid and rewarded on what they do, not on whether we make the EPS, which is contrary to most, if not all, pharmaceutical companies. We have done those things, but they are not sufficient. We need every scientist to be passionate and engaged and free to work.</p>
          <p>The Z system always helps, but it also comes down to the culture, to the people and I think there are some big ambitions with the new team to make that an even higher priority and not only continuing the work done, expand it.  And I am very excited about some of the ideas that are circulated on that. So, that's for the fundamentals, now in '07, we're no different, we want biological, they are the better life cycle, they last longer, you don't have to worry about generics that they're after, and I don't think you will worry about generics for long time, that doesn't mean that's not going to happen, but right now there is an opportunity that we fully exploit with our vaccine business, but we also want it to beef up our effort in biological &#x2013; therapeutic biological.</p>
          <p>Now, I do want to remind you of Domantis.  This in a few years might prove to be the best deal we ever did. This is a technology that reinvents monoclones. This is a second-generation monoclone, you can copycat Avastin, RITUXAN, Ambrielle and <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>With this technology, you're likely to come up with a better milestone. If this works, this itself will be a pipeline for GSK and a significant one. Now, we have work to do, I have to give all the caveats here, we are not done yet, but we have had some good preliminary proof of concept experiments that reassure us that this technology is very exciting. It's going to take long time to the developing biological, if they are different from the ones in the market is not a simple affair, but I think it's a tremendous bet and I'm really glad we made this acquisition last year.</p>
          <p>We have also in-license, we will try to accelerate our presence in biological so that's why we have in-licensed quite a few products that you have seen over the year and we are continuing to invest in our own product line. New sets, not surprising, this is a world emotion as a new scientific opportunity comes around, we create a set around it and we have recruited some first-class leaders.</p>
          <p>There will be more chances in the mix and the number of sets. The cost set volume is beautiful in drug discovery, small and empowered is beautiful in drug discovery. And I think this model has some room to improve further and make us even better. I am shocked that the rest of the industry has not copied us. I actually know why because it's a very difficult transition to go through as you remember.</p>
          <p>But in any case, it's a real competitive advantage. And we think most of the &#x2013; some of the productivity increase we have noted which is very visible now definitely is attributable to this structure and liberates, the freedom which scientists and the transparency with which they operate. We wanted to globalize R&amp;D, not a big deal, but we need to do it. We have a chemistry starter in India, which I would like to like to see expanded. I think you can't beat the price and the quality there. We have &#x2013; we opened for business in China, we're thrilled about the quality of science we are recruiting there.</p>
          <p>We are neurosciences in China. This is going to be a very exciting development to follow. We have small teams in Singapore, Eastern Europe, I mean we're pretty much all over the place and that's the way it should be.  We got to get accessed to the best science in the world wherever that is.  And then also in terms of externalizing we've done a number of deals, no different from other companies. The only reassuring thing is whether we would pick those deals right or wrong. And there is a easy way to look at this is to say well, let's look at the deals we made five years ago not this list, let's look at the deals we have made five years ago and four years ago, how many of the deals are still alive, how many of those compounds are progressing.</p>
          <p>Well, in our case, Monsef tells me 75% of our deals from five years back are still alive. That's a very high number. But you see for instance Exelixis is at the bottom of the middle appear. Well, of course, the Exelixis deal was done years ago but this is the compound that they have delivered to us with proof-of-concept in hand. So there are other engines working for GSK and it's starting to show now and it's starting to make an impact on our pipeline. We also picked up some marketed products, some of them are geographically important, they are not all global.</p>
          <p>Lovaza is U.S., Lunivia is Europe, Zegerid is for the time being international and there are couple of consumer products, which are global. Finally, the proof of the pudding is well how good is your pipeline, so I just want to go very quickly here, you are very familiar with this. Vaccine pipeline is terrific on top of Cervarix probably the biggest opportunity we have faced ever as a company. We see six new, all significant, at least they are interesting from a public health standpoint, Asterix might not be a big banker dollar and cents wise, but it is a vaccine for malaria, it will change the world in many parts of the African and Asian continent.</p>
          <p>So, this is very strong and we have to manage that goals very carefully. So we extract maximum mileage out of this terrific project. Oncology, no need to talk. We have 15 phase III development program. We have built the program from basically scratch in the last eight, nine years, and we are building TYKERB, and then we're very pleased with the start and we'll comment on that if you wish. Cardio and metabolic is interesting. This is where we have a mix of best-in-class and first-in-class. Our GLP-1 is a very competitive offering. We are not done, but so far where we have seen we like it a lot in terms of efficacy, safety, convenience. If we come out after Byetta and the others we want the best offering. Otherwise there is no point in participating in this market segment.</p>
          <p>So we're very excited about this. On the other hand, our LpPLA2 product is potentially a transformation product in this field. And we will be filing some very important clinical data in a major publication. We were hoping to show it at the ACC, but we didn't make it on time. We are still reviewing the data by the way. So I'm not going to comment on what's in it, but from what I understand, the scientists want to publish it in a major publication. And we have lots of exciting product as well.</p>
          <p>Neurosciences, again you followed at the workshop what we're doing there.  My take on it is we have very interesting molecules, but more importantly we are able now to attack the very gigantic markets of CNS, Alzheimer and schizophrenia and so forth. In the past we were in clearly smaller market segments. So this is very exciting for the future. Altogether, if you look at today, where are we today, well, I had said last year, that we had in the best case, if the FDA cooperates, 25 potential key launches. This is not small stuff and small line extension, 25 key launches, and so far if you follow the scorecard, we have passed 7 already. So, we are on the road to 25. We might not &#x2013; we will not make 25.  I'm sure there will be some delays from the FDA and the like, but it is a substantial workload and frankly, we will have implications on how we can make sure every single product we put in the market is very successful and we extract the maximum advantage from those products.</p>
          <p>This is a talent survey, you will apologize some of you don't like to see benchmark studies. But I think these benchmark studies are very important, particularly the benchmark studies which have existed for long time, because at minimum they show you how you are progressing.  Now, when I presented to you seven years ago, I showed the same slide. We were at next to last, so allow me to brag the last two years we have been number one. Now this is a survey that only measures number of products, it doesn't try to make an assessment on the value of the product.  So it's an incomplete piece of information.</p>
          <p>So on that criteria and of course they give more points to late-stage molecules as they should. But on that point, we are number one.  But if you look at the other significant benchmark study in our industry which actually measures price and value of the pipeline viz the appropriate risk assessment attached to it and replacement value of the pipeline versus the sales you have, GSK also finishes first in the comparison of all pharmaceutical companies. So we are not happy, we want to do more, but I think we are off to a good start.</p>
          <p>The bottom line is simple to understand, we have strong fundamentals, diversified business, a fabulous vaccine business, best-in-class consumer healthcare, pharmaceutical business, which is clearly going through a tough time because we have Avandia and the generics.</p>
          <p>But the engine is going to be new products, the pipeline is in good shape, R&amp;D is in great shape. But all this is said and done, we are facing an even tougher environment than a year ago when I talked to you.  Clearly things have moved one notch more. It wasn't easy to start with, it's getting harder. So in a kind of a challenging and fast changing environment, you can't fight the government agenda, you can't fight the environment.  You have to fit to the environment and take advantage and ride the wave.</p>
          <p>And I think this is why expect the chances that we have initiated in the last few years to continue, in fact if anything to accelerate because we need to stay with the program. We need to keep up our efforts to make us by far the best R&amp;D organization in the world, by far the best company in the world.</p>
          <p>And there is a lot of work to be done to get there. But I am very encouraged by this combination of being strong in tough times. Good things happen to strong companies in the worst kind of weather.</p>
          <p>So on that note I want to thank you and I want to also open the next presentation with Julian Heslop, our Chief Financial Officer, who is going to give us some details on the numbers. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, J.P. I will focus on most of my presentation today on business performance results, which as you now exclude the restructuring costs relating to the program that we announced in October. It's our focus on business performance. But I will cover the total statutory results on one slide. As usual, I will talk in terms of growth versus last year at constant exchange rates.</p>
          <p>We turn to the first quarter, the last quarter of the year. Turnover was level and Pharmaceuticals were down 2 and Consumer Healthcare sales were up 11%. Cost of goods as a percentage of turnover was unusually high during the quarter, and that reflected a relatively high vaccine and consumer healthcare sales mix, but also a number of one-off items, particularly stock write-offs. If you exclude those one-off items from the 25.6%, it drops to 24.2% of sales, 24.2%.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A costs declined 13%, benefiting from continued cost reductions and also higher one-off costs last year. R&amp;D expenditure was broadly in line with the previous year. If you look at other operating income, 119 million, 65 million of that was royalty income and 51 million the mark-to-market on the Quest collar. I mean the Quest caller is an irony, because economically it protects half the value of our Quest holdings, which is worth about a billion pounds. So half the value is protected &#x2013; so actually when the price moves up and down, half the value is protected and that doesn't move at all.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, because we equity accounts for Quest, the accounting bodies require us to mark-to-market this instrument and move it accordingly. So it's a disconnect between economic reality and accounting. It was favorable in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Lastly, if you look at the CER growth and the Sterling growth, you see that they are broadly the same for the quarter &#x2013; the first time for many quarters.</p>
          <p>This chart does contrast the business performance results, which you see in the left-hand column. It shows you in the middle column the restructuring costs of 338 million. This costs two-thirds of them were redundancy, one-third asset write-off, and to the right in the third column you see the total results, simply the sum of the first two.</p>
          <p>Moving on and back to business performance for the full-year. Turnover increased 2% for the year, Pharmaceuticals were level and remember the decline in Avandia sales and the intensive generic competition in the U.S., which basically resulted in that level performance.</p>
          <p>And Consumer Healthcare, turnover was up 14%, benefiting from the introduction launch of alli, our weight loss product and also the acquisition of CNS. The cost of goods margin increased in 2007 and reflected a number of factors, but particularly that higher consumer healthcare and vaccine sales growth. Secondly, the generic competition to a number of very high margin U.S. products. And thirdly and very importantly, the loss of very high margin Avandia sales.</p>
          <p>We expect a further increase in the cost of goods as a percentage of turnover in 2008. The company delivered a further reduction in SG&amp;A costs as a percentage of sales although part of this improvement was a result of low legal charges.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenditure was 3% lower from the previous year due to cost saving programs and also to lower restructuring costs. We continued to be good at improving our productivity in R&amp;D at the same time as we improve our activity in R&amp;D, the net effect of that being we control our R&amp;D spend pretty well.</p>
          <p>Other operating income was 475 million pounds for the year and the increase compared to the previous year was largely driven by an improvement in royalty income, which went up by 122 million pounds to 216 million. Royalty income now represents 45% of other operating income. For 2008, we expect our operating income to be broadly in line with that achieved in 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning to the earnings per share, we'll start with interest. Interest was higher for the year and that is pretty much the result of the enhanced share repurchase program. That's the key driver of the increase in debt. Earnings per share, 10% CER growth, and that benefited from the lower tax rate but also benefited by one percentage point from the share buyback program. And that one percentage point benefit is net of the interest cost, the related interest cost that arose through buying the shares. We have clearly to take the two into account. For 2008, we expect the tax rate to be slightly higher than it was in 2007.</p>
          <p>This chart summarizes our earnings guidance for 2008. We had always expected a generic hit in 2008. But what clearly surprised us were the events in 2007 which J.P. referred to was Avandia, which has impacted not only 2007, but will also clearly impact 2008 with a full-year effect. Overall, we believe that the earnings guidance we have given best reflects the swing factors facing the company in 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving on to cash flow. Taxation pay was at a more normal level in 2007. You'll recall that in 2006, we made the tax settlement payment to the IRS. If you look at capital expenditure, the increase is fundamentally driven by increased expenditure on intangible assets, and there are two parts to that. More in licensing with the related payments in R&amp;D and secondly, payments made in respect with alli to Roche.</p>
          <p>The increase in net debt during the year of 3.6 billion, which you at can see the bottom of that chart, is pretty much the same number as share repurchases. So the two pretty much equated to each other, free cash flow basically funded the dividend, pretty much funded acquisitions, the share repurchases drove net debt up to 6 billion pounds.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, for 2007, the Board has approved a dividend of 53 pence, 10% up on the previous year. We repurchased 3.75 billion pounds of shares and 2.5 billion of that related to the new share buyback program. We plan 6 billion of share repurchases in 2008, and both the 2007 and the 2008 numbers are exactly in line with the commitment we made last year. Together, these actions reflect our continued drive to improve cash returns to shareholders, firstly and mostly through a progressive dividend policy and lastly, through share repurchases.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand back to J.P.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Julian. Before we start the Q&amp;A, I'd like to introduce Andrew Witty to you, Andrew of course is the CEO Elect and many of you are familiar with Andrew, but I just want to say something about Andrew. I think he is very modest, people have said he is young, yes he is young, but he is very experienced in what matters. He has a very good understanding of Asia and other BRIC countries, which of course is important. He has experience of the all-important U.S. pharma market because he has worked there, and he has the ability to implement change, which as you have seen is necessary.</p>
          <p>And the proof of the pudding of course was some of the significant changes he made in what is essentially the least change friendly part in the world, no that's not the U.K., that's Europe. So Andrew has really demonstrated that he has the skill set to run a major pharmaceutical company.</p>
          <p>Frankly on top of that and more important to me, he has leadership talents. When you talk to people around the company, they know that Andrew knows how to extract value from his team, he knows how to spot talent and promote it.</p>
          <p>So he has what it takes to align essentially an organization of 110,00 people to get things done without having incidents of bad management practices dominate, as we have seen in other big companies. So I am very glad to be able to pass on the baton soon to Andrew, and I'd like him to introduce himself to you, just say a few words and then we will start the Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, JP. And it's a pleasure to have the opportunity to talk to you briefly today and then obviously in the future there will be more occasions I am sure.</p>
          <p>Before I start it would be remise of me not to acknowledge JP's great leadership of the company since the formation of GSK. And over the period, I think JP you have delivered an average of 12% EPS over a long period of time <mark type="inaudible" /> all of course. And that takes a lot of doing when you actually think about what the portfolio of the company looked like back at the beginning or the portfolio looks like now, transformation of the R&amp;D organization, the pipeline I think you deserve an enormous amount of credit for that.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I would like to thank you for your personal support to me in the last few months as we have been working together in this transition period.</p>
          <p>Now many of you will be wondering what I have been doing since the announcement was made of my appointment. Well transition can sometimes be short, they can sometimes be long. This is ideal for me because it has given me the chance to really get around our organization and really make sure that before I take over, I have the chance to talk to a lot of people inside the company and a lot of our stakeholders on the outside of the company.</p>
          <p>So as I start to put together the plans, I want to take forward, I've really had the chance to inform that thinking in a much greater way that might normally be the case.</p>
          <p>So, in fact, if you go back over the last I think two, three months, I've only spent about three or four days in the Brentford office of GSK. Many of you have been to Brentford, so you know that's not the hardest thing I have had to do.</p>
          <p>But I have been all over the world, I have been in Japan, I have been in Singapore, I have been in India, I have been in the Middle East, I have been in the U.S. every two weeks since my appointment. And naturally the way it's going to be, I am sure, it's the way as this job has to be, this is a global company. And it's been really an excellent period for me just to get a sense of where our people are, where the issues are and more importantly where some of our opportunities are going to stand going forward.</p>
          <p>Now you are not going to be shocked to hear that I am not going to announce today a new strategy for GSK. I am still taking the time to assemble how we developed forward. But I do want today to take the opportunity to give you a sense of where some of my perception is, and where some of the direction of my thinking is going.</p>
          <p>Let me start first of all, with what I think is absolutely fundamental when you are looking after a company of the size of GSK and the place that GSK fulfills and that's obviously the environment. We operate in a highly regulated environment in the eye of society, in the eye of the media and on the front of many government ministers' agendas frankly. And so it's na&#xEF;ve of us to believe that we can to anything in isolation of what's going on around us.</p>
          <p>We have to be focused on the environment and make sure that we are understanding of it. It's self-evident and JP has already touched on it but the environment has got tougher and it's got tougher more quickly over the last few years &#x2013; and I for one don't believe for a minute that many of the changes we've seen are going to simply reverse and go away again. The changes are real changes, there are shifts in payer power, for example, payers are full &#x2013; far more powerful today than they used to be, frankly. They have more information, they have more ability to control physician behaviors. All of that is changing the commercial environments in which we operate.</p>
          <p>The regulators are changing and JP described very well I think, the kind of trends which are going on inside the regulators leading to slowdowns and approvals, greater focus on risk. We need to recognize them. We need to figure out ways in which we can navigate that new reality.</p>
          <p>The pressure on us as a global company to make sure that we step up and do our part to access the medicines in developing markets and in fact till actually develop the drugs that are needed for neglected disease. We can't avoid that and JP has led from the front from the very beginning in terms of our commitment as a company to do the right thing and to invest properly in the development of disease in developing world.</p>
          <p>All of those things are going on around us and we need to recognize that. What we need to do is make sure that as a business, we start &#x2013; continue to develop our operating plan, our business model, to make sure we fit much better with those new realities. That leading will have to lead to all sorts of things. It leads to new selling models and you know and it has been well publicized over the last couple of years that GSK have done an enormous amount of work exploring new ways of selling. Those types of pilots, those lessons we have learned have now to be implemented. Because clearly a new selling model is required in large numbers of countries around the world and for different types of customers.</p>
          <p>We need to be able to ensure that we engage with our payers properly through being able to demonstrate the value of the medicine more clearly, being more open to more flexible relationships with payers who've made blink at the initial idea of the price of the new medicine. Those are the sorts of changes that we are going to have to see happening; and as you know GSK over the last few years, we have been assembling or thinking and doing the work to get ourselves in a good position to really make sure that we can make the right moves at the right time.</p>
          <p>Now key among all of that is really the role of R&amp;D. And in all of the countries I have worked, and I had the chance to lead our businesses in four continents now. I have never once met a politician or a payer who has ever said to me, we want fewer innovative new drugs. They all want new drugs; they want new drugs that meet fundamental unmet medical need which carries a great burden for their systems.</p>
          <p>The challenge is for us to deliver them. The challenge is for us to make sure we have an R&amp;D machine which really gets it right and gets it right in the eye of the customer, in the eye of the key stakeholders, and that's clearly what we have been focused on at GSK since the formation of the company and the development of <mark type="inaudible" /> and all of the progress we have made in the pipeline has made tremendous progress there and that's an area where you can take it from me, we will never stop.</p>
          <p>I don't think we will ever be happy with the level of what we are capable of doing in R&amp;D. Even though last year we got approval more than anybody else in the industry for four new chemical entities, three small molecules, one vaccine; even though last year we put six more molecules, new molecular entities into registration; even though we put eight more new chemical entities into full development, it's not enough. We have to keep on really pushing ourselves organizationally in the way in which we diversify our focus on different types of science and the way we reach out to people outside of the company through our externalization efforts.</p>
          <p>All of those things have to be constantly pushed and pressurized through the organization, because the future as far as I can see in the environment that we can see right in front of us is that the winning strategy has to be one which brings wave after wave of new molecules, which really fundamentally meet unmet medical needs.</p>
          <p>As JP says, the days of the line extensions are receding. They are not going away completely, but they are receding in their relative importance. We need to make sure as an R&amp;D company we really get that message and make sure that our organization can deliver. I am confident it can, and there will be plenty more opportunities to talk to you about how that looks in detail. But it's not just about R&amp;D. For a company like GSK, we of course have to get R&amp;D right, but we also have to go after sales growth. And as an organization going forward, our focus on sales growth is something that we really want to ensure is maintained and built. Now how do we get that? Well clearly, a big piece of our business is the classic pharmaceutical company and that's what we have been talking about so far, and I have just talked about for the last two or three minutes.</p>
          <p>But we have many other parts to this company. We have the vaccine business, we have our biopharmaceutical business, we have our consumer business. All of these businesses represent significant channels of growth opportunities for us going forward. And that's an area where we are going to really focus our attention in terms of how we build up those businesses. Again great progress made, six new vaccines to go in the next couple of years. Within five or six years, I expect a sixth our overall R&amp;D activities to be in biopharmaceuticals, excluding the vaccines by the way; very significant progress in those areas.</p>
          <p>The consumer business, I think, has really demonstrated that it is a real deliverer of sales growth to the organization. And we've demonstrated as owners of that business we know what we are doing that we can grow as fast as anybody else in the sector and we can deliver margins higher than anybody else in the sector and that really represents a powerful engine for the organization.</p>
          <p>But in addition to those businesses, we need to start tapping other areas of growth. And just one for today is obviously the emerging markets. It's an area where already 25% of pharmaceutical growth comes from the so-called emerging markets. That number will only go up over the next 5, 10, 15 years as economies like China or India and the rest really start to propel themselves into a different type of platform. The great news for GlaxoSmithKline is we are already market leader in many of those countries.</p>
          <p>Just to give you one example, in India, a business I know particularly well. We sell product in that country which accounts for 20% of the global GSK product, i.e. for every 10 packs we sell worldwide, two of them we sell in India. We're already a very substantial business in that marketplace. The challenge is now to make sure that we ride the wave of the economic prosperity in the emerging markets to allow those geographies to also become engines of growth for the company.</p>
          <p>So for me to conclude just simply to say, there's a lot going on in the environment, my objective is to make sure that we take all of the great foundations we have as a business that we really never give up looking for new opportunities both for serious medicines to fix unmet medical need and also seek out strong new growth opportunities so that as the industry goes through what is an industrially tough environment, this company gets through that navigating in the most positive way possible so that the end of the changes which we've seen in our industrial landscape, this company is the strongest around.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and I'm going to ask JP, Julian, and Chris to come back up for the Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my question. My name is Marcel Brand from Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole. Three questions if I may. The first one, why was the guidance for 2007 so wrong? You mentioned Avandia was obviously the surprise, but you failed to mention Coreg, which probably also did less well than expected. And also Advair volume growth was also much less than expected.</p>
          <p>That brings me to question two, why is the guidance on 2008 so conservative, you are guiding already 350 million savings. Other operating income expense is going to be continuously high because of royalties. You have significant share buybacks and if I understood your presentation correctly, you don't share sanofi's view on Zovirax.</p>
          <p>And then the third question is on darapladib.  This is obviously very important information the imaging study data. Since the material's non-public, can we expect release of headline data before publication in the journal? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your questions. I mean when you say our guidance was wrong, it depends what you compare it to, I mean you talk about &#x2013; our internal forecast was actually on track with what happened in the marketplace. I can't comment on other people's forecasts, but as far as our forecasts are concerned there was not one product that deviated too much from what we expected.</p>
          <p>On the other hand I think in my presentation, I did mention there were areas that surprised us on the positive, that's how we were able to fill the gap of nine points that Avandia cost. I mean without Avandia, if you exclude Avandia, in the comparison from the baseline and from what actually happened, the company grew 19%.</p>
          <p>And I think the areas that I mentioned where we did better than we expected, I'll just repeat them very quickly. Slightly better turnaround in the consumer business, in other words, consumer business beat our forecast. Better cost savings, we accelerated &#x2013; this is not a coincidence. We accelerate the restructuring. We took it &#x2013; it's an urgency. We tried to close the gap. This is not a passive exercise where we just wait for the business to go where it goes. We did something about trying to fill the gap. So you shouldn't be too surprised as this is a very good team in terms of execution that we are able to push the company a little harder and a little faster. So the cost savings was a big one. And to be fair, we had a down &#x2013; I mean a forecast which was much more modest on pandemic preparations, and that helped as well. Those were the three variations for you.</p>
          <p>For you, I did look at your consensus. I think that there were a number of products, no big delta anywhere in particular, but they added up to about 200 million pounds of sales that you did not expect us to realize. And if you think about pandemic, that might be just right there that would be the case.  And there were also some, I would say, less aggressive numbers on SG&amp;A reduction and that kind of explained that the analysts were a touch below, I mean the consensus of the analysts was a touch below where we ended up.</p>
          <p>For '08, I don't want to qualify the guidance. As I said and I tried to make that clear, there are many moving parts right now. I mean you saw the swing factors, they are huge. Depending on where you aim on Avandia and Cervarix on pandemic, your guidance is going to have a lot of fluctuation. I think we should wait and see. I, hopefully &#x2013; this is a management team that's going to really try hard to do better than guidance. But from where we are, today, as we speak, this is our best guess. That's what the guidance is all about.</p>
          <p>And then finally on the last point, we have to finish cleaning up the data. Obviously, this is &#x2013; there are a couple of trials. The dose ranging trial will be published at ACAC. As far as the imaging study, we have investigators. They have to be absolutely done with data analysis, writing the summaries and so forth.  As I said we are planning to file the manuscript for a significant journal.</p>
          <p>And at some point in the, I would say in the future, there will be also a decision what happens to the drug, what is the next step or what do we do, I mean that's going to also clarify how we feel about the drug that will come in some months, but not too long. And that's all I can say at this point. We can't reveal work in progress, this is a complicated study. In terms of giving headline, it would be difficult because you need to have the full story, the primary endpoint, the secondary endpoint, I mean, it's quite a complicated study. So we apologize for not being able to give you more precise information, but that's really due to the complication of the study. Yes.</p>

          <p>Michael Leacock from ABN Amro. Three questions, if I may. Firstly for Chris perhaps, could you give us an update on your innovative selling models? I think you're doing some private programs. How is that going?</p>
          <p>And related to that, I guess maybe for Andrew, we've heard a lot about the operational excellence program from last year, seems to be about 5% of your operating cost base that you are extracting. And I wondered how much more might be able to be extracted to reach, say, operational perfection?</p>
          <p>And thirdly in the shorter term, JP, for the FDA and this ping-pong match you've got between these late stage line extensions. What can you realistically do to try and speed up that process and get these, pretty vital ex-el-ex-el or vials whatever they are, through quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'm going to try the third one because that's where you're going to get the worst answer of the three by far. We're trying everything we can. I mean, you have no idea how frustrating it is to get the casual FDA letter that says, well, we know we're missing the PDUFA, but we are not ready, we don't have enough results. Literally we are getting letters with this kind of tone if you to read between the lines.</p>
          <p>Now the FDA does a very good job on most files. And they are very focused and very serious. For instance, the review of Cervarix, you are dealing with a huge file. And they want to see everything and I have no problem with many of the products, but you were mentioning line extension. This is clearly not their priority. So here you sense sometimes that they just take longer than they should but what can we do? We can only you know try to press them and so forth, so we have no magic solution. And we are looking, if you look at our track record for '07, I mean we made it on ONC; in fact GSK have more FDA approval than any other company.  In fact we had 15% of the ONC approved, our company alone. And we certainly don't have a 15% market share.</p>
          <p>So there are areas where you know you're going to have a fair and quick review, it's &#x2013; life saving medicines get treated quickly. First-in-class medicines get a lot of attention not necessarily speed, but a lot of attention and good reviewers. But then there is everything else which is 80% of the files and that just is sometimes moving slow. But we hope we are going unblock for instance, Treximet, I'm kind of optimistic. There are a number of areas where we hopefully are at the end of the road. And we are going to get our approvals, but there is no magic solution. And as you know all companies suffer from the same disease. Now I'm going to pass on the questions that were raised for Andrew, maybe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Michael. So in terms of the OpEx question, first of all we are never going to reach operational perfection. I think the whole &#x2013; one of that spirits of this management team is that we're never comfortable with it, which is why you see this every year grinding away at the expense base of the company.</p>
          <p>Personally, I think there is significant onward opportunity for us to improve. And I think, as you see us continue to do more externalization, we do more global sourcing, the way in which we are changing our selling model, the way in which we are changing the relative importance for example, of our advertising and promotion within our overall mix. All of those things are touching big, big lines of the expense base. And I think over time, you will continue to see us really address that. And make sure that as we have more product, more opportunity, we're not necessarily having to always ramp up more costs, because I think we can drive a tremendous amount of efficiency in the organization, above and beyond the current program that's in place. And I think that's the spirit of the organization we've had for few years. And I think it's one I absolutely expect to continue, and, if anything, be sharpened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the field force, and this applies also to other operating expenses, it's not very difficult to actually cut costs. What's hard is to actually reduce costs while actually keeping the same output and perhaps even increasing it. So when you look at the field force, we actually have quite a few product launches to support. So even while we are losing some sales to generics, actually when you're on the ground, you still need an awful lot of promotional support. So we have been experimenting over the last several years on different selling models. And really what we have been able to do is take out about 25% of our primary care over the last couple of years.  And the way we have done it is a couple of things.</p>
          <p>First is, typically the way you organize the field force across America is really by density of where the physicians are, the more doctors there are the more reps you've got on the ground. And, obviously, you've all heard about access issues there. But those access issues aren't constant wherever you go. If you're up in Oregon, they are pretty difficult, but if you're in Southern Texas there isn't an issue. So we actually decided to deploy our field forces more along the basis of where the opportunity is. What access might be like, what reimbursement might be like, what other demographics might be like.</p>
          <p>And the other factor that we have taken into account is that our reps are actually looking for a lot more accountability. So by redeploying and actually operating on a model that we don't think anybody else has out there, we believe we have been able to reduce our field forces without actually harming our competitive ability, without harming our ability to actually launch all of these new products successfully. The other thing that we've always been careful about also, and we haven't done this all in one go, is &#x2013; for me one of the most important factors as we look at sales force restructuring is how many physician-rep relationships do I disrupt. And we have been very careful about that and even in this last go-round last November, the vast majority of those relationships weren't disrupted.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Kevin Wilson from Citi. A couple of questions. JP, you talked in the past about SG&amp;A declining and R&amp;D over time increasing. Could you give us an update in the light of your 2007 takeaways from SG&amp;A where that goes? And then to roll it over, perhaps to Andrew and ask him where he sees industry margins going long term, because you're clearly talking about some significant pressures and at the same time you are going to be efficient with R&amp;D, what do you think &#x2013; what message would you like us to take away about where industry margins are going to go?</p>
          <p>And secondly a specific question on Cervarix. Would it be reasonable for someone looking at it from the outside to assume that you as an organization know a great deal about AS04 as an adjuvant, and that maybe you didn't tell agencies around the world everything you know about AS04 at the moment that you filed that enormous package and therefore you might be in a position to respond if somebody asked you for a detailed review of the safety and efficacy of the adjuvant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of R&amp;D as you know we have had competing influences in R&amp;D. Our pipeline has grown significantly, it has tripled in the last seven, eight years. So costs associated with pipeline development have kept growing and growing. On the other hand at this &#x2013; during the same period of time, we have quite effectively attacked the cost of doing things. Like a classic piece of a company where you try to do the same with less, or do more with less. And we've been quite successful &#x2013; if you think about just the outsourcing of clinical trials to low cost countries, that's a $600 million saving right there on the size of our company. So you're able to affect basic fundamental costs of functioning in R&amp;D and infrastructure costs in R&amp;D. And of course this money wasn't really put on the bottom line it didn't flow through to the profit line, because we've spent it on the pipeline. So as you have seen this equilibrium has worked pretty well and I can't speak of what happens in five years' time. But so far we are not overly concerned, I think guidance for the next couple of years is &#x2013; stick to the sort of growth that would go with the sales growth. In other words as a percentage of sales I think the R&amp;D budget is going to stay the same.</p>
          <p>Now I have to say that's a sort of inspirational wish to say, if I was starting a pharmaceutical company from scratch I wouldn't say we're going to spend 17% of sales in R&amp;D, which practically everybody does. I wouldn't do that, I would say, I would like to spend more because like in electronics, like in other industries the bigger spenders in percentage of sales tend to get, all things being equal, tend to get major benefits and in fact all things are not equal. We think &#x2013; and based on this CMR survey we're 200 to 300% more effective in what we do in R&amp;D than the competition. So there is a real competitive advantage element here if we can raise the money to build up R&amp;D for the future and that is going to be an issue faced by the next management team, they are going to have to make some trade-offs between short-term earnings and long-term achievement. But so far Kevin, you will give us credit. We have grown 12% in a very tough period of time. I lost my three best drugs within years of being a CEO. So we are good at delivering for short term on the hundred-yard dash, but we also never take our eye off running the marathon. Because that's where the big wins will be when we transform this product line and it's starting to show and it's &#x2013; that we have the guts and the goods to replace our aging product line that is now more behind us than in front of us. So the last question, can you remind, I don't want to...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before I answer that let me, so, I mean I share JP's view obviously in terms of where margin progression is likely to go, I don't think there's going to be anything very dramatic. I do think we are likely to see cost of goods probably drift up a little bit. Because we've got more licensed product, some of the newer products are just, the way they are synthesized, that kind of thing. But you know, clearly as I have already said to Michael's question, I think there's opportunity in the SG&amp;A line. So the net-net of all of that, it's not obvious to me there's going to be a dramatic change. As far as the response to the FDA vis-&#xE0;-vis Cervarix is concerned, as you have already heard we're planning to get our response in during Q2. We think we can make a very full response to them. There is no doubt, we know a lot about ASO4, I remind you that it's not only approved in Cervarix in Europe and rest of the world, it is also approved in another vaccine called Pendrix elsewhere, which was about three or four years ago.</p>
          <p>So this particular adjuvant, I think we know a lot about, we have a very high degree of confidence. Frankly it's the adjuvant which makes Cervarix as effective as it is in terms of cross-protection, and particularly we think it's the adjuvant plus the fact that we originally developed this as a bivalent and not add on things subsequently which makes us confident we've got protection both on 16 and crucially 18 and that that is going to be sustainable for a long period of time. Now, if you compare that with the other vaccine, what you see there is not the same sustainability &#x2013; not the same degree of sustainability on 16 and 18 and not the same degree of cross-protection, when you look at genetically related subtypes to 16 and 18. I.e., for them it's worse on 45, which is close to 18, all of which supports the hypothesis if you will that I'm just laying out. And that has a lot to do with ASO4, not entirely, but a lot to do with. So I think in terms of us going back, we are confident we can go back and respond, obviously then it's up to FDA how then they go forward. And, as JP said, it's likely there is going to be an advisory committee I think it would be unwise of us to guess there wasn't going to be an advisory committee and maybe there will be more questions there, we'll see.</p>

          <p>Kevin Scotcher, HSBC. The question for Andrew, 2008 we've got guidance, 2009 is your recovery respectively. So you have given us some idea as to perhaps where you think SG&amp;A exactly. But just running through looking at JP's presentation, is there anything that you think JP has missed in terms of the 2009 recovery? Is there anything that you think that JP perhaps didn't emphasize strongly enough in his presentation? Can you just give us some idea of where you see the two-year view?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Listen, for me, two things. First of all when I take over as CEO would be a good time for me to kind of answer that question number one. Number two, today we're focused on making sure you've got a clear view of what we believe for 2008. And as we've tried to describe and I think JP has described very clearly there are a lot of swing factors in 2008, what we are guiding here is what we think is the realistic estimate of what is likely to happen this year based on what we know today. Swing factors will go one way or the other during the rest of the year.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, it's Andrew Colson at Redburn. Just trying to understand operating cost items better in 2008. The guidance to my mind implies quite a big contraction in the operating margin despite some cost savings coming through maybe adding 2% to the operating margin. And you said maybe the R&amp;D ratio stays the same, other operating income probably stays the same in absolute terms. Cost of goods obviously gets worse which leaves, but not to the extent that would explain the underlying margin decline that you've been talking about. So should we be assuming that SG&amp;A is going up a lot or that was something that Julian didn't talk about in terms of guidance on cost lines items I noticed.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah we're not, in terms of cost of goods I think we're not giving specific guidance on cost of goods but I think the quarter four cost of goods excluding one-off items is a good sort of starting point in terms of determining what they might be for 2008. In terms of SG&amp;A and R&amp;D, clearly R&amp;D is going to be driven by the progress we make in the pipeline, in terms of SG&amp;A, we have a strategy to bring down SG&amp;A at the same time our bottom line focus is on maximizing the earnings per share, given all the other constraints around us. So for example, if by investing in more sales force we can boost a product and make profit from it, we're not constrained by the fact that we've got particular guidance around a particular cost line in the P&amp;L. So in terms of SG&amp;A and R&amp;D cost, they're output is based on what we need to do, rest assured, for what we need to do we aim to do it as efficiently as possible. We are not giving specific guidance around those two areas. Other operating income as I said, is broadly in line with 2007.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much JP. It's Matthew Weston from Lehman Brothers. Three quick financial questions, if I could and then one bigger picture one for Andrew and JP. On the financials, could you just split pandemic flu up ex-U.S. and U.S. so we can see where the demand has been? Also the guidance on other operating income being flat year-on-year, this year if I recall it had about 220 million sterling of product divestiture income in there &#x2013; should we also anticipate a similar element of product divestitures or is it the royalty element of that line which is going to grow in 2008?</p>
          <p>And finally if you could just give us very quick guidance on were you see the tax rate going for 2008 I would be grateful. And then finally on the big picture question, one thing that both JP and Andrew have made clear is that the future of line extensions is going to be a little bit more difficult in an environment where payer power is stronger, and clearly that's been a very key strength of GSK over the last handful of years. And another key strength of GSK has clearly been Advair which has been a tremendous success under JP's sort of tenure at the firm. If I look at Andrew's next tenure then the beyond Advair program becomes a very big element of the future potential of GSK in terms of maintaining that franchise. And I would be very interested in terms of whether or not we should see that basically as a line extension because one of the things you have said you're aiming for is once daily. And quite frankly if I am a payer do I really care about once daily anymore? Or should we really see that as a real key therapeutic shift in terms of asthma and COPD which is really likely to take GSK forward into the next decade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good questions.  Let me just take one and a half and then I will pass it on to Julian for the other two.  The one in the middle, if you look at other operating income, there's a very easy answer to that one.  We are going to grow royalties because a bunch, a big part of those royalties come from Gardasil.  And I think Gardasil is going to grow big time next year as well, I mean in '08 as well.  So you know that royalty line is going to take a bigger share of operating income and I think it's fair to say that we have been somewhat conservative on the rest of operating income saying well we will sell fewer products and so forth but it gives us a little bit of room, wiggling room, it's not huge, but clearly this is what the makeup of this line is.  So if you do your forecast on Gardasil you fill in the rest, you will see that there might be a little bit of room here.</p>
          <p>On the last question, remember one thing, Advair is not going off the cliff and disappear overnight because of the regulation in the U.S. do not allow automatic substitutions for similar products.  So we will have more time as we launch Horizon, we will have more time to manage the decline of Advair because there will be branded basically generics coming in, but they won't get any break from the automatic substitution.  And as we have seen in the U.S. market that's, you know, those inroads are fairly, you know, modest.  Now there will be, we are actually counting on those inroads to be more important then they would have been five years ago simply because payers are going to play us against the generic and we are going to have to give up some price concessions and so forth.  But I think there is, the market is going to be more stable when we introduce Horizon, we are not going to face the abyss and then try to build it up from zero.</p>
          <p>And I think we are going to have to be clever on the pricing and on the claims.  You have to &#x2013; you're right, the extent of differentiation will vary with the kind of studies we have done and I think Andrew mentioned specifically we want R&amp;D to deliver products that sell to the payer.  So we are not going to go there and be, you know, like a deer in a headlight and be very surprised if the payers say well, it's marginally better, so I will give you a little bit more than the generics, but I don't want to put you on the formulary without, you know, some significant concession of some kind.  So I think it's more in a matter of how we sell it and how we develop the drug and what kind of advantages we have.</p>
          <p>And I also want to remind you that, yes, line extensions are going away, there is no question.  But they still are meaningful and I would say that it's all in the eyes of the beholder.  If you present Horizon as a line extension it will be perceived as a line extension.  We have no intention of doing so.  So I think they are different molecules, they don't really fall into that category as strictly as you presented it.</p>
          <p>On the pipeline, you're absolutely right, the reason GSK got good at line extension in the last 10 years, we had nothing else.  It's a simple answer.  We were not that clever, we just said what do we have? We had two drugs in Phase III, one died within weeks of my appointment as CEO.  So you know it was not too hard to say well what can we do, and that's when we decided to really push Advair which we thought had long legs in the marketplace. Many people disagreed with us, but we've proved them wrong and then to develop as many line extensions as we could so at least we could soft land some of the patent expirations and it's still working today.  But if you look at the value of our pipeline going forward, line extension are a fraction of the value, a small fraction of the value. The big value frankly is vaccines number one, then everything else.  So I don't think there is, you know, I think that we are in the right place in terms of positioning. Coming back to some of the questions on the funds.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I mean we're not disclosing what proportion flu pandemic was of our total influenza vaccine sales.  And I think JP sums it up in terms of other operating income, the quality of other operating income, i.e. the royalty element is improving.  Improved in '07 versus '06, I think it will improve in '08 versus '07.  Tax rate, slightly higher than the tax rate in 2007.  Andrew you want to add to...</p>

          <p>The only think I would add, Matthew, on the post-Advair scenario is Horizon isn't one product, right? And our respiratory future isn't about having just simply one product developed for a post-Advair environment, and I think that's an important thing just to keep in the back of your mind.</p>

          <p>Thanks JP. It's Craig Maxwell, JPMorgan.  We've got an industry going through a period of substantial change and obviously cost savings is a lot of what we're looking at.  You got a lot of questions on that.  I think from the FDA angle it would really help us if there is any more color you can give us on the understanding.  You've dropped the margin 35% down to 28 and that's incredibly impressive.  That's also got sales growth in there as well despite the patent expiries you've overall sales growth.  So as an absolute my feeling is it's probably fairly flat on those lines but just understanding, are you in absolute terms decreasing the sales force, absolute terms decreasing advertising, head office, procurement?  Where are the lines these benefits are coming from?  And on the new selling models, can you actually give us &#x2013; I know you don't want to give away anything competitive but do you have any feel for how you can sell on the new models, is it lower cost stuff or is it more efficient?  And then one just last question, sorry I have to ask this one, on clarification on the LpPLA2 and the APP did that image study meet the late factor deadline on Jan the 7th or was it cut from &#x2013; just didn't make the cut on the late breakers?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, late breaking, just to take that one first, they want products which are very late stage.  So we had a difficult case to present in the first place and we came in a little late.  So it's a combination of two things.  And frankly, we would rather go through &#x2013; honestly, we think that going through a major publication is probably a better way to give those moves. So you can't read anything in what I said because I can't tell you, as I have said, the full database has not been publicized even within the company. They are still playing with it, some of our scientists have some part of it but I am not tempted to give you the right or the wrong body language because I really don't know what the bottom line is on the product yet.  I'd like to pass it maybe do you want to comment on SG&amp;A and...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure, there is not much more we can add, Craig, to what I've already said.  But we are in terms of the sales force efficiency, yes, we are running new sales force models that are driving efficiencies out in terms of number of salespeople, and that's one of the key elements of saving in the overall operational excellence program that we announced.  So we are being cleverer at how we use our sales force and that doesn't mean less salesmen as a result of that program.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as always, I think for you forecast for '08.  You have to worry about the sales line to get that right, that's the hard part.  On SG&amp;A, don't forget we have two divisions, we have consumer and we have pharma.  Consumer was way up in SG&amp;A this year because of the launch of alli.  So you really are better off splitting the two before you do the forecast <mark type="inaudible" />. Do you want to make an additional comment on sales force.  I think it's a bit early to draw definitive conclusions.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean we have piloted these things, and again, in some ways, the model that's changing is really how you deploy them.  We haven't changed as much yet what happens when a rep is in front of a physician.  And because there is still a lot of education, we are doing lots of things like lots of other people in terms of e-detailing and everything else, but I don't see any revolution really taking place in that sphere.  There is an awful lot of cost savings around field force. I can tell you when we look at things like benchmarking our cost per meeting, doing a lot more web-based training so we've been able to dramatically increase the amount of time we spend in the field, that's about 20% in the last two years.  So there is an awful lot of effectiveness and cost around operating the field force.  Really the same thing is on the AMP lines, I mean we have just take an extremely disciplined look to really understand what is driving. And the mentality often in our industry is just throw more at it, just throw everything but the kitchen sink at it to make it grow.  And it's sometimes quite honestly difficult when you're with partners and you've got people who come from other companies, and just want to throw more at it.  But if you ask people out there who gets the better deals from ad agencies, who is spending more effectively. I've got a promotional warehouse.  Five years days ago, somebody came to me and said we need to rent another one because this thing was so full. Now we are actually leasing space out of that same warehouse on a much bigger sales base.  So this is something that we keep &#x2013; take very seriously.  And I would agree with Andrew. I think this is something that you constantly chip away at and no part of the company is sacrosanct here, we're looking at cost savings absolutely everywhere.</p>
