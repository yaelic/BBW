        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and welcome to the presentation of Scotiabank's Second Quarter Results. I'm Sean McGuckin, Chief Financial Officer. Rick Waugh, our CEO, will lead off with the highlights of the second quarter. Next, I will go over the second quarter financial results, including a review of business line performance. Rob Pitfield, our Chief Risk Officer, will then discuss credit quality and market risk. Rob will be followed by our business line heads, each of whom will provide an outlook for their business for the remainder of 2012. We will then be glad to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to refer you to slide number two of our presentation, which contains Scotiabank's caution regarding forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Over to you, Rick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sean. We are pleased to announce another strong quarter. Scotiabank generated net income of $1.46 billion. This represents growth of 16% excluding the acquisition related gains and the IFRS-related foreign exchange gains in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share were $1.15 for the quarter, up 8% year over year excluding the aforementioned gains. Return on equity remained strong at 18.6%. Revenue was a record this quarter, growing by more than 10%. The strong performance this quarter demonstrates the results of our continued focus on our ongoing revenue and cost containment initiatives and acquisitions in high-growth markets.</p>
          <p>The credit environment continues to be benign this quarter as evidenced by the continued steady improvement in loan loss provisions. Our industry-leading productivity ratio remained stable at 53.7%. Expense management remains an ongoing priority. This quarter, excluding the nonrecurring gains, we delivered positive operating leverage.</p>
          <p>Our capital ratios remain strong. With our solid and consistent internal capital generation and our recent issuance of common shares to fund acquisitions, our Tier 1 and tangible common equity ratios increased significantly this quarter. As well, we remain confident of exceeding the minimum Canadian regulatory expectations of Basel III, which are well above the international Basel III requirements, by the first quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>Last week, we announced the sale of our Scotia Plaza office complex here in Toronto. We were the last of the major Canadian banks to own our own head office building. But this asset is not core to our banking business and is a source of funding and capital to finance our growth. The sale is expected to close on June 20 and the ongoing impact of our operating earnings is not material. We will provide further details on the financial impact of this transaction when the deal closes.</p>
          <p>The strong performance this quarter from all our business lines continuously show the underlying strength of our diversified operating model. Canadian Banking had a strong quarter and saw solid growth in residential mortgages, automotive and commercial lending. Year-to-date revenues are up a solid 3.5% with net income up 13.5% as a result of very good expense management in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>International Banking had solid net income this quarter with diversified loan and deposit growth. This quarter also includes our most recent acquisition in Colombia, Banco Colpatria. Year-to-date, revenues are up strongly at 20% and net income is up 15%, reflecting our investments in higher growth markets in Latin America and in Asia.</p>
          <p>In Global Wealth Management, earnings this quarter were driven by a solid performance in our Canadian mutual fund business. Year-to-date, revenues increased 18% with net income up 24%, demonstrating the continued strength to both our wealth management and insurance businesses. Also, DundeeWealth continues to contribute to the solid bottom line growth.</p>
          <p>And finally, Global Banking and Markets reported a very good quarter due to stronger capital market revenues in our precious metals, our equities and our energy businesses. Year-to-date, revenues increased 3% from a very strong first half in 2011 and continues to show the strength again of diversified along our product lines and our geographies and our client-driven focus. However, net income did decline 2% mainly due to a lower effective income tax rate.</p>
          <p>So based on this good performance in the first half of the year, we are confident of achieving our financial objectives for 2012.</p>
          <p>And with that now, back to Sean.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rick. Slide seven shows our key financial performance metrics for the quarter. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.15, an increase of 8% excluding acquisition-related gains and IFRS-related foreign exchange gains from last year and up 3% over the first quarter, excluding the Calgary real estate gain in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at year-over-year changes, Q2 earnings benefited from the contribution from acquisitions, particularly, Banco Colpatria, as well as the higher margin and solid volume growth, stronger trading revenues and growth in transaction-based banking fees.</p>
          <p>Partly offsetting were higher operating expenses, mainly from acquisitions as well as a higher effective income tax rate and a lower net gain on investment securities. The provision for credit losses was $264 million this quarter, down $6 million from last year, reflecting lower provisions in Canadian Banking and global Banking and Markets, partially offset by higher provisions in International Banking.</p>
          <p>Moving to revenues on slide eight. Revenues during the quarter were a record at just under $4.8 billion, representing growth of more than 10%, excluding the aforementioned gains last year. The year-over-year increase reflects higher net interest income, which increased due to the impact of acquisitions and organic asset growth. The core banking margin increased seven basis points year over year mainly from recent acquisitions with higher spread business partly offset by higher volumes of lower-yielding deposits with banks.</p>
          <p>Non-interest revenues increased modestly from last year, excluding acquisition-related gains due to the increased banking fees and higher capital markets revenue mainly in the precious metals, energy and equity businesses.</p>
          <p>Quarter over quarter, net interest income increased 4% from higher margins from recent acquisitions and business lending asset growth, partly offset by two less days in the quarter. Non-interest revenues declined slightly quarter over quarter due mainly to the gain on the sale of the Calgary real estate asset in the prior quarter, though this was mostly offset by the impact of acquisitions and the increased contribution from Thanachart Bank in Thailand.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide nine, non-interest expenses were up $170 million or 7% from last year. Acquisitions accounted for $149 million or over 80% of this increase. Underlying expense growth year over year was mainly due to higher staffing levels as well as increased premises and technology costs. Excluding last year's gains, operating leverage was quite strong at 3.5% year over year.</p>
          <p>Compared to the prior quarter, expenses were up slightly due to acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, there were reductions in most expense categories. Operating leverage was also positive excluding the real estate gain in the prior quarter. Expense management remains an ongoing priority and we are well on track to deliver positive operating leverage in 2012.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital on slide 10. You can see that the bank continues to maintain a strong, high quality capital position. Both the Tier 1 and tangible common equity ratios increased significantly this quarter to 12.2% and 9.4%, respectively, due to the share issuance and strong levels of internally generated capital.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we successfully completed a public offering of common equity for gross proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion to fund recently closed in previously announced acquisitions. Our capital ratios remain strong by international standards. We will continue to prudently manage capital to support organic growth initiatives, selective acquisitions and evolving regulatory changes. The Bank remains committed to our previous guidance of achieving a fully accelerated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 7% to 7.5% by the first quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>Turning to the business line results beginning on slide 11. Canadian Banking had a strong quarter. Net income was $461 million, up $87 million or 23% from a year earlier. Revenue growth was solid with growth in net interest income and net fee and commission revenues, up 6% and 4%, respectively. Although the margin decline slightly year over year by two basis points, net interest income was up as a result of solid volume growth in residential mortgages, automotive lending and commercial loans. There's also improved credit performance with loan loss provisions down $26 million.</p>
          <p>Expense management initiatives were also evident this quarter with expenses virtually flat from last year. Quarter over quarter, assets increased 1% mainly from continued growth in retail mortgages and consumer auto loans. Total revenue declined 2% due to two fewer days in the quarter and a one-basis-point decline in the margin.</p>
          <p>The provision for credit losses declined $16 million to $120 million with lower provisions in both retail and commercial. Expenses were essentially flat compared to last quarter reflecting the impact of a shorter quarter and seasonally higher expenses in the previous quarter offset by higher pension costs.</p>
          <p>Moving to International Banking on slide 12. Net income in the second quarter was $448 million, up from $368 million a year ago, excluding an acquisition-related gain. A significant portion of the increase was due to the acquisition of Banco Colpatria in Colombia. Approximately $31 million of these earnings are deducted in the non-controlling interest line. Year over year, revenues increased 27% due to strong diversified loan and deposit growth, the positive impact of acquisitions, as well as wider margins. Net fee and commission revenues were boosted by the contribution from acquisitions, as well as good transaction fee growth, particularly in Peru and the Caribbean.</p>
          <p>Expenses were up 32%, or $224 million, with almost two-thirds attributable to acquisitions. The remainder of the increase was mainly due to inflationary increases and investments in growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>Quarter over quarter, net income was up 15%, largely due to the Colpatria acquisition and the higher contribution from Asia-Pacific. Loan loss provisions increased $21 million from last quarter, primarily from higher commercial provisions in the Caribbean and Central America region. Expenses were up 10% from the previous quarter due entirely to acquisitions and seasonality reflecting careful expense control.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, Global Wealth Management's net income for the quarter was $298 million. Excluding an acquisition-related gain, revenues increased 6% year over year driven by strong growth in global insurance and solid results in asset management. Assets under management and assets under administration grew 3% and 2%, respectively. Of the total revenue, approximately 84% was attributable to wealth management and 16% to insurance businesses.</p>
          <p>Expenses declined 3% from the same quarter last year due mainly to one-time DundeeWealth costs incurred in 2011 and benefits realized from the integration of DundeeWealth operations.</p>
          <p>Quarter over quarter, net income increased by 3% due to growth in global asset management and wealth distribution revenues, partially offset by lower earnings in global insurance, which benefited from a reserve release the prior quarter. AUM and AUA grew by 3% and 2%, respectively. Expenses were up 6% due to growth in volume-related expenses and technology costs.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 14, Global Banking and Markets recorded very strong net income of $387 million. Year over year, revenue increased due to higher capital markets revenue in precious metals, equities and energy businesses, partly offset by declining revenues in fixed income.</p>
          <p>Provisions for credit losses were a net recovery of $1 million compared to provisions of $11 million a year earlier. Expenses were 5% lower than last year, reflecting lower legal expenses and lower remuneration costs. A reduction in expenses reflects cost management initiatives implemented this year.</p>
          <p>Quarter over quarter, net income increased 24% due to higher equities revenues and higher revenues from U.S. and Canadian lending businesses. Expenses declined by 6% from last quarter primarily due to lower stock-based compensation.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the Other segment on slide 15, which incorporates the results of Group Treasury, smaller operating units and certain corporate adjustments. The Other segment reported a net loss of $134 million this quarter. This segment was impacted by $34 million impairment losses on investment securities and a $25 million offset to revenues recorded in Global Banking and Markets and Global Wealth Management related to Scotiabank's common share offering in February.</p>
          <p>This concludes my review of our financial results. I'll now turn it over to Rob, who will discuss risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sean. The risk in our credit portfolios continues to be well managed and we continue to see a steady improvement in the quality of our loan portfolios. Our provisions for credit losses improved again this quarter down $6 million year over year and $1 million quarter over quarter to $264 million.</p>
          <p>Our net impaired loan formations were $405 million, an increase from the prior quarter principally due to two accounts. Our exposures to certain European countries of concern, namely, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, are not significant and have declined from the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Our market risk remained low and well controlled. Our one-day average VaR was $18.3 million versus $17.5 million in the prior quarter. There was one loss day in the second quarter compared to two in the previous quarter, reflecting lower volatility in capital markets. The one loss day was well within the range predicted by VaR.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 shows the trend in provisions over the past five quarters. As you can see, provisions have declined in the Canadian Banking portfolios year over year and quarter over quarter. The lower provisions were broad-based across the majority of Canadian Banking's retail and commercial businesses. Our Canadian retail portfolio remains extremely high quality with 93% of assets secured and relatively low exposure to unsecured loans and credit cards.</p>
          <p>International retail provisions increased $33 million year-over-year mainly due to higher retail provisions in Peru as well as the recent acquisitions in Uruguay and Colombia, partially offset by lower retail provisions in Mexico and the Caribbean. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects higher levels of provisioning in the Caribbean.</p>
          <p>International commercial provisions increased to $12 million due primarily to higher provisions in the Caribbean.</p>
          <p>Global Banking and Markets had net recoveries of $1 million, as net recoveries in Canada were partially offset by higher net provisions related to the two accounts in the United States.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 shows our Canadian Banking residential mortgage portfolio. Our total portfolio of residential retail mortgages is $149 billion, of which $136 billion is related to freehold properties and $13 billion related to condominiums. As you can see from the slide, approximately 56% of the portfolio is insured, and 44% is uninsured. The uninsured portion has an average loan-to-value ratio of approximately 56%. We believe that the solid economic fundamentals will enable the Canadian market to remain healthy and adjust without the bubble-bust scenario that occurred in the United States.</p>
          <p>The continued low interest rate environment and reasonable economic performance will enable consumers to manage debt levels well. Credit quality and performance of the portfolio remains strong. Our disciplined underwriting standards to all of our origination channels have resulted in extremely low loan losses.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 20, our Canadian high-rise condo development exposure is relatively small at $610 million. The majority of this exposure is to established, well-known Tier 1 developers with significant experience in building and selling high-rise condos. We have long-term relationships with them and have strong covenants and underwriting standards. It is a high-quality portfolio and we have had virtually no losses in the past 15 years.</p>
          <p>To summarize our slide on 21, our asset quality remained strong with the retail and commercial portfolios stable and our corporate portfolio is performing exceptionally well. A combination of growth in portfolios, acquisitions and product mix will result in a natural rise in provisions over coming quarters. We expect Canadian retail provisions to remain stable and International retail provisions to grow due to acquisitions and growth in the portfolio. We expect corporate and commercial provisions to remain modest.</p>
          <p>And that concludes my comments on risk and I'll turn it over to Anatol.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Rob. As Sean discussed, Canadian Banking had another strong quarter with net income of $461 million. We have remained focused on deposits, payments, and wealth management referrals and we've grown each gaining market share in mutual funds and realizing double digit account growth in cards.</p>
          <p>We continue to report positive operating leverage on a year-over-year and year-to-date basis. In retail, we expect to see continued healthy asset growth primarily in fixed rate residential mortgages and in consumer auto. Deposit growth will remain a challenge due to the persistent low interest rate environment and competition for regulatory qualifying liquidity. However, we feel that the success of our 'Richness Is' and other campaigns have positioned us favorably in the market.</p>
          <p>We have experienced solid asset growth in automotive lending on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. As I mentioned, going forward, we expect this to continue. Small business deposits continue to grow, but the rate of growth had slowed somewhat from prior periods reflecting intensified competition in this segment.</p>
          <p>Turning to commercial banking, we've had very strong year-over-year growth in assets and deposits. Our pipeline remains strong as we continue to focus on targeting initiatives in key industries and on further leveraging synergies between core commercial banking teams and our specialty teams.</p>
          <p>Our partnership with Global Transaction Banking has generated excellent growth in deposits and we expect this growth to continue. We expect the margin to remain relatively steady as the sale of new mortgages continues to be predominantly in fixed-rate mortgages, a higher-yield product as opposed to variable-rate mortgages.</p>
          <p>Somewhat offsetting this, spreads on deposits remain under pressure reflecting competition. Retail delinquencies have continued to slow and steady decline and recoveries continue to trend favorably as well. Many of our retail portfolios, we have returned to pre-recession delinquency levels. Recent stress testing results demonstrate our ability to withstand severe shocks in the housing market.</p>
          <p>Overall, we expect Retail and small business PCLs to remain stable for the remainder of the year and likely close the yearend with a year-over-year decline. Commercial PCLs have also improved, but can vary from quarter to quarter. However, the current outlook for the balance of the year is for commercial PCLs to be relatively stable.</p>
          <p>Cost containment has been excellent with expenses nearly flat quarter over quarter and year over year, but they are likely to increase somewhat going forward, reflecting seasonal spending patterns and more days in the quarter. In all, Q2 was another excellent quarter and we're optimistic about the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Earlier this year, I told you we were committed to delivering positive operating leverage and we feel confident about our ability to continue to do so.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it over to Brian.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Anatol. International Banking had another good quarter. Our well diversified platform delivered solid results as we continue to realize the benefits from higher growth markets in Latin America and Asia. We had good momentum on loan and deposit growth and we expect this momentum to continue.</p>
          <p>From a regional perspective, in Latin America, we delivered strong earnings, most notably in Mexico and Peru. Asset and deposit growth remains strong in all markets and economic fundamentals remain favorable.</p>
          <p>This quarter also included the results from our most recent acquisition, Banco Colpatria in Colombia. Our outlook for the balance of the year remains positive for the Lat-Am region.</p>
          <p>In the Caribbean and Central America, our results reflected continuing slower growth in the Caribbean economies. In Central America, we experienced solid growth, particularly in Panama and Costa Rica. We continue to manage the region closely and expect more of the same for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>In Asia, our core lending portfolios continue to perform well. As noted last quarter, the results from our investment in Thanachart Bank are now benefiting from the post-flood recovery and we expect this trend to continue over the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>On the commercial banking side, our businesses across all markets are performing well with strong loan and deposit growth reflecting the key growth initiatives we implemented over the past 18 months. Looking ahead, we continue to have a healthy sales pipeline.</p>
          <p>On the retail banking side, our efforts to improve sales productivity and enhance our distribution channels are showing encouraging results. For example, without the benefit of Banco Colpatria, we had strong year-over-year loan growth of 7%. Origination levels for personal loan products are strong and we expect that pattern to continue for the balance of the year. We continued our sharp focus on expense management and we are on track for delivering positive operating leverage this year.</p>
          <p>In summary, International Banking had a good first half. We are expecting a solid second half based on good momentum in our underlying businesses and from the benefits from our Banco Colpatria acquisition.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Chris.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Brian. Our outlook for Global Wealth Management is for a good organic growth. This outlook may be impacted by the current uncertainty in the markets. Growth in our global insurance business remain strong with the addition of new offerings with acceptable risk profile diversifying our product range. For example, we expanded distribution of our new ScotiaLife Travel Insurance program to the retail bank channel and launched new products in the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands.</p>
          <p>As we have discussed before, we are in a multi-year strategy of leveraging the Bank's significant distribution networks and deepening collaboration with our partners in other bank channels. We are pleased with our progress to date and our improved cross-sell of insurance. Insurance is a highly complementary business to our Wealth platforms and growth should be sustainable.</p>
          <p>In our Wealth businesses, we have a strong base of assets under management and assets under administration to drive our top line. We have significant strengths in both asset management and in the breadth and depth of our distribution channels. Based on the most recent IFIC data, we gained market share for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Net sales in Canadian mutual funds have more than offset market declines over the past year and expectations or that sales momentum will continue. This past quarter we had combined net sales of $1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Our relationship with our partners in Canadian and International Banking continues to be a key source of competitive advantage in driving our sales momentum. We continue to leverage our asset management bench strength with a focus on product innovation. We launched eight new funds across our Canadian and International channels this past quarter.</p>
          <p>In our Wealth distribution businesses, we are seeing good growth in our Canadian private banking business and International wealth businesses. And we continue to invest in our technology and operating platforms to drive efficiencies and create greater capacity for growth.</p>
          <p>We recently completed the consolidation of our online brokerage platforms under a single Scotia iTRADE brand and launched the new trading platform and public website with significant new features and benefits. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of DundeeWealth and the integration continues to capture both revenue and cost synergies and is progressing well. Our investment in CI continues to be an important strategic investment for us and we're also pleased with its ongoing performance. Finally, we remain vigilant on expense management and generating positive operating leverage for the year.</p>
          <p>In summary, we are watching the economic and market environment closely. Despite the ongoing pressure facing markets, which will impact all participants in the wealth sector, we believe our diversified business model will continue to deliver good results in 2012.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now pass it over to Steve.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Chris. Global Banking and Markets had another strong quarter. This quarter ranks among the best performances ever for our wholesale operations. Solid results were diversified across all of our business platforms and geographic footprints. In addition to ScotiaMocatta achieving two consecutive record quarters we experienced strong results in our equities business, our investment banking business and our U.S. and Canada corporate banking businesses. Results in fixed income and energy kept pace with the strong levels set in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of Howard Weil this quarter expands our product footprint in the energy sector and also grows our equity sales, trading and research capabilities in the U.S. as well we continue to focus on growing our global wholesale banking platform especially in Latin America and Asia.</p>
          <p>Market headwinds are expected to persist due to global uncertainty as well the summer months often shows cyclically lower levels of activity in the capital markets businesses. We do not expect revenues in these businesses to remain at current levels.</p>
          <p>The pipeline for investment banking and advisory revenues for the second half is fairly robust, but in the absence of a pickup in M&amp;A activity, the low level of activity in lending markets suggest some challenges for loan underwriting fees. Average assets continue to show steady growth, mainly in support of our Global Capital Markets platforms. This is in line with our expectations and we continue to maintain our discipline to limit risk exposures and to optimize capital usage.</p>
          <p>Loan volumes have shown modest increases and we expect this trend to continue. Loan spreads have remained very stable over the past few quarters despite competitive pressures and we do not expect this to change significantly. The credit quality of our loan portfolio remains strong. And while we do not expect ongoing net recoveries, we do expect PCL to remain modest going forward.</p>
          <p>Cost management continues to be a priority and our cost savings initiatives will help us maintain positive operating leverage and our strong productivity ratio. Overall, with our diversified geographic and product mix, we expect to deliver solid results and remain well-positioned to benefit as opportunities arise over the second half.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it back to Sean.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks. Just a first question on your European exposure. There's a big jump in deposits with UK and German banks. Give us a little color what's driving that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a combination of two things, Peter. One, just liquidity management and two, natural customer cash flows. Those cash flows can tend to go up and down there. They were at a high point and those lines have come down. But as you say, they're in the strongest areas of the European sector and we selected them on that basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, we're talking systemically important institution?</p>

          <p>Right. It's Mike Durland. They were in our Global prime finance business. There were a couple of transactions that occurred late in the quarter that caused a jump in those numbers. Those transactions were short-dated they matured in those positions and that come off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then a quick question for Chris. Just on the earnings growth and contribution outside Canada. Can you give us a sense of what percent contribution you're getting from your businesses outside Canada in your segment and then how much did those contribute to growth in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The contribution outside of Canada would be limited. From a wealth perspective, it represents about 6% to 7% of the earnings. For insurance, it would represent a larger amount. In terms of the mix of earnings, we still see significant opportunities to grow our business in Canada, overall, but we do expect insurance outside of Canada continue to grow. Insurance represents about 20% or 25% of the revenue for the business overall and the bottom line is slightly higher than that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. First on International, if I back out Colpatria, it looks like the expenses were up 11% year over year. Can you, Brian, let me know how you expect that to trend over the next several quarters?</p>
          <p>Then in the Other segment, we saw the NII swing quite substantially &#x2013; I don't have the number in front of me here, but on a quarter-over-quarter basis, it was a negative $145 million and I think it was around minus $90 million last quarter. I thought we'd see less swings like that because of the new fund transfer pricing methodology, but maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree there.</p>
          <p>And then, in your capital section, you talked about increased use of advanced models for RWA calculation by 2013-2014, I know it's quite early to be asking this, but any sense of what kind of benefit we would expect from that in terms of RWA reduction? Any help you can provide there would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Brian take International and then I'll take the next two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Gabriel, on expenses, I'd make two points. One, as you know, we've been going through a period of time where we've invested in our non-branch sales channels in terms of systems and processes, et cetera. That's largely over so we're left with the ongoing operating expenses largely staff of those initiatives. And those initiatives are certainly gaining traction as you can see from our loan growth on the retail front. I would say this quarter, Q2 is a little lighter on a seasonal basis and that just reflects the shorter quarter and the amount of holidays particularly in LatAm in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The other point I'd make is that we're managing head count aggressively. We're going through a process of branch consolidations in Chile, Central America and Mexico and reducing head count that way. So expenses again are our priority and we expect to produce positive operating leverage this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would we expect that to drop substantially or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to forecast expenses for you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we are going to have positive operating leverage as I said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with respect to the higher interest charge in the Other segments, about half of this increase came from the change in our consolidated funding profile. We've added a bit more longer-term funding, which hasn't been allocated out to the business lines yet. And the remainder is mainly from lower spreads and volumes in our short-term funding book and some minor refinements to our transfer pricing within the business line.</p>
          <p>With respect to the note, we made about moving some of our books further into the advanced internals rating based approach, those relate primarily to some smaller books in our International business primarily the Caribbean retail and Mexico the year after. We're still working through the numbers we haven't fully quantified it, but it may be a small hit to our risk weighted &#x2013; like an additional risk weighted asset as opposed to a reduction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes that's got part of it. That's part of it, that's driving that, just the higher loss experience in some of those books.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And just sorry on the &#x2013; so half of the change in the NII in the Other segment comes from you just haven't allocated the funding yet, is that...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We've had done some additional longer term funding in advance of some maturities later in the year. So that sits in the other.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Robert Sedran with CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. For Rob Pitfield first, on your slide 18, Rob, the international side for both the retail and commercial, I believe you said that the reason was the Caribbean for the increase. Is it actually getting worse in the region or is it just that things are not improving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, looking at International commercial, International commercial has been relatively pristine. It's got Caribbean loan portfolio, as you well know, that's soft and occasionally you get a bump in that portfolio and you saw it this quarter. And as far as International retail, Bahamas and Puerto Rico, a couple of islands have just &#x2013; they've been working through their NALs and their problem loans. It is more difficult in these countries, but on the other hand, its mortgages principally is secured and there's no overall trend up. It's just a work-through and it's taking longer than we forecasted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just add in as well. Due to the higher volume growth in International, as well from a loan loss experience standpoint, the loan loss experience is basically unchanged from a year ago and just up slightly from last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that true of the Caribbean as well, Sean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Caribbean is up a bit more than the rest of International. I was talking more about the broader International segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one quick point of clarification from Brian. You mentioned that Thailand was a positive contributor on the quarter and perhaps I was mistaken or maybe it bounced back faster than I thought it would, but I thought it might still be a drag. So is it recovering faster and is the recovery still a work-in-progress or are you happy that it's where it kind of it needs to be from a contribution perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's still a work-in-progress. We have all our branches open. When you go through one of these natural catastrophes, the first thing you see is revenues start to come back, but PCLs lag for a quarter or two. So we're starting to see the revenues come back so car loans, for instance, which is a big part of our business their volumes have returned to the late 2010 early 2011 levels. So that business is performing very well. We did have a recovery on a rather large commercial loan this quarter, which we had the benefit of that this quarter I wouldn't expect that next quarter, but business volumes are coming back and we would PCLs to start to edge off and will be back to normal in a quarter or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that a recovery of a noteworthy size to the segment, Brian, or is it just noteworthy to Thailand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just noteworthy to Thailand.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Michael Goldberg with Desjardins Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I have a few questions. So, first of all, I understand that the increase in International retail gross formation is largely due to loans in Uruguay. What is it about this portfolio causing the increase? And also with what it looks like a relatively small portion of loans in Colpatria secured will we see a higher level of formations and provisions out of Colombia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, it's Brian Porter. New formations in International retail were up $70 million this quarter that's driven by $30 million of mortgages, largely in the Caribbean and our coverage ratio quarter over quarter remains stable. So we're comfortable there. The other piece was $28 million driven by our consumer finance business in Chile and Peru, and provisions were up there and that's just a function, as Sean said, of earlier portfolio growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the overall run rate on Colpatria, yes, Colpatria will contribute a significant, normal, natural level of provisions going on into 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Michael, just, you should remember that Colpatria is a high-margin bank. The margins run around to 8%. Loan losses between the two businesses, retail and commercial, come at around 325, 350 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also, any change in your expectation of possible opportunities that might be created from distress in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly, acquisitions have been part of the International strategy for some time. We continue to look at opportunities as they arise. But I would say and we've emphasized this for the past two years, we see significant opportunity for organic growth on the platform and that's what we're focusing on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my last question, why is your financial reporting of your balance sheet different from your reporting to OSFI when there are no similar differences at other banks?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a question for Anatol on the deposits, Anatol, if have the numbers, it looks like you personal deposits actually went down in the quarter. Is that correct? And where are you seeing most of the competition on the deposit side and what are you kind of doing to address that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think on the deposit side, we've got the different categories. In small business, it's growing, in commercial, it's growing and on the retail side, it's staying relatively flat. The biggest thing is the shift that we've done with the focus that we've got in the Canadian bank is towards deposits and payments and referrals to Wealth Management.</p>
          <p>I think we've taken a number of steps to get the focus on to the deposits side. We're quite pleased with the steps that we've taken and the initial results in it. I think as we discussed last quarter, this is about taking a lot of small actions that will give us results over a longer period of time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But is there a specific area, Anatol, that you're seeing the competition on deposits? Is it three-year money, GIC, five year or is it demand deposit, where are you seeing the competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're seeing &#x2013; the very strong competition is both on GICs and in terms of checking accounts and savings accounts.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And when you get and when you have to go to the Treasury for funding, what rate approximately equivalent to GIC market do you get it at? Is it like a three-year GIC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, well it depends also as we've gone in towards matched maturity, it depends on the type of loans that we're making and the types &#x2013; the terms of the loans that we have. So, in essence it's matched.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. A couple of quick questions for Brian to start, please. Brian, can you give us the organic loan growth for consumer and commercial separately in International? And then by way of follow-up to some of what you said earlier, how many branch closures are you looking at doing over, say, the remainder of the year? And lastly, on the credit side, can you speak to the nature of the couple of accounts that were mentioned? Is this the Caribbean hotel portfolio coming up again or something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'll comment about the Caribbean hospitality portfolio and I've commented on a number of times over the past number of years. The portfolio, we continue to work the portfolio down. The last time I probably made a comment it was $1.25 billion. It's now $1.1 billion. The good news is we've had a number of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:52) in the last number of quarters where we've been able to sell properties or we've had equity injected in the properties.</p>
          <p>The other point I'd make is the Caribbean hospitality industry actually had a very good year. RevPAR was up 8% across the board. Occupancy's up. Average daily rate's up. So the Caribbean hospitality industry generally had had a very good year. So, look, we're just grinding it out. We've got a couple of residue properties that we're working on. Nothing out of the unusual and we thought it was prudent to take a provision as we continue to grind through it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the asset growth, the organic asset growth year over year in International, excluding Colpatria it's about 17%, of which about 11% is retail and about 20% is commercial and versus last quarter, if you exclude Colpatria, retail is up about 3% and commercial is up about 2%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Branch closures, they're not significant numbers in Mexico, it's a number between 15 and 17 branches; in Chile, it's a handful; in Costa Rica, particularly, it's another handful. But we just think it's prudent business given the direction of our customers these days.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, first over to Brian Porter. Brian, you updated some of the numbers for us in regards to Colpatria's net interest margin and loan loss outlook. Just revisiting some of your commentary from when this acquisition was announced last year, if the numbers are right, it was about $5 billion in loans, $1 billion of which were credit cards. So my question is as you've gotten to know this portfolio a little bit better, is there anything that's changed in terms of the businesses you're emphasizing versus Colpatria's legacy operations? In others words, were there some portions of the book that were a little bit risky for your taste and may not continue at the clip they were? I'm specifically thinking about the credit card business they had?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, on closing, the lending assets in the bank were $6 billion, which is roughly split 50/50 between retail and commercial. The retail book primarily consists of credit cards and mortgages. They've been quite innovative in terms of their credit card portfolio and actually we're learning some things about their arrangement with a utility and with a retailer in terms of the credit card business in Colpatria. So we're comfortable with the risk appetite and how they're executing on that business.</p>
          <p>I think the next page for us in terms of &#x2013; we've put some people into the Colpatria organization, the Chief Risk Officer, a Head of Operations, audit, those type of functions, but it will be to grow a higher-end commercial business and dovetail into the Global Banking and Markets business over time as that business grows in Colombia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the last two quarters on a reported basis, the net interest margin in your segment is up over 30 basis points. I think it's fair to say the bulk of that is Colpatria-related. Can I take from your comments that you're not significantly repositioning the portfolio such that we're going to see a drop off from where <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:05)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, margin's up 20 basis points this quarter and that's a benefit of Colpatria. If Colpatria wasn't in it that would be flat, but we're not repositioning the bank in terms of assets, we like the asset profile and the risk profile of the bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And over to Scotia Capital...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one other point I should have mentioned is that when you look at margins, one thing we should point out is that margins in Asia were up. They've been trending up. They were up significantly this quarter, where the benefit of that we see it in our trade finance, in our lending business there. But that's a function of European banks disappearing in terms of the lending market in Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're able to take loan yields higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then over to &#x2013; sorry, I called it Scotia Capital. It's called Global Banking and Markets now. So for Mike and Steve, a two-parter. On the negative side, it looks like there was at least a somewhat noticeable increase in gross impaired loan formation, something we haven't seen for this segment in a while. If you could you give me some color there on what you're seeing in terms of the loan loss? It doesn't sound like you're expecting provisions to increase materially, but we did see the formations higher.</p>
          <p>And then secondly on trading, pretty much flat from the Q1 number despite the fact conditions seemed to worsen as the quarter went on. Just wanted to get an update from you on whether this is related more to the global expansion you've had in the business or there was specific opportunities that you saw this quarter that worked out well? So that's it from me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, Steve to answer the first part of your question, Sumit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, we really have run with a very clean portfolio in Global Banking and Markets for some time now. So we took &#x2013; but we did take early action on one account in the U.S. that moved the numbers. And as you say also, we aren't anticipating big changes in our provisioning. So it is something that we've identified and we're going to work on it. And it's going to take us the better part of the year to &#x2013; it's going to probably involve a restructuring, but, again, our levels are very low and we're actually reasonably comfortable with this particular exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then more of a one-off rather than a trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Sumit. This is Rob. You know the overall portfolio in terms of NALs has gone down by an order of three to four times. So, this was just &#x2013; and in that trend, we've always said that there will be times where you'll get one-offs and bumps along the way and this is a bump along the way. It just happens to be a sizeable account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then for Mike, on the trading performance and outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure the &#x2013; obviously, we're very pleased with the second quarter. Second quarter was kind of a mirror image the way that the first quarter we started in sort of softer market conditions, they got better in the second half of the first quarter. Second quarter started out a little stronger and then got weaker through the quarter. But I see the job at hand right now to be to tailor the business to be as resilient as possible to market conditions. We think that this volatility is going to be around for a while and so we're keeping the risk levels very low. The business is very diversified. We've had very strong performance in the first two quarters from our commodities business. The Precious Metals business has done very well. We've been &#x2013; there's a small growth strategy in base metal, which is doing well. Energy is doing well. Both of the rates billed in both New York and London are doing very well. So, it's trying to get &#x2013; firing on as many cuylinders as possible and to make the business as resilient as we can to the volatility that we think is going to be around for a while.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brian Porter, a question for you. When I look at the International segment, I see what I would call a unit that's sort of in the early stages of its second phase of development. I would be expecting to see rates of return start to rise and rise quickly I would think at some point in time. I'm just wondering, are we seeing a bit of sort of a springboard here where the division's return could actually be suppressed by the last steps and it's going to start to rise? I was wonder if you could comment on where you envision those returns rising to, and over what sort of timeframe. And then just lastly if you can just comment on where you are charging yourself for your capital in thinking about your economic returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sean, will take the second part but I'll kick it off. I think it's important to note that the International division is &#x2013; it benefits by diversification and when Sean gave the numbers in terms of ex-Colpatria commercial loan growth being 20% this year, year over year, that's also with commercial assets declining in the Caribbean. And that's by design given our risk appetite and we haven't found a whole lot of good quality commercial loans to underwrite within our risk appetite. So we're benefited by diversification. Colombia is an important acquisition for us; it's a high growth market. As I said, we're really focused on organic growth and driving the opportunities within our platform. But you can't ignore the climate like today and there will be M&amp;A opportunities for us.</p>
          <p>We have executed on a number of transactions, we don't execute on everything; we're very discipline in our approach. But it's &#x2013; we've been focused on turning our operations around in Mexico, for example, Mexico produced an ROE of 18.5% all bank this quarter; we're very pleased with the growth in Mexico. We're not a big lender in the unsecured market in Mexico. So in a bull market, that affects the returns. But, look, we think we're well positioned to continue to grow the franchise on both an organic and an acquisition basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just with respect to the charge on capital, all business lines get allocated economic equity based on the risks that they assume in the business lines. And where we have acquisitions, goodwill and intangibles get charged dollar-for-dollar. So as you're building out a business line, as we have for International the last number of years, they have a higher capital charge upfront. But soon, those acquisitions turn into organic growth and over time, those returns drive up as they earn through that goodwill cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Brian, just a follow-up. You mentioned that Mexico was returning about an 18.5%. Your consolidated segment is around 12.5% annualized in the quarter. Is that to imply that there is some serious laggards here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colpatria has an impact on that and I would say that the other country from an operational standpoint that we're working on and we're making headway is Chile and that's a function of the goodwill we absorbed in Chile in the Desarrollo acquisition and we're building out our platform.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. For Chris Hodgson. Chris, looking at the revenue growth that you've experienced sequentially quarter over quarter very strong, particularly on the fee side, I was wondering if you can give us some sort of outlook in terms of the change that was undertaken on the mutual fund pricing in terms of capping the expenses and charging a fixed rate. Do you expect that to have any material impact on revenue growth or earnings in the near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer is no, John. I think that what we did is just do what other institutions have done since about 2005, which is cap our fixed admin fees. So, it's only a portion of the fee. We do believe that with the growth in the portfolio over time that we'll actually be able to grow revenue and <mark type="ph" /> NIAT (1:01:25) through this and also provide some transparency to the client and the advisor base.</p>
          <p>In terms of the growth in fee income, it largely came from our mutual fund portfolio early on in the quarter and then as the quarter changed from a market perspective, we saw a bit of a slow down in that fee income. This quarter we had less income coming into the insurance side and we actually expect that to pick up as the rest of the year goes on.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you. A question again going back into International Banking for a moment, my understanding in the shareholder report is that Colpatria has earned about $65 million of net income. And so when I take International's earnings, and I take Colpatria out, if I also strip out Mexico, which I understand are $83 million this quarter versus $64 million last quarter and then my final adjustment would be to take out the associated corporations, which should be $109 million this quarter versus $68 million, if I make those adjustments, everything else in International looks like it's down about 26% quarter over quarter. So where did I make my mistake in my math?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Probably for Rob Pitfield. You gave us enough information to go through Colpatria and understand the contribution to earnings and NII. I think either Rob or Brian, you made reference to PCLs losses of around 325 to 350 basis points eventually. Could you tell us what they were this quarter and over what time period do you expect to get to those losses of 325 to 350 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So they were around 265 basis points this quarter and they've been very low vis-&#xE0;-vis our plan and our forecast. You've had exceptional performance in corporate, you've had very low PCLs in international commercial, steady performance in Canadian retail and Canadian commercial. So, what we expect to see is that at some point in time you'll see corporate start to trend up in a natural way. You'll see International again revert to a normal number. And this is just natural planning. And then you will have Colpatria come on and you will have Uruguay come on fully and so when you add all those up, you're looking at a run rate that's you know at 325 to 350 basis points very naturally.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry just want to be clear. The 325 to 350 basis points, Brian, I think that you refer to that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that 325 to 350 basis points absolutely, it's around in terms of basis points it would &#x2013; we're at 31 basis point now, we've said that we're looking at a sort of 38 basis point overall. So, it would be between those two numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, I'm going to back up then for a second because I was just thinking what Brian Porter saying that losses in Colpatria would be roughly 325 to 350 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Rob's giving you an all bank number. Your question pertains to Colpatria. We fair valued the assets on acquisition, which was January 17. So, the loan loss as you see are $3 million are just the discrepancy between the fair value and what happened at the end of the quarter. You have to look at local results going forward, but loan losses in Colpatria will be around 325 to 350 points depending on the blend of business and the mix between commercial and retail in Colpatria.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, going back to my question, the losses this quarter would have been close to zero?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Zero, $3 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And that's that you'd expected to be something like $50 million on a quarterly basis going forward based on what you gave us and what I'm getting at is over what time period would you expect it to ramp up to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be about $40 million to $50 million and it should be somewhere in 2013.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then just one quick clarification, Sean, you said the consumer, organic growth consumer International what was that again 16% year-over-year?</p>
