          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the welcome to CIBC Fourth Quarter and Year End Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Ferren, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Ferren.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On our call this afternoon CIBC's Senior Management Team will review our Q4 results released earlier today. The call is being audio webcast and will be archived later this evening on cibc.com. In addition to the usual quarterly materials CIBC's 2008 full year consolidated financial statements and MD&amp;A are also available on our website, and our full annual accountability report will be available this coming Monday, December the 8th.</p>
          <p>Following the prepared remarks this afternoon, we will have time to take some of your questions. Before we begin let me remind you that any individual speaking on behalf of CIBC on today's call may make forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.</p>
          <p>Certain material factors or assumptions may be implied, which could cause CIBC's actual results in future periods to differ materially from the conclusions, forecasts or projections in these forward-looking statements. For more information please refer to the note about forward-looking statements in today's press release.</p>
          <p>With that let me now turn the meeting over to CIBC's President and Chief Executive Officer, Gerry McCaughey.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for joining us. Let me remind you that my remarks may contain forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially. Following my remarks, our senior officers will provide an update on their respective areas.</p>
          <p>CIBC has reported net income for the fourth quarter of $436 million and cash earnings per share of $1.09. Earnings, apart from the items of note that our Chief Financial Officer, David Williamson, will discuss shortly, were $1.57. CIBC's capital position is strong with all key measures higher than 12 months ago. Our Tier 1 ratio is 10.50 up from 9.7 at the end of last year &#x2013; this is among the strongest Tier 1 ratios of the major commercial banks in North America.</p>
          <p>Our total capital ratio is 15.4%, up from 13.9 at the end of last year. Our capital position is a key strength for CIBC providing a prudent cushion for industry conditions. Turning to our business results, CIBC Retail Markets reported net income of $523 million, revenue of 2.3 billion was down from a year ago primarily due to the large Visa gain in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Overall our Retail business continues to make progress. We are competing well in market share and have seen volume growth across key business areas. Our Retail Markets business has been strengthened by our corporate imperative of lower risk primarily in the area of unsecured lending.</p>
          <p>As you will recall from previous webcasts, we shifted our mix beginning in 2005 from unsecured to secured. While we have seen volume growth in the secured lending area, margins are lower thereby affecting our revenue.</p>
          <p>This change improved our risk posture and should hold us in good stead given the slowing economic conditions across the industry. Our latitude to continue investing in our core Retail business has increased due to exits this past year of non-core business areas including U.S. investment banking as well as U.S. and U.K. leveraged finance. Our core World Markets position will also be strengthened by this.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we will continue to invest across our Retail Markets business, particularly in our distribution network as well as our advisory and product capabilities in support of our clients. Sonia Baxendale will review Retail Markets business performance in more detail in her remarks.</p>
          <p>CIBC World Markets had reported earnings of 133 million before items of note. David Williamson will take you through the items of note and review the underlying earnings of World Markets in his remarks.</p>
          <p>World Markets continues to make progress and is better positioned heading into 2009 as a result of the actions taken in '07 and '08 to reduce risks and refocus the business on its core strengths. We are focused on core banking areas, taking advantage of voids in the market, building our banking franchise, clients relationships and aligning our focus more closely with our risk appetite. While the market backdrop will continue to be a factor, we expect further progress next year. Richard Nesbitt will comment further on World Markets in his remarks.</p>
          <p>Now let me comment on progress within our structured credit run-off business. In early October, we announced a 1.050 billion investment by Cerberus that reduced our exposure to potential declines in the value of our U.S. residential mortgage market positions. Through repayment of principal and regular amortization of the Cerberus investment, the value of our liability was reduced to U.S. $609 million as of October 31. The underlying assets had a fair value of U.S. 773 million at the end of October.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we also recognized a gain of U.S. 841 million on the reduction of an unfunded commitment through a variable funding note. We had accrued a large liability on this U.S. residential real estate structured position. That liability was reversed due to a default by another counterparty that resulted in our commitment being eliminated. This asset had been included in the collateral pool supporting the Cerberus financing transaction. However, this large gain accrued entirely to CIBC since we had structured the financing transaction to retain future value recoveries in the underlying portfolio for CIBC shareholders.</p>
          <p>In October, we also commuted our U.S. real estate market exposure with one of our financial guarantor counterparties, the counterparty we have previously identified as Roman numeral IV in our ongoing disclosure. We received cash consideration of U.S. $100 million which reflected a gain of U.S. 7 million on a current fair value of the position and a recovery of approximately 20% of the growth value of our mark-to-market claim against this financial guarantor. This transaction was accretive to our Tier 1 ratio by 10 basis points due to the impact of releasing risk-weighted assets on the financial guarantor receivable.</p>
          <p>Giving effect to these settlements and valuation adjustments recorded in Q4, we had U.S. $826 million of net receivables from guarantors related to U.S. real estate market as of October 31. These receivables have been reduced by U.S. 925 million this quarter through normal amortization of 27 million as well as writedowns and the exits of positions. As we have described on previous conference calls, CIBC has allocated significant risk-weighted assets against our financial guarantor receivables. This will mitigate any Tier 1 capital impact of ultimate losses taken on these positions. If we had recoveries of 15% from financial guarantors, there would be no further impact on our Tier 1 capital ratio even in the scenario where the value of our U.S. real estate market positions fell to zero. As I noted, we did settle one position with a counterparty for this quarter at a recovery rate of 20% for reference purposes.</p>
          <p>In our non-U.S. real estate portfolio hedged by financial guarantors, net receivables at October 31 were U.S. 1.1 billion. It is worth noting that similar to our U.S. real estate mortgage portfolio these receivables have been assigned risk weightings that would reduce any capital charge as a result of future valuation adjustments. The risk-weighted assets assigned as of October 31 to this position of financial guarantor receivables against our non-U.S. real estate portfolio were approximately U.S. 4 billion.</p>
          <p>If you were to apply the same assumptions that we outlined in the example we have provided in Q3 frequently asked questions on our website, the impacts on our Tier 1 ratio of writing-off the entire U.S. 1.1 billion of exposure would be approximately 50 basis points to our Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, notional amounts in the non-U.S. real estate mortgage portfolio were reduced through regular amortization of U.S. $84 million. We also adopted a new industry accounting guidance that permitted us to reclassify some of our CLO and trust preferred securities from trading to hold to maturity portfolios, and also change our valuation methodology for CLO positions that remain in our trading book. As a result, future volatility for these positions will be reduced. David Williamson will discuss these accounting changes in further detail in his presentation.</p>
          <p>In the area of productivity, we exceeded our 2008 expense target which was to hold expenses flat to the fourth quarter of 2006 on an annualized basis, excluding FirstCaribbean and our restructuring activities. We are maintaining the same expense target for 2009.</p>
          <p>Since last year, CIBC has undertaken a number of initiatives in terms of our business activities and organizational structure such as selling our U.S. investment banking operations, closing our U.S., European leveraged finance operations, managing the run-off of structured credit and focusing World Markets on four core business areas. We are now bringing our support functions at CIBC into alignment with this new business structure which has resulted in the severance accrual this quarter.</p>
          <p>In summary, 2008 was a period of challenge and change for the financial services industry. At CIBC, we continue to work towards all of our priorities. The gradual improvements in our results over the last three quarters has reinforced our commitment to these priorities and the actions we were taking. Although the world economic outlook is challenging, at this stage the Canadian economy appears to be somewhat less affected by the recent market uncertainty than many other countries. In light of this, CIBC's strong capital position and high concentration of business activities in Canada should allow us to make further progress in 2009.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the meeting over to David Williamson for his financial review. David?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gerry. Good afternoon, everyone. My comments also contain forward-looking statements and I would remind you that actual results could differ materially. I'm going to refer to the slides that are posted on our website starting with slide number five which is a summary of our results for the quarter.</p>
          <p>We reported earning per share for the fourth quarter of $1.06, or $1.09 per share on a cash basis. We had several items of note this quarter which are listed on the top right-hand side of the slide, totaling $0.48 cents per share, and therefore our cash earnings per share excluding these items is $1.57 per share.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1 capital ratio is strong and, as Gerry mentioned, finished the quarter at 10.5%. Growth in our Tier 1 ratio during Q4 is primarily due to positive earnings in the quarter of 37 basis points, a preferred share issuance generating 25 basis points, and slightly lower risk-weighted assets giving 5 basis points.</p>
          <p>Moving to the items of note, we had tax related items totaling $1.21 per share. This amount consists of a tax benefit of 486 million, or $1.27 per share relating to the previous Enron related litigation settlements. Events during the quarter which included discussions with third parties, the CRA, and our external legal counsel led us to change our best estimate of recovery. Also affecting the income tax line was a charge of 23 million or $0.06 cents per share from the recognition of unutilized tax losses at future year tax rates that are lower than current year statutory rates.</p>
          <p>The second item on the page is the $0.84 per share loss on structured credit run-off activities. I'll provide more detail on this topic in just a few moments.</p>
          <p>The next category of other mark-to-market gains and losses, valuation adjustments and writedowns of negative $0.31 per share includes the following five items: 242 million, or $0.43 per share of positive Q4 impact of the significant widening of credit spreads on our corporate loan hedging program. Next we had 177 million, or $0.28 per share of higher than normal losses and writedowns on our merchant banking and other investment portfolios driven by the current market conditions.</p>
          <p>We also had market valuation adjustments of 124 million, or $0.22 per share. This included 68 million of charges related to trading positions that we have put in run-off and have started to exit in the fourth quarter, and 56 million due to changes in valuation techniques within our continuing trading businesses.</p>
          <p>In addition to the credit valuation adjustments that we have in structured credit, we had valuation charges against credit exposures to derivative counterparties other than financial guarantors of 25 million or $0.04 per share. The methodology for calculating this non-financial guarantor CVA is now based on credit default swap spreads similar to our financial guarantor CVA. We believe that this will increase the volatility of future reported earnings, and may therefore continue to separately identify this item just as we do now for the impact of spreads on our corporate loan hedge program and financial guarantor CVA.</p>
          <p>Also included are other charges of 109 million or $0.20 per share including higher than normal operational losses, a charge of 39 million that we previously announced relating to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, and project asset write-offs due to the decision by the Canadian Payments Association to cancel the mandatory truncation and check imaging project.</p>
          <p>The next item on the slide results from the repatriation of capital from foreign subsidiaries. The impact is a pre-tax net gain of 112 million but an after-tax loss of 92 million or $0.24 per share. This repatriation only releases items that were previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income and therefore did not impact the Bank's equity or our Tier 1 capital ratio.</p>
          <p>We had higher than normal severance accruals of 122 million, or $0.21 per share as we continue to rightsize our business for changing markets conditions. And finally, we had losses related to leveraged leases of $51 million or $0.09 per share. For your reference we have a detailed list of our items of note this quarter on slide 46. Excluding these items of note, results were helped by higher volumes in Retail Markets as well as higher M&amp;A fees. But we were hurt by the challenging environment, higher loan losses in cards and lower spreads.</p>
          <p>The next slide provides a summarized statement of operations on a reported basis and shows how results were affected throughout the year by structured credit losses and other items of note.</p>
          <p>Turning now to a summary of our structured credit run-off for the quarter. Losses in Q4 totaled 479 million or $0.84 per share, versus 885 million or $1.56 per share in Q3. We took credit valuation adjustments in the quarter due to a further deterioration in the mark-to-market value of the underlying assets and the credit quality of financial guarantors, driving the 1.269 billion on the first line.</p>
          <p>The impact of the credit valuation adjustments was mitigated by a gain on the reduction of an unfunded commitment to a variable funding note, or VFN. The gain was driven by the bankruptcy in September of the guarantor of a related credit default swap which was held by the CDO. This triggered an event of default that led to a series of actions by the trustee under the indenture for the CDO resulting in the reduction of our unfunded commitment on the VFN to zero. Results were helped by 895 million or $1.58 per share relating to this gain.</p>
          <p>The other items of note including unhedged U.S. residential mortgage market writedowns, asset-backed commercial paper writedowns, expenses and other items total to a loss of 105 million or $0.18 per share.</p>
          <p>Slide eight is a summary of our financial guarantor protection purchased against our U.S. residential mortgage market exposure. In U.S. dollars, the slide shows that we have 3.8 billion of credit protection, which now has a fair value of 3.1 billion. It's important to recognize that this net remaining exposure of approximately 700 million is largely protected by the Cerberus transaction, which has an outstanding note with a fair value of 609 million at October 31.</p>
          <p>Turning to the protection that we have from financial guarantors against this fair value of 3.1 billion, we have taken credit valuation adjustment of 2.3 billion to date and therefore have a remaining net fair value of 826 million. However, we have already recognized a substantial level of risk-weighted assets against the financial guarantor receivables. And, therefore, in a hypothetical and unlikely scenario where the value of the U.S. residential mortgage market underlying shown on this slide went to zero and there are no recoveries at all from financial guarantors, the impact on our Tier 1 ratio would be approximately 40 basis points, assuming a tax rate of 33%. As Gerry mentioned, in a scenario where we recover say 15% from financial guarantors, there wouldn't be any further impact on our Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we deemed counterparties Roman numeral III and V to be no longer viable. Simultaneously we recorded additional valuation adjustments of 290 million in the quarter to write the net fair value down to our best estimate of net recovery. This amount is included in the total CVA for the quarter that I outlined in the previous slide.</p>
          <p>As Gerry mentioned, we also commuted our USRMM exposure with the counterparty we have identified as Roman numeral IV. We received cash consideration of U.S. $100 million which resulted in a small gain on the current fair value of the position, and an overall recovery of approximately 20% as the USRMM related total receivable with this counterparty.</p>
          <p>Slide nine outlines the counterparty protection provided by financial guarantors for the underlying assets or primarily CLOs and corporate debt that are not related to the U.S. residential mortgage market. The far right column shows the fair value protection with each counterparty which totals 2.6 billion at the end of Q4. Against this balance we have taken credit valuation adjustment of 1.5 billion in aggregate for a net fair value of 1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>In October, Canadian accounting standards were amended to permit reclassification of trading assets to held to maturity or available for sale under rare circumstances. We and other banks have concluded that recent market and liquidity conditions qualify as rare and have made certain reclassifications effective August 1.</p>
          <p>Consistent with the new rule, we transferred CLOs with a notional of U.S. 5.833 billion, and CDOs of trust preferred securities with a notional of U.S. 444 million into held to maturity which reflects our intention to hold these positions until they do mature. All transfers were done at fair value on August 1. Securities held in held to maturity amortize towards their par value over the term of their estimated life and will be subject to regular review for impairment. If there is impairment in the future, the losses will be taken through income.</p>
          <p>On September 30, the SEC Office of the Chief Accountant and FASB staff provided clarifications on fair value accounting in the current market environment. The guidance highlighted the need to consider all available data points including internal models in arriving at fair value. Consistent with this guidance and due to the inactive markets for CLO securities, when determining fair value we considered both the values provided by our internal model and indicative broker quotes rather than relying exclusively on indicative broker quotes as in previous quarters. The net impact of this change in approach to valuation was to increase revenue by 310 million as at August 1.</p>
          <p>Going forward, the introduction of models into the valuation of our CLO holdings and the transfer of our on-balance sheet cash CLO securities into held to maturity should reduce the earnings impact of shorter term market pressures which can mask underlying intrinsic value.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn to our business results, starting with Retail Markets. Our revenue was $2.29 billion for the quarter, and excluding the Visa gain reported in Q4 of last year, revenue was down $50 million or 2% from the prior year. Strong volume growth was offset by weaker equity markets, lower spreads and lower treasury revenue allocations. And the following slides have aggregated the Retail product lines so I can speak to the key drivers of retail banking, wealth management and FirstCaribbean revenue rather than the individual business units.</p>
          <p>Retail banking includes personal and small business banking, Imperial Service, mortgages and personal lending, and our cards business lines. This represents our core lending and deposit business lines.</p>
          <p>Retail banking revenue was 1.5 billion for the quarter. Excluding the Q4 Visa gain last year, revenue is relatively unchanged from the prior year. We experienced strong volume growth across all of our key Retail product groups. Retail banking spreads were down year-over-year due to our risk posture which continued our focus on secured versus unsecured lending, competitive pricing for deposits and GICs, and lower mortgage refinancing fees, partially offset by a wider prime-BA spreads and better mortgage pricing.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 12. We've experienced strong year-over-year volume growth in our lending and deposit businesses. In cards, our market share decreased slightly in Q4 as we have taken measures to slow growth given current economic conditions. We continue to hold the number one card market position in both outstandings and purchase volumes. We continued to see improvement in unsecured lending, so we remain cautious in this particular market. Our market share is stable in personal loans, residential mortgages and consumer deposits from last quarter. We do not anticipate that market growth rates will remain at these levels in the current economic environment. Q1 levels are likely to be down particularly in credit products.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 highlights the results of our wealth management businesses. Both management revenue of 363 million was down 42 million or 10% from Q4 of last year as a result of the much weaker equity markets. The average of the TSX index for the quarter was down 15% versus Q4 of last year. The weaker equity markets have resulted in a decline in new issue activity, lower trading commissions on lower market driven asset values. While revenue is lower, we have gained market share in mutual funds over the past year with an increase of 16 basis points this quarter versus the same quarter last year. Q1 performance will be affected by how the market performs. If current equity market conditions prevail through Q1, we expect revenues to be down.</p>
          <p>FirstCaribbean revenue of 161 million was down 13 million, or 7% from Q4 of last year. Excluding the $52 million Visa gain from Q4 of last year, revenue is up due to the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, volume growth and higher spreads.</p>
          <p>Retail Markets net income was 523 million. Excluding the Visa gain in Q4 of last year, net income was down 56 million from the prior year. The provision for credit losses was 232 million, up 82 million from last year primarily due to an increase in our cards portfolio. Tom Woods will discuss this topic in his remarks. Non-interest expenses were 1.363 billion, down 39 million or 3% from last year, as we continue to be focused and disciplined in managing our costs.</p>
          <p>Now turning to CIBC World Markets. Negative revenue of 318 million in Q4 was affected by further losses in structured credit run-off, but to a lesser extent than in prior quarters. Excluding the impact of structured credit run-off, Q4 revenue of 132 million is down 143 million from Q3 mainly driven by higher than normal merchant banking writedowns, and valuation adjustments in our trading portfolios resulting from the continued challenging market environment. This was partially offset by mark-to-market gains on corporate loan hedges.</p>
          <p>Looking at the individual lines of business, starting with capital markets, our revenue was negative 495 million due to structured credit run-off losses. Excluding the impact of structured credit run-off activities, revenue was negative 45 million compared with a positive 184 million last quarter. These results were adversely affected by the valuation adjustments taken during the quarter.</p>
          <p>If we exclude all items of note highlighted in the press release, and look at the underlying capital markets business &#x2013; both fixed income and currencies and global equities revenues were down from Q3, offset by strong foreign exchange revenue. Investment banking and credit products revenue of 318 million was up 184 million from Q3. Investment banking revenue is higher in Q4, primarily due to the mark-to-market gains on corporate loan hedges, M&amp;A and advisory revenue, which was partially offset by the losses related to leverage leases and lower equity new issue revenue. Merchant banking results were down significantly from Q3. As discussed previously, we had higher than normal writedowns this quarter and lower gains in distributions.</p>
          <p>Turning to World Markets expenses. Q4 expenses of 288 million are up 22 million from Q3 due to higher expenses related to structured credit run-off and other exited activities. World Markets' net income was 133 million in Q4. Excluding the impact of structured credit run-off, Q4 income was 456 million. Q4 results were significantly affected by the challenging market conditions, and a number of significant items mentioned earlier including the Enron tax recovery of 486 million. Excluding the impact of all items of note highlighted in our press release, net income was 73 million.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our total expenses and our performance versus our 2008 target. Our target was to hold expenses flat relative to annualized fourth quarter 2006 expenses. We have made adjustments to &#x2013; as noted on the slide &#x2013; to ensure a reasonable comparison. And as you can see we continue to run ahead of our objective through continued expense discipline.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And at this point, I will hand it over to Tom Woods.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. Good afternoon. My comments may also contain forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially.</p>
          <p>With respect to credit risk on slide 51, specific loan loss provisions in Q4 were 219 million or 48 basis points of net loans and acceptances. The quarter-on-quarter increase of 17 million was due to an increase of 35 million in Retail Markets, partially offset by an $18 million decrease in World Markets. Retail Markets specific loan loss expense was 226 million in the quarter. The increase in the quarter was driven by higher cards provisions, which were up due at a combination of higher write-offs and increased reserve requirements resulting from both volume growth and higher delinquencies.</p>
          <p>A number of actions are currently underway to manage the increase in delinquencies. These actions address the full credit management cycle from acquisition, through account management, and collections. We continue to closely monitor the portfolio with ongoing analysis and review to identify future areas of opportunity.</p>
          <p>World Markets reported a net recovery of 7 million in the quarter. New provisions were down from the third quarter. The fourth quarter also included the reversal of a provision that we took in Q3 related to a borrower in the U.S. Net impaired loans increased to 352 million at the end of Q4, with a majority of the increase in FirstCaribbean primarily as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to market risks, slide 52. This shows the Q4 distribution of revenue in our trading portfolios. In Q4, 50% of the trading days were positive, down from 67% last quarter. The trading revenue here does not include the reductions in mark-to-market value of our structured credit assets as this analysis is carried out only at each month-end.</p>
          <p>Slide 53, Tier 1 ratio was 10.5%. This is the highest among the Canadian banks, and our capital position remains among the strongest of all North American banks and provides substantial cushion in the event we have further structured credit charges. Tier 1 ratio increased during the quarter primarily due to positive earnings, a preferred share issue and slightly lower risk-weighted assets. While risk-weighted assets declined by about 500 million in the quarter, there were large offsetting movements. Risk-weighted assets attributed to the financial guarantor counterparties were down significantly, as David outlined earlier.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it over to Sonia Baxendale, Head of Retail Markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom. My remarks may also include forward-looking information and actual results could differ materially.</p>
          <p>Overall, Retail Markets performed well this year in the midst of challenging market conditions. We had strong volume growth in our core products including cards, deposits, lending and mortgages. Our revenue growth has been impacted by lower revenues in Wood Gundy, a mix shift in mutual funds to short-term where MERs are lower, our risk posture related to unsecured lending, and more recently our decision to slow growth in credit cards. We have continued to focus on risk mitigation and prudent expense management.</p>
          <p>In terms of products, we maintained solid performance in our industry leading credit card portfolio throughout the year. The credit card market grew by approximately 13% in fiscal 2008 and is forecast to slow to 7 to 8% in 2009. Throughout much of this year we grew at market rates. However, in the latter part of Q3 and in Q4 we slowed our growth in response to the market environment.</p>
          <p>Our industry leading high quality cards' franchise remains well positioned. We anticipate that overall cards' growth will be in the mid single-digits given consumer spending sentiment and our risk appetite. While industry growth in mortgage assets has slowed from the prior quarter as a result of consumer demand, we have maintained our market share. We expect industry mortgage growth in 2009 to decline to low to mid single-digit and our growth is expected to remain in line with industry.</p>
          <p>In lending, we delivered quality growth and continued to show stable market share. Given market conditions we believe we are well-positioned. As per our plan, the secured mix in our portfolio has increased from last year and this positions us well for the difficult economic conditions. Personal balances are up 12% year-over-year. This is comprised of 18% secured and 3% unsecured. Both our mortgages and personal lending portfolios are holding steady from a credit quality point of view.</p>
          <p>Personal deposits and GIC balances were up 1.6% on the quarter and 7.7% year-over-year. The new Tax Free Savings Account is an important new savings opportunity for Canadians, and we believe our advice strategy uniquely positions us to provide clients with expert advice on how to best leverage the TFSA. Our advisors are actively meeting with clients and our pre-registration have exceeded expectations.</p>
          <p>Commercial banking continued to deliver good credit and deposit volume growth, with loans up 4% on the quarter and deposits up 5% on the quarter. In this portfolio, we have been able to maintain new originations volume versus prior year while ensuring disciplined pricing. The overall risk profile of the commercial banking credit portfolio has improved steadily from 2004 and has remained consistent in 2008.</p>
          <p>In mutual funds, the industry experienced outflows in both short and long-term funds as did CIBC. However, due to our diversified asset mix and strong relative performance, our market share increased to its highest in two years. We currently have 24 foreign Five-Star Morningstar rated funds, and 60% of our funds are above median on a one-year basis. We are pleased with our progress to-date in elevating the quality of our fund offer and believe we are well positioned for strong growth ahead.</p>
          <p>In retail brokerage, revenues are down as a result of continued volatility in the capital market. We hold a strong position in the full service brokerage segment as the second largest in assets and revenue. In distribution, we made strong progress in our strategy to improve client accessibility and the client experience in all of our channels. This past quarter we continued to focus on branch builds, new branch hours, and increased access and flexibility through Sunday openings. We also expanded our Imperial Service client experience to an additional 200,000 rural high value clients, and launched a new advisory focused marketing campaign &#x2013; "It's worth a talk".</p>
          <p>Overall, in light of the market challenges 2008 was a solid year for Retail Markets. We have stayed focused on our strategic priorities providing clients with strong advisory solutions, an excellent client experience, and highly competitive products.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we will continue to invest in our retail franchise, opening 40 new branches, expanding our Sunday branch openings, and investing in our brand leveraging our new marketing campaign. Now more than ever clients are looking for sound financial advice. We believe that our strategic focus on building one of the most highly accredited advisory teams in the country has strongly positioned us to support our clients in achieving their financial goals. And in doing so, to deliver consistent, sustainable revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I will now turn it over to Richard Nesbitt.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sonia. My comments may also contain certain forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially. So I'll review CIBC World Markets quarterly performance and provide an update on our business strategy.</p>
          <p>Our key priority for 2009 is to shift our business from the restructuring that occurred in 2008 to a client focused strategy that will establish a foundation for risk controlled growth as market conditions normalize. And let me begin with some comments on our performance in Q4. While World Markets recorded a profit of 133 million in the quarter, this performance was impacted by a number of significant one-time items that David detailed earlier.</p>
          <p>As was the case throughout the industry, market and business conditions remain difficult and they worsened significantly throughout the quarter. Against this backdrop we were able to maintain consistency in our primary activities. We achieved some positive revenue growth in investment banking and foreign exchange, while revenues in our capital markets businesses declined.</p>
          <p>In investment banking, despite a slower case of opportunities, we received strong advisory mandates. For example, we acted as financial advisor to Kinross Gold Corp. in its $1.2 billion acquisition of Aurelian Resources Inc. We acted as a financial advisor to Schlumberger Limited in its $1.2 billion acquisition of Saxon Energy Services Inc. We also secured mandates as the sole underwriter on two separate equity underwritings for Central Fund of Canada. We completed three underwritings for CFC altogether in 2008.</p>
          <p>In our fixed income and currencies division, revenues were down from Q3 primarily due to the widening of credit spreads. This was offset partially by strong revenue growth in foreign exchange. A key win for this team was our lead manager role in an $8 billion Canada Mortgage Bond offering. This deal was notable as it was completed on September 17, during the week of the Lehman default. It was the only significant government bond deal announced around the world that day.</p>
          <p>The unprecedented market environment had a direct impact on our global equities business. As expected the market for equity new issues remained slow across the industry and this had a negative impact on revenues.</p>
          <p>Our strategy focuses on the mission we established earlier this year, and our mission is to bring Canadian capital markets products to Canada and the rest of the world and also to bring the world to Canada. Implementation of this mission is divided into two components. First, the ongoing repositioning of our business which started at the beginning of fiscal 2008. And second, the continuing to intensify our focus on our clients so we can deliver on our mandate to be the premier Canadian based investment bank.</p>
          <p>And we are now in the final stages of the first component &#x2013; the repositioning the World Markets franchise to focus on our strengths. During Q4, we continued to wind down unprofitable trading strategies. In addition, we divided our merchant banking activities into two areas &#x2013; active investments that are aligned to our business strategy, and legacy investments that we are in the process of selling when the market permits a sale.</p>
          <p>A year ago, we needed a plan to help us respond to a market and industry environment that had the potential to be the most challenging we have seen in decades. We've completed a great deal of work to execute on this plan. By quickly exiting or reducing high risk or non performing businesses we are now in a strong competitive position as we move forward to adapt to the wholesale transformation in investment banking that is occurring right now.</p>
          <p>The positive side of this for CIBC World Markets is that we excel in the traditional businesses and activities that will be valued more and more by our clients in the future. We also have a legacy of strong client relationships that we are working hard to make even stronger.</p>
          <p>And during Q4, we began to position our primary businesses to help deliver on a client focused plan that will be the key to our transition into this new environment. We began a reorganization of these businesses so that we are in a better position to integrate our products and service offerings. This reorganization has two key changes. First, it brings all of our derivatives activities together under one senior manager as Head of Derivatives and Strategic Risks. And second, it adds both a new Distribution Head and a Chief Investment Officer to our fixed income and currencies business.</p>
          <p>Our new Distribution Head will provide sales and marketing capabilities that will allow us to combine our efforts across World Markets to deliver integrated solutions to our clients. The Chief Investment Officer will be responsible for execution of CIBC's funding, balance sheet management and capital markets execution activities. This role will work closely with our new Treasurer.</p>
          <p>To conclude, this has been a difficult year for our business and for our industry, but the rebuilding efforts of the past year have placed us in a strong competitive position moving forward.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call back to John.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I had two very quick questions. With respect to the structured credit market I was just curious; the outstanding notional on the purchased options in that business increased about 1.8 billion in the quarter. And I was just curious, was that just something that had been pre-programmed and do you expect it to start to decline again? And then the second question related to the accrual of 122 million in severance which was booked through the corporate and other segment. I was just wondering if you could give us some color as to which operating segments that relates to, and whether those severance actions have already been completed at this point in time?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Mike Capatides. I run Administration. As we've discussed before, in the past year CIBC has undertaken a number of initiatives to &#x2013; in terms of our business activities and organizational structure, such as selling our U.S. investment bank, we closed U.S., European leveraged finance, we are managing the run-off of structured credit and focusing World Markets. And as a result of all those changes we are now bringing into line our support functions at CIBC with this new structure. And that's resulted in the severance accrual that you're speaking of. So they are primarily in the infrastructure areas.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can pick it off in your sup-pack [supplemental package] on page 27, sort of two-thirds of the way down, purchased options. Sorry, the written option amount was the one I was interested in, the 32, but let's look at just the trading component, 32.7, that's actually up about 1.8 billion from the prior quarter if you go back to the same schedule last quarter. So it's about a $1.8 billion increase. Just that I &#x2013; I guess being in run-off I was kind of thinking it would be getting smaller consistently, but apparently it hasn't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, to the extent that it's running off the run-off book, I mean there are no incremental positions coming on obviously. So I think the driver of that would be the impact of foreign exchange and the movement in the Canadian dollar over the course of the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. Tom, when I'm looking at Retail Markets provisions, we keep hearing how the Canadian economy is holding in okay, but you know that can't continue. And then we see an 18% increase quarter over quarter in PCLs. How concerned should we be about the Canadian consumer? I mean, if the unemployment rate was to go up 100 basis points over the next year, what would happen to PCLs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think every &#x2013; most economists are probably predicting 100 basis points is likely. So, but everyone on the phone will have their view on that I suppose. With respect to CIBC, as you know I think you have to think of it in two parts. The personal lending business as you've heard for three to four years now, we've repositioned that business considerably much more secured than unsecured, and the unsecured is performing very well and is very stable now. In a continuing economic decline, no bank is going to be able to avoid losses there. But we've been very cautious for three to four years. So I think on that line, while I can't give you complete comfort, I think I can give you some comfort even in a weakening environment.</p>
          <p>On the credit card business as we've said, we and probably every other North American bank has seen higher delinquencies already. And although I can't give you a specific number because that would really depend on where you saw the economy in Q3 and Q4, I think Q1, Q2 you can probably predict where it's going. So I think it's fair to say that as you've seen higher delinquencies in the last couple of months through the quarter, you are going to see higher loan loss provision there.</p>
          <p>I'd wrap it all together with the basis point objective we have over the medium term of 50 to 65 basis points. I mean we were well below that in Q1, albeit with hardly any write-offs in World Markets. And although I'm not going to give you a guidance for next year, I think that 50 to 65 basis points is sort of a roadmap over the next two to three years and where we are within that range or outside that range is really going to be driven by the consumer and by the economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there anything &#x2013; maybe talk a little bit about credit quality in FirstCaribbean, is there anything to talk about there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, FirstCaribbean as with every &#x2013; well, certainly the big Caribbean banks, is very much driven by tourism. And I think most analysts see arrivals falling probably 25% over the next 18 months. So the tourism related businesses which drive the secondary economies are going to have an impact. In our case &#x2013; again I don't think any bank can give complete comfort. Our losses in '08 were higher. We had one larger item, but small in a CIBC context. So it may be that even in a weakening environment our loan losses next year are in the same ballpark as this year because of the one item, but the whole economy is driven by that. In our case, we've got a very diversified portfolio. A lot of the portfolio is residential which is very secured and is in a credit environment there where defaults are very low. So I think it's really a question of the U.S. economy &#x2013; the extent to tourism arrivals declining, but we are very comfortable with our portfolio overall there.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Question, a broad question about the retail business. Revenue growth softer this year, and I'll appreciate why, operating leverage in the last few quarters was fairly light. When you look out to 2009, again a broad question, if you could just do the best you can to answer it even if it is very broad: Is it reasonable to expect that the retail bank can generate revenue growth and positive operating leverage in 2009? Is that a reasonable expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sonia Baxendale here. I would say in a moderate way that we should, that is a reasonable expectation. Of course, that is going to be very much impacted by the environment. We've had some good volume growth this year and we would expect in certain of the segments, although down from this year, to still be in the single-digit, mid single-digit range. So &#x2013; and quality of our portfolio is still very strong and expense management continues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the World Markets side, I think you said that the core number or the number &#x2013; the earnings number for the quarter was $83 million in World Markets if you exclude everything. Did I hear that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that number &#x2013; and sorry, again a very broad question, does that number feel about right for World Markets in 2009 on a quarterly basis, or do you feel that World Markets is now prepared to give us something a little better than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Richard. Generally, I would say that that's at the lower end of our objective range. Our objective as I said, last meeting I believe it was is 300 to $500 million net income after-tax from our continuing business on a go forward basis. It really &#x2013; it does depend somewhat on getting slightly improved market conditions. These have been the most dire market conditions any of us have ever experienced, so that 73 would be on the low end of that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Ian de Verteuil from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question I have relates to the VFN. I am not clear on the gain that you've booked on this. I think you said it was related to the various assets that you had sold to Cerberus but you retained the upside. Can you articulate that &#x2013; what went on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ian, a couple of things. It's related to Cerberus in the sense that these assets were part of the pool that were back stopped by Cerberus. But other than that, that's the only connection with Cerberus, just these assets. The original Cerberus note was 1.050 billion. And this is a pool of assets was back stopped by Cerberus. So that's &#x2013; as I say that's the one linkage with Cerberus. Thereafter &#x2013; and the reason for the gain was a different counterparty that was the guarantor of the credit default swaps into the CDO. When they went into bankruptcy in mid-September, that's what was the event of default that triggered the cascading effect that resulted in our VFN being taken down to zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I understand. What I guess I would ask is do you have any more of these billion dollar gains knocking around?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are looking. We are looking and we haven't identified any at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do you have other exposures where if &#x2013; because when I think of you booking a gain when a counterparty fails, I'm always concerned about that. Because I think if you book a gain when a counterparty fails, very often if you were the other way on the counterparty deal sometimes you end up with a loss. Is there any way that could have, any other positions where you have this scale of exposure? I mean it just seems odd to have a billion dollars of counterparty risk where a counterparty failed and you booked the gain. I think of Lehman, I think you said the Lehman was 30 or 40 million. I think of that kind of scale of exposure when you enter into an agreement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I take your point. Frankly, our experience to-date over the past year has been the other side of the equation where our counterparties have been weakening, and if not failing just the spreads expanding out and us taking loss as a result. This is a different situation and a fairly specific and isolated situation whereby the CDO structure as a result of that event effectively was starting to get unwound if I can use that expression. So the upshot, it is a strange circumstance, but the upshot is that we were reduced down to zero and as a result of the actions of the trustee, and I'd point out I guess one item of note, which is that noteholders who are subordinate to our positions were also paid out by the trustee of this CDO. Not all, but some of the positions subordinate to us were paid out by the trustee.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, it's Gerry here. Your question in relation to potential for large gains, I think David has addressed the obverse of that, but I'm going to turn it over to Ron Lalonde to talk about that. And the reason why I think it's important that he explore it is although we're not trying to emphasize this element of our portfolio, the transaction that we did with Cerberus was very specifically structured so that recap shares would flow back to CIBC. And that was something that was constructed with the full knowledge of our counterparty. So the fact that there was a partial paydown of their note was something that had been contemplated in the structure.</p>
          <p>I did want to note here before I turn it over to Ron to talk about the various potentials for gains, and as I say we are not trying to emphasize that, but you did ask the question. I did want to note here that the Cerberus note, which was 1.050 billion, there was a limit on the amount of paydown that a single item could trigger, and in addition to that this note paid down a certain amount. But also in addition to that, there was amortization in our portfolio which paid down another $100 million, and we did refer to that in the Cerberus webcast where people were trying to forecast how much this was going to cost us over the next couple of years, and Ron mentioned amortization as one of the factors. So that's come into play this quarter, and we did also have some optionality when this event was triggered to pay down another portion of the note, and given that our outstandings that that this note is backed by, we're down 700 million. We did exercise the optionality which was to pay down an additional 50 million.</p>
          <p>So as a result of that &#x2013; you had been doing some calculations on the Cerberus call around the cost of the 1.050 billion. We just wanted to make sure that you were up to date that as a result of this VFN plus amortization in the portfolio plus an optional paydown on our part, the remaining amount is, as I mentioned in my notes, in the $600 million range and the amount that that is back stopping is something in the slightly over 700 million range. So that was first factored because in the Cerberus call you had been trying to do some calculations around the 1.050 billion --.</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I wanted to make sure that you were up to date on the new number. And Ron will now talk to you about the upside potential that might occur under certain circumstances. Ron?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe just a couple of comments to add, Ian. We talked at the webcast on the Cerberus transaction in terms of expectation of amortization of this financing over approximately a three-year timeframe under our most likely model. We've got a range of scenarios that we have modeled. I think that what you've seen in this quarter is that we are seeing some real amortization on this transaction. And I think the other thing you are seeing in this quarter is a significant gain coming through.</p>
          <p>While unfortunately we don't have any other situations like this that we are aware of at this point, we certainly model a range of outcomes on this portfolio that included the possibility of things like this happening as well as just the basic performance of the underlying portfolio. Our view was that the more likely gains on this portfolio were going to extend over an extended period of time, and that those are gains that you'd not get significant value for at heavy discount rates in the financing transaction. Which is why it was so important to us to retain that rear-end or residual value of the transaction for CIBC shareholders.</p>
          <p>We also structured the transaction, as Gerry indicated, so that if we did have any of these types or this specific type of windfall event that we would be able to retain a significant piece of that for CIBC shareholders as well. So I think what you're seeing in this quarter are a couple of examples of issues that validate the structure that we put in place here to preserve value for CIBC shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second line of questioning really relates to the CLO. In your MD&amp;A, you provided some outdated disclosure with respect to the subordination across the various tranches, Ron. And it looks as if &#x2013; and the investment grade component is down a bit on some of these and the subordination is also down a bit. Specifically with respect to the CLO, I know most of it is non-investment grade. Can you &#x2013; I think this 31% average subordination with 6% being the bottom and on the 6% tranche, can you tell us what &#x2013; how much of the 13 billion has that low level of subordination?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can't give you those details, Ian, but what I can tell you is that the subordination relates as well to term on transactions and also the quality of the underlying assets. So I think you can assume on those structures that have relatively lower amounts of subordination that they have some combination of lower term and/or higher quality of underlying assets. So that we &#x2013; there is not a material degradation of credit quality in those structures, that they continue to perform as expected, and we've not seen any material deterioration anywhere in the portfolio at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I was to ask you what the average rating would be on that, just so I could sort of go back to sort of traditional default rates. Do you have something you could tell us on the CLOs, Ron?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at origination, they're typically in the B, BB-low type range. And we've not seen material downgrades of that portfolio at this point.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. There are so many items of note that it's hard to discern what a normal level of trading revenue would be. I'm hoping that you can give me a hand. What do you think we should view normal trading revenue to be out of the 599 million negative revenue for the fourth quarter? And then taking it a step further, what would a normal level be if you got completely out of the prop trading business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I'll handle the prop trading question first. As you know we are in the trading business and that's what we do. We do trades with clients, clients gives us &#x2013; often we take risks as a result of the trade with clients. In one part of our business, the equity division, there has been a number of activities that you would consider much more proprietary in nature than client and many of these were discontinued in 2008. These activities really weren't part of what we do any more, not core to our mission and we did have concerns about the profitability of those activities. So those are the activities that we talked about moving into run-off and we are in the process of managing those positions down to zero. Of the remaining activities, some of the remaining activities while related to our equities business as a whole, they do contain certain proprietary elements. And we went back and looked at it, and those activities have been consistently profitable but only represent less than 5% of our overall revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Less than 5% of ...?</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said there's so many items of note, what do I take as that revenue number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so let's go from &#x2013; in order to meet our earnings objective of 300 to 500 million per year, which if we're roughly on track for of on the low end of that in the fourth quarter. We would need revenues in the &#x2013; we would have an objective of having revenues somewhere in that 1.4 billion range and about a little less than half of that would come from trading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I &#x2013; so let's say &#x2013; if I said 600 from trading that would be a normal, you would figure sort of a ballpark normal number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that would be roughly accurate, yeah. And again, we're talking about if we were to meet our objective of the 300 to 500 million, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And of that you're saying also that perhaps something in the neighborhood of 30 million would be prop trading?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>5% &#x2013; no, I said 5% of the total revenue. So 5% &#x2013; less than 5% and it's going down, less than 5% of the 1.4 billion would be proprietary.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you just elaborate on what World Markets looks like in the future with taking into account the businesses that you're discontinuing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Happy to. We have our four businesses which are the traditional businesses of World Markets which have always made us money. So our fixed income and currencies business, that business we expect to see growth particularly from our foreign exchange side of that business. We have our equities business. That equities business, we would expect to see going forward that business could be slightly down from the past couple of years simply because of the environment we're in, but also reducing resources, reducing balance sheet resources and other resources in some of those businesses that were no longer involved in that we've moved to run-off.</p>
          <p>Our third one, investment corporate merchant banking, we are the top investment banking shop in Canada. That business is very strong and will continue very strong. And we would hope to have gains in the future from our merchant bank as opposed to the losses that we saw in the fourth quarter. If you go back, the previous three years they had very, very substantial gains in the merchant bank.</p>
          <p>And then the fourth business is our real estate finance business which is a business &#x2013; which is a U.S. commercial real estate business, which has been operating at a very, very low level in the past 18 months. And has avoided so far through, I think, excellent management on their part have avoided any of the problems that we've seen in the U.S. market. That business will continue to operate at a very low level until we get through this market environment that we are in. But it remains profitable even at these low levels.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. First for David Williamson, just a couple of things I want to make sure I heard properly. First off, for counterparty V, I think you said you had given this the same treatment that ACA got back in Q1. If I look at your CVA charges in the US RMM book and the non-RMM book, it seems like the proportion of the insurance that's been taken through earnings or charged off through earnings is different for this counterparty on both of those sides. Am I looking at that correctly, first of all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's have a look. So on slide eight, you're right, counterparties III and V were the ones that we put on to specific recoverable. Now, that should kick out the same level of and would kick out the same level of percentage recoverable. The thing is that on slide nine, I guess, we've got there the fair values, but not by line item the CVAs attached to each counterparty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that was in the MD&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it is separated out in the MD&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're right, both III and V were put on to specific recoverable basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I'm not sure if we are on the same page. I just, it seems like the proportion of insurance that you've charged off to earnings for this same counterparty is different unless I've done something wrong, but I can follow up with that afterwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we could do that. I think that when we look at the &#x2013; yeah, why don't we do that? Just make sure we are on the same page.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And secondly, did you mention &#x2013; you did this last quarter, it was helpful &#x2013; did you mention the amount of risk-weighted assets that's now backing the total amount owing from the guarantors in both of these portfolios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I didn't. I can give you a sense of that, though. The last quarter we had about a four times multiple on the risk-weighted assets associated with the net receivable from the monolines and guarantors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This quarter it would be at a slightly lower multiple than that. I haven't got the specific number, but because we put counterparty III and V on a specific recoverable basis that releases some risk-weighted assets which we benefited from this quarter which would lower the multiple from the four that we saw last quarter. Not massively, but it would come off that &#x2013; something probably just north of three.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for that. And then finally for Tom and probably Sonia. If I look at Retail Markets, credit cards has actually been probably the best performing revenue item in the last number of quarters. I think I've heard both of you say in the last number of quarters that you've been experiencing volume growth at some of the best levels in years. And now in the last two quarters we have the uptick in loan losses even before we've seen employment turn down in Canada.</p>
          <p>I guess I'd ask here, I mean what would you say to give me some comfort that this isn't the same experience you had in unsecured personal loans and lines from '03 to '05? Especially since I mean you've talked a lot about how that book has been for lack of a better term cured, but credit card growth has continued and now we are seeing the losses come through. Anything you can offer me there on why this is not the same story?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I kick it off, it's Sonia and then Tom will likely want to add to it. As we've talked about in credit cards, our account management, our adjudication, all of our processes in credit cards are very strong. We continue to believe that. We have also highlighted throughout that period, while we were growing credit cards, that they are &#x2013; cards generally are a leading indicator there. We have a large portfolio. And as the economy changes, one would expect some change in your loss rates. So I think this is in line with that. We continue to have good processes in place to manage that. And I would say it is clearly distinguished from some of our other portfolios, at least historically, in terms of that capability that we've had.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Andr&#xE9; Hardy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just one question on credit and one on the CLO. So if we go to your supplementary pack &#x2013; page, I believe it's 24. And if we look &#x2013; sorry, let's start with &#x2013; sorry, I'm little drowning in paper as well. So which one shows the gross impaired loans? Sorry, page 19. My apologies. So if we look at page 19, there is an increase in impaired loans for mortgages which we see at the top. And then if we go further down, that doesn't seem to be coming from Canada, it seems to be coming from countries outside of North America. So I presume that's the Caribbean and correct me if I'm wrong. But then I look at page 20, and what I see is a very small increase in allowances for credit losses related to mortgages. So first of all, am I correct? Are these coming from the Caribbean? And can you please help us understand what kind of underwriting there would have been and why is the Bank so confident that losses are going to be low?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andr&#xE9;, it's Tom. The Caribbean mortgage market is quite different than North America. And I have to generalize here, but as a general comment banks do see somewhat higher instances of delays in payments. But very, very high success rates in ultimately receiving those payments. Part of it has to do with the seasons. So what you're seeing indeed is an uptick both in absolute dollar &#x2013; U.S. dollars, but the Canadian translation is probably most of it in terms of impaired. But the typically low coverage or allowance attribution in respect to that which reflects the confidence and the history we have of ultimately turning those around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it &#x2013; are these mortgages that were given to people who work down in the Caribbean? Or are these, or sorry, I should say it differently. Are these investor owned, are they condos that people use on vacation, or are they primary residences?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's both. But I mean, again, this is a general comment because I don't have the data. But just anecdotally, the delays and the impairments are more from the second category than the first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So not &#x2013; second homes you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to reiterate, it's mostly FX.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, FX would have helped your allowance. If it was mostly FX your allowance would have gone up a fair bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no. Let me be &#x2013; the impaireds &#x2013; well, both are FX, but the impaired &#x2013; the uptick in FX raised the impaireds. It also raised the allowances, so the five in allowances, the Caribbean component of that would have been lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The other one relates to CLOs. Now that you are going to consider models and not just broker quotes, there is a certain amount of "trust us". So you're telling us to trust your models that these things are going to be money good. Can you help us understand as outsiders what needs to happen for these assets to not be money good at maturity?</p>
          <p>Ian tried to get at that, but I think we need a better answer. Because if you're not going to be using broker quotes, we'd like to have a better idea of how conservative these marks are or these models are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I can make a couple of comments in that regard. First off, we're using a blend, right. So we are saying that given there is no trading in the space of CLOs, we're introducing models but not going solely to models. We are still looking at broker quotes, so it is looking at the two data points. So as you can see from the materials in the MD&amp;A, we are not taking these back to par. There are substantially valued still off of par, and in fact we're responding to discussions we've had on this conference calls where there is &#x2013; the CLOs should be money good, but they continue to be written down. So are we missing something was a question?</p>
          <p>And no, you're not missing anything. Our models would indicate that they are money good. But what we're seeing in the quotes is the effect of the illiquidity in the markets. So we've -- I guess, I'd make two comments. One is that we have introduced models but we've only done it in the space of CLOs. I guess there will be the possibility to do it in other spaces, but we focused on CLOs where the credit quality and the modeling is much crisper.</p>
          <p>Second comment is that although we've introduced CLOs, the MD&amp;A would show that we're substantially off of par value. So we are still giving a big weighting to the broker quotes which are substantively off.</p>
          <p>And I guess the third comment I'd make is with respect to CLOs, generally Ron made the comments earlier about the quality of the CLOs, but I guess I'll just add a couple which is to say that these positions continue to perform well. Subordination is strong across the portfolio, and our senior position gives us the preferential or first payment on default. The portfolio itself is well diversified. We have a lot of loans. The underlying loans are about 20,000 loans underneath all the CLOs, about 3,000 counterparties &#x2013; companies. So we've got a lot of industry, geographic and company diversity that also mitigates the risk.</p>
          <p>But what we do have obviously is spreads. So over time these CLO holdings now that we've got them in a held to maturity book, they are either market conditions are going to ease or these positions are going to amortize down. They're not &#x2013; the weighted average life you'll see in the MD&amp;A is about five years. Or &#x2013; so either the market will ease or we'll amortize down, but we'll start to see a harmonization of the market pricing and the credit quality of these assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I were to look at a high yield index, how high would defaults have to rise before we'd see real losses? And I know it's not a perfect comparable, but it's probably the best we can do as outsiders. Would that be a fair point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Ron Lalonde. Maybe I can get at it a little bit different way for you. So when we stress these portfolios for purposes of our own internal models as well as for purposes of the models that would be used by our accounting community and by our auditors to review these models, we looked at stresses of as much as 25% constant default rates over the remaining term of these assets. That compares to the worst year we've ever seen, it's a little under 20% default rate in a single year.</p>
          <p>We also stressed our recovery levels down to 50%. Normally we'd expect recovery on secured loans as these are in the range of 70%, and the worst one year that we've ever seen is 65%. Even under those stressed conditions, we have minimal losses in the portfolio. So it's that kind of stress testing that gives us confidence in the value of the portfolio, and also provides support for the accounting approach that we've taken.</p>
