          <p>Good morning. We're going to begin the presentation of the Results for the Year 2010 at Iberdrola. The procedure will be as usual. When we come to the questions, first we'll take questions from the room, then via phone and, finally, through the web.</p>
          <p>So, without further ado, I'll hand the floor over to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Jos&#xE9; Ignacio Gal&#xE1;n.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for coming. For those of you that are here physically, and those that are following the meeting via the phone or the web. We'll have the usual structure today. I will refer to the main points for the year, and then the CFO, Mr. Armada, will analyze all the results in detail. I'll end with some brief conclusions, and then we'll move on to questions.</p>
          <p>And starting with the introduction, the gross operating profits for the Group increased 10.5% in the year to &#x20AC;7,528 million. And with this, we have exceeded the maximum growth range estimated for the period 2010-2012, which, as you will remember, it was between 5% and 9%, as we said at the last meeting we held during Investors' Day last year.</p>
          <p>As shown in the last three quarters, the results reflect the positive impact of the investments made in recent years, which have provided the Group with a portfolio of activities in geographic areas capable of providing sustainable growth in any scenario.</p>
          <p>The renewable and liberalized businesses have been driven by an 8% increase in production thanks to the greater contribution of the emission free technologies, which now represent 50% of the total production for the Group; and in the case of Spain, this is 80%.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the regulated activities have been strongly driven by the good performance of our network business in Spain, United Kingdom, United States and Brazil. As a result of all this, the gross margin has recorded a growth of 7.9%.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the measures to exchange best practices between companies in the Group together with a profound revision of corporate costs have made it possible to carryout the reduction almost 4% in operating expenses. Together with the increase in the gross margin, as pointed out, this has led to an 11% improvement in the operating efficiency for the Group.</p>
          <p>All this has been reflected in the operating cash flow, which has grown 11% to &#x20AC;5,500 million. Finally, the recurrence in net profit increases by 5.6%, and net profit amounts to &#x20AC;2,870 million with a growth of close to 2% in spite of the lower atypical net results compared to last year.</p>
          <p>2010, characterized by a complex macroeconomic and energy environment, has been a key year for the optimization of the Group at all levels. During the period, we have carried out a number of initiatives that will enable us to face the coming years from a more advantageous position. First of all, we have continued to improve our current business portfolio and have strongly invested in growth activities in areas and divesting in non-basic businesses.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of Elektro in Brazil, agreed in January 2011, gives us a magnificent opportunity to continue to grow in a profitable way in the regulated business in Brazil, which presents favorable prospects. And we have also kept our focus on improving management and efficiency in all our areas of activity.</p>
          <p>We have made compatible strong growth in our basic business with a stricter cash control, and for this we have carried out divestments amounting to over &#x20AC;2,000 million in businesses in geographic areas that are not basic for the Group. In this sense, we can highlight the sale of the gas subsidiaries at Iberdrola USA in Connecticut and Massachusetts, of which $1,300 million was obtained; the divestment of the Group business in Guatemala; and our reduction of our shareholding in EDP where we still have 6.8%. At the same time, we have continued to invest in our basic business where we have provided a total of &#x20AC;4,600 million in net terms.</p>
          <p>I would like to draw your attention to the fact that these investments are 35% lower than those made before the crisis, which shows our flexibility and capacity to adapt to the financial environment we live in. This major reduction has been possible, thanks to the design of our investment plan where, as we reported during the presentation of the financial forecast last year, only 60% of the total funds were committed at the beginning of this period.</p>
          <p>Therefore, in 2010, we have focused on the most attractive organic growth opportunities, including the wind power business in the U.S., driven by the federal government grant program and the transportation line that will make it possible to interconnect New England with Canada. This project has started during the second half of the year, and we have invested &#x20AC;100 million during this period.</p>
          <p>As I said last January, we decided to buy the Brazilian distributor, Elektro, 2.17 million points of supply in the state of Sao Paulo. The integration of this company enabled us to increase our presence in the Brazilian market whose electricity demand grew 8% last year, and it is expected to grow strongly in the coming years. The operation also complies with the stricter profitability requirements for the Group since it will have a positive impact both on net results and on cash flow from the first year.</p>
          <p>The third major access of action in the year has been organizational after the internationalization growth process experienced by the Group in recent years. And in order to maximize the exchange of best practices and obtain synergies, we have reorganized that the Group under global business areas, one for liberalized businesses and one for regulated businesses, that will coexist with the corresponding organization under our subsidiary, Iberdrola Renovables.</p>
          <p>We have also set up a single corporation that provides services to all businesses in an efficient and flexible manner, avoiding duplications. I would like to underline that in 2010 alone, we have saved over &#x20AC;100 million, thanks to the rationalization of coal productivities.</p>
          <p>2010 has also been particularly relevant from the point of view of the optimization of the financial structure. For this, and continuing with the work done in recent years, we have further increased the strength of the Group as reflected in the improvement of the debt profile and financial ratios that the CFO will comment on in greater detail. This, together with increase in liquidity, which amounts to &#x20AC;10,600 million, has enabled Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch agencies to recently reaffirm the credit rating of Iberdrola. I would also like to highlight the success of the flexible dividends program started up in 2010, which was accepted by 68% of the capital.</p>
          <p>This for shareholders has meant that they can benefit not only from tax advantages, but also from the revaluation of the shares whose price increased 14% since the new shares were issued. Finally, I would like to highlight the speedup of the collection process of the amount owed because of the tariff insufficiency. In recent weeks, there have been two issues amounting to &#x20AC;4,000 million, of which &#x20AC;1,200 million were for Iberdrola. We hope that similar issues will continue to take place in the next few weeks.</p>
          <p>The good results obtained during the year, together with the financial situation of the Group, have enabled the Board to approve a shareholders' remuneration proposal for the year 2010 of &#x20AC;0.326 per share, inline with last year's. This proposal, obviously, will be presented at the next general shareholders' meeting. So, for this purpose, the company will be paying out a remuneration of at least &#x20AC;0.18 per share. That is &#x20AC;0.003 in cash, as laid down by our bylaws, and a minimum of &#x20AC;0.15 through a new program based on the flexible dividend.</p>
          <p>So, this remuneration is added on to the &#x20AC;0.146, which is the purchase price established for the subscription rights that are related to the script dividend. As regards regulation, 2010 has brought about significant advantage in all the geographic areas in which the Group is operating, thanks to the very good negotiating capability. And I think that it's been a very dynamic year and a very successful year in anything related to regulatory issues in all countries.</p>
          <p>In Spain, we have the new remuneration framework for distribution. It is more stable and more predictable. And not only that, but the royal decree, 14/2010, recently approved has introduced a number of measures that will solve the future tariff deficit among which we can underscore a number of points. That is the management of development and remuneration of renewables. And then, we have the maximum limits of the ex-anti-tariff deficit for 2010 to 2012 to put an end to this tariff insufficiency in 2013. But also have to maintain the social bonus and actions required for improving energy efficiency. And finally, something that has not been mentioned very much, but which is very important, which is that we've eliminated the maximum ceiling of 40 years for the nuclear power stations, and their continuity has been established based on technical and safety criteria. And this has nothing to do with political criteria.</p>
          <p>As regards to the UK, in April, the new remuneration regime was approved for distribution that provides greater visibility and stability until 2015. And as you know, 2011 will be very important for this country, for the U.K., from the regulatory point of view because specific actions will have to be implemented as regards reforming the energy market that are currently being debated, as well as a new framework for the transportation of electricity. And we hope that the outcomes of both processes will be in line with the messages that are incentivating investments that have been released by the British government, as well as by Ofgem, the regulatory body.</p>
          <p>In the United States, both the main activities of the Group have significantly improved from the regulatory perspective. As regards to the grid business, the improvement of the gas and electricity rates in New York were implemented in October, and will be bettered until 2014. And now, all the subsidiaries of Iberdrola USA will have regulatory stability until 2014, which will allow us to carry on addressing the optimization and efficiency actions that have already produced a significant improvement of results in 2010.</p>
          <p>As far as wind power is concerned, we have approved the extension of the opening debt for the construction of new farms in order to alter the grant system until the end of 2011, which gives more stability and visibility to the projects that will be commissioned throughout 2011 and 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to details. The production figures of the Group in 2010 reached a new record exceeding 154,000 gigawatt hours with a growth of 8% relative to the previous year. And the investments that we've made in recent years have improved our generation portfolio by increasing a production that is free of emissions.</p>
          <p>And that means that wind power production has increased 18%, which when linked to the greater contribution made by hydraulic and nuclear technologies, means that the weight of clean technologies has increased 10 points and now represents nearly 50% of our total production. And as I said before, this emission free production in the case of Spain exceeds or is close to 80%.</p>
          <p>So, this has also increased the diversification of our generation pool. So, no technology is offering more than 20% of the total, with the exclusion of the combined cycles in Mexico, which as you know, they have a practically independent economic regime as regards hours of operation and cost of fuel. But as regards the hydroelectric reserves, in December in Spain they reached 7,500 gigawatts per hour in the reservoir, which represents an increase of 26% relative to the figures reported in December 2009.</p>
          <p>And this figure has increased in the first months of 2011, and right now they exceed 8,000 gigawatts per hour, which is 10% higher compared to the previous year. And higher production levels, as well as an improvement of the mix together with the evolution of the regulated business mean that the gross margin stands in excess of &#x20AC;11,600 million, which means an 8% increase.</p>
          <p>As regards operating expenses and how they've evolved, they have decreased. We have a strong reduction in external services that have dropped by 7% in net terms. And then, we have staff expenses is flat or are flat. Staff expenses, as I said, are still flat. Although, after having excluded the impact of rates of exchange, this item has dropped nearly 3%. So, we have to underscore the good behavior of Iberdrola USA with a 14% reduction in its expenses and of ScottishPower with another improvement in this item, which totals up 8%.</p>
          <p>By businesses, we have to talk about the positive behavior of the regulated businesses whose EBITDA has grown 25%, boosted by very good progression in all markets, as mentioned previously. As regards Iberdrola Renovables, the wind power business has increased its EBITDA by 19%, although the total increase of this item is down to 10%, as a result of the negative evolution of the storage business for gas in the United States.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the liberalized activities present a very diverse evolution in Spain. Its outcomes have been benefited by an increase in excess of 10% in production and also by the growth of the clean technologies, whereas in the U.K., the business margins have been reduced relative to 2009, which was an exceptional year. So, that means that the business has grown in terms of EBITDA in line with what we've had in the gross margin. But there was an increase in taxation, especially in Spain, with an increase of 84%. And we now stand at a figure very close to &#x20AC;400 million as a consequence, among other things, of the taxes applied to nuclear power. And later on, the CFO will be talking about this in much greater detail.</p>
          <p>But as regards management of the balance sheet, the results of the Group confirmed the positive impact of the different actions that have been implemented in order to optimize the structure of the liabilities. So, therefore, the increase in operating cash flow together with the control of investment have allowed debt to be reduced by nearly &#x20AC;700 million in this period of time. Whereas, the company's equity has increased by &#x20AC;2.5 billion, and now stands at &#x20AC;31,600 million. So, that means that leverage stands at 43.3%, which represents an improvement of nearly three points, vis-&#xE0;-vis the figure reported 12 months ago. So, this means that this ratio has reached its lowest level over the last 10 years. And the main financial ratios have also improved considerably.</p>
          <p>The solid operating evolution and the better financial position of the company have produced a 5.6% increase in the recurrent net profits and 1.6% in the total net profits, which now stand at &#x20AC;2,870 million in spite of the lower extraordinary results. But the Group is still growing very strongly in the generation of operating cash flow that's grown 11.3% and now stands very near &#x20AC;5.5 billion.</p>
          <p>And now, I would like to give the floor to the CFO, Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, so that he can give you more details in relation to what I've just explained to you. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chairman. And now, we are going to review, as usual, the most important aspects in the accounts for 2010 and the business performance. And finally, end up with a quick analysis of the financial situation for the Group.</p>
          <p>As the Chairman said, the company has obtained growth on all levels of recurrent results. On an operating level, EBITDA grows 10.5% to &#x20AC;7.528 billion. The reported net profit grows 1.6% to &#x20AC;2,870 million, and the recurrent net profit shows an increase of 5.6% to &#x20AC;2,582 million. And as the Chairman also said, the cash flow for the Group is almost &#x20AC;5,500 million, an increase of 11.3%.</p>
          <p>Starting with the various items on the accounts, the sales figure grew 17.5% to &#x20AC;30,431 million, especially because of the growth in the national energy business with bigger volumes in the liberalized business and improvements in the remuneration of the regulated business.</p>
          <p>Latin America and the USA also contributed, and the exchange rate has also helped in this performance. Regarding Group supply, this grew 25.3%, up to &#x20AC;18,394 million, also because of the national energy business, Latin America and the exchange rate.</p>
          <p>The gross margin increased 7.9% to &#x20AC;11,645 million with all the large business areas showing increases, as the Chairman mentioned. Additionally, Iberdrola has benefit from good developments in the exchange rate, representing &#x20AC;334 million under this item.</p>
          <p>The basic margin, which shows the net effect of the issue rights goes up 7.3%, somewhat less than the gross margin because of the lower price and consumption of CO2 in 2010. The net operating expenses continue with a positive evolution, improving 3.7% to &#x20AC;3,457 million, an improvement of 2.2%, compared to September and in spite of increases of &#x20AC;95 million because of the exchange rate. With this positive evolution, as the Chairman said, we can highlight the personnel expenses control measures and efficiencies applied, especially in the U.S. and United Kingdom.</p>
          <p>Net spending on personnel has had a flat evolution with &#x20AC;1,705 million improving 1.8% from September. The exchange rate effect means that they would have grown 2.4%. Therefore, the personnel expenses have fallen.</p>
          <p>The net external services show a reduction of 7.2% to &#x20AC;1,752 million, a 6% reduction with respect to September. However, there is a reclassification in the nuclear tax that I'll mention later on, as well as the inclusion of other earnings according to the IFRIC 18 agreement.</p>
          <p>There is an increase of 33.1% in taxes to &#x20AC;908 million, mainly because of the increase in this area in the liberalized business in Spain, which has grown 84%, that the Chairman mentioned. And I'll go into details later on.</p>
          <p>In global terms, there is an increase of &#x20AC;108 million in nuclear taxes amounting to a total of almost &#x20AC;200 million in nuclear taxes paid by Iberdrola in Spain. And it also includes the social bonus and other taxes in the United States, United Kingdom and Spain. And all these effects added together more than offset the elimination of the removal of CO2 clawback, which represented &#x20AC;82 million in 2009.</p>
          <p>The consolidated EBITDA for the Group is &#x20AC;7,528 million, showing an increase of 10.5%. This evolution in EBITDA provides an improvement in basic margin of 7.3%, thanks to the cost containment efforts and the efficiency improvements made by the Group, including the already mentioned 33% increase in taxes.</p>
          <p>The strength of currencies with which Iberdrola operates in 2010 has benefited the Group. And the impact on EBITDA has been &#x20AC;226 million because of the exchange rate. The pound has appreciated 3.7%; the dollar, 4.9%; and the Brazilian real, 16%. Excluding the exchange rate effect, EBITDA also showed a strong growth of 7.1%.</p>
          <p>This increase of 10.5% in the consolidated EBITDA for the Group is based on our diversified business model, which has been reinforced by the growth obtained in lower risk businesses such as the regulated and renewables business, which shows the solidity and sustainability in cash generation for the Group.</p>
          <p>The business context for 2010, our regulated activity has showed the biggest growth, 25%; renewables grew 10% in EBITDA, although the pure renewables business grew 19% in line with the installed power.</p>
          <p>The liberalized businesses overall dropped 3%, affected by the business in the U.K. and the major tax increase in Spain. Since regarding the gross margin, as the Chairman said, the increase was 4%. As of 2011, Iberdrola will report on the accounts for the Group according to the reorganization carried out by global business, as mentioned by the Chairman.</p>
          <p>And moving on to businesses by countries, I'm going to analyze the operating profits in Spain, starting with the liberalized business, which includes generation, commercial and non-regulated gas. Iberdrola has increased the ordinary regime production by 10.5%. Again improving the overall performance for the system, we showed drop of 0.9%. This positive evolution explained by the growth in demand in Spain, which has grown 3.3%, although adjusted to temperature and other elements, it represents 2.9%. And a major increase in hydraulic production at Iberdrola, which doubled compared to last year. Our nuclear production has grown 14% and thermal technologies have dropped cycles by 39% and coal plus fuel 42%.</p>
          <p>And average sales price has been obtained of more than &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour. And there are 35 terawatt hours in production estimated for 2011, sold at a price similar or somewhat lower than 2010's price. The forwards for the European and Spanish markets point to stability or a slight increase in prices in 2011. And the Spanish forwards, although they have closed the gap somewhat with regard to European prices, maintain a difference of &#x20AC;5 below the prices of France and Germany, proving that the deficit &#x2013; the tariff deficit problem is not generated by the ordinary regimen. It's the opposite. The EBITDA of the liberalized business in Spain grew 11.5% to &#x20AC;1,483 million because of the improvement in the basic margin by 15.3% to &#x20AC;2,676 million, due to the greater volumes and the better production mix.</p>
          <p>The operating expenses grew only 2.8%, very much below the growth in basic margin. The increase in expenses related to greater commercial activity and the transfer of the Last Resort tariff have been offset by the efficiency measures implemented and the impact of the nuclear tax reclassified under the tax heading in 2010. As already mentioned, taxes in this area grew 84% to &#x20AC;397 million, and they represent close to 30% of the EBITDA for this business.</p>
          <p>As we said, this is due to the sum of several factors: the already mentioned nuclear tax, which amounts to &#x20AC;108 million; the social bonus; the increase in the Extremadura environmental tax, which have been appealed before the Extremadura Court, and this represents &#x20AC;27 million plus &#x20AC;44 million; and the greater Iberdrola taxes related to TIU and commercial taxes. And the total was &#x20AC;82 million, and therefore this means that taxes grew by 84%.</p>
          <p>EBITDA for the regulated business in Spain grew 24% to &#x20AC;1,389 million, an improvement compared to the increase of 9.5% in the gross margin, thanks to the significant improvement in net operating expenses, which fell by 20%, thanks to improvements in efficiency and the following impacts. First of all, the transfer of the liberalized business to the liberalized business related to TUR. And the accounting reclassification related to IFRIC 18 where the charging of the results of the value of the facilities is registered as other operating earnings, reducing the operating expenses with an impact of &#x20AC;68 million in Spain. On an EBIT level, the impact is zero since these item increases the amortizations.</p>
          <p>Additionally in 2009, there were additional maintenance expenses, after the storms that did not take place in 2010. Regarding the increase of 9.5% in the gross margin, this is basically the result of the increase of 8.8% in the recognized earnings for the business. We have to remember that the year 2009 closed with remuneration according to the Ministerial Order of 31st of December, which was provisional and which was lower than that finally approved in the ministerial order for electric excess prices based on the reference network model. Therefore, there is an additional positive impact derived from the increase related to 2009, which represents &#x20AC;87 million more and which cannot be repeated in future years.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA for the renewable business grew 19.4% to &#x20AC;1,449 million over and above the increase in installed capacity of 16%. This positive evolution has been achieved, thanks to a major increase in production, 18%, because of the greater operating capacity and because of the improvement in wind power resources. Prices reached &#x20AC;73 per megawatt hour, similar to 2009, meanwhile the cost control efforts have continued and the OpEx per megawatt has improved by 3.8%. This good performance in the basic business contrasts with the weak contribution of the gas business, which also contributes &#x20AC;6 million to EBITDA affected by the weak gas prices in USA, which places the total EBITDA for the year at &#x20AC;1,4525 million showing an increase of 9.8%.</p>
          <p>The ScottishPower EBITDA in local currency dropped 10.5% to &#xA3;1,157 million after a reduction of 9.6% in the basic margin because of the worse performance of the wholesale and retail business, partially offset by the improvement in networks, while the net operating expenses was cut back by 11.7%, including great amounts of collected insurance.</p>
          <p>In euros, EBITDA reduced its drop to 7% to &#x20AC;1,349 million after having a positive impact because of the exchange rate of &#x20AC;50.4 million. Networks contributed &#x20AC;799 million with a growth of 20.4%, derived from the growth of 15.8% in the gross margin, with the favorable impacts from the major investments made since the second semester in the new agreement for business remuneration called DPCR5, Distribution Price Control Review Five, in application since April 1st, 2010 and distributed energy. This has been stable compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>Wholesale and retail provides &#x20AC;545 million to the EBITDA with a drop of 25.5%, mainly due to the retail business where on the one hand there are smaller volumes, 1%, and lower unit margins basically in the electricity business a result of a drop of 4% in the sales price, which was not offset by lower supply costs. And 2009 was also a year that was especially strong in the ScottishPower electricity retail business, and this also affects the comparison.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA for Iberdrola USA went up a great deal. It went up almost 60%. In IFRS in euros, it amounts to &#x20AC;711 million, which represents an increase of almost 60%, compared to the &#x20AC;451 million in 2009, which included, as already mentioned, around &#x20AC;76 million atypical negative impacts. The effect, because of the exchange rate, is positive. It represents &#x20AC;35 million. And the effect, because of U.S. GAAP to IFRS transfers, is also positive this year by &#x20AC;58 million.</p>
          <p>In homogenous terms, it's important to highlight the increase of &#x20AC;167 million achieved in the EBITDA, thanks to the good business operations and the efficiency measures taken. The gross margin went up 13.3% to &#x20AC;1,548 million, as well as having positive impacts because of the exchange rate and adjustments to IFRS, as mentioned.</p>
          <p>And this is important; there is a loss from the contribution of divestments made in Connecticut Gas, which means around &#x20AC;30 million less in gross margin. In homogenous terms, the business showed a very positive performance with higher margins after the coming into effect of the rate cases in New York, and the new earnings from the main transmission line after construction and the increase in prices.</p>
          <p>The net operating expenses improved 14.3%, mostly as a result of the efficiency programs implemented by the company in the last year. The average workforce has been reduced by 13%, and there have been new initiatives that have reduced external services by 16%.</p>
          <p>The EBTIDA of Latin America has grown 12.1% and now stands at &#x20AC;963.6 million, which is the outcome of the evolution we've had in the gross margins that have grown by 18.3%, considering the increase in the net operating expenses, that is 44%, mainly due to an extraordinary adjustment of &#x20AC;36 million in Brazil in 2009, and which was not repeated in 2010. So, this means that we can see that the net operating expenses show increase related to inflation and to greater activity. This good operational evolution of the business has been improved by the rate of exchange after the revaluation of the real, 16.2%, and the dollar, 4.9%.</p>
          <p>Brazil has made a contribution of &#x20AC;56.7 million to the EBITDA with an 11% growth. That is with an improvement of 8.1% in demand because of the adjustment to the inflation and because there has been a positive effect of the rate of exchange in spite of these sales of assets in Chile that has been compensated by the commissioning of new power stations in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Mexico has made a contribution of &#x20AC;407 million to the EBITDA, which is a growth of 13.7% because of the improvement in the margins and the availability of the power stations and although the sale of Guatemala already accounts for &#x20AC;15 million less in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of non-energy businesses and engineering has dropped 40%, and now stand at &#x20AC;201 billion. The lower activity of the real estate business and of the slump in engineering activities are the main causes. Now, engineering provides 37% in terms of the gross margin. And other services like the area of telecommunications and measurements provide the rest of the revenues. But then, net operating expenses have been reduced by 5.6% because of the adjustments.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of the Group grew 7.1% and now stands at &#x20AC;4.829 million, and after the &#x2013; an increase of 17% in amortizations and provisions, which now reach &#x20AC;2.7 billion. Amortizations now total &#x20AC;2.5 billion, which is 14.5% more because of the higher installed capacity in renewables and because more investments have been made in the ScottishPower networks, and also because there have been environmental investments in Spain in the liberalized business.</p>
          <p>The reclassification of differed revenues in the facilities that have been handed over to the subscribers under implicating as regards the net operating expenses have produced an additional impact of &#x20AC;73 million. Provisions have been increased by &#x20AC;73 million, and now stand at &#x20AC;184 million.</p>
          <p>And as regard to the fourth quarter, we've had some additional provision. And in the fourth quarter of 2009 there were reversals, which affects the comparative analysis. As regards financial cost, the improvement of the average cost of the debt, which goes from 4.5% to 4.2% makes financial expenses related to debt to be reduced by &#x20AC;59 million.</p>
          <p>However, the net financial results show an increase of &#x20AC;178 million, which is 16%, and now has reached the figure of &#x20AC;1,287 million. And the main items explaining this trend are not related to the management of the debt, and they are the following. And that is a lower rate of remuneration of the deficit that has had a negative impact of &#x20AC;96 million. As you know, it's remuneration system that is related to the euro ibor. And in 2009 it was 4.3%, and in 2010 it was 0.7%. And the sum of the lower dividends are collected by EDP and the effect of the hedging coverage of the hedging derivatives, you know that this has produced an effect on the rate of appreciation with an impact of &#x20AC;20 million. And then other items that are related to the financial updating and taxation and pensions, which explain the other &#x20AC;121 million in negative impact in the accounts, although this does not represent any alterations in terms of cash flow.</p>
          <p>The recurrent net profits have grown 5.6% and now stand at &#x20AC;2,581 million. And the lower contribution after non-recurrent taxes, which mean that the rate of adaptation has gone up to 23.4%, vis-&#xE0;-vis 20% in 2009, means that the net profits have increased 1.6% versus 5.6% in recurrent terms. The improvement of operating results has increased by 11.3%.</p>
          <p>The flow of operating cash flow of the Group that has nearly reached &#x20AC;5,500 million. Although, next week during the Investors' Day, I will explain the financial situation in much greater detail, I would now like to briefly review its main features as regards to the tariff deficit.</p>
          <p>For 2010, the net tariff deficit was &#x20AC;1,630 million, which has to do with the total deficit generated in the fiscal year. In other words, &#x20AC;1,933 million minus &#x20AC;303 million already collected in the usual settlement. So, that means that the total tariff deficit pending collection for Iberdrola on December the 31st, 2010 was &#x20AC;5,249 million.</p>
          <p>I would like to understand that the &#x2013; underscore that the securitization process is already underway and looks very positive because the market has improved. As the President said, &#x20AC;4 billion have been securitized, and the Treasury is already opening the third and fourth auctions, which we hope will take place as usual.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet of the company has been strengthened in the fourth quarter. And apart from the management actions carried out successfully by the company, already mentioned by the President, like the scripted dividend and divestitures in non-basic businesses and control of investments, we have the increase in cash flow that has been produced by good operations. And the company's equity up to the end of 2010 presented a figure of &#x20AC;31,663 million.</p>
          <p>And the net debt, without considering the deficit, was &#x20AC;24,312 million, which is &#x20AC;682 million less than one year ago and &#x20AC;1,465 million less compared to September. And leverage stood at 43.3%, which is &#x20AC;290 base points better than the figure reported for 2009, which was 46.2%. If we include the tariff deficit, the debt reaches a figure of &#x20AC;29,461 million, &#x20AC;949 million more than last year. As the deficit went up by &#x20AC;1,600 million, we are covering part of the tariff deficit. Although leverage also improves 140 base points, and now stands at 48.2% versus 49.6% of the previous year. But if we were to exclude the effect produced by the already securitized tariff deficit, &#x20AC;1.2 billion, leverage would be reduced to 47.2%.</p>
          <p>So, all of this has allowed us to improve the financial ratios, compared to the previous fiscal year even including the tariff deficit. The FFO ratio relative to the net debt has improved 2.9 percentage points. And the tariff deficit now stands at 18.9%, which is better than the figure reported in 2009, which was 17.5%. And if we exclude the tariff deficit, we stand at a figure of 23%. But if we exclude the securitized deficit, the ratio practically reaches 20%. The retained cash flow ratio relative to the net debt has improved 6.5 percentage points, which is nearly 50%, and now has reached 20%. Including the tariff deficit, it stands at 16.5%, which is very favorable compared to 2009. The figure reported was 11.9%. And if we exclude the part of the deficit that has been securitized, you can see that the ratio has gone up to 17.2%.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And the President will now close this part of the presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Pepe And to conclude, I would just like to underscore that this fiscal year that we are closing now, which has results that show how strong our long-term business is, and it also shows how capable the Group is at adapting to short-term environment by maintaining sustainable growth in complex financial and operating situation.</p>
          <p>We have grown 10.5% in EBITDA. We have increased the recurrent net profit by 5.6%, and this response to the application of the profitable growth model that has been our sign of identity during the last 10 years. This model is based, first of all, in our determination using green technologies. And this has enabled the Group production to increase 8% in an environment where there is moderate demand for electricity.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the results we present also show the positive impact of the efficiency improvement initiatives implemented during the year. They are just a continuation of our traditional measures in recent years. In this sense, we have increased gross margin by 8% while we significantly reduced net operating expenses, which dropped by 3.7%. And this has been possible, thanks to personnel cost containment, which continues to be flat with improvements if we consider the exchange rate and improvements made in external services, which dropped by 7.2%.</p>
          <p>There has been a decisive influence of the improvements in the stability and predictability of the regulatory frameworks in our network businesses, which have enabled us to carryout a rationalization of the same. Finally, the third key element in our model is our financial solidity. The results we present show a significant strengthening of the Group's balance sheet, as the CFO explained.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the increase in equity and debt reduction, leverage is 43.3% with an improvement of almost 300 basis points, compared to one year ago. The results for the year are also the result of the various measures taken throughout the year to improve the Group's position in the current situation. But we also hope that they will contribute to achieve long lasting growth during the coming years. In this sense, we have optimized the Group business portfolio by divesting non-basic assets amounting to over &#x20AC;2 billion and concentrating investments in growth areas. The flexibility of our plan has also enable us to contain investments reaching a level 35% lower than levels before the crisis. We have also occurred an intense activity to improve the regulatory situation in all major areas of the Group. And we have seen that in 2010, major steps have been taken to solve the tariff deficit and provide profitability for our regulated activities, which is now more stable and predictable.</p>
          <p>The significant improvement in Iberdrola's position brought about by these measures together with the development in financial results has led the Board to propose to the shareholders meeting a remuneration of at least &#x20AC;0.326 per share in line with the previous year.</p>
          <p>And I would like to conclude by saying that on the 2nd of March on Investors' Day, we will analyze in detail the master guidelines for the Group for the year's 2011 and 2012. And I can tell you that they are in line with our indications given during Investors' Day last year. But in any case, you can be sure, all the men and women that work for the Group, we will continue to put our firm efforts behind the maximization of profit results for everyone.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, and now we'll move on to the questions.</p>
          <p>Well, before we start with the questions, I would like to ask you for something. I don't want to influence on the questions, but I would like to ask those of you that are in a room or on the phone or on the web, to move the strategic questions or regulatory questions for March 2nd because they will probably all be more than suitably answered there. So, let's start with a question, Raimundo.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let's see if these are questions for today or for next week. The first one is a bit general. I don't know whether it's strategic, but in the current circumstances with oil prices that are going up and the instability in the North of Africa, I would like to ask the Chairman whether you're concerned from the point of view of the regulatory stability we have in Spain since Christmas. Do you think this could affect the access tariffs, or do you think it's something that the system can digest during the next year or two?</p>
          <p>The second quick question, it seems that the proposal is to continue with the script dividends at least two more times. And if the tax advantages continue, will this continue beyond this year? And the final question is a bit of an esoteric question, we've heard about the possibility of an underwater cable between the UK and Spain. I don't know whether this sounds a bit like Jules Verne, I'd like to ask you about this.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Where is Frank Mitchell? Frank? Where is Frank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question related to this submarine cable connecting Spain with UK. So, that's Julio Miguel's idea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, Chairman, there are no plans to from the UK perspective for a cable to go that distance. In fact, we sit on the National Strategic Planning Group in the UK, and that scenario has never been even in the most remote way contemplated. Hopefully that responds directly to that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, gracious. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Situation of North Africa &#x2013; well, I think that without a doubt, first of all, it's a situation that we don't know how long it can last. In Spain, we're coming to a lower demand period. Thirdly, the prices in Europe are tending to grow and energy prices are going one way and other prices are going along their own path. So, any affect on the price of raw materials affects energy. And, as you know, the price of energy is a pass through regarding the part of the regulated tariff.</p>
          <p>So, I don't think it's going to have an affect on the regulated side, which is what we commented on in regard to stability. Regarding the scrip dividend, well, we announced it. We said it from the beginning, we think that this has advantages for the shareholder and, in fact, 68% of them subscribed to it last year. The demand we have for many of them is growing. And, apart from the 20% savings in taxes, the share performance means that their profitability has grown spectacularly. So, within our schemes of providing as many advantages as we can to our shareholders, we'll continue to play with this element in moderation. But I don't know how long we will use it. It's not going to be perpetual and permanent in spite of the tax situation.</p>
          <p>Next question from the room. Virginia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. Virginia Sanz from Deutsche Bank. I would like to ask whether you can tell us regarding Elektro, if you're already in touch with your partners in Nokia and if they have an interest in taking part in the operation. And the regulated business this year has had surprisingly positive developments. And I would like to ask you what do you think might happen in Spain and in the United Kingdom in 2011? And what potential is there to further reduce costs if we include the United States because I think this year there have been very positive developments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course, we've spoken to our partners. You know that we've been with our partners with Previ and Banco do Brasil for 15 years. And we have very good relationship. And as soon as we have all the approvals, we want to integrate them in the complete business. However, according to the new accounting standards, we would like to have a position that will enable us to consolidate the company once the proportional consolidation system goes away. And we're having conversations with them, fluid conservations at all levels. And things are exactly the same.</p>
          <p>Regarding the regulated business, 2011, we have said it. We have stability and regulatory clarity in the U.K. until 2015 or 2014/2015, in the U.S. till 2014 and Brazil till 2013. And Brazil and in Spain the remuneration has already been defined for 2011 according to the Ministry of Orders published at the end of the year. So, from the point of view of earnings, the issue is clear. From the point of view of savings, in the U.S. there is still a plan &#x2013; a major efficiency plan. The same as in the U.K. The same as in Spain.</p>
          <p>One of the reasons that we've created these regulated and liberalized business divisions in the Group, and this will be explained by Jos&#xE9; San Pedro in greater detail on the second. But one of the reasons is that after seeing the first quick wins in the country we've started to work on, and once setting up the single corporation with the results of over &#x20AC;100 million in savings this year, after seeing the benchmarking with the different companies that we've compared figures with, now is the time to implement it. And this will be done through steering committees through joint groups led by Xabier de Irala and for regulated business and liberalized businesses, Mart&#xED;nez-C&#xF3;rcoles, and they will help in each country.</p>
          <p>So, that these potential efficiencies can be transformed into a reality. We'll discuss it in greater detail next week, but for networks, for example, I can see Frank over there. He can give us more details. They are studying the standardization of substation designs, kinds of transformers, et cetera, et cetera. And this will certainly help to achieve greater efficiency. If this is in the plan, then we're going to continue on all levels. It's very detailed for the U.S. There are very detailed plans to continue to improve efficiency. We have incentives to improve it, according to the regulatory framework. This is one of the major changes we've had in the U.S. There was no incentive. Now with the regulatory framework, we have the incentive to do it. And we have 2014 to do it by. So, we're going to do everything possible. So, we think that this is not an extraordinary situation in 2010. This will continue during the coming years.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Javier Garrido from JPMorgan. I'll keep most of the questions for next week, but I have one. What tariff deficit have you considered for the year 2011? And do you think that this tariff deficit is going to exceed &#x20AC;3 billion of the new cap? So, what measures are you expecting from the government in order to be able to fulfill these cap requirements? Possibly, would we be capable of what's going to happen in December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I can say, however is that, when you perform all the analysis, firstly, what we did was correct the figures for 2010 relative to 2011. And there were still 10 months to go, and I'm not sure whether you think if there are going to be any modifications or not. Well, there is a fact. And firstly, that the government has guaranteed that it will not exceed the deficit. And I think that this was a commitment they took two months ago that they will fulfill.</p>
          <p>And secondly, there's been an increase in energy prices, so that was on January the 1st. And it is to be expected, even if it's because of the curve of the load factor, that the prices will be reduced again in the second or third quarter. And that this reduction can be used to increase the remuneration of the regulated costs and do something about the deficit, I'm optimistic. And I'm optimist &#x2013; I'm an optimist, and I trust the government because, I mean, after all, they did pass a bill for that.</p>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
          <p>Well, as there are no more questions from the room, let's move on to the telephone, I think that the first one comes from BNP Paribas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, the first question is going to be asked by Mr. Jose Javier Ruiz from BNP Parib&#xE1;s.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I had one question for you. And I was referring to the results of 2010. Could you give us some figures, and if not possible, could you give us some trends as regards of margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we all know that there is a scenario in which the margins of gas are being squeezed more and more. Gas margins Paco in 2010, please. Paco Martinez Corcoles is going to answer that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's see, 2010 was a fiscal year that adjusted our gas portfolio so that it could be adjusted to our supply and demand or demand and supply. And the margins that we have obtained were very fair and very scarce to make up for the costs, and it is somewhat higher. And I'm referring to the wholesale margins. And then, the sales to end customers where we've multiplied by two. The number of contracts, we had 300,000 and now we have 600,000, mainly domestic contracts. And this is leaving certain a number of margins, but they're very tight. And specific figures &#x2013; and well later on, if you want, we can discuss this. But I am afraid I don't have the information here and now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Were you referring to combined cycles, too? Perhaps this is a recurrent question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you're referring to combined cycle production, some combined cycle production, and also because of the big production we had in terms of renewables, including wind power and hydraulic power, combined cycles have worked through restrictions and adjustments and through balancing mechanisms. And in this field, combined cycles are giving a spread of &#x20AC;1 or perhaps &#x20AC;2, variable euros. And when you link this to the rest of the remunerations that the cycles receive when you link this up to investments and to sales, the margins are pretty extensive. And they could even reach &#x20AC;17, if we bear in mind the prices at which we are selling to end customers, which is completely guaranteed and closed energy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if we were to only incorporate &#x20AC;1 or &#x20AC;2, if we were to establish remunerations at &#x20AC;1 or &#x20AC;2, we could be talking about &#x20AC;10 or &#x20AC;11 megawatt per hour in terms of margin. Is it sufficient to produce a positive EBITDA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that it's reasonable. We'll probably achieve an amortization.</p>
          <p>Yes, the next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is going to be asked by Mr. Javier Suarez from Unicredit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I have a couple of questions. The first one has to do with the CapEx that now stands at 35%. I would like to know, could you give us some details relative to those areas in which the CapEx has been reduced more, and do you think that the level of CapEx we had for 2010 would be a good indication for the next two years?</p>
          <p>And then, another question regarding business in Latin America. I think that you spoke about the growth of 12% in terms of the EBITDA, but my question is how much would that be in terms of the local currencies? And, I think that in slide 33, you were talking about 65% of provisions. And I would like to know why there's been an increase in provisions, and if this level of provisions could be an indication of what's going to happen in 2011? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as the CapEx is concerned, before the crisis, we had an investments plan of something like &#x20AC;7 billion, and we're now just over &#x20AC;4 billion. So, this, in terms of renewables, you have seen that there has been a significant stagnation. We once stood at &#x20AC;3 billion and now we are standing at &#x20AC;2 billion, and we'll continue along these lines in the next few years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, it will be more or less the same figures. It will be &#x20AC;4 billion plus, over &#x20AC;4 billion, nearly &#x20AC;5 billion. And this is something that we'll also be talking about on March the 2nd.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the increase in provisions, that has been due to a reversal that applied &#x2013; that was applied in 2009. And then had some provisions that had to do with some insolvencies. But the truth is that we don't really believe that the level of provisions that we have established for this year is that high or &#x2013; it's not going to be that high in 2011.</p>
          <p>And as far as investments go, I would like to say that basically renewables presented a reduction of the number of megawatts to be commissioned. We were talking about 2,000 and something and now we're talking about 1,700 megawatts. And the liberalized business has also had a bit of a reduction because there's been a lower demand.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I have three questions. The first one has to do with the CapEx. The &#x20AC;197 million we have seen. I would like to know if this is going to be recurrent in the next few years, or if it's just circumstantial? And then, the other two questions have to do with the levies on the taxes we can see in the different regions of Spain for nuclear power or hydraulic power. And I would like to know what you think is going to happen in terms of taxation? And also, could you say something about payments per capacity in the case of renewables? I would like to know what you believe. Is this absolutely necessary, or how is this going to unfold, or when is it going to finish? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the last question regarding capacity payments, in the talks we have held with the Spanish Ministry they have told us that there will be increases in this concept of payments for capacity, or capacity payment, for the combined cycle power stations, but especially for all of those power stations that do provide a service. And the market is not really paying for it. But this amount would have to be substantially increased over the next few years, which is what they're doing in other countries. And you know that what's happening in the U.K. in terms of the energy debate is that now with the massive arrival of unpredictable energies, as occurs with wind power and both offshore and onshore, it's necessary to have a backup. And you have to pay for that backup. In Spain, we have that backup, and it's not being paid.</p>
          <p>So, the government is very sensitive about this issue, and they want to set this into motion. And I hope and trust that over the next few weeks there will be some Ministerial Orders arising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, what about taxes in the regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is nothing new. It was mentioned by the CFO. We had some taxes of this kind in the region of Extremadura and appeals filed against it. And it reached the Constitutional Tribunal, or the High Court, and they considered the possibility of not applying those taxes. But, in case, we're going to file appeals yet again.</p>
          <p>But in any case, what we have seen is that the total sum of taxes paid in Spain are absolutely astronomical because we are talking about something about 30% of the EBITDA that is generated by the liberalized business in Spain is paying these taxes. It's nearly &#x20AC;400 million in the business that generates &#x20AC;1.3 or &#x20AC;1.2 billion in EBITDA, and this is terrible. It's 83% more than what we had last year. So, in short, it's a recurrent issue, but I think that it's being paid for. When we talk about nuclear taxes, this is already being paid. Iberdrola paid &#x20AC;500 million in this sector, so it's a very real issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>CapEx and that &#x20AC;197,000, I don't know what he's referring to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically, this year, we also had, as the President mentioned, we had the issue related to the systems that are related to the CapEx as regards homogenizing systems, et cetera, et cetera. And we've also had some CapEx because, as you know, we've bought Gamesa shares. So, let's say that, whatever has to do with systems and so forth, I think there's going to be more or less recurrent and not the other side of things. So, perhaps we could be talking about &#x20AC;100 million with systems and other things because there are other things to be considered, too.</p>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I would just like to ask you a couple of things. The first one has to do with the following; do you expect to make any strategic changes as regards hedging in Spain? Are you going to apply somewhat higher prices? And the second...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you repeat that first question because I'm afraid that I couldn't understand you? Could you repeat that first question because you were not very clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the first question has to do with a possible change of strategy in the hedging you've advertised for the last two year. Relative to what you were already doing for generation in Spain, are you considering a price increase? Will you be playing around with a price increase? And I would like to know what your hedging strategy is going to be like? And the second question has to do with the maximum ceiling applied to nuclear power stations. So, that ceiling has it &#x2013; it has been eliminated. So, will this extension be granted to the company as a function of the power stations being in a good condition, or do you think that in a way what you will have to do is implement other kinds of actions together with the nuclear power stations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that the nuclear power issue is very clear. There was pending agreements in terms of sustainable power. And there was an agreement that said that the duration of nuclear power station was supposed to be 40 years and, perhaps under certain cases, this could be reviewed. But in this case, it was limited to a political criterion. But now, it's moved on to a technical approach. And a nuclear power station, like any other facility, will last for as long as is necessary, as long as they meet the requirements that are related to safety, security, reliability, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And who has to review that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this has to be reviewed by the Nuclear Safety Council. But if the Nuclear Safety Councils says that the facilities are safe, and if they make the proper investment, they will operate in the same way that a car plant would do. And they would, obviously, have to be inspected from time-to-time to make sure that that facility or that factory has a suitable safety equipment means. So, it becomes yet another industrial component that has to be inspected on a regular basis.</p>
          <p>So, I think that it's all about being more rational and more logical. And as to regards the market, the market operates according to a systematic approach that is full of European regulations on liberalization. And the prices of energy are prices that are negotiated and bilateral and multilateral and forward negations, and it's all the same thing.</p>
          <p>With regard to taxes, we're already paying them. It's about 45% of the revenues of the power stations. It has to do with these rates they're paying because in Spain, 25% of the revenues you have are the consequence of your nuclear power is related to tax, nuclear tax and local taxes, regional taxes; 25% of the revenues are connected to the payment of taxes. As regards to the hedging system, Paco, do you have anything to say about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our sales strategy is to be on top of the market, and we are closely monitoring what's going on. And as soon as new elements crop up, like for instance the &#x20AC;0.5 per megawatt hour that is paid as if it were like a toll as is done in the rest of Europe through generation, and this is immediately incorporated as a new cost in the offers and sales to customers. And consider what's happening in Germany in terms of commodities. I think that what we have is every week, the commercial manager and myself, what we do is look into what's going on. And then, we incorporate this to the sales prices, and we are monitoring things very closely. So, there's been no long-term change in our strategy. But we monitor the market very closely. So, the answer to your question is that, yes, we incorporate all the price increases we see and that are applicable to future sales, although we always stick to our commitments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Alberto Gandolfi. I have three question. See if you can answer them today or next week. The first one is for the Chairman. You are going to talk about strategy next week, but would it be possible today to talk about external growth? Will there be something in this area all business as usual? And in generation, the decree on domestic coal with the increase in capacity payments for combined cycle plants, can you tell us how you see the possibility of closing capacities in 2013 in relation to CO2 emissions, or isn't that on the agenda today? And finally, for 2011, you have &#x2013; do you look at net profits of &#x20AC;2.8 billion, or do you see a downside and increasing costs because of interest rates, et cetera? Can you tell us something about that, or perhaps some of those questions will have to be answered next week?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I refer to the final question in my comments. And although we'll discuss it on the 2nd, our forecast for the years '11 and '12 are in line with what we expressed last year for growth under the various items. Growth between 5% and 9% on average during the period 2010, 2012. We'll discuss this in greater detail, but I can answer that question right away. And regarding the strategic issues, we'll have the opportunity of discussing them on the 2nd.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding closing capacities, Paco, can you say something about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like somebody to ask something outside Spain because Spain represents 35% of our business. It's perhaps because all the questions are in Spanish, and we're only having questions on Spain. We have our American colleagues, our British colleagues, with us, our Brazilian colleagues and Mexican colleagues. And I would like somebody to ask something about some of the other countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paco, just so that you won't have so many questions to answer. Yes, I'll be enormously grateful if they listen to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can't close capacities unilaterally in Spain. We have to apply to the Ministry. We have applied for a small fuel-oil plant close to Madrid, the only one we have left. And the Ministry considers that it cannot close it according to network reports.</p>
          <p>And we have 100 odd megawatt capacity in this small fuel-oil plant, but we'll continue with our plans for 20,000 hours in some coal-fired plants, et cetera. Base El&#xE9;ctrico considers and reality proves that it's such a wet as 2010, there are many times during the year when all the Spanish capacity, absolutely all the capacity, all the combined cycles, all of them have to be operation &#x2013; in operation at the same time.</p>
          <p>So, if we applied for that capacity closing, the answer would be no because there are times where they've all had to operate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the solution is to capacity payments, as the Chairman said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll also discuss this on the 2nd, and I think it's an interesting issue. I think that in Spain, some things we've done well and other things not so well. But things they're doing in other countries, when you massively use non-predictable energy, you need to have predictable energy alongside. Here, we've started working on predictable energy, and then we start to working on non-predictable energy, and we find we have both. And one without the other won't work. So, when we say there's a surplus, no they're indispensable. If in Spain right now combined cycle plants were shutdown, we would have serious problem because there are days when we have 10,000, 12,000, 14,000 megawatts in wind power. And the following day, we have 2,000 or just five hours later or three hours later. And you have to have an immediate response.</p>
          <p>And on a hydroelectric level, this means that we're transforming many hydroelectric power stations to be able to be capable of more peaks, increase pumping and increase the installed capacity in many hydroelectric power stations that were planned to operate for many hours at a low power. And we're transforming them to produce fewer hours at high power to be able to respond in real time to those changes, to those variations, in the production of a non-predictable system in wind power. And solar energy, much more. When a cloud goes by, it automatically stops producing. In wind power, that drop is lower. So, it's indispensable. And if it's not paid for, well measures have to be taken so that they won't run. And on the other hand, those countries they don't have it are providing the necessary incentives so that they'll be built because it's absolutely indispensable for the system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the mode of operation is different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they are not meant to operate many hours. But as Paco Martinez Corcoles said, they are meant to operate during times of restriction at certain moments to a few hours. But they're absolutely indispensable. So, there are two paths. One is to apply an extremely high price doing those few hours that would affect the whole system, or provide capacity payments that would mean that the variable cost plus a little more would be input only when they operate. And we'll have to work out of balance. Otherwise, it will be done by the countries where it hasn't been done yet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning to everyone. Two very quick questions. And I'm sorry to have to bother Paco again. The first is bearing in mind the 8,000 gigawatts in electrical reserves, last year there was a fantastic performance in hydraulic production. What is your best estimate today regarding what the drop in hydraulic volume should be in 2011 considering the reserves?</p>
          <p>And the second question is regarding the rating, and the negative prospects from Standard &amp; Poor's at the end of December. After that we've seen the regulatory changes in December. We've seen the securitization of the deficit, the improvement in the ratios regarding net debt. When do you expect to speak to them again? Or when do you think that Standard &amp; Poor's can issue another report?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Will you answer the second question, Pepe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're perfectly in touch with the rating agencies, and I think that they are more positive. And basically, they are waiting for the securitization of the deficit to be consolidated. And I expect that if the securitization process continues as we expect it to continue, that they will change the outlook later on during the process. But while in December, I think they were more concerned. Right now, they are clearly improving their outlook, at least internally.</p>

          <p>What are you going to do with 8 teras?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm delighted to answer the question, and its part of my wage &#x2013; so, last year we had 20 teras. They forecast an average year is 13, 14; and that's practically what we have to start to estimate in February because it's very hard to predict rainfall. This year we started with more water. And secondly, we've had more hydroelectric production that was statistically to be expected. But it's still a forecast. And the end of the year will have a big influence, and what I've just said may be quite different to reality. But we're pointing it at somewhat more than an average year. We could be talking about 15 terawatt hours, which is 4 or 5 terawatt hours less than next year. This is a forecast that's based on what might happen during the end of the year. That's a little bit more than an average year because we have more water in the reservoir that was estimated in the budget for an average year, and we're estimating a higher production. The year will start in October, and a new hydroelectric year will start in October, and we'll have to see how the days rolls then.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I have some questions that I hope you can answer. The first regarding Iberdrola USA, could you first give us the EBITDA and EBIT figures in relation to the assets you sold? And also, can you give us an idea of the relationship between OpEx recovery, OpEx going to revenues and the OpEx in cash?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to Iberdrola Renovables. The comment was made yesterday, but just to clarify, the gas business for Iberdrola, the parent company, is it going to keep the business; or would you prefer the scenario of Iberdrola Renovables, selling the business to a third party?</p>
          <p>And the third question would be related to ScottishPower. The last quarter, it has been said that there were positive figures regarding the developments in margins in the retail business. Can you tell us what has changed in the fourth quarter, and what is the outlook for 2011? Are we going to have more of the same? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding gas storage in the U.S., you know, that this is part of what ScottishPower had in the U.S. together with the renewables business. And we've said that the gas business for the Group is not a strategic business, so we've sold Connecticut. And this isn't a strategic business for us. So, if we found good conditions, we would be perfectly willing to study the issue. And we've said this repeatedly, and I'll repeat it again. It's not strategic for us. The recurrent figures for Iberdrola USA, do you have them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gas at Iberdrola USA and Guatemala and Latin America, the loss of life will be around &#x20AC;55 million; and Iberdrola USA for Guatemala, I don't have the exact figures, but it's around &#x20AC;40 million, I suppose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding OpEx, so what is the savings, you're making a recurrent basis in Iberdrola USA after deducting Connecticut, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Excluding Connecticut in 2011, we had recurring OpEx savings of around $120 million, in that kind of range.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The margins for the fourth quarter in the U.K. were affected by an increase in demand as a result of the low temperatures in the U.K. And on the other hand because of the tariff increase. You know that on November 25th this year, the gas tariff was increased 2.5% and electricity 8.9%. It's the first tariff &#x2013; significant tariff increase in the U.K. for &#x2013; or since 2008 because tariffs have only dropped since then. And from the trend point of view, we expect that the price position will be consolidated and that so will margins.</p>

          <p>Hello, good morning, everybody. It's Jose Lopez from HSBC. I was wondering, could you give us some details on how much capital gains you booked in relation to the divestments you made in 2010? And the second question I had was with respect to the deficit, do you think you're being overly optimistic in relation to the government promises to eliminate the deficit in 2013? We are talking, after all, about the same people that raised the legal limits two days before Christmas, I think it was. So, how credible are these promises? How credible are the current legal limits for 2011 tight deficit when we already know really that we're going to be going above &#x20AC;3 billion on current trend?</p>
          <p>And also, do you not see any danger of the government using ratio of the deficit as leverage over this sector to extract concessions, which recently saw how U.S. threw new objections to the royal degree on coal. In fact, concessions of quid pro quo in order to facilitate the second tranche of securitization. Do you have any comments on this? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Well, firstly, divestures, Pepe you could say something about those. Regards the tariff deficit, I think that this was mentioned by the Operations Director, Jos&#xE9; L. San Pedro. It's a very straightforward issue. And we have to believe in the government. We have to believe in the Parliament that has just approved that because if we have doubts about a law that has just been passed, I don't see there's any reason for this not to be carried out. They've implemented measures to contain whatever may happen. And what's happen &#x2013; what happened in the past, there was an untidy growth of certain kinds of solar technologies that produced tremendously high increases in costs in the system. So, what have they done?</p>
          <p>They've put a stop to the growth of these technologies, and they've stopped building solar power stations whether they use the thermal set or the PV technique. And secondly, they've taken actions for the solar technologies that had very high premiums and there were situations of imbalance to put a stop to that in order to subsidize sun hours of sun. They were subsidizing much more than there was in terms of hours of sun. And there were some thermal power stations &#x2013; thermal solar power station that are subsidizing 3,700, and there were other power stations that were exceeding 2,000, which doesn't seem to be reasonable. If it's 1,600 hours of sun, it seems to be reasonable to pay for those hours in the same manner you pay for the hours when there's wind. When there's no wind, you don't pay. So, this &#x2013; the actions that have been taken, and many actions have also been taken from the point of view of the social bonus and energy efficiency, which is what we the companies are paying. So, measures have been taken, and there has been a significant increase in prices. So, in the end, this is conducive to a framework that is not a declaration of principles, but it's just this.</p>
          <p>And what I can say is that we've held many talks with the public authorities, and there are number of models. And it couldn't be otherwise, and as Jose de San Pedro pointed out, these modelings, with the exception of expected situations that could occur with all the scenarios, things I think square out, more or less, reasonably with an increase in the regulated activity that is reasonable. And the price of energy, we don't know what's going to happen. It will be whatever it has to be in the future, as applies to petrol, et cetera. But in the regulated side of things, I think things could be done reasonably well. So, I would like to stress, but I can't say it otherwise, what I believe that our government is taking all the necessary steps for this to happen. And Parliament has given it support for this to be so.</p>
          <p>Well, as far as the capital gains are concerned of divestitures, we will grow some capital gains somewhat above &#x20AC;300 million before taxes. But the other thing that, let's say, that there is an issue that has to do with book value, especially in the sale of the gas from Connecticut, which shows that the rate of taxation in sales in the case of gas distributors in the United States is high &#x2013; is higher than usual. Higher than what we have in taxes applied to capital gains here in the book value. And then, there are some other non-recurrent issues that have to do with taxes. And this has reduced the non-recurrent net profits relative to last year because the higher the rates of taxation are, especially because of the sale of Connecticut gas.</p>
          <p>Are there any more questions?</p>
