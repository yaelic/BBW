          <p>Hi to everyone. This is Pierre-Andre Terisse speaking. I'm the group CFO. I'm here together with Emmanuel, with Robin and with Marion Cazenave and with Antoine Guttinger. Before we start, I just wanted to say thanks to Robin. As you know, Robin is going to be moving to other adventures. He has been significantly contributing to the improvement of the financial communication of Danone, the communication with you for the past almost three years, and I wanted to thank you very much for that, as well as for his great sense of humor which has been very important and very good. As well, at the same time, I invite you to welcome Antoine Guttinger, who is going to take over from Robin starting from the end of this month, and I'm sure you will have a lot of fun with him too, as well as he will do a very good job in communicating with you about the financial performance of the group.</p>
          <p>We'll move on to the core of the presentation and to what is I think we can say a good half. So a look at the key figures first. Evolution of sales like-for-like, plus 7%. On a reported basis, this number is bigger, plus 11.2%. This comes from the evolution of the currency, and I'll come back on that. Our trading operating margin, which is down versus the first half of last year but very much in line with what we expected and very much in line with the average margin we delivered in the course of 2009 and which is as you know our target for the whole of 2008 and EPS which is at 1.38 and reflects very unique elements. Again, I'll come back on that. But you have on the negative side the dilution from the rights issue plus some elements of scope, and on the positive one the franchise as well plus the operating performance which is at plus 7.7%. Last, cash flow, which is very high at &#x20AC;858 million, which is at 35% almost on a reported basis versus last year, which is reflecting two things; one, a very good operating performance, slightly above our target; and on the other, phasing effect for the CapEx, again I will come back on that.</p>
          <p>So, very good key figures, as for the sales and the analysis of the GATT was seven point &#x2013; well, 7% organic performance for the first half, which has been predominantly fueled by volumes with almost 10% volume progression and a negative pricing value &#x2013; pricing and mixed value element of minus 2.8%. The new things versus the previous semesters and quarters is that the ForEx is adding a significant element with plus 4.7% on the half while the scope is reflecting the exit of Frucor year ago during Q1 and Naya, and at the same time reflecting the addition of Chiquita in the course of the second quarter. More interestingly, let's look at the same numbers for Q2, which shows the some evolution with however a number of differences. The first is about currency, which has impacting favorably the first half of 4.7%, but if you look at Q2 only this number will become plus 7%, so a very significant contribution. The scope of consolidation has become positive because the only change we are talking about here is the addition of Chiquita, and then still 7% &#x2013; almost 7%, 6.9, evolution of the sales like-for-like, but with a mix volume and value which is pretty different because we are talking of 8.9%, almost 9% progression of the volumes and a negative value element, which has reduced from 2.8 as an average for the first half to 2% &#x2013; minus 2% for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So that's for the group, let's have a look perhaps at the dynamics of the different divisions. We will start with Fresh Dairy as usual, which reflects very much trends observed at group level. A very strong volume growth, 9.3%, so not very far from 10%, and sales acceleration which is at close to 7%. The important point to be noticed at this stage is that virtually all countries contribute to the positive volume growth, so showing the positive momentum across the overall division. The reset countries, and that was very important, are delivering sustained volumes and sales momentum. In particular, you remember that a few of them have been going through the first anniversary of reset. This is the case of Poland. And Poland has been showing performances, which are up versus Q1 both in volume and value with sales which have increased double digit. This is the case of France where again this &#x2013; the performance in Q2 has been higher than the one in Q1, both in sales and in volume. This is the case last of Mexico, which show as well an acceleration of sales versus the previous quarter and a rebalancing of the quality of the growth, i.e., less volume growth and little bit more sales growth. This basically shows that the effect of the reset, which we always thought will be long-lasting are proving to be long-lasting, and that's the countries in which we are investing are delivering very sustainable good growth. So, these are for the -- this is for the reset countries.</p>
          <p>And the third point to be taken into account, of course, is the particularly good momentum of some very key geographies for us. We have them mentioned on the screen, these are the U.S., which has done very well during the quarter, reaccelerating and I'll come back on that, in June. This is the case of Brazil. This is the case of Mexico, Argentina and Japan, and all these geographies are obviously key for the future of the group.</p>
          <p>One word about the evolution of volumes and pricing just to show &#x2013; because I think it's easier this way, that the convergence of pricing towards positive territories is on the right way. The peak of the negative pricing was reached in the last quarter of last year. It improved slightly in the first quarter. It improved significantly more in the second quarter of this year. And we'll be targeting a positive &#x2013; neutral to positive pricing during the second half of this year for the division. At the same time, the volume keep being strong. So we are not progressing at all from 5% as we did in Q1, but we are progressing at 9% which I think shows again the quality and the sustainability of the growth we have managed to produce in Dairy.</p>
          <p>If you take a longer-term approach to try and understand, analyze what we have been doing for the past two to three years with the evolution of the cost of milk and what we've taken from that. You see on this chart the evolution of volumes by halves and the evolution of pricing by halves for the whole division, and you see that the exit point is basically showing a strong volume growth, a strong volume momentum recovered, and at the same time on a level of pricing, which is 5% higher than what it was three years ago when we entered into this period of adjustment of cost and pricing. And therefore, this is a sign of the robustness of the model of &#x2013; in Dairy.</p>
          <p>We've chosen to show you the same for the U.S. in order to comment it. So the U.S. pricing was &#x2013; is about the same story, i.e., significant price increase taken at the time of the increase of the cost of milk, which has been for a part given back to the consumer or reinvested in order to sustain the evolution of the topline. This has resulted into a volume acceleration, which was already sensible in the second half of last year and which has accelerated this half. This is basically the result of a strategy and the performance of a strategy of focus on several products, not one. First of all, focus on Activia which keeps doing extremely well in this country and we believe this has been and remains the main driver of penetration of the markets in the U.S. But this is a result as well of a greater focus on the key category, which is as you know a segment which is dominated by European and on which we have chosen to invest with several brands including Danimals and Coolision. This is last &#x2013; the result of the launch of the Greek Yogurt by Stonyfield and then that one by Dannon, which is a segment which is doing very well. Altogether, we believe we have a very positive momentum which comes from increased penetration mainly, but also from some markets again in the U.S. which will drive part of the growth of the division in the coming years.</p>
          <p>A look at that map of the world with different clustering in terms of numbers, and you see in red the countries where the sales evolution has been negative, in light green the countries in which the sales evolution has been from zero to plus 10% and in dark green above 10%. This is, I believe, reflecting very much the challenging opportunity, which this division is facing. With the first group of countries, which is Europe where you see that the evolution of sales in Southern Europe; Spain, Greece, but also Portugal; remains under pressure. But the rest of the European countries and in particular Northern and Central Europe, I'm referring to France, I'm referring to Germany, I'm referring to the U.K., I'm referring to Poland, are doing very well and make us altogether have a positive performance, positive growth in Europe. So first group of countries where we have different dynamics, but which altogether is on the growth side.</p>
          <p>The second group of countries are the big key countries, key &#x2013; I would say emerging countries maybe not, but key growth countries for the group. These are the U.S., these are Japan, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, this is Russia as well; with the exception of Russia which is very close to double-digit but very close only. All the others are growing double-digit. And therefore, that's obviously making &#x2013; move the portfolio of the group towards this geography more and more.</p>
          <p>And then you have the last group of countries, which are the new geographies, i.e., the countries in which we have invested recently, which are building the growth of tomorrow and after tomorrow, and these countries are developing very fast as well. This is China which obviously has a great potential. This is Egypt, this is Colombia. These are countries in which we are still investing, which are small at the level of the division, but which progressively will <mark type="inaudible" /> within the portfolio and participate to the growth of the label.</p>
          <p>A word last on Dairy about products and innovation, so a very good performance of Activia again for the half and for the quarter in particular, double-digit growth. We continue stretching this brand which is progressing in virtually all countries. You have here on the screen some definition of this product. You can see a big battle in Brazil. You can see an extension of the shops, which we have launched in Mexico a year ago and which are being very successful and Activia keeps again being stretched. Beyond Activia, we keep innovating in other products. This is the case with Danonino. For instance, you see here frozen yogurt which has been launched in Spain during the second half &#x2013; the first half, sorry, the second quarter and which is working pretty well. You see as well some family pack of Danonino in Brazil. You can see Vitalinea Stevia version, which is being launched in Spain at the moment and will be pushed in September. And you see last in Griego, which are again in two major countries, being Spain and U.S. It's working very well and it's probably going to be a factor of growth again in the coming quarters and years. So again, innovation in the Dairy and we'll keep delivering new product in the coming quarters. So that's for Dairy.</p>
          <p>Let's move to Waters now, which is a fairly easy equation with two different parts, as you know, very balanced. The majority of the sales is now taking place in emerging geographies. These emerging geographies have been growing consistently double-digit for the past seven, eight, nine quarters. It keeps being the case. They keep showing a very good momentum. This is particularly the case in Indonesia, in Argentina, in Mexico. So that's the first part of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>The second part of the portfolio is the other countries, the industrialized countries, which are predominantly European countries in which, as you know, the trends for the past quarters has been difficult but improving since in particular the second part of 2009. What's happened in the second quarter is very much a confirmation that the trends in these countries keep improving. They remain difficult in Japan. They remain difficult, but gradually improving in Spain. They are definitely on the right track in France, U.K and Germany with all the three countries &#x2013; all of these three countries delivering positive volume growth and two of them, in France and Germany, delivering positive sales momentum. So if you add the emerging countries, which last year growing at the same pace, and you add to that industrialized countries which are recovering then you get to this 4.8% sales growth, which is basically the most important, the higher sales growth we've been seeing since the first half &#x2013; the first quarter, sorry, of 2008 and therefore showing the improvement of this division.</p>
          <p>Look at two of these countries, and we've chosen to show you Germany and France, the evolution of sales. So you see that in Germany starting from the second half of last year sales have started improving and this remains the case this quarter with a double-digit evolution of sales. And in France it's taken more time, but it's definitely on the right track. Volume growth became positive last quarter. We're now at sales growth, which is being positive and we are progressively rebuilding &#x2013; help rebuild the category.</p>
          <p>A word about innovation because it plays a role in this recovery. You remember that we said that we will try and enter into additional formats and for some of them more affordable formats. We had launched in France a year ago the 8-liter and 5-liters, which are doing well. We have now added a format which we think is going to be a very successful market for Volvic and this is the 3-liters, which has been launched very recently. Similarly in Spain, in a country which, as all of you know, is very severely impacted by the economic trends, we have launched a 6.25-liters version, which is &#x2013; which has been launched very recently and which we think is going to have the performance of the division. On a completely different field, you see on the right a woman with a t-shirt. The woman is Maria Sharapova. The t-shirt is the extension of the roller baby campaign, which we produced a year ago and which was extremely successful, as you know. I have tried to bring Maria Sharapova, but I have not been so successful. I am sorry for that. Instead what we've decided to do is to bring you some t-shirts. So, when you exit the room after the short session of Q&amp;A you will get one t-shirt, and be very successful on the beach this summer with it. And to be frank, we were wondering if I should wear that this morning but I decided not to do it.</p>
          <p>Last thing on the innovation, Bonafont, because we are innovating in the industrialized countries, but in emerging countries as well. We've launched as you can see here a stocking version of Bonafont, which is an extension of the range and therefore participating to the growth.</p>
          <p>Baby, so Baby another &#x2013; very good, very similar, very consistent quarter in terms of performance, 8.7% topline growth, which is marginally above the performance we delivered in Q1 of 2010, very much the same trends, i.e., on the food side the market and our positions are both stable but on the milk side things are growing very fast and growth is still double-digit for something which I remind you is roughly 75% of our portfolio. Very good performance in Asia of course with Indonesia, which is benefiting from the re-launch of SGM, with China which is doing well, but also in several countries in Western Europe, U.K. is doing particularly well. The growing-up milk category is performing very well. Poland is doing very well as well. And altogether, this is the result of categories which are growing, but as well of market share gains which have taken place in most of our markets, at least most of the important ones. You can see here the U.K., France, Turkey and as well Argentina, Brazil were despite being very small in front of sometimes very weak competitors who progressively managed to progress in these markets and to offer enough energy to the consumer, which I think is important.</p>
          <p>Again example of innovation, you have three of them on the food side and we try to extend the range in various countries where we are present on these sub-segments. The growth on the milk side with a particular focus on the growth or the growing-up milk. As you can see, in Italy we've Mellin here but also on the specialty milk as you can see on the top left and bottom-right.</p>
          <p>Medical Nutrition, last division, so again a very good performance. 10.8% topline growth, up versus the 9.3% at the beginning of the year which was marked by some transfer of some loading and reloading between the year-end of 2009 and beginning of 2010. The growth is coming from virtually all geographies, a specific mention to Germany which after several quarters proves it's the resilience of its growth, on Brazil which has been doing well despite difficulties with distributors but which are under &#x2013; progressing in terms of resolution and as well in China and the Americas which are doing very well.</p>
          <p>So one thing to be said about this division is that &#x2013; we've been saying for the past one year that we keep seeing major opportunities in extending our portfolio, in selling of new business model and extending geographically. We've decided to move, and therefore we've been doing &#x2013; we've been investing a bit more significantly than we usually do in this division in the quarter, and you will see that on the margins as well.</p>
          <p>Again example of innovation with things which are more line extension, but which represent I believe very much the right combination between the economical way of doing things and the Danone way. You can find Geli, which is drink in fact for people who can't swallow water and we are extending the flavor with free additional flavors, you can see fruits in Milupa for PKU. PKU is a disease which is hurting very often young children and is slowing down their mental developments. So, providing this nutrition is very important and providing it in a way which is enjoyable by them is equally important for their health. You see innovation &#x2013; line extension in Nutilis, KetoCal launch in the U.S., many &#x2013; and many more to come.</p>
          <p>So that was for the evolution of the sales of the division. A quick look at the geographies, to say basically three things. Number one, we are very much in line with the trends which were already observed in Q1. Number two, we'll remain on the positive side in Europe with 1.4% topline growth, so between 1 and 2% topline growth in Western Europe for the past four quarters. Asia is accelerating. This is largely coming from Baby and from Waters, with Aqua in Indonesia and the Rest of the World has delivered a performance which is at the same level as Q1, up versus the previous one, thanks to the good performance in there of Dairy in North America but also in South America, in Latin America.</p>
          <p>So that's it for the sales. I'll now move to the operating profit and the margin. So the first slide which I am sure you are very familiar with, which gives us fleet between the recurring or trading operating income and the other operating items. One thing to note is that we benefited lesser in the first half of an exceptional item &#x2013; in the other operating items for a net of &#x20AC;200 million. This was the capital gain on the disposal of Frucor for 300, net of &#x20AC;100 million investment contribution to Danone Ecosystem. So that's what's giving you a net positive of 200. We don't have anything of that kind. This year we have some small negatives for a amount which are quite small, minus &#x20AC;17 million. The rest of it is trading operating income, so which has increased by &#x20AC;74 million, which means that in terms of margin it's gone from 16% to 15.3%.</p>
          <p>So of course what is absolutely essential in reading the margin evolution of the group is the understanding of the margin evolution of the group last year. We started the year with a very high level of margin, which has come in from very strong tailwind coming from the evolution of raw material, which impacted the P&amp;L and the margin of Danone for the whole year. But we started reinvesting these amounts in order to fuel the growth only later in the year and it's impacted the margin of the second half. Hence, the very strong rebalancing you have between the margin of the first half, which is 16% and the margin of the second half which was 14.6%. Based on that, knowing that these swings <mark type="inaudible" /> this year, we said from the beginning of the year that we will be targeting a stable margin versus the average level of last year and that we will be targeting a very balanced level of margin between the first half and the second half, and therefore, this is very much what we are delivering this half with a level of margin of 15.3% to be compared with 15.31 to be precise in the full year of 2009 equally. What is currently reflected as a negative evolution in the first half will resolve into a positive evolution in the second half by about the same amount in terms of basis points.</p>
          <p>If you have a look at the bridge and the reasons for the evolution of these margins, and there is different factors, scope and currency are accounting for 1 bp, so not material altogether. Then you have three main factors, the first and foremost of them is of course the basis of comparison in terms of pricing. H1 in &#x2013; H1 of last year was largely before the restate and therefore with a level of pricing which was very high. We don't have that this half. On the other hand, this is offset by significant leverage effect coming from the volume growth, which we have experienced during this first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Second element is the country mix. There are two divisions in which we have margins in emerging countries, so in the faster growing ones are higher. These are Baby and Waters, but there is one division in which the level of margin in emerging is lower than the one we have in industrialized countries, and this is Dairy. And altogether, on a net basis, this has resulted into a negative impact on the margin by 15 basis point as you can see in the country mix. Last point, and that's obviously one of the most important, has been the evolution of the raw material, which on a net basis has contributed for minus 94 basis points on the evolution of the margin. I am saying on a net basis because this is a reflection of the steady evolution of the cost of raw material on one hand but on the other significant productivity which has offset significant part of it.</p>
          <p>A word on the evolution of milk, by the way. So you have on the screen two different charts. The one on the left is showing the evolution of the skim milk powder, so the market price which is a reference for the evolution of the cost we pay but a reference only. And you have on the right the evolution of the price we paid, which is the evolution of price we had. What we have been seeing on the evolution of the SMP is a sharp increase of the price of the skimmed milk powder on the market, which has been coming from a reduction of supply which itself has been coming from the evolution of the cost of feed. That's been very much the case with the kind of end curve throughout the first half. Since May we are seeing very different trends. We are seeing prediction coming up again on the basis of the cost of feed, which is normalizing and therefore we've been seeing for a couple of months the evolution of the SMP price coming down. Of course this will have consequences on the right part, which is the price we pay, because there is a thing &#x2013; delayed impact on the cost we pay, and we expect for the cost of the milk we buy that the peak is being reached as we talk and that we will progressively starting from now seeing an ease of the evolution of the cost of the milk we pay in the second half.</p>
          <p>Altogether, what does this mean? This is what we had initially forecasted at the beginning of the year. We thought at that time that the cost of milk would be increasing by 5 to 7%. What we see today &#x2013; what we foresee today is that for the whole year this is going to be an increase of 10%, therefore higher than the one we had forecasted. And this increase is going to be offset by a combination of leverage on the one hand, pricing on the other, and I will come back on that, and last, by productivity.</p>
          <p>So a word about productivity; you know that we've been engaging into very strong focus and initiatives on these fields because we see that as essential for two reasons, number one, to be put in front of the the evolution of the cost of raw material; and number two, because that's a way for us to fuel the investments we are doing. We have an ambition to generate &#x20AC;500 million of reduction of cost at the beginning of the year. Programs are in place. It goes through very simple but many initiatives across the different labels. You are &#x2013; hear some examples which by the way can be sometime triple wins. Triple wins in Fresh Dairy for instance, when we decided to take away the overlapping, so the pickup on the yoghurt, which is delivering money because you save packaging which is delivering a reduction of our carbon footprint emission and which last has been boosting the sales on the &#x2013; of the SKUs on which we have done that.</p>
          <p>Same thing in Waters, with a thought of reduction on the weight of the bottle of the PET and a systematic benchmark exercise we're doing in this division. And in Baby Nutrition, an example about the purchasing method, which basically means that we are together with suppliers analyzing the value of the goods we are buying and trying to allocate it better in order to reduce the cost. Altogether, this has reverted into &#x20AC;230 million cost savings in the first half, which means that we are very much on track to achieve our target for the full year.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look now at the evolution by business. We've very different drivers from one division to the other, but in all cases base of comparison which was high in the first half of last year. In Fresh Dairy, the evolution of margins basically reflects the evolution of the cost of raw material and in particular the cost of milk, plus the negative pricing element which is going to turn positive during the second half. In Waters, the evolution of margin reflects as well the evolution of the cost of packaging but also the deleveraging of our operation in Japan, which has impacted the margins significantly. In Baby and Medical, this is the primary reflection of accelerated investments in A&amp;P or in sales force and in organic initiatives with a view to fuel the business, knowing that in Baby the leverage has been pretty strong and that in Medical it's been equally strong. But as I commented to you before, we are investing into new territories, Latin America and Asia, and we are investing as well into new business matters. So that's very much it for the margins.</p>
          <p>On the rest of the P&amp;L, so you know the structure of the table as I've just reminded to you, you have on the left side the first half of 2009 including other items and trading operating income. The next is the evolution of the same for the fist half of 2010 and then you have the split between non-current or others on the one hand and underlying on the other. I have already commented the other items on the operating profit. It's basically the same at the level of net income. It's a small negative of 10 million. On the underlying side, besides the operating income one word about the financial expenses which have been significantly reduced as a result of on the one hand the capital increase but on the other as well the restructuring of the debt which took place in the last part of 2009. Income tax 280 million, which means that we've an implicit tax rate of 24% this quarter, which is slightly below the one we expect for the year which will between 24 and 25. Net income of affiliate progressed under the effect of better earnings from Huiyuan and from Yakuts, which is offsetting &#x2013; more than offsetting the lots of contribution from Wahaha after the disposal in the second part of last year. And this is giving you net income group share which amounts to &#x20AC;848 million.</p>
          <p>So I skip the tax, not much more to say on the EPS, so &#x20AC;848 million which against the underlying net income of last year, so abstract from the capital gain of Frucor is progressing by 17%. In front of that you of course have more shares. This is basically 20% more share compared to the 520 million, which we have on the restated column in the middle, which means that the EPS has been decreasing by 2%. And the analysis of this 2% is roughly the following. 12% of dilution for the half which is going to be 5% for the full year as expected, the negatives scope impact from the disposal of Wahaha for a percent of about 2.5, and on the other hand a positive impact from ForEx and the like-for-like growth of EPS which has been 7.7%.</p>
          <p>I will conclude with free cash flows and balance sheet. On the free cash flow, you see here a very significant increase, 135%, to 858 million. There is basically two factors driving that. Number one, marketing performance, which has been above 10%, so above what we target for the full-year, and which is very solid. Number two, on the other hand, a level of CapEx which has been as you can see on the screen 3.3% of sales, i.e., at a lower base than what we have as an expectation for the full year which will be 4.5 to 5%, and therefore this is inflating the performance of H1 by the same amount. This cash flow has been used to pay the dividends, cash flow minus the payments of dividends plus some additional elements like the &#x2013; some revaluation of the puts plus some mark-to-market of &#x2013; in IAS of derivatives has resulted into a slight increase of the debt to &#x20AC;6.7 billion. Obviously, the bigger part of the deleverage traditionally, so it takes place in the second half, i.e., after we have paid the dividends. On the rest of the balance sheets, the balance sheet inflated by about 10% and this is very much a reflection of the appreciation of most currencies against the euro, which is a pretty [indiscernible a bit everywhere in the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So that's basically what I wanted to tell you about H1, which again we regard as being a very solid first half of the year. As for the rest of the year, we remain focused on a few priorities. The first of them is to keep the investing where we think there are growth opportunities and very significant ones. I'll mention again, they are in the U.S., they are in Russia with <mark type="inaudible" />, they are in Brazil with the recent opening of the second factory, they be in Asia, western Asia and in Latin America, maybe <mark type="inaudible" />. We have a lot of sizeable opportunities and we keep investing behind them. Second priority, to work very hard on productivity, because again this is a condition for investing on one hand and this is as well one of the level we have to face the evolution of the cost of raw material and in particular the inflation we are seeing this year. And the third priority is of course the focus on free cash flow, which remains absolutely key in the group.</p>
          <p>Based on that and based on the result of the first half, we reconfirm our guidance. We upgraded in fact the guidance we give for the topline for the full year moving from at least 5% to at least 6%. We reconfirm that we are targeting a level of margin for the full year, which will be stable like-for-like versus the level of margin of last year. And we reconfirm that we are targeting a free cash flow comfortably above 10% growth in reported terms for the full year.</p>
          <p>That's all I wanted to say. And now Robin and I will be pleased to take your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good morning. It's Polly Barclay from JPMorgan Cazenove. On pricing in Dairy please, will we see positive pricing in Dairy in the second half given input cost pressures? And also, following on from that a comment on the competitive environment you're currently seeing please, again specifically in Dairy.</p>

          <p>Good morning. On the competitive environment, not much to say; i.e., this is very much business as usual. Business as usual is tough competition in all markets, but again nothing which will be noticeable over and above what I've just said. On the pricing, we have indeed already passed some targeted price increase, as we said we will be doing. We have passed some price increase in Poland on <mark type="inaudible" /> product. We have passed some price increase in Mexico as well. And we've done that again in a very focused and selective manner in cases and markets where we thought that, number one, the equation from a cost standpoint was justifying it; and number two, this would not perhaps stake our competitive position. So, that's what we've done so far and there will probably be more &#x2013; a few more, but again always targeting and always very focused during the second half of this year.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's David Hayes from Nomura. If I could just get back to slide nine in the interesting chart on the absolute volume performance, if you would just split out that first half first quarter, second quarter, can you just confirm that that trend would be continuing that you would have a higher absolute volume performance second quarter versus first quarter? And then secondly, just on the A&amp;P change during the first half down 60 basis points partly due to the efficiencies, you're up 70 I think basis points in the second half. Can you just give us a bit of a feel for what the progression of A&amp;P will be through this year and second half as well? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the volume side, first, you've seen that the volume evolution during the second quarter of this year has been strong but not as strong as it has been during the first quarter, plus 9.3% in the second quarter verus plus 12.5% in the first quarter. It's obvious that we don't expect the pace of volume growth to remain at or close to 10% once we are entering into a completely normalized basis. This being said, we think that we have been building sustainable volume growth. On the A&amp;P, so the level of A&amp;P this half has been of 12%. 12% is basically very much in line with what we expect for the full year. We've said that we expected around 12%. This is off the 12.6% which we had in first half of last year, but which was as many other items, a pretty high number and therefore not sustainable. I will add a comment on this point, which is that as you know we have engaged in productivity in many different areas. One of the area in which we have done that has been media as well. We have targeted productivity for this year, which means that &#x2013; targeting stable spending means that we are increasing our communication and our power of communication to the consumer, but overall a percentage which for me is very much in line with what we expected and what we target for the full year.</p>

          <p>Hi. Deborah Aitken of Bryan, Garnier. Could I just go back to the first question? You mentioned as one example Poland where you said we'd already passed the 12-month price reset there. Could you perhaps give us an indication overall in terms of Dairy of what percentage are currently at the 12-month pass rate and where the others stand at nine-month's stage or six-month's stage to try to understand where pricing will be going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of pricing evolution you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the case of Poland we've turned back to positive this quarter. In the case of other markets, we have been coming back closer to zero, remaining either slightly negative or slightly positive, but basically it's normalizing at the pace we expected with &#x2013; and that's very important, the sales momentum. So I am not talking of volumes. I am talking of volumes plus price. The sales momentum, which overall in the case of all these markets remains positive. So I have mentioned France where the sales have even accelerated between Q1 and Q2 with a pricing which has been progressing, i.e., going back towards the positive number. I am talking of Poland obviously. I have already mentioned that and the sales have been better in Q2 than in Q1. I am talking of Mexico where the pricing remained negative, but is quickly converging and the sales altogether remain very solid. I could talk about the U.S. where things are progressing obviously very solid and growing very rapidly. I could talk of Russia as well which is delivering as you have seen a positive performance, in fact very close to double-digit performance. So things are really going &#x2013; I mean they remain very solid on &#x2013; in all the &#x2013; rest of the countries and they remain for all of them with a convergence of the pricing elements towards zero being at different stage depending on the countries.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that &#x2013; I mean, that's basically a reason which is not country mix and not input cost. Primarily, it is indeed impacted by &#x2013; fueled by volume leverage, negative pricing and other elements.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>If you go into more detail, you go from more detail to more detail, I think there's already quite a lot of detail on how we derive the 15.3%. So, we would like to stick to this level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And frankly I mean, just to give some elements anyway, there is no mystery about the fact that the leverage is more than 100 basis points and the negative pricing is equally more than 100 basis points. The net of the two is a positive. So, volume leverage is in excess of the negative pricing effect. And then you have a few other elements. As you rightly mentioned, the A&amp;P is contributing positively, but on the other hand the evolution of sales force is contributing negatively because there are some businesses in which when we need to invest we need to invest in sales force more than in A&amp;P, and Robin is right, you have a lot of different elements, I'm not sure we want to comment on that.</p>

          <p>Erik Sjogren from Morgan Stanley. Firstly, a question on the raw materials. You described milk you expected to be up by about 10% this year. How about the total raw material portfolio? And then secondly, on the productivity, the &#x20AC;500 million you mentioned, is this a net number of any cost for implementing this? And is it actual restructuring or is it changes within the existing organization that you're simply working smart to?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The net &#x2013; is the 500 million, is it net of any cost of implementing these productivity gains?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the productivity gains are &#x2013; is this &#x2013; is that for restructuring of the organization or is it within the existing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's really very much along the examples I've mentioned. So it's within the existing parameter of the portfolio, it's more continued productivity, ongoing productivity rather than restructuring program with cost, which will be associated, in any case it is including everything. On the first question which is the evolution of the cost of EMEA, the rest of the roadmap is having some plus or minuses. Altogether they will be very much in line with what we expected, which means that the evolution of roadmap altogether will be impacted by the milk and that means two points more than what we expected at the beginning of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just coming back to dairy in the first quarter, in Q1, it seem to me most of the growth in dairy was emerging markets and the U.S. where as it seems in Q2 that Europe has been a lot better and you flagged improving momentum in Spain, for example. I'm just wondering whether you can walk us through some of your bigger European dairy markets, how they're doing in volume value, if you've got market share that would be helpful as well thinking of France, Ukraine and Spain primarily? That's the first one. And the second one is a smaller question really. It's more about Water, you flagged Japan and Mexico as being weak spots in Q1. I had thought both Japan and Mexico were kind of one-quarter issues, but it seems like really Japan has continued to be a negative and although quite small it seems to be having quite big impacts on beverage margins. I just wonder whether you could talk to us about what's happening in Mexico and Japan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Dairy, European countries, so as I said, quite different cases in fact. To take the markets you've mentioned, clearly Spain is under pressure. It's been the case for the past one to two years. It is slightly more the case for the past few months, as the economic situation deteriorate and it's clearly impacted the consumption trends. So, we are talking of an evolution of sales in Spain, which is clearly negative. That's &#x2013; I mean the same applies to other Southern European markets, which are on the other hand less significant for us. This is the case of Greece, but Greece is really peanuts in our portfolio in terms of importance. This is the case of Portugal, which is quite small. And then you have the other markets. I have been already commenting on France and on the fact the reset has been giving extremely good results, that the results keep doing well, that Q2 has been better than Q1. In fact, the evolution of sales has been mid single digits in France in Q1, so that's a clear positive. You mentioned the U.K and the U.K is doing well. You mentioned Germany and Germany is doing well. You mentioned Poland and Poland is doing well. So that's what we are facing with &#x2013; in terms of competition, progression of market share in most markets.</p>
          <p>With respect to Water, Japan is indeed the very last market in which we still have to fix things. It's a more complex market for us for different reasons. Number one, because it is a very &#x2013; it is a market in which we are seeing today a very fierce competition. So it's not only a problem on the category, but it's a level of competition which is extremely high from local players and international players. And in addition to that, it's a market which is a bit more complex for the way we distribute; we are going through different distributors. So Japan is probably a market which will take a bit longer from our side to fix. We are in the process of doing that. I hope that by the end of the year that will be improving. What I am saying, it is the Russians because Spain on the other is very much on track for the recovery, and the three other markets I have mentioned are I think completely out of these very difficult market conditions we have been seeing for the past years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just come back, I mean you sometimes give us the growth of your four, five blockbusters in Dairy. I think you said Activia was double-digit. I was just wondering whether you could maybe firm up a more specific number on Activia and tell us what the growth rates were for the other three or four blockbusters, either in the Q2 or in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robin is saying no, but still I will give you some elements. So, Activia is clearly doing extremely well, double-digit. Actimel remains a bit weak. We are currently testing new versions of Actimel in selected markets. It is clearly too soon to have results of that. But there is a clear need for innovation as I have been mentioning for several quarters now. And we are at the moment testing a renovative version, what we call Actimel 2D. Danonino, as you have seen, is doing quite well, not at all at the pace of Activia of course, but definitely quite well. Danacol is still doing well, and that's very much it for the key products of the group, of Dairy.</p>

All these red markers you signed, what is the weighting based on weighting to Dairy?

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is about pricing. So, as I understand you right, you still think the pricing will be negative for the full year. Could there be a chance at Q1 that we could see already positive pricing in Q1 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've indicated is that we expect pricing to become so &#x2013; value growth that is to become positive in the second half of the year, and then it remains to be seen how quick it will be in the second half of the year, whether the second half as a whole will be positive, so which by definition means that definitely in Q1 2011 we will be in positive territory.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Sara Welford at Citi. Sorry to carry on, on same slide, but in terms of the red geographies, I guess the significant country there, you've talked about Spain and Portugal but it's Italy as well. Can you talk about whether you're seeing any signs of recovery there? Does that &#x2013; has it decelerated? Has it &#x2013; is it going back on track? And how is, I think you rolled out the version of Densia there, so how is that going and do you see that rolling out elsewhere? And then finally, in terms of your price mix, you're talking about it, towards the second half you're seeing a recovery. Can you &#x2013; without giving the specifics, but can you talk about how you see the pricing versus the &#x2013; specifically the mix? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, on the marketing Southern Europe, I don't think we can talk of any form of improvements. It basically remains difficult, and I think at least at this stage as we talk today, it's difficult to talk of any signs of improvement. So, if you look at the overall division, the improvement is coming basically from the rest and the rest is of course the vast majority of our sales. The only very significant country in the one you've mentioned being Spain, but basically the rest of the division keeps doing well and accelerating. Spain remains a difficulty, and frankly given the economic context, I would not expect that to improve significantly in the coming &#x2013; in the short-term at least. Despite that we keep &#x2013; I mean we keep working on innovation in order to sustain our position and to fuel the markets. You mentioned Densia, and Densia has been very successful. It's still very successful in this market, in Spain. I mentioned the frozen version of Danonino we have started doing as well. I mentioned as well the new version of Aptamil, which is being tested in this particular market. So, that's clearly the approach in a market which is difficult, keep accelerating the innovation in order to progressively go back to positive territories. And these, you know, are the two on which we have sufficient ability which are Densia and the frozen yogurt are doing well. Last, on the pricing mix element, most of the improvement will come from the pricing basically.</p>

          <p>Good morning. It's Jeff here from Exane BNP Paribas. Given the increase in milk cost, I am just a little bit surprised that the category as a whole &#x2013; at least in Western Europe and in the U.S., we've not seen any sort of sequential price movement for the category as whole yet, because obviously you've got your input sort of productivity programs, et cetera, but that can't be case across the industry. Would you be expecting sort of sequential price movement in Western Europe for the U.S. or elsewhere for that matter, as we move through the second half for the category as a whole? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we have in &#x2013; already in some markets taken the initiative putting price increase. I have mentioned Mexico and Poland. And the reason why we have done so is that we thought that will not be detrimental to a competitive position and therefore that the industry overall will be putting price increase, and I understand you question is about other markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought you may not have, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I do understand. I am just reminding that. And I'm reminding that to say that this is something we have started doing and I have said already that we will keep using that tool if and when we think it is relevant and threatening our competitive position in different markets. That could well happen in some of the markets. In fact when you look at the amount of pressure, which is being put by the two main players in the U.S. markets, we think this has reached the peak and in other markets there may be some need for most of the players in the industry to pass some price increase as well. But we don't take that as &#x2013; it's very much like we said, we take that market by market, product by product. We think we've been extremely good at the exhibition of the resets. One of the reason why we have been so good at that is that we've taken decisions on local basis based on the local environment and that's something we want to keep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the input costs, second half versus first half, will they be higher or lower in the second half on a like-for-like basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at the evolution on the chart, you see that the input cost has been the milk &#x2013; at least has been increasing throughout the first half of this year and we think that this has peaked. So basically, as a comparison of average to average, we assume that the input cost will be higher in the second half than they are in the first, which means that when I'm talking of a 10% increase of the milk price for the whole year, it means a bit less in the first half and a bit more in the second half. So that's what we assumed. So it means that the pressure of input cost on the margins in the second half will be higher. This being said, there is one element which will change completely the picture and this element is the absence of negative pricing in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've moved Activia and Actimel and you've changed your message &#x2013; you're advertising in one of &#x2013; two of your main markets, France and U.K. Could you give us an update of the performance achieved in the first half, if you've noticed something? Could you also update us on what has been said and how you analyze and view the meeting with the EFSA? And I think Activia was one of your weakest brand in your blockbuster. You've tried to find a new way to follow with a new concept or something. Have you find something? Are you web testing something, so what about &#x2013; because you moved the diet range to the &#x2013; under the Activia brand. So there is nothing left on the concept.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it's a bit harsh to say that, but I'll come back on it. On the performance of the products for which we have changed the way we advertise, basically same trends. Same trends doesn't mean that everything is positive everywhere. But it means that we are very much in line with what &#x2013; the performance we were delivering before the change, which means that Activia keeps performing extremely strong and Actimel is obviously not in such a strength. And I won't give you numbers, otherwise I would need to leave it to you by markets and by products and by SKUs and so I won't. Now &#x2013; but it's basically &#x2013; there is no change of trend. We have seen that already in France and the U.K. in the first two months of the year, and as we move forward it's basically getting on firm. We regard that as something which is behind in terms of immediate impact on the performance of the brands.</p>
          <p>On EFSA itself, there was a meeting I believe at the very beginning of June in Boronia. That was a big meeting not only with Danone, but with many participants from the industry and many other people. We found the outcome pretty positive, two-fold; number one, because EFSA publicly &#x2013; some representative of EFSA publicly stated that they would be engaging into more dialogue with representative of the industry and we think &#x2013; I think the dialogue is the only way to progress. And secondly, because they decided to go and organize workshops and workshops are for sure going to be fairly more efficient than big meetings in order to find adequate targeted and complete tradition for the categories we're in. By the way, the first two workshops are going to be dealing with immunity on one hand and with growth on the other. So, these are very much the topics we are dealing with, with Activia and Actimel. So things are progressing. I repeat what I've been saying I don't think there will be any change in the short-term. I think this is going to be &#x2013; and the outcome will be the result of progressive dialogue and a better understanding with EFSA which will take months, but we're on the right track basically.</p>
          <p>You're last question was about Tyfin. I think it's fair to say that Activia and Tyfin somehow are playing on territories, which are very close and not the same because one is about weakness and the other one is about digestion, but they're related somehow. And Tyfin has been probably cannibalized a bit by Activia, hence the need to recover by different positioning. So far, we've not been successful in &#x2013; to finding the positioning which will make it sufficiently different and growing by itself. As you have seen, we are launching a new version with Stevia in France, which could be an interesting asset to redevelop the brand. So we have to monitor the results in the coming quarters.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my first question is, can I &#x2013; did you intend to move other countries by &#x2013; in terms of advertising other than the U.K. and the &#x2013; I think France?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we intend to move &#x2013; we have really started moving the rest of the countries. And we'll move similar to what we have done in France and the U.K. We'll move all the countries by basically September, at the end of September of this year. I think we've already done that in other countries, in Spain, next in Hungary. What else do we have? Well, I mean there's a whole schedule of switching and again, once we've taken the decision, it's up to the countries to define the execution in the right timing, but that will be before September.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Our next question today comes from Jeremy Fialko of Redburn Partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. It's Jeremy Fialko at Redburn here; a couple of questions for you. The first one is on Fresh Dairy, and where there any countries where growth in Q2 was notably slower than it was in Q1 and any reasons behind that? And secondly, on your pricing strategy in Dairy, I think you'd previously gone on record and saying that you would not going to be leading prices up, yet now you seem to be changing your view on that. Could you explain why that might be the case? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think you can remember us having said that we would not lead. Similarly, I don't think we will have said that we will lead, just because it's really a matter of, as I said, about the reset, taking things country-by-country and taking a pragmatic approach. That's very much the way we look at things. So in two instances, which are the two I mentioned, and I repeat it's likely that there will be more, we've taken the decision because of the whole parameters, because of the evolution of the costing, because of the evolution of the performance of all brands, we've taken the decision to take pricing proactively. Again, I think there will be more probably during the second half and there could be as well movements in term of pricing coming from competition. Again, we don't take a dogmatic approach on that. We don't consider it is our responsibility to move up. We don't consider either that we have to wait and see what the others are going to do, because we are facing markets which are very different taken one-by-one with very different dynamics, very different competitive position.</p>
          <p>On Fresh Dairy products, the markets which have slowed, I would say, are the red ones. Turkey is the clear one. That's a pretty difficult market and this market has slowed. Spain I think is lower than what it was in Q1, not significantly but slightly lower. So there are a handful of markets which are indeed slower than the one we &#x2013; than &#x2013; sorry, than what they have delivered in terms of performance during the first quarter. I don't know if Robin wants to complement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take the last question from Pablo [JPMorgan Securities].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. <mark type="inaudible" /> a couple of questions. First of all, I have to say I'm a bit surprised on the need to increase guidance in the Dairy business. You are telling us here that Dairy costs are higher than expected in the second half apparently, which has unfortunately increased prices. The category is clearly elastic. So obviously, you are trying to tell us you have a &#x2013; a lot of confidence in your targets. But if you can comment, what was the need to increase that guidance and whether that was mostly related to a performance in Dairy or was it coming from somewhere else? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question, is mix in terms of emerging markets and developed markets in yogurt an issue like it is Water? I mean, clearly your emerging markets still seem to be doing very well, but that doesn't get raised as an issue as it is in Water. So if you can comment on that. And the third one, maybe baby nutrition doesn't get enough attention, but I am always so impressed by your franchise in Indonesia and China, your two largest markets in baby formula. But how is that really doing? I mean is it up 10%, 20%? Every quarter Johnson tells us how they are growing in China, Danone does not, but comment on the growth and on the progress with your low price point offerings that you are launching in Indonesia and I believe you are launching also in China. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, there is many questions in one. I will try to take them one by one. On Baby in Asia, yes, things are doing very well. We just &#x2013; it's just not our policy to disclose the progression market by market. We don't think we need that, but the performance is just very, very good in both markets, and by the way even stronger in Indonesia where the conjunction of very strong super premium brands, which is Actimel, plus the re-launch of SGM which has really made this product far more attractive than it was in terms of packaging, content and the way we sell it, plus indeed the test on <mark type="inaudible" />, which continue but show that there is a real potential. All that is basically giving a very good performance in Indonesia. The same applies to China, and I appreciate &#x2013; I mean Johnson is growing but that's basically a market and a category where many people are growing including ourselves.</p>
          <p>On the mix between developed and emerging markets, as I said, there are two businesses in which the level of margin in emerging are higher than in developed. These are Water and Baby. You will tell me that in Water it doesn't show up when we look at the evolution of margin, but as I said, that's being primarily driven by the evolution of the cost of <mark type="inaudible" /> this quarter &#x2013; this half, sorry, plus the deleverage of Japan. So we are at the end of dealing with the deleverage of the industrialized countries. This is a last one. Going forward, it's clear that the difference in margin between the industrialized countries and the emerging countries is going to be a factor of improvement of margin for the whole division. Dairy is not in this position yet. Dairy is in a position where emerging countries, and I am including the U.S. for this purpose in this case, are lower than the level of margin we have in Western Europe, the gap is reducing year-after-year, but we are still not yet at the level we would like to be and that's a priority in terms of margin. We are not so far by the way, but we are not there yet. So that's something which is going to be a drag, not a very significant but a drag on the performance of margins of the dairy in the coming years. Then there are many other factors including the leverage, including the pricing, including all the ones you know. So I'm not worried about that. It's true that the dynamics are not exactly the same and that for one, two, three years we'll have to keep that into account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> is it a drag on pricing, on price mix, on topline, emerging market growth in yogurt compared to developed markets, is that a drag on price mix, on margin? And you're commenting on margins, what I'm saying, is it a drag on price mix?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>

          <p>No?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I am saying on margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's on margins, not on pricing mix. Then the outlook &#x2013; I mean the question you asked is a very good one. Basically, the reason why we increased our guidance is that &#x2013; you mean, you've seen all the divisions, you've seen all the businesses, all the geographies, and it's very clear that there are areas where consumption trends remain difficult but at the same time there are areas where following the resets, following the investments we've been putting in place, following the investments we keep putting in place, we have accelerated our growth. So with the first half at plus 7%, given our medium-term guidance of at least plus five, we &#x2013; the medium-term guidance at &#x2013; of at least plus 5, we have decided to increase our guidance for the full year at, at least plus 6, which I believe is a sign of confidence in what we see from the evolution of our business.</p>
