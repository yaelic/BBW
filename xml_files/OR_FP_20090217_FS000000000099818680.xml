          <p>We are going to wait until it is 9 o'clock sharp, if you don't mind. Caroline has a Swiss watch and will tell us exactly when we should start.</p>
          <p>Okay, good morning, welcome to this meeting. We will be presenting the 2008 results. I would first of all like to begin by introducing the Vice Chairmen who are around me. I will begin with the ladies; Brigitte Liberman whom you know, whom you saw last year and who is at the head of the Active Cosmetics Division; Marc Menesguen, whom you also know, who is at the head of the Luxury Products Division; Jean-Jacques Lebel last time was on the other side, since he was at the head of the Professional Products Division, and for the first time this year he is at the head of the Consumer Products Division; Christian Mulliez needs no introduction, of course; and Nicolas Hieronimus is the new head of the Professional Products Division and he is the successor of Jean-Jacques Lebel.</p>
          <p>So, now you know everyone and I would like to ask Jean R&#xE9;gis Carof to give you a few indications on the way in which this meeting is going to be organized. We made a very small change which I'll explain afterwards; just a small change.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Before the presentations begin I would like to give you a few practical indications regarding the meeting. You will have found headphones for interpretation at the entrance of the room. The channels for the two languages available are shown here on the screen. I suggest that you switch now to the channel you wish to listen to. A Wi-Fi Internet connection is available; the hostesses can lead you to the room where the computers are available. So also please turn off your cell phones or at least do not let them ring.</p>
          <p>You received the booklet with the numbers in two languages which Mr. Mulliez will be commenting. Mr. Agon's booklet will be given to you after the break. There are many of you attending the meeting; many of you are in the second room which will be treated in the same way as this one, especially at the time of question and answers. I would like to ask Caroline Millot to confirm that you can hear us in the other room. Yes, everything is fine. You can hear us. Thank you, Caroline.</p>
          <p>So, on your seats you will have found a card for questions in writing during the first stage. Do not hesitate to ask your questions in writing. During the presentations, the hostesses will be picking up the cards that you will hand them. And during the question time, following the presentations, you will be able to ask your questions live whether you're in this room or in other room, but please ask only one question at a time, please give your name and the company you represent; and you can be given the floor again later on, if you wish.</p>
          <p>Mr. Agon's presentations and those of the Vice Presidents are broadcast live on the loreal-finance.com website. All of that will be available later on this afternoon and you will also be able to download the podcast for the meeting; and the buffet will be served upstairs on the first floor, as usual, and we encourage you to go upstairs immediately after the presentation for lunch. Mr. Agon now has the floor.</p>

          <p>We have a slightly more limited buffet this year. We are in the process of trying to save, but I think you will enjoy it nevertheless.</p>
          <p>We changed the order slightly this year, and I think you'll understand, why. We'll begin with the presentation of the numbers by Christian Mulliez, not quite new because you discovered them yesterday evening, but Christian Mulliez will be commenting on the figures. And then, I asked each of the Heads of the divisions to give you a presentation slightly more comprehensive than during the previous years; not just a list of all the launches of the past year, but a complete analysis of the past year and the prospects for 2009. The analysis per activity, per division, is the best way to understand the dynamism of the group.</p>
          <p>And we're now going to begin with Christian and the presentation of the numbers.</p>

          <p>Translator: Good morning to everyone. Presentation of L'Or&#xE9;al's financial statement in 2008 will include some elements pertaining to sales, earnings, cash flow situation, the balance sheet, and the dividend situation.</p>
          <p>Consolidated sales in 2008 amounted to &#x20AC;17.542 billion, up by 6.6% at constant exchange rate, so like-for-like growth was established at 3.1%. External growth impact was positive at 3.5%. Net results from the consolidation of Yves Saint Laurent the 1 of July of 2008, consolidation of the</p>
          <p>Canan company in Turkey, CPS in the United States, in January 2008, integration, 100% integration of the Club of Beauty Creators as of April, CollaGenex acquired by Galderma on April, and the impact of a full year consolidation of American distributors of Professional Products, Beauty Alliance and Maly's West acquired in 2007. After a negative exchange rate impact of 3.8%, the increase like-for-like amounted to plus 2.8%.</p>
          <p>A few examples concerning the consolidated exchange rate, in 2008 another time we've recorded a negative exchange rate impact with, in particular, the U.S. dollar at minus 6.5%, the pound at minus 13.9%, the Russian ruble minus 3.9%, Canadian dollar minus 5.8, and Mexican peso minus 8. But we've recorded a few foreign exchange gains: the Chinese yuan plus 2.5% and Japanese yen plus 7.1%. In 2008, the euro accounted for 35.4% of our order income to be compared to 35.2, almost similar, in 2007.</p>
          <p>Now, consolidated sales for the different branches and divisions. Professional Products, first of all, increased like-for-like by 1.3% and 7.3% at constant exchange rates. Consumer Products rose by 4.1% like-for-like and 4.5% at constant exchange rates. Luxury Products up 0.7% like-for-like, plus 9.9% at constant exchange rate. We could see here the effect of the Yves Saint Laurent acquisition. Active Cosmetics plus 4.2% like-for-like and plus 4.2% at constant exchange rate. We'll talk about The Body Shop later on, but the figures are plus 4.6% like-for-like. Dermatology, Galderma experienced a successful year and rose by 17.1%.</p>
          <p>Let us look now at the different geographic areas. In Western Europe, the figures for like-for-like were minus 0.3% and plus 3.6% at a constant exchange rate. In North America the figures were minus 4.8% like-for-like and minus 0.2 at a constant exchange rates. Rest of the World experienced very sustained growth at plus 13.8% like-for-like and plus 15.8% at constant exchange rates. Rest of the World represented in 2008 32% of our cosmetic sales compared to 29.3% in 2007.</p>
          <p>Let us now look more in detail at the sales in the Rest of the World area. In the document that you have on the screen you can see that the development of Asia, excluding Japan, picked up speed in 2008; growth rate was 20.2%. Japan rose this year at plus 2.9%, almost 3%. In Eastern Europe, growth amounted to 21.1%, Latin America recorded a growth rate of plus 6.7% and in the countries of Africa, Middle and Far East and the Pacific we saw a growth of plus 8.1%.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the operating profit, at the P&amp;L. The gross margin, first of all, 70.1% of the sales compared to 71% in 2007. A number of factors have contributed to this situation. First of all, as we can see on this document there were a number of foreign exchange gains and losses. You know that it is the corporate policy to try to cover a significant part of our exposure to the foreign exchange transactions. We tried, in fact, to make it possible for purchases in plants and commercial subsidiaries to limit the level of uncertainty on these factors. Classically, what we do is we operate through futures contracts and foreign exchange options. The ForEx gains and losses on these instruments are entered, low down in the P&amp;L. By restating this factor, by reallocating to the gross margin 2007 and 2008, the corresponding share of foreign gains and losses, it appears that we have a difference of 20 basis points and the gross margin deteriorated according to the situation by 70 basis points.</p>
          <p>Moreover, by excluding the effect of the YSL consolidation, we can see that the gross margin only drops by 50 basis points. That being said, we've been negatively impacted by the contraction of several factors: first of all, the increase in the price of raw materials; secondly, there was the increase of provisions for obsolete products for slow moving goods. We are talking here about prudential provisions. There was a significant increase in this provision at the end of 2008 and this resulted in a slowdown of the sales during the fourth quarter and there was a slight shrinkage of volumes in 2008 also.</p>
          <p>To counter-balance these negative effects, the gross margin has enjoyed favorable conditions in terms of direct costs on packaging the purchases, of packaging items, consumptions, and the productivity of labor. There were constant programs to improve the efficiency of our industrial setup. We continued with these efforts and managed to restrain or to limit the drop in the gross margin by 250 basis points.</p>
          <p>Let us now continue with the reading of the consolidated P&amp;L. R&amp;D are up by about 4% and flat as a percentage of the sales at 3.3%. A&amp;P costs at 30.1% of the sales have increased by 10 basis points compared to 2007. This increase, as we had announced at the end of August, has been confirmed in October; it's much higher from half year to half year. We can see that the rate during the second half of 2008 was 30.4% of our sales, compared to 29.7% in the first half of 2008 and 29.6% during the second half of 2007, which means that we've significantly increased our A&amp;P costs.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;As at &#x20AC;3.779 billion account for 21.5% of our sales. Efforts made to cap our operating costs have been hampered by the full year integration of distributors of Professional Products in American hair salons, and by the way, the structure of their P&amp;L is quite different from what it is in the rest of the group. Then, there was the increase in the depreciation of intangible assets and the mix effect linked to conversion rates. These factors account for about 30 basis. Excluding the three factors, the SG&amp;As remained flat as a percentage of the sales.</p>
          <p>Let us talk now about foreign exchange gains and losses. There was an overall ForEx gain of &#x20AC;58 million. Now income from operations was &#x20AC;2.724 billion or 15.5% of the overall sales; or it would be 15.8% of the sales if we were to exclude the dilutive impact of the YSL acquisition.</p>
          <p>Let us now look at the profitability by branch and by division. Profitability of the Professional Products division remained flat in 2008 at 21% of overall sales. Profitability of the Consumer Products slightly down at 18.9% against 19.1% in 2007. Half of the drop in the profitability of the Luxury Products division is attributable to the YSL integration, as you can see on the right hand side column; and Active Cosmetics profitability was recorded at 20.1%. The Body Shop derives all of its sales or earnings during the second half of each year, and of course, The Body Shop was particularly impacted this year by the lower level of store traffic as of October, especially in the United States and in Great Britain over Christmas and New Year's Eve; and this accounts for a sharp decrease in the profitability of The Body Shop. One last point, profitability of dermatology, Galderma has increased greatly in 2008 to reach 18.7%.</p>
          <p>Now, let us look at the different geographical areas. If we take into account the dilutive impact of the Yves Saint Laurent acquisition, we can see on the right that there is a new improvement of profitability in Western Europe at 22.8%, a significant degradation of profitability in North America. There was a particularly rough year in North America, especially for the Luxury Products and Professional Products divisions. And we also see a new increase in the profitability of the rest of the world area at 17.1%.</p>
          <p>From the operating profits, we are now going to move on then to the net earnings excluding non-recurring items, which is in fact the basis of calculation of our earning per share. Financial debt level remained stable at &#x20AC;174 million. A slight increase in the average interest rates of euro-denominated debt at 4.77% against 4.35% in 2007 was compensated by the strong drop in the cost of our dollar-denominated debt at an average rate of 2.91% in 2008 against 5.03% in 2007.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, volume effects reached a point of balance. On the one hand we had the income from the disposal of the &#x20AC;1.5 billion in Sanofi-Aventis shares which took place in November of 2007. On the other hand, we had the payment on the 30th July of 2008 of about &#x20AC;1.100 billion linked to the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent, but in 2009 there will probably be a strong decrease of this financial expense because of the drop in interest rates. The Sanofi-Aventis dividends remained stable at &#x20AC;244.7 million.</p>
          <p>The tax level or the tax burden was &#x20AC;721.5 million. The tax rate at 25.9% has dropped sharply compared to 2007 where we had 29.5%. Half of the drop in the tax rate of 3.6% is attributable to factors which should continue throughout 2009. For example, the increase in the R&amp;D tax credit and the impact of the drop in the tax rate of a number of European countries, in particular. As an indication, we can consider that the tax rate for the L'Oreal Group as a whole in 2009 could be in the range of 28%.</p>
          <p>In total, the net earnings excluding minority interests and non-recurrent items will &#x2013; rose to &#x20AC;2.63 billion, up 1.2%. After the accretive impact of share buybacks, the net earning per share rose to &#x20AC;3.49, an increase of 3.8% and at 6.8% at constant exchange rates. This is very close to the target that we had indicated last October.</p>
          <p>We should also note that as announced at the beginning of the consolidation exercise, the impact of the Yves Saint Laurent acquisition was a dilutive impact to the tune of about 1% of the net earning per share which would otherwise have been 3.52%. This dilution was mainly the result of the inclusion in the books of a step-up entry on the YSL stocks and for an amount slightly higher than &#x20AC;21 billion before tax; and this is obviously an expense that we won't have to incur in 2009.</p>
          <p>Now, let us look at the non-recurring &#x2013; the net earnings excluding non-recurring elements. If we take that into account, we have a charge of &#x20AC;115 million compared to a profit in 2007 of &#x20AC;617 million. We have net earnings to the tune of &#x20AC;1.948 billion. Let me remind you that the profit in 2007 included a capital gain of &#x20AC;643 million because of the disposal of Sanofi-Aventis shares.</p>
          <p>We have charged &#x20AC;115 million which integrates the industrial reorganization in Europe with the projected disposal of the British plant of Llantrisant, the close down of the Monaco plant, but also the streamlining of distribution contracts for YSL products, the revamping of the U.S.A. based L'Or&#xE9;al subsidiary, integration of an American company, CollaGenex acquired by Galderma, and the speeded up amortization and depreciation of intangible non-current assets on Yue Sa&#xEF; goodwill and the Biomedic brand.</p>
          <p>Let us talk now about the cash flow. Cash flow was &#x20AC;2.745 billion, up 1%. Changes in working capital requirement was &#x20AC;148 million; this difference or this increase in the working capital requirement mainly attributable to a number of items that have gone up, inventories and trade debtors as well as accounts payable. The ratios have improved because at the end of 2008, excluding Yves Saint Laurent acquisition, the ratios were 9% percent of the sales compared to 9.1% at the end of 2007 and for trade debtors, this accounted for 14.7% of turn of the sales compared to 15.3% at the end of 2007. We're very careful about this item, trade debts.</p>
          <p>Other working capital requirements have increased by &#x20AC;110 million. They correspond to movements on the payable tax resulting from, in particular, the research and development tax credit and the payment of the capital gain on the disposal of the Sanofi shares at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>Investments at &#x20AC;745 million are down by about 4% and are established at 4.2% of the sales compared to 4.5% in 2007. This item, by the way, should further improve as a percentage of gross sales in 2009. In total after the payment of the dividends, after the acquisitions, after the share &#x2013; net share buybacks, we have a residual flow, cash flow, at minus &#x20AC;1.209 billion. The group has decided, in fact, to interrupt for the time being its share buyback plan, so as to strengthen its balance sheet further.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet, by the way, is already pretty strong because the shareholders' equity represents 52% of overall assets. They have dropped compared to the end of 2007 and this is due mainly because Sanofi-Aventis has been restated based on its market value. This is due to the impact of the own share buyback scheme and to a lesser extent this is due to the conversion effect linked to foreign currencies.</p>
          <p>Financial debt, we had made an estimation at the end of August, and this information is confirmed at &#x20AC;3,700 billion. The increase in the financial debt is the consequence mainly of the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9;. Of course, our financial debt is well secured. It is made up to the tune of &#x20AC;2.5 billion of middle-term banking loans whose maturities are between 2011 and 2012; and for the remainder, we have commercial paper which is guaranteed by stand-by credit lines.</p>
          <p>The dividend, as you've seen in the press release, the dividend will be presented to the general assembly of the shareholders meeting on the 16th of April, will be &#x20AC;1.44 per share. So it's a new year of dividend growth in line with the earnings, and this clearly is a sign of confidence and balance. The payout ratio this year has increased ever so slightly this year at 41.3%. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

          <p>Translator: Thank you very much, Christian, and we're going to move on to the divisions' activity part and I suggest that we begin with the largest one, the Consumer Products Division, with Jean-Jacques Lebel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A few words, first of all, about 2008. In sales, 2008 was a satisfactory year showing a total growth of 4.1% that breaks down as Western Europe, plus 0.9%; North America, minus 3.2%; and Rest of the World, plus 14.5%.</p>
          <p>I shall first comment on sales. In Western Europe, which represents 44% of the division, we note the good performance of Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, let's call it Northern Europe, and a slightly more difficult year for France, Belgium, Italy and Spain which worsened towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>In North America, 22% of the division, it was a difficult year for invoicing due to market shrinkage, a reduction in inventory among certain customers, and promotional efforts to defend our business, although we held on to our global market share as I shall show you in a minute. The Rest of the World, 34% of the division, continued to be very dynamic with plus 14.5% growth. Above all, note at this stage that 2008 was a good year for Russia, even if the strain began to show at the end of the year, and for Ukraine, China, Thailand, South Africa. Other regions performed less well; I'll talk about this later on.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at our categories. Our major strategic categories all achieved progress on growth markets. In facial care, our second category, we advanced by 10.4% after a plus 17.1% in 2007; makeup grew by 5.4% with a fine year in Europe; hair care's plus 1.3% was somewhat disappointing; hair colorants were up 2.7%. Our four global brands grew in a uniform way as you can see on the screen.</p>
          <p>Now, look at this overview from our market share &#x2013; for our market shares. In Western Europe and the U.S.A., we managed to sustain and even slightly increase our market share. This table shows the Nielsen panels. In the Rest of the World, we do not have panels everywhere, but our market share is estimated at 8.8% and our growth between two and three times the market rate. So you can see the potential. And per category, where we gained most was in facial care especially in the U.S. with the success of Garnier. We improved in makeup and we held out well in the other categories.</p>
          <p>What is the outlook for 2009. For the Global Consumer Products division, we see no reason to be pessimistic about market levels. As for our market share, this will grow most of all in new countries driven by innovation, brand development, and globalization that I shall now go into in more detail. The division strategy is based on innovation. I will review the 2008 successes and give you a preview of 2009.</p>
          <p>In Skincare, the leading global market for L'Oreal after the success of the Skin Genesis range, the number one creator of Cellular-Nurturing in 2008. We're launching Skin Genesis anti-aging pore minimizer, a mix of hyaluronic acid and ingredients that refines skin's texture.</p>
          <p>In L'Oreal's major RevitaLift franchise, the global leader in anti-wrinkle products, we've created deep-set wrinkle [French] in 2008, and for 2009 we're preparing a new neck and face care product. In the Collagen franchise, the leading global Collagen range the main ingredient for dermatologists, we're going to launch Collagen Lip Filler for 2009.</p>
          <p>In the Age Perfect range we are currently launching the first initiative that directly targets menopausal women, Age Perfect resubstancer. For Garnier, the leading natural agents range, note Eye Roll-on Caffeine, the great success in 2008 and leading reference in the U.S. care market that we are now launching in Asia. At the beginning of 2009, we will launch Vital Restore for mature skins.</p>
          <p>In Makeup, we are the global leader; let me say in passing that we are the only company to have global brands and in 2008 we have had successes in mascara, Maybelline's Volume Express Colossal, 20% market share in France; for the start of 2009, Maybelline Lash Stiletto from L&#xB4;Or&#xE9;al Double Extension Beauty Tubes, a revolution in lengthening Extra Volume Collagen.</p>
          <p>In Lipstick, from L&#xB4;Or&#xE9;al Infallible lasts up to 16 hours, and Glam Shine six hours, and we are launching Color Riche Shine Gel&#xE9;e which will revolutionize lip balms at the start of 2009.</p>
          <p>In Foundation, right in minerals wave, Maybelline has launched Mineral Power, a real advance in foundations for healthy skin. At the start of 2009, L&#xB4;Or&#xE9;al will launch Visible Lift Serum Inside.</p>
          <p>In Hair Colorants, where we are the world leader, L&#xB4;Or&#xE9;al XL 10, ease-of-use, and just a 10 minute wait, coloring you can do at home before going to work. At the start of 2009, Garnier Herbashine 10 minutes, this time for a dual tone hair color.</p>
          <p>In Hair Care, we focused on dry and damaged hair with our Vive Re-Nutrition with Royal Jelly; Profectus in 2009, it will be volume restructure for fine hair lacking volume. In the United States, we are currently creating buzz with the L&#xB4;Or&#xE9;al EverPure range, the first sulphate free product for color-treated hair with shampoo at $7.00. The laboratories and marketing people are pulling out all the stops on innovations.</p>
          <p>The second strategic focus is our brands. Major innovations are carried by powerful brands that men and women recognize and trust. Here are three adverts as an example.</p>
          <p>[Video]</p>
          <p>Translator: We kept up pressure on the media throughout 2008 and this will continue in '09 with TVR gains from new negotiations. Through our negotiations with the media, especially TV, we have made lots more contacts for the same financial outlay. In several countries, we are talking about double-digit reductions in the cost of TVR in the last months of '08 and the start of '09, and this trend is set to continue.</p>
          <p>Now, let's talk about points of sale. In '09 we're working with our distributor partners to launch the Destination Beauty in Turbulent Times program. The idea is that we should promote the fragrances category, the perfumery category, because everyone wants to stay beautiful, good looking even during a crisis. We're sharing our knowledge about consumers with distributors. What consumers are telling us is that color is key for lips and for hair. It's anti-depression, anti-drab. I take care of my looks, I exist. They want honest products, real innovation, Volume Express Colossal, Caffeine Eye Roll-On and a favorable quality price ratio, of course.</p>
          <p>We're mobilizing our know-how at points of sale with broader shelf space such as the one for makeup from DM in Germany and a major event that drove sales up 17% in '08. In brand display, that enables customers to test across all categories. Now for our sales price strategy, we have also been concerned about pricing and setting the right price; value add from innovations on the one hand and competitive pricing on the other to attract all consumers to our brands.</p>
          <p>L'Or&#xE9;al is the premium mass brand. Here in Skincare, you can see that prices range from &#x20AC;11 to &#x20AC;18 and in mid '09, we're introducing a new moisturizer at &#x20AC;9. With Garnier, we are more accessible. We are going to launch Garnier Vitale at &#x20AC;12 and Garnier Essential range at &#x20AC;5. And if you turn to our plans for India, we shall be pricing items at &#x20AC;0.18 and &#x20AC;2. So, if you look at the whole picture, you can see that the Consumer Division covers the spectrum from &#x20AC;0.18 to &#x20AC;18 or from a 1 to 100 ratio.</p>
          <p>Lastly, geographic growth opens up substantial perspectives for our division. We have only just started our 8.8 market share in the RW zone means that there is still a huge potential. As you know, our Garnier, Maybelline brands are well established in Eastern Europe and Russia. In Asia, we are growing very strongly. In China in '08, we made remarkable gains in skincare, possibly the key milestone in '08. In these photos you can see our L'Or&#xE9;al [French] counters, the breakthrough achieved in Men Expert, the start up of Garnier and the first Maybelline Skincare counters.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, '08 was a middling year, but it ended well and the start of '09 is looking good. We have launched our Garnier bio-deodorants and shall now launch Garnier Skincare. India had a difficult '08 and we're still only starting up there and we need to disentangle the distribution system, but we have had some products successes and are prepared for others. In Egypt, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, we are still setting up our subsidiaries. Here you can see the current launch of our Garnier Color Naturals product in Egypt.</p>
          <p>To summarize, our equation for 2009 involves innovation, new categories, accelerating launches, geographical expansion, stepping up resources to drive growth. Overall, our 2009 attitude is realism and optimism. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Translator: Thank you very much Jean-Jacques. As you've seen, we have a lot of trust in consumer markets; a very proactive plan has been devised for 2009. The second division in terms of size is the Luxury Products Division and Marc Menesguen is going to take the floor now.</p>

          <p>Translator: Good morning to everyone. In 2008, the Luxury Products Division achieved growth in sales of 0.7% like-for-like. The year was marked by two key features, a slowdown in consumption, first of all. As you can see in this table, you could see the estimates for the 2008 global selected market. We have two dynamic first quarters at plus 6%, a deceleration in the third and a complete standstill in the fourth half year at minus 3.1%, delivering an annual total of plus 2.7%. The second phenomenon is a reduction in inventory and this is due to the scarcity of credit.</p>
          <p>The results per zone are as follows. In Western Europe, first of all, the division's sales fell by 1.9%. The division maintained market shares, especially in France, and even gained positions in large key markets such as the United Kingdom. We're already the leader in Western Europe and with Yves Saint Laurent we have further extended our sway with market shares of over 20%.</p>
          <p>In North America, the division's sales fell by minus 7.3% like-for-like at below the market rate. The fourth quarter was difficult due to a substantial drop in foot-fall and a sharp contrast with the last quarter of 2007 when Diesel, in particular, was launched. But, there are also good news from the American market. We have five of our main fragrances ranked in the top 10 at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>One last point, the key feature in 2008 was our strong momentum in the Rest of the World where we grew at above the great market at 12.4% like-for-like. There were good results everywhere: Latin America, plus 9%; Africa-Orient-Pacific, plus 11; Eastern Europe, plus 14; Asia, plus 12; Japan with positive figures; China, plus 20; Hong Kong, plus 25; and South Korea, plus 33%.</p>
          <p>Now, as you know, the economic situation in some of these countries in the Rest of the World area deteriorated recently, including Dubai, Eastern Europe, and Travel Retail, which has been adversely impacted by the fall in air traffic; but the Rest of the World now accounts for 30% of our sales compared to 23% for North America. We are leaders in this market and have largely benefited from the structural growth in these emerging markets.</p>
          <p>But for us and for the world of Luxury, the major event was the signature with the incorporation of the Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; on the 1st of July 2008. During the six months of this integration process, the division's sales grew by 9.9% in 2008, excluding exchange effect. The division is now worked number one in distribution and with Yves Saint Laurent along with Lanc&#xF4;me and Armani, we now have three brands in the top global 10 selective brands. This acquisition added a further 15% of sales on an annual basis and three market share points.</p>
          <p>We achieved growth in all categories. First in fragrances, we were already a leader in men's fragrances. After the acquisition, we have become a leader in women's fragrances. So, we have improved our position as the global number one in fragrances with a market share of nearly 20%. In makeup too, Lanc&#xF4;me is the global leader in this category and with Yves Saint Laurent, a tremendous success story for the last 10 years, the division now has more than 20% of the makeup market. Finally, in care products where Saint Laurent is still small, but through our research effort which show great promise in the coming years, especially in Asia.</p>
          <p>The integration of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; is going well and the division, we shall take direct control of 11 agents in 2009. The division is, therefore, acting as the host organization to deliver maximum efficiency, sales support, synergy in buying raw materials, packaging items, media, and so on. This means that Yves Saint Laurent offers a splendid growth opportunity for the division.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn to 2009 and see how we can make the most of our advantages to navigate through this difficult period. Our fist asset for us is the industry's finest product portfolio. There are eight brands in our portfolio that have global reach and account for 90% of our sales. Lanc&#xF4;me, first of all, which is the world leader in luxury women's beauty is a symbol for French-style appeal, leading edge technology innovation. Lanc&#xF4;me enjoys a huge capital of trust amongst women all over the world and of course this is an extremely valuable asset at a time such as this one. There are three major fashion names, the magical trio of Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, and Ralph Lauren.</p>
          <p>One last point, we have four brands that are young, modern, accessible, and different: Biotherm, the young people's care brand and the world number one for men's care in the selective market; we have Shu Uemura, the Japanese style art of beauty which grew strongly worldwide in 2008, especially in Asia; Kiehl's the New York apothecary, which is growing exclusively all over the world and it is now present in 30 countries and delivering plus 64% growth in Asia in 2008; and Diesel, the alternative to classic luxury, with incredible results in sales for the financial year.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we shall speed up launches of products delivering genuine technology breakthroughs. Take Lanc&#xF4;me as an example. Genifique is a revolutionary care product, 10 years of research, seven patents. This formula opens up a whole new era of genomics and proteomics. Genifique helps revivify the skin's rejuvenating genes, which is a fundamental discovery.</p>
          <p>&#xD4;scillation is the first vibrating mascara of Lanc&#xF4;me; with 7000 micro-oscillations a minute the product can be applied far more evenly over the eyelashes. At the end of the year, &#xD4;scillation became the best selling American makeup product and you ladies will be able to try this product at the end of the meeting. L'Absolu Rouge is the number one Pro-Xylane lipstick on the market and it takes wonderful care of your lips. It won the Prix d'Excellence Marie-Claire at the end of 2008. We also have our whitening care product which is a key market in Asia. Lanc&#xF4;me, the incumbent leader in this category, came up with a whole new line called Blanc Expert GN-White which acts on entire skin blotches.</p>
          <p>In fragrances, there will also be a number of creative breakthroughs. After Acqua Di Gio incurred, Giorgio Armani is bringing out a third men's success with Diamonds For Men, one of last autumn's most successful men's product launches. At Lanc&#xF4;me, Magnifique was the number one women's launch in 2008 and the product star, Anne Hathaway, was one of the year's most successful actresses; and it will further be developed next month with the launch of the eau de toilette.</p>
          <p>And there will be two other speculator launches in the first quarter. First, Only-The-Brave from Diesel, a story of courage, with a highly original bottle that is shaped like a clinched fist is a creative way to attract young people who are always on the lookout for new fragrances. Secondly, Yves Saint Laurent was the brand's first fragrance since the integration with Nuit de l'Homme personified by Vincent Cassel and as you can see, surrounded by a wealth of beautiful admirers.</p>
          <p>As market leaders, as of the beginning of this year, we intend to make a very powerful impression on the market.</p>
          <p>One last point, a very aggressive 2009 plan. Firstly, we need to grasp opportunities in new selective distribution especially in the United States with the e-business segment. We have developed, for most of our brands, online sales outlets that shown double-digit growth. We also have TV shopping, an example on HSN in the United States, we have been able to successfully sell Lanc&#xF4;me circulation in December. TV shopping also has a positive influence on sales in U.S. department stores. And in boutiques, we have 32 Kiehl's boutiques in the United States and 18 worldwide. It's an excellent profitability model that we are continuing to develop.</p>
          <p>We also need to be aggressive on the ground. We shall step up events in sales outlets by deploying our sales strike force. This involves catwalks and special events for launching fragrances or cosmetics. The aim is to capture the clientele on the spot and to optimize the contents of the average shopping basket; and we also need to be aggressive when it comes to our brand accessibility. We cover very broad range of price points in our brand portfolio, but we have to also make sure that each of our brands is equally accessible. Two examples, the price of Lanc&#xF4;me care products range from &#x20AC;30 for the 30 ml of Hydrozan. We have just launched up to around &#x20AC;140 for Luxury 75 ml Absolue Premium BX. Flower Bomb which is a very successful product from Viktor &amp; Rolf sells at &#x20AC;98 for 100 mls, but in February 2009 we are launching a 20 ml bottle at &#x20AC;35.</p>
          <p>We also managed to step up the offensive for our special offers on all of our brands by remaining extremely quality conscious. Here for example is the successful Lanc&#xF4;me campaign on Two Each Ages Beauty in January 2009 in French perfumeries.</p>
          <p>To conclude, let's be realistic, 2009 will obviously not be an easy year because of the very strong slowdown in the markets and because of the inventory adjustments of our distributors worldwide; but we will show a lot of resolve and determination. We will have fuller brand portfolio, show a lot of technological innovation and an aggressive action plan. 2009 will definitely be only for the brave. Thank you for your attention.</p>

          <p>Translator: Thank you very much Marc. So you see that in Luxury, the outlook for the market is a bit uncertain, but we have a very aggressive action plan for the Luxury Division for all of its brands and we will be using every opportunity. Another very interesting example is Professional Products with Nicolas Hieronimus.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It gives me great pleasure to present the results of the Professional Products Division for 2008. In 2008 there was an estimated growth on the global Professional market at plus 0.3%. It was at 2% at the end of September and suffered from the economic crisis in the last months of the year. As you can see, this had a specific impact on mature countries such as North America, Western Europe, and Japan where customers and resales at salons have decreased, but there is sustained momentum in new and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Against this background, the Professional Products Division grew by 1.3%, or 4 times the market rate and substantially outdistanced its global competitors throughout the world, accelerating strongly in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America. In Western Europe, we made progress in Germany, United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Greece while Italy, Spain and Portugal were more affected by the market slowdown.</p>
          <p>In North America, it was a paradoxical year. Although we experienced poor sales results, we were nevertheless able to strengthen our positions and prepare for the future. In an American market estimated at minus 6%, our colorant sold to salons rose by 6%. And this is a strong signal of our capacity to attract new salons with our brands. This increase for colorants is one of the beneficial effects of our distributor strategy currently being united under the salon-centric label. With better area coverage and more direct contact with American salons, this will enable us to gain new ground. So we shall continue with this acquisition and strategy.</p>
          <p>So, on the other hand our retail products have suffered not just from the market slowdown but also from our further efforts to reduce parallel sales by cutting off non-compliant salon customers and this cost us more than 2% in growth. Excluding the anti-diversion effect, we are growing at a higher than market rate in America.</p>
          <p>In the Rest of the World, the Professional Products Division had a very good year with growth of 14.7%; spectacularly so in Eastern Europe driven by Russian and Poland and also in Brazil, China and India where we are helping to develop the market. In Japan, one of the most sophisticated Professional markets, we grew by 5% in a negative market thanks to our technology innovations and store services.</p>
          <p>Overall, as this table of market share shows, L'Or&#xE9;al's Professional Products Division extended its lead over its major global competitors in all regions of the world and even took over the leadership in Eastern Europe. With 27.4 of the market, the division is the absolute global number one in the professional sector, building on our knowledge of customers and a close understanding of hairdressers which has been part of our DNA for a hundred years.</p>
          <p>Our leadership and growth strategy for '08 and '09 are fueled by four drivers. The first driver, growth in the hairdressing market, especially in new countries where it is expanding at full speed by a training such as in this Matrix class in India which is training tomorrow's hairdressers, by our new product services developed for local needs such as the hair spa for long Asian massages. But, we are also dedicated to growing the market through new services in mature countries. Cover 5 for men to blend away gray hair with a shampoo and the hair lifting service that rejuvenates mature women with colorants at a haircut and a care are two examples of our capacity to generate new sources of business for our partners and at the same time grow our own business.</p>
          <p>The division's first step in professional skincare with Clear Skin, which is already in 37 salons in 11 countries, exemplifies this ambition to develop the sector. In '09, we shall continue to develop innovative services exclusively for professionals. One example is this Brazilian progressive blow drying with our new lasting extensive moisturist smoothing or hair thinning with K&#xE9;rastase Ol&#xE9;o Slim.</p>
          <p>Our second driver is in-salon market share. This is vital in mature countries and here you can see a number of salons or major chains that we have won over from the competition in recent months. At the end of '08, more than 500,000 of the world total of 2.5 million salons were using at least one of our brands either in their work or retail through resales; and there are many more to be won over. In '09, expanding our salon population will be a priority.</p>
          <p>In this effort, the complementary yet differentiated portfolio of brands is a major asset. This is the third growth driver and is unique to our company. We can respond to each individual need with products and services tailored to each salon.</p>
          <p>Look at the story angle representing the salon market in any country, whether they are extremely luxury and exclusive A plus salons or D salons with typically just one or two employees working in a rudimentary environment. They are all looking for brands and products that suit their customers at their own price level or image. We can offer them the highly selective and premium Shu Uemura or K&#xE9;rastase for the high end range or the major L'Or&#xE9;al Professional and Redken brands for the core market with a touch of Paris or New York fashion, all the way down to Matrix and these are the accessible brand in terms of price and technique, but with high training value added.</p>
          <p>Mizani is specialized in African hair while PureOlogy uses organic sulfate-free ingredients, and both are positioned on new high growth segments. Our capacity to offer different quality levels at different price points is proof of our commitment to adapt our products to new purchasing power.</p>
          <p>Finally, our fourth strategic growth driver is, of course, innovation. 2008 was a good year in terms of innovation for the Professional Products Division. First in technique, in L'Or&#xE9;al Professionnel Platinium +, a lightening paste with guaranteed effectiveness and comfort and the new patented Rubilane, red colorants from L'Or&#xE9;al research both launched, patented in September along with Cover 5 for men and Force Relax, specially developed for relaxing Brazilian hair. From Matrix, Stay Wonderbrown colorants are still doing well in Asian salons and Logics is attracting American hairdressers.</p>
          <p>In Haircare, successes include Luffe Ultime from L'Or&#xE9;al Professionnel, Real Control from Redken for typically thick, unruly Hispanic hair; from Biolage Fortetherapie at Matrix; and above all, products from K&#xE9;rastase with dermo-rich for colored hair or genuine Probiotic for the scalp; and the whole Shu Uemura range with its latest launch, Muroto Volume, for fine hair. S&#xE9;rie Nature by L'Or&#xE9;al Professionnel in Western Europe operates in the expanding market for natural care products and '09 promises to be yet another great year for innovation.</p>
          <p>In Colorants, we are preparing a major initiative for each of our brands and in Haircare, as shown here with K&#xE9;rastase, volumers and also in perms, the main market in Asia, where we have a very small market share, but great expectations. Optistraight and X-Tenso Moisturist will lead the charge in this conquest.</p>
          <p>In hairstyling, Texture Expert from L'Or&#xE9;al Professionnel is starting out very well and Design Pulse from Matrix will hit the headlines in the first half.</p>
          <p>'09 will also be the year for going global with PureOlogy which we bought last year which matches current trends with its organic component based formula that are so concentrated that users only need a minute amount of shampoo. These are both more environmentally friendly and cheaper with satisfaction guaranteed. As our female customers grow choosier during the downturn, we shall obviously highlight the quality of products but also make a number of commercial offers. Here you see several examples of value added products that are currently selling well and all of our people have their ears to the ground seeking out the kind of products that attract customers and we shall channel a large share of our resources into stimulating consumption.</p>
          <p>We naturally accept that the current business situation will impact market growth but at Professional Products Division we are both confident and determined. We are confident because history has shown how resilient the hairdressing sector is and how it can bounce back quickly when the going gets better. And during the year in which we will celebrate the centennial of L'Or&#xE9;al Professionnel, we are more than ever determined to spearhead and lead this market. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much Nicolas. You see that we have a leader division here in its business with an action plan which is very aggressive. And finally, to finish we will be hearing Brigitte Liberman on the Active Cosmetics Division.</p>

          <p>[French]</p>
          <p>Translator: Good morning. In 2008, the Active Cosmetics Division increased its turnover by 4.2% like-for-like. The results are different depending on the area. They are slightly down in Western Europe because of the overall slowdown in market growth, but also owing to Vichy's rather weak launch plan during the first half year. There was a significant increase in North America with sales up by 4.7% and very dynamic growth was experienced in the Rest of the World at plus 14%. All together, this performance resulted in a market share gain.</p>
          <p>In 2008, Active Cosmetics reaffirmed its worldwide leadership in pharmacies, well ahead of its direct competitors. Vichy confirmed its number one position thanks to consistent investments in advertising and promotion, especially to support major launches over the second half year. For example, Liftactiv CxP which is the new anti-aging skincare product based on the slow release of vitamin C, this product and the success of this product has enabled Vichy to establish itself as the leader of the anti-aging segment in the pharmacy in Europe.</p>
          <p>La Roche-Posay is recommended by over 25,000 dermatologists throughout the world and it explains its strength. With another year of double-digit growth, La Roche-Posay substantially increased its market share. This result is due to the cross category success of the brand, specifically on acne and cleansing, with the launch of physiological cleansing products for sensitive skin which are free of parban, soap, alcohol, and artificial color. Lastly, the division reinforced its relay brands. Inn&#xE9;ov strengthened its number one position in oral cosmetics in Europe. This is due to the tremendous breakthrough achieved on the hair segments with Inn&#xE9;ov Masse Capillaire, but also with the launch of the anti-hair loss supplement for men.</p>
          <p>Inn&#xE9;ov continued its conquest of the BRIM countries with, after Russia, the spectacular take off in Brazil, where Inn&#xE9;ov Firmness became last December the best selling dermocosmetic product in all Brazilian pharmacies. SkinCeuticals, which is a premium brand sold through physicians and medi-spas, has confirmed its pioneer position with the launch of exclusive technologies such as phloretin CF serum which has been awarded a number of prizes in the United States and the A.G.E. interrupter cream for mature skin. SkinCeuticals was already number one in U.S. dermal professional skin care. It enlarged its distribution in Europe to target more expert consumers who today account for 10% of the European population.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Sanoflore became the number two organic brand in French pharmacies and has expanded step-by-step into the major European markets. It is our ambition to become a key player in the promising organic market by positioning ourselves as a natural, attractive and effective brand, thanks to the know-how of our laboratories.</p>
          <p>But over and beyond these figures, we finished 2008 in a stronger position vis-&#xE0;-vis our pharmacists. We have significantly improved our share of advice and exposure for our brands, why is that?  Because on the one hand we have been constantly investing in the training of our pharmacy staff, we have been organizing events on the point of sales and provided services to attract new customers into pharmacies. On the other, we also have a unique and complete brand portfolio to meet all of the customers' needs.</p>
          <p>So, in the light of the economic crisis we are currently going through, what can we say about 2009?  There are three main reasons that justify realistic optimism. The first reason is linked to the specificities of our distribution channel. The pharmacies enjoy very high level of traffic because of the presence of medicine. Today, more than ever, with the aging of the population the need to look after one's health will continue to be expressed as a universal phenomenon.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the pharmacy channel will remain the place to go for all the concerns, the increasing concerns about health and beauty. For example, oily skin and acne, which concern today more than 50% of the world population; or we also have the prevention of melanoma, which has tripled in the last 20 years in France. We also have the issue of sensitive skin which is on the increase and this is due to pollution and the changing eating habits. Finally, and it's absolutely crucial in a time of crisis, the pharmacy is perceived as the facility nearby; a place that you can trust and which will offer high quality advice and information.</p>
          <p>The second reason is related to our innovation policy. In 2009, we are going to launch major innovative products on every major pharmacy market. As regards Vichy, the brand which first put cosmetics into the pharmacy with effective, safe and affordable products, 2009 will be a year of major renewal. This will mean, of course, a more medical approach to health, a new slogan: "Vichy, Health is Beautiful," new advertising communication and a new generation of products.</p>
          <p>Liftactiv Retinol HA, thanks to a new generation of retinol, is considered as a major advance in wrinkle correction. Cellu Metric, a specific formulation in line with the body's metabolic cycle ensuring faster results on cellulite. Second example, the launch of the XY Homme line of La Roche-Posay for skin sensitive to shaving was a star product requested by dermatologists, which is a shaving gel preventing irritations and ingrown hair. It specifies a formula which is soap free, non-occlusive and noncomedogenic at a price of &#x20AC;10 and this is, of course, a major advance for La Roche-Posay. Third example, the anti-aging elixir by Sanoflore with organic essential oil, and it is the first time that we have managed to provide evidence for its exceptional anti-oxidant property.</p>
          <p>The third and last reason why we should be optimistic is the fact that we have high geographical development potential. In Europe, where La Roche-Posay is only present in 50% of Vichy outlets, in the United States also where the division's products are only available in two regions. And above all, in the rest of the world which offers enormous growth potential. In Asia, for example, our market share is only 14%, whereas it is 20% in Western Europe and this is at a time when drugstores are experiencing full growth in this part of the world.</p>
          <p>So we will forge ahead with our brands, our products and our countries. More than ever, our division is opening up new avenues for growth especially because our brands and networks values today echo more than ever the concerns of consumers worldwide, consumers who are looking for safety, value for money and ethical products. Thank you for your attention.</p>

          <p>[French]</p>
          <p>Translator: Thank you Brigitte. I think it's important to understand well what the strategy and dynamics of each division is.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to comment on our performance in 2008 and explain to you how we intend to successfully negotiate the year 2009. In 2008, as did a number of other companies, L'Or&#xE9;al faced an extremely difficult environment with a slowdown in markets and also inventory reductions by our distributor customers who themselves were subjected to very strong financial pressures. Because of this particularly adverse environment, our organic growth slowed down to 3.1%, in line with the estimated growth in the worldwide market. This slowdown affected us earlier than our competitors, in the third quarter already, because of our size probably, our high exposure to businesses which are more sensitive to the economic environment such as luxury products and hair salons, and our heavyweight presence in categories such as makeup, hair colorants, and perfumes, in which inventory reductions have been more significant.</p>
          <p>Generally speaking, however, we put up good resistance and held well on to our market share, which have overall even grown slightly. Finally, thanks to our acquisitions, particularly Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9;, our sales at constant exchange rates grew by 6.3%, twice the market rate and our market share continued to advance to reach 15.8% globally, thus further increasing our leadership. Overall therefore, in a particularly difficult economic environment, the L'Or&#xE9;al Group has continued its growth, but rates were highly differentiated by division and by region because there were great differences in the impact of the economic crisis in each case.</p>
          <p>Interpreting the figures by division, it's very important as you saw, that basically this is the real reflection of the Company's dynamism. The Consumer Products Division grew by 1% with market share maintained in Western Europe and North America and strong growth rates which are building for the future in the rest of the world. Its positions in strategic market of skincare and makeup were strengthened. It has three powerful brands: L'Or&#xE9;al Paris, Garnier, and Maybelline, ideally positioned and still with the men's extension potential in terms of market share, extensions into new categories, and geographic expansion. Finally, it operates in markets which should prove resilient to the crisis and for '09 has a rich and extremely aggressive product initiative plan.</p>
          <p>The economic environment has had a greater impact on the Luxury Products Division, as you saw. Its organic growth was 0.7%, greatly handicapped by difficulties in its distribution channels. I'd like to give you a few examples: the U.S. department stores; perfumery chains in Russia; and travel retail stores with the reduction in air traffic. While its market share declined slightly in North America, it held up well in Western Europe and increased significantly in the Rest of the World.</p>
          <p>Finally, the division has been considerably strengthened with the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; which was the highlight of the year in the industry. With this acquisition, the division's growth came out at 10% at constant exchange rates and became the world number one in luxury cosmetics sold in perfumeries and department stores, giving it a strong position and strength for the future. Finally, it has quite an exceptional portfolio of diversified and complimentary brands and is well equipped to weather the crisis with considerable potential for expansion once the crisis is over.</p>
          <p>The Professional Products channel, which Nicolas presented, was also one of the first affected by the impact of the economic slowdown as it is always more sensitive to the general mood of the population. But it should pick up because it's well-known that women look on their hairdresser as the best brand and having their hair done is morale boosting.</p>
          <p>In this market, the Professional Products Division, with growth of 1.3% like-for-like and 7.3% at constant exchange rates, is clearly the leader; and as it is easily the worldwide market leader and each year increases its leadership salon-by-salon, thanks to its incomparable expertise and its brand portfolio. As Nicolas said, out of 2.5 million hair salons around the world only 500,000 use L'Or&#xE9;al products so by definition there is a tremendous expansion potential.</p>
          <p>Now the Active Cosmetics Division, meanwhile, grew by 4.2%. The channel was less buoyant than in previous years but it should, on the other hand, prove more resilient to the crisis because it has captive foot-fall boosted by healthcare spending. In this market, Active Cosmetics is by far the leader both in developed markets for historic reasons and in emerging markets; for is this division which is globalizing the business by creating pharmacy, cosmetic sales in new countries.</p>
          <p>And The Body Shop reported growth of 4.6% in 2008 with retail sales at 1.9% and like-for-like growth at minus 2.3%. Objectively, in few of the brand star presence in the British and American markets where retail businesses have been hammered hard as you know, it is fair to say that it put up relatively good resistance in a context which could hardly have been more adverse. Similarly, while the fall in its product visibility may seem disappointing, you must remember that The Body Shop does most of its profit in the last three months of the year and it was just then that the financial crisis hit, triggering drastic drops in consumer spending. Basically, The Body Shop brand is positioned on the strongest growth driving trends of our current period: nature, respect for the environment, sustainable development and an ethical approach.</p>
          <p>Finally, just a few words about Galderma, which in 2008 had an exceptional year with sales growth of over 17% and a strong improvement in its profitability. Galderma has become the world leader in dermatology, is gaining market share, and has made a success of its acquisition of CollaGenex and still has great potential for growth and profit improvement.</p>
          <p>Even more than the view by division, looking at performance by region results in a highly contrasting trend. In North America, where our sales trend was minus 4.8%, the crisis had a violent impact on both consumers and distributors. Our market share declined slightly in Luxury Products because of promotional pressure from our competitors. On the other hand, we have held on to and even strengthened our positions in the mass market, particularly with the breakthrough of Garnier Skincare, as you saw, and in Professional Products with the successful integration of our three distributors.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we in fact suffered in the American market from an exceptional combination of adverse effects in the four sectors: slowdown in markets, distributor inventory reductions, promotional pressure on net prices, and as you saw, even we suffered from our proactive efforts to prevent diversion in Professional Products. Despite these difficulties, we have conserved our growth driving resources and we ended this year with the best possible conditions to prepare for 2009.</p>
          <p>We consider that we are very well equipped to tackle this New Year while being aware of the fact that the economic climate will continue to be difficult at least until the summer. The difficulties in the United States had a severe impact on the group's overall growth in 2008, and if North America is excluded, L'Or&#xE9;al's growth rate would have been 5.1%. It puts us at a disadvantage in the short-term, but it is the price to be paid for our strong position in the American market. In a medium-term perspective, North America will rebound as it has always done in the past and will return to growth, and we will be there to take advantage of this.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, our sales were practically stable at minus 0.3%. We were handicapped by the slowdown in France and in Spain, where historically we have had strong positions. On the other hand, we achieved good growth in the Anglo-Saxon countries Germany, Austria, Netherlands, and United Kingdom, and in the northern countries. Overall, we strengthened our already substantial market share in mass-market and hair salons, held on to our positions in Luxury Products, and saw a slight contraction in pharmacy sales.</p>
          <p>Finally, we continued our strong growth in the Rest of the World with growth of 13.8% and spectacular performances particularly in Asia, where our growth was over 20% with market share gains in all divisions. In China, growth was plus 28%. All of our brands are proving highly successful. We are number one there in Professional Products, number one in Luxury Products, number one in cosmetics sold in pharmacies, number one in mass market makeup, and we are now even number one in skincare across all channels, which is a major victory. Skincare, as you know is the number one market by far in China.</p>
          <p>Sustained growth also in Eastern Europe at plus 21% where our positions have grown strongly and which we have operations consolidated with Western Europe to maximize efficiency and synergies. In Latin America, our growth rate was plus 6.7%, handicapped by temporary difficulties in Brazil which have since been resolved, enabling our businesses to re-accelerate.</p>
          <p>Finally, in all the other countries where our growth was plus 8.1%, they have been &#x2013; all the other countries have been grouped together under a common command structure in order to accelerate growth wherever we are present and above all to mass an offensive in new high potential markets with high potential where we are not present today, such as &#x2013; or only limited way, such as Gulf states, Middle East and this is L'Or&#xE9;al's new frontier.</p>
          <p>As for our operating figures, I am not going to comment on all the figures presented by Christian Mulliez, but I would like to look again at some which are very important in my view. Growth profit after adjustment for exchange gains and losses and excluding Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; has moved from 71.1 to 70.6. In view of all the adverse effects in '08 and particularly the large increase in raw material prices, I think it can be said to have held up well. This is due to the spectacular advances we have made in purchasing and in productivity and which continue to improve despite the slowdown in volumes. We are determined to step up our efforts in '09 to improve gross profit in all areas; reorganization of the industrial facilities when possible as with the closure projects for the Monaco and Llantrisant sites. Secondly, maximization of purchasing cost savings by strongly centralizing negotiations with our suppliers. On this point, the considerable decline of price of oil and raw materials in '09 should be very favorable to us. And finally, continuation of productivity efforts in all industrial activities and in the supply chain field where we believe we can still make large gains.</p>
          <p>[French]</p>
          <p>As for R&amp;D expenses, they grew in the same proportion as sales. Research and innovation are today more than ever the priority for L'Or&#xE9;al. We are the cosmetics company which allocates the highest percentage of sales to this item. This strategic choice has been a constant feature of previous years and will also remain so in 2009 and subsequent years. It is further more interesting to note that in 2008 L'Or&#xE9;al registered an all-time record total of 628 patents.</p>
          <p>In the advertising and promotional field we have, as we had previously announced, increased our capital expenditure in the second half to coincide with more substantial launch phasing in the second part of the year. And we did not take our foot off the accelerator in the final quarter; indeed quite the contrary. Despite the deterioration in the economic environment, our advertising and promotional expenses have thus remained at the same level for several years as a percentage of sales despite a continuous and significant decline in the cost of media, POS, and promotional items, which we have obtained through our negotiations. Reflecting this investment, L'Or&#xE9;al in 2007 became the world's number three advertiser and in 2008 our shares of voice continued to advance.</p>
          <p>Our intention for 2009 is to accelerate in the same direction with a dual impact. Firstly, we intend to further strengthen investment allocated to advertising and promotional resources. Secondly, we intend to take full advantage of what is currently a buyer's market, in which costs have already started falling very sharply. Overall, our fire power should thus clearly increase, helping us to develop the worldwide positions of our brands and our products. Finally, as for selling, general and administrative expenses as Christian has told you, they were practically stable as a percentage of sales at constant exchange rates and on a constant structure basis.</p>
          <p>For 2009, we have taken radical steps to drastically limit changes in these expenses. We have frozen hiring in all of the developed countries, frozen the total number of employees in rapidly growing emerging countries, and we have announced the reduction of the workforce by 500 people in our American subsidiary.</p>
          <p>We have drastically reduced business trips and expenses. We are striving across all departments of the company to streamline and simplify our organizational structures, shared services and optimize processes.</p>
          <p>Overall, in 2008 in a year of maximum adversity with increased raw materials prices, negative monetary effects, a slowdown in markets, major difficulties in North America and the dilutive consolidation of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9;, our operating profit held up pretty well and we have strengthened our growth driving resources.</p>
          <p>Our net profit excluding non-recurrent items grew by plus 1.2%, our net earnings per share increased by 3.8% and by 6.8% at constant exchange rates, and we generated cash flows from operating activities of &#x20AC;1851 billion practically the same as 2007; and the dividend which we proposed to the Annual General Meeting of 1.44 is in line with the growth of our EPS and expresses our concern to achieve the right balance. 2008 will not have been an easy year, but on the other hand it will have prepared us for 2009. And as regards 2009, we are tackling this New Year with realism, confidence and resolve.</p>
          <p>What exactly does that mean?  Realism first of all, because we expect the economic climate to still be very difficult, particularly in the first quarter and in the first half.</p>
          <p>Confidence also, because cosmetics markets should prove more resilient than others as they've always done at times of crisis, even though the degree of resilience will probably vary depending on the category and the channels. These markets, the cosmetics markets, also are those which are the least cannibalized by private labels, and this is probably an important factor in times of crisis for the month and years to come. Confidence, finally, because L'Or&#xE9;al's financial situation is healthy and solid. The balance sheet is robust, debt will gradually be reduced thanks to positive cash flow, and our credit lines are strong.</p>
          <p>Finally, we will show a lot of resolve because whatever the economic situation our engine is always firing on all cylinders; but we wonder this in a business as usual attitude. Quite the contrary. By systematically and pragmatically seeking all ways of adapting our strategy and our business model to the crisis period in order to seize all of the opportunities, this is what we will do.</p>
          <p>What does that mean?  Well, first of all, innovation. Innovation is more than ever a key strategic priority for the group. Innovation is the best anti-crisis weapon because of consumers all over the world are always ready to try new products which offer visibly better quality or effectiveness or which will meet new needs. But we're not talking about just any kind of innovation. The innovation must be spectacular, obvious, irresistible, and this is what we have succeeded in doing with, for example, the products we showed earlier on &#xD4;scillation by Lanc&#xF4;me or Eye Roll-On. These products are extremely successful, by the way, even during the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Second way of adapting to the current crisis, we need to aim at all consumer target groups to make sure that we are not forgetting anyone. With our four divisions and with The Body Shop, we already pretty much cover all the channels of cosmetics distribution. In each of these channels, we cover with our differentiating portfolios of brands, practically all of the price segments.</p>
          <p>Thus for example, in Skincare with our brands Garnier, L'Or&#xE9;al Paris, La Roche-Posay, Vichy, Biotherm, Lanc&#xF4;me, and Helena Rubinstein, we offer highly differentiated products at prices ranging from &#x20AC;7 to &#x20AC;250. But we will complete this offering by launching, as Jean-Jacques said, in 2009 across several of our brands, for example, Garnier and L'Or&#xE9;al Paris or Vichy more accessible, more affordable priced product lines. In this way, we would show our determination to complete our value enhancement strategy by another strategy of greater affordability or accessibility to our products.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we will also in 2009 expand the range of consumers that we target by intensifying our penetration into new categories. As you know, we are historically very strong in categories such as haircare, hair colorants, skincare, makeup, and perfumes, but we can make many more gains by conquering new categories such as styling, body care, men's products, and others. And we will do exactly this in 2009 by building on the expertise of our laboratories, on our marketing know-how, and our strong footprint in the field.</p>
          <p>In terms of growth driving resources, in 2009, as we've told you, we will strengthen our investments but we will also optimize the effectiveness of our capital expenditure by refocusing the investments run by business model by business model. We will invest in advertising and promotional resources which have proven to be the most effective and productive. We will try to eliminate less effective approaches and take maximum advantage of what will clearly be exceptionally favorable bargaining conditions. We are also going to accelerate our geographic expansion, not just by intensifying our conquest in the markets in which we're already present. At the beginning of 2009, we will open three new subsidiaries in Egypt, Pakistan and Kazakhstan and others will then follow.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we are adapting forcefully and rapidly to this crisis environment by taking all the necessary steps to optimize our operations and curb our costs. We have launched a plan to reduce the number of references across all divisions and brands. We are extremely aggressive when it comes to reducing the cost of sales by optimizing purchasing, making advances in productivity and optimizing industrial facilities. The same applies to the supply chain via the optimization of flows, reduction in the number of distribution centers and lowering of transport costs in which we are helped by the decline in oil prices and inventory reduction. And the same is true also in SG&amp;A. I have already said a few words about that.</p>
          <p>So, finally in 2009 we should benefit from a very large reduction in interest expense as a result of lower interest rates. We are lucky that L'Or&#xE9;al is highly diversified in terms of brands, countries and channels and we will be able to take advantage of this to weather the storm, to make the best of the crisis and seize all opportunities. In terms of brands, for example, many of our major brands are ideally suited to present day preferences and adapted to the crisis period, such as with Garnier. Garnier is the green brand with natural ingredients, which offers products at very affordable price levels. L'Or&#xE9;al Paris represents the best of technology and premium quality, but at mass market prices. Maybelline, all the modernity and the seductiveness of makeup but at price levels that all women can afford, but also we have The Body Shop, La Roche-Posay, Vichy, Matrix, Kiehl's et cetera. All these brands offer very good value at a very good price and this is what will make the difference today.</p>
          <p>In terms of countries, our business is also very evenly distributed over most of the world's major markets. In 2009, we will still have to face challenging markets in Europe and North America, but we will be able to enjoy our position, buoyant positions which are very strong positions such as Asia, China in particular, or Latin America and India which have resumed growth at the beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>Finally, in terms of divisions, growth in 2009 will clearly be highly differentiated. We expect our growth to continue in Consumer Products, where markets should prove resilient and where we should gain market shares. Growth is also expected at Active Cosmetics in a pharmacy channel which should be positive. Dynamism in hair salons is more uncertain but we intend to continue conquering in an aggressive way new salons and we want to continue developing ourselves our technical products. The greatest uncertainty is in Luxury Products, for which it is harder to make any kind of forecast.</p>
          <p>Overall therefore, we believe that there are many reasons to be confident, but we think that the worldwide cosmetics markets will remain positive and that we will be able to achieve organic growth above the market trend. And by the way, reported growth will be even higher because of the additional consolidation of six months Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; sales and the monetary effect which we hope will be slightly positive this year as compared to last year. Growth should, moreover, gradually build up in the course of 2009 after a first quarter which will still be difficult, very difficult, particularly in Luxury Products.</p>
          <p>I can tell you that at all of the L'Or&#xE9;al's team, whom would like to thank for their remarkable commitment, are extremely determined to make sure that our group, whatever the market conditions, will continue to move forward in 2009. We'll continue to boost its leadership on the worldwide cosmetics market. Thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we're now going to move on to questions. There is a tradition here which is that very often the first question comes from Madame la Maire. So, we're going to follow the tradition. You exaggerated a bit, because you've a lot of questions. We'll try and see what we can do.</p>
          <p>The first one is to better appreciate your margin for 2009. Could you assess the effect of the raw material in '08 and the productivity effect?</p>
          <p>Both are close in percentage.  We consider that the negative effect of raw materials is about 4%, out of the total of purchases of raw material for 2008; and the positive productivity effect was 3.7%, so also close to 4%.</p>
          <p>So clearly next year, we plan to continue our progress in productivity and we will have a positive effect as regards raw materials. You know that we've always said that the impact of raw material is limited compared with other categories, but it will be a positive effect.</p>
          <p>So a question also on subcontracting. In 2008, we implemented the policy which we had announced. We call on subcontractors when it's a significant help in the efficacy of our plans, so it's very limited. The amount of subcontracting is just slightly above the percentage that we had the previous year. But, if we target it in an intelligent manner, it enables us to optimize production and optimize production costs.</p>
          <p>Concerning the head count, without going into the details of head count because we could spend all day on this. Just major information, I can give you the total head count for the group at the end of 2008 and 2008 and per region. At the end of 2007, 63,400 people; at the end of 2008, 67,660, out of which 3,400 additional staff from Saint Laurent. And 28,000 in Eastern Europe, 31,000, 15,000 &#x2013; 15,300, 20,200 for the rest of the world. The major evolution was Saint Laurent and CollaGenex and a company in Turkey.</p>
          <p>So, the trend is that our head count has a tendency to decrease in Western European countries and the trend will be towards a decrease also in North America and it should stabilize, as I indicated earlier, in the new countries where we have frozen the head count in numbers. So we freeze the new recruitments and the head count so that should lead to a few changes; plus the closing down of Monaco and Llantrisant, that should lead to a progressive but significant reduction in the head count.</p>
          <p>Okay. So, another question concerning American distributors and I'll pass the question on to Nicolas. There was a question regarding these distributors. What is their share in the total distribution?  How do they finance themselves?  I don't know what the question means, and what about destocking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[French]</p>
          <p>Translator: Nicolas. With the American distributors that we bought we have about 50% of our American distribution via distributors. The rest of the products are distributed by regional distributors or BSG, so about half. And concerning destocking, we've reduced the inventory at the end of 2008 to have levels of stock in our distributors at the level of the industry and in total for two distributors we've also reduced the number of references, about 5,000 less for BAI and 1,000 less for Maly's West. So, we've cleaned up the inventory. So, that was a good question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there not strong heterogeneity from one region to the next concerning the prescriptions of the hair salons outside of France?</p>
          <p>Well, there's a great difference in the sophistication and the development of the hairdressing market, depending on the country. In a country such as China, you have approximately 0.5 salons per urban inhabitant. In Japan, it's 1.7, 1.8, so there are major growth possibilities, but the hairdresser is the one who prescribes the product; about 80 or 90% of the women choose the product on the basis of what the hairdresser prescribes.</p>
          <p>So the second part of the question is what do we do to help the hairdressers who do this less well than others? How can we help them prescribe products or services?  We do it through our main growth driver, through training. We tell them how to use the product and recommend them and provide the proper recommendation to the customers.</p>
          <p>There are, in fact, four questions all together, it shouldn't be too long. There was a question on an increase in the share of Nestl&#xE9;, in the capital. Would this be possible in the short or medium-term following the family dispute in the Bettencourt family?</p>
          <p>I'll answer the question by saying you should ask Nestl&#xE9;. We have no information about this. The shareholders pact provides that as of April 2009, the only thing that should change in 2009 is that both parties may sell their shares. And the pact also specifies, it's public, it's in the Annual Report, it also indicates that Nestl&#xE9; has made a commitment not to increase its share in the capital as long as Madam Bettencourt is still alive. So, there is no ambiguity on that point.</p>
          <p>Do you feel the risk of trading down in your major markets which could lead to a mix ratio that would go down or become negative?</p>
          <p>Well, there's no risk of trading down because if you look at the American market or the European market, on the mass market, obviously I want to give you a complete answer. There can be trading down from channel to channel. There may be a difficulty in consuming in luxury and the consumers may be moving to a &#x2013; from a luxury brand to a mass market brand. If this happens, it will benefit mostly to L'Or&#xE9;al Paris, which is the luxury brand of the mass market. As far as the mass market itself is concerned, we did not see this in 2008. What we saw is a strong competition in promotions on the American market which is shown here for facial care. The more expensive products saw their &#x2013; a share of the total market increase, and it's more or less the same in Germany.</p>
          <p>It's stable in Germany, but what we've seen in the United States is that for very promotional categories such as shampoos you have major promotional efforts which are made and which may sometimes lead to a drop in the net price. But we have not observed so far a trend in the consumers to choose a lower priced or a lower quality product. We don't know what will happen in 2009, but this is not what we have seen so far. And as you have seen in the divisions, we ourselves and the Consumer Products Division in particular, we're determined to offer within our product ranges, we're ready to propose an alternative for L'Or&#xE9;al Paris or for Garnier.</p>
          <p>The whole idea consists in being able to launch new products, new product lines at a lower price in order to keep our consumers if some of them were tempted to trade down. But this also enables us to find new customers that don't buy our products because of the price level. So you see here the distribution per value and per price range and you see that L'Or&#xE9;al covers the whole range. And our strategy is more and more to differentiate the Garnier brand and the L'Or&#xE9;al brand price wise in order to cover the whole market and to avoid a cannibalization of the two brands by each other.</p>
          <p>I think we've answered the written questions for the most part, or all of them. So, Emmanuel comes first as always. Emmanuel Bruley des Varanne, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My first question is on the visibility you may have today on the continuation of the destocking phenomenon depending on the different regions and not only what is happening in the professional circuits. When you said that the first quarter of 2009 would be very difficult, do we need to expect a major discrepancy between the order invoicing and the sell through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the first quarter will be very difficult, especially in the luxury branch. What we are going to be seeing in 2009 will be a major differentiation between divisions. You remember that in 2007 and 2006 if I remember correctly, the performance in terms of growth for the four divisions had been very homogenous and one must admit that the growth of the markets in these four channels had been fairly homogenous also. Now what has happened since the end of 2008 is a difference in growth per circuit per channel.</p>
          <p>When I'm saying that the first quarter will be very difficult, it will be most very difficult in Luxury. It will be easier in Consumer Products and Active Cosmetics, but it will be difficult in Luxury for a simple reason. There is lower consumption. The end of the year holiday season was not great, and there is another factor that comes into play. Certain traditionally strong areas for Luxury Products such as Russia, such as, for instance Dubai, such as, for instance the travel retail stores are suffering at this stage. So, we need to expect difficulties there.</p>
          <p>So, regarding inventory reductions, I think that greater part of the effort was done during the year 2008. I'd like to remind you of one thing, we were the first to talk about inventory reduction at the end of October. And at that time, there had been certain doubts. Some people had been saying is this true, is this true for everybody? And if you listened carefully to the comments made by our major competitors, they were &#x2013; they communicated a lot about the inventory reduction from distributors, especially the American ones, in all of the channels, mass market, Luxury, Professional Products, et cetera. So, I believe that the situation will become normalized, but it's a normal fact. Distributors, like any company in the world, are subject to greater financial pressure these days and the logical reaction consists in reducing one's inventory.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question says Emmanuel, apart from this first quarter, what would be the level of internal growth that the group should reach &#x2013; would need to reach to have margins that would not be decreasing as was the case in 2008; and this had not happened in a long, long time.</p>

          <p>Well, says Mr. Agon, it is true that 2008 was a slightly extraordinary year. I'll tell you how we see things. We believe that in total, the cosmetics market should develop, should grow; not a lot, but should grow. And our objective division per division, and for the group total is to have growth of the company above the market growth. Now, what is difficult today is to know by how much and we were very criticized last year for having been slightly optimistic concerning the growth prospects for the year.</p>
          <p>At the time, we had said 6 to 8. Now, one of the eminent specialists in the room had said should we not increase our guidance in terms of &#x2013; in the area of sale?  So, it's difficult to do some guess working or to be a prophet. So, we've learned our lesson this time around and we're telling you that we believe that we're going to have a certain amount of growth and the growth will be above the market rate.</p>
          <p>Now, regarding profitability we have shares &#x2013; sorry, we have action that has been undertaken and which should provide results. We have strong action in the area of gross margin. We have reason to believe that our gross margin should improve in 2009. We have undertaken action in administrative and commercial costs, and administrative costs in SG&amp;A, and that should also contribute to an improvement on those lines.</p>
          <p>So in total, overall, we're going to do our best so that the growth that we'll be generating in 2009 can also be a growth which will enable us to maintain our margins as much as possible. As I said earlier, we will also have positive effect. We had a lot of negative effects against us last year.</p>
          <p>There are number of positive effects that I'd like to recall. We were at 126 this morning for the dollar and we've had a number of negative effects for a number of years. So, the price of oil should be good, should be positive, financial costs should go in the good direction. So, all of the efforts we've made plus a bit of wind in our backs against the winds we've had in our face during the past years should enable us to do better. Celine?</p>

          <p>My first question is on emerging countries. You seem to be very positive, you seem to be able to rely on emerging countries and a lot of emerging countries will be in a position where their GDP will be decreasing. So, can you tell us why you're still optimistic in that area and could you give us your view on Eastern Europe and Latin America which did a little less well in 2008?</p>
          <p>And also regarding costs, you've been accelerating the efforts regarding efficacy, but at what point will you need to adjust for the Professional division, for instance, the Luxury division, adjust to a market that may be shrinking in 2009 and not rebounding in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>Reducing costs, says Celine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is what we are doing, says Mr. Agon. I'd like to begin with that question. At L'Or&#xE9;al, we have a tradition which is to do permanent restructuring and we've always done this, but this should not give you an incorrect image of the efforts we are making.</p>
          <p>When we're closing a Luxury Products plant in Monaco, when we're closing a Consumer Products plant in the UK, when we're reducing by 500 people our head count in the U.S., this is strong action and it's painful action, very frankly. It's necessary, but it's also strong action. It's not because we don't advertise it all over the place that it doesn't mean that it isn't strong action.</p>
          <p>We have strong action that has been done, that has been announced. We're continuing to carry out strong action, freezing new recruitments in all of the developed countries. It's the first time since 1974 that we have taken such a measure. The last time was in the days of Francois Dalle in 1974, following the first oil crisis. We had taken that decision. So you should not be mistaken as to our determination and also the fact that we will be doing very serious things to reduce our costs.</p>
          <p>At the same time, one should not break the machine because we can all reasonably bet on the fact that this crisis will only last for a time. If you take Professional Products, it's a division which is very well managed. It used to be managed by Jean-Jacques Lebel and now by Nicolas Hieronimus and there is no fat in that division and the cost structure for Professional Products is mostly composed of people such as people who train the hairdressers, who ensure proximity with the hair salons. If you start cutting off into that you're cutting into the life of the business and you're jeopardizing the long-term potential of the division. I'm convinced that this division has a tremendous future ahead of it. I don't see a lot of competitors opposite it for the years to come. So, I believe that the Professional Products Division, year-after-year, salon after salon will be conquering greater and greater market shares and its potential is practically without limits.</p>
          <p>So, I think it would be very dangerous to take drastic measures today which would be stopping the impetus of the dynamism of this division. And I can tell you that they're doing their utmost to reduce costs. Okay? Well, in any case that's my answer.</p>
          <p>The first question was on emerging countries. I believe that in 2009, we will be getting good news and bad news. It's true that some emerging countries were major growth drivers in the past years and they will be going through a difficult period. Russia, it's a pity because Russia was a triple growth driver for a while and maybe it won't be so for a while. On the contrary, there are other countries of which you may consider that this will continue.</p>
          <p>I'm not absolutely sure. I'm not making a commitment that all the emerging countries will remain economically in great shape because I frankly don't know. But, one could believe that China even if its growth &#x2013; the growth of its economy slows down a bit we can hope that China will continue to develop. I hope so for the world. I hope so for L'Or&#xE9;al and I do hope so for all of us for the global economy. And if this is the case, we have strong positions in China. We're number one in practically all of the businesses and its one of our number one countries and it will weigh a big share in the development of the group. In all of Asia, the Asia area this year worked remarkably. We're developing very strong positions and if China can hold, a number of other countries around it will hold also and we can benefit from it.</p>
          <p>Latin America, Brazil is an interesting case because Brazil often goes opposite the direction of everyone else. So, it's possible that Brazil may have a good economic year and very good news that we have at the beginning of the year, we are back to growth in our business in Brazil after a year when growth was more or less stopped. The news are very positive and we were in India two weeks ago with Jean-Jacques Lebel and our business is picking up in India. India does seem to be on a growth pattern.</p>
          <p>So, the whole story &#x2013; since we're present in practically all of the countries in the world, all of the countries that count. First of all, we're going to benefit from where the economy will hold and we're not stupid. We will be investing even more in the countries that will be pulling growth and perhaps slow down a bit in the countries where things are more difficult; and the same thing with the brands.</p>
          <p>What we will be doing in 2009 is adapting our model. The L'Or&#xE9;al model is what it has always been. It's a clearing room model so to speak. It covers all the distribution models, all the segments, all the geographical areas; sometimes, it's a great strength and sometimes it's a bit of a handicap when some of the circuits are &#x2013; the channels are more difficult or a few countries are more difficult. But our strategy for 2009 is to adapt the model, is to go further where there's a good response; and I'm convinced that there are countries which will remain positive. I may be mistaken, but today I don't think anybody in this room know this for sure.</p>
          <p>So we will make a bet that a number of countries will remain positive and we will bet that we will be able to strengthen our positions, build our positions, and seize any opportunity. I think perhaps we need to give the floor to the others a bit, Celine.</p>

          <p>Shamina Bhaidjy from Natixis. Could you give us the mix and volume component for 2008, first of all?  Secondly, I have a small question of the access offer, accessibility offer that you have. And secondly, anything that you've seen that would push you towards this kind of offering. Now, can you just tell us about the image of brand awareness of these brands, you talked about a more accessible offering?</p>
          <p>And talking about margins now, what exactly are you expecting from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, regarding the volume value component, Christian, can you answer this question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in 2008, I'm talking here about Active Cosmetics, we had 2.8% like-for-like, that's the increase with a volume effect of 0.3 and a value effect of 0.4. So, the value effect is pretty much the same as what we had experienced. It is exactly in line with the average of the last three years, but the volume effect is historically, extremely low here. And this of course corresponds to what happens in North America and to a lesser extent what has happened in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>We have a slide I believe on the, on your question on the private labels, not really discounted offerings, but private offerings. In the mike, please.</p>
          <p>Hard discounters, or if I take countries such as France we have roughly 4,000 points of sales. We are, we have our brands in some of these points of sales. We have some of our lush brands. We have product ranges such as the less card for example, the Dop shampoo lines. We also have a number of our Garnier products, which are present on hard discount points of sales.</p>
          <p>Hard discounts account for very low market shares for our categories of products: 4% for hair product; 3% for care product; 7% for gels, et cetera; and the development is not yet very significant when it comes to hard discounters. So, we are present in these hard discounters points of sales because we have be there and also because they're the shop around the corner, so we need to be present there.</p>
          <p>As a corollary, with the new legislation in France, the LME legislation which will promote small and medium size &#x2013; the opening of small and medium size stores, it is possible that stores of this kind, or food businesses will further develop. And that's not very good for us, in fact, because as you've seen consumers are leaving big supermarkets and we have a better position in big hyper-markets than in these points of sales. Even though we are making efforts to establish the presence of our products, it's not a very favorable situation.</p>
          <p>In reality, what we should have in France is a chain of the DM Verner type in Germany. We know stores that will exhibit our products very well are Italian stores called Aqua e Sapone. The Sapone stores that have developed over the last few months or years, this would be in our favor. This would be great if we could have the same thing in France exhibiting our products. So, if anybody hears this, call please. Well, you have to be where consumers are and consumers are going more and more towards hard discount stores to buy their products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In any case, this is certainly a trend in France and the idea is, I mean, my question was have you thought about this? Have you thought about these hard discounters, are you going to increase the space allocated to the cosmetic products in general into your own brands in particular?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what Jean-Jacques said. In fact, you shouldn't generalize. There are, indeed, countries where hard discounters are very present. Hard discount is making progress in France. Granted, hard discounters in the United States organize completely differently in the United States. You have this Sam's Club or Costco stores. In Asia, it's yet &#x2013; it's still a different situation.</p>
          <p>So, it is growing but in some categories only; and not really for the cosmetics, it's not very significant in the cosmetics area. That's what I was saying earlier on. Cosmetics products is definitely the categories that is the least cannibalized by private labels and hard discount brands for good reason. Cosmetics are good products you derive a lot of pleasure from, and that doesn't really correspond to the core of hard discount business. So, that's very important.</p>
          <p>Obviously we're going to try to establish our footprint, our presence, as much as possible but we're also going to make efforts to develop our offering wherever it can be developed. Another important point is that when it comes to cosmetics or cosmetics products, over the last few years there haven't been tremendous price hikes as we've experienced in other categories which means that, in fact, consumers will have to sometimes choose private labels or hard discounters labels, but not as much for other products, because we had very reasonable price increases in cosmetics. That's why we don't see consumers flee towards hard discounters or private labels as much as one might fear.</p>

          <p>Claude Belliere <mark type="inaudible" /> Securities. I would like to ask a question on Yves Saint Laurent. The integration incorporation of Yves Saint Laurent, is it going smoothly? What are you expecting in 2009?  What is going to be its contribution, level of profitability, and what will be the other projects following the launch of the men's fragrance?</p>
          <p>A &#x2013; Jean-Paul Agon&gt;: I could tell you about the project, but what I could say first of all is that the acquisition or the contribution to the overall profitability of the Yves Saint Laurent operation in 2008, I mean, it happened as planned, according to our plan. We knew what we were buying. We knew that this business would be less profitable than our Luxury businesses and that's probably why they sold it.</p>
          <p>In the first place, if it was more profitable &#x2013; if it had been more profitable, we wouldn't have been able to afford to buy it. So, its contribution to the overall profitability was 6.9% in 2008, which is exactly in line with our plans. For 2009, we will have a full year. We are going to try to improve this contribution to overall profitability. Obviously, we have the crisis and particular recession in Luxury Products and that's not going to be a great help for that purpose, but we remain fully confident. We believe that gradually, over the years as we announced during the acquisition, we're going to increase the contribution of YSL to overall profitability.</p>
          <p>Regarding projects, as of the 1st of July of 2008, which is the date of the acquisition, we decided to have the former boss of the of the Armani brand at the top of Yves Saint Laurent and he worked very hard. As of the first quarter, you've seen we're launching a new male fragrance, L'Annee de l'Homme, which has been well received by public &#x2013; by retailers, in particular, and we also have in the pipeline, the launch of a new women's fragrance to be launched in September. So, we're very active regarding perfumes and we're going to increase the growth of this category.</p>
          <p>Regarding makeup products, this certainly is a very strong product range. Yves Saint Laurent has been very successful over a number of years. We also have a very proactive scheme here. We'll continue developing all categories. In particular, we're going to launch a new mascara in September and we'll continue capitalizing on the success of Yves Saint Laurent, which is success everywhere. So, we're going to optimize this and we're hoping to derive very strong growth from this in 2009.</p>
          <p>We're very happy about this acquisition by the way. It is true that we'd have preferred to do, to carry out this acquisition six months before speeding up of world growth and development, but this is when it happened. And I think it's of strategic importance for the future of the group. It's a &#x2013; it completes our portfolio. It's a French business which is very close to our own core business from all points of view: from a cultural point of view, geographic point of view. We can pull the talents and skills, and this business is merging very smoothly and very harmoniously in the Luxury Division. And it also allows us, which is very important for the future, it also allows us today to be the number one player in perfumeries and in world perfumeries and stores. It's very important because your clout, the weight you have, your influence is very important. If you have a lot of clout, you can get a lot in terms of negotiations with the large department stores, beauty counters and so on. So, it's for the long-term but it's of strategic importance.</p>
          <p>I'd like to now move on to the second room for a question. Your turn, you sir.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric Blane, Desjardin Securities. Could you tell us about foreign currency, the hedging, your hedging policy? Could you tell us about flows, financial flows? There have been a number of changes in the structure of the group. Could you tell us a few elements regarding that?  I mean, even it's not very important in terms of the market share, but your relations with retailers, it seems that there are a number of major actors or players who have problems with the retail business in France and in Europe in general. Can you tell us if these problems are now behind you and if you resolved these problems in a satisfactory way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jean-Jacques will start with the second one and then Christian will take the first one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me tell you that we have good relations with major retailers. I think you're alluding to a situation that is not a worry for us. Our negotiations are going very well and our launches are well underway. They got off to a good start and the overall climate is a climate of cooperation and challenging times. We tried to really close ranks with retailers and work hand-in-hand. So, we got off to a good start.</p>
          <p>And as you've seen, all of the Consumer Product Division has a partnership program with retailers worldwide. What we were trying to do is to cooperate. What we are going to do is built and develop our business together, which at the end of the day is really what should be the essence of a relationship between a supplier and a retailer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding current hedging positions, we have fairly well-hedged our positions for the ongoing year, for 2009. We have futures contracts. We have options and we have a mix between the two corridors for the dollars, it's the first currency exposure. We have covered our positions at a cost that can change but right now it would be to the tune of 1.36 and this is the same rate, in fact, as the previous year. So, that's the first point, so 136 for the hedging rate.</p>
          <p>And you were talking about, you know, changing situations. The currencies of emerging countries, more particularly the Chinese yuan and the Russian rubles, are of course taking up more significant so we have a euro dollar, Swiss franc dollar, pound euro positions which are the most important. And then you have the Chinese yuan and the Russian ruble that come after that and that's the most prominent currencies.</p>
          <p>Now, regarding the current parity of exchange rates, the positive effect that we could have on the sales could be plus 0.8% over 2009. So that's a foreign currency positive impact. It changes every day, of course, but that's an order of magnitude to date, 0.8% for 2009.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Sophie L&#xE9;cluse from La Tribune. You were talking earlier on about pooling efforts to curb costs. Well, if I've understood your strategy correctly, what you're trying to do is have divisions compete with one another and even brands compete with each other within the different divisions. Do you really think that this strategy to organize competition between brands and divisions is still relevant today?</p>
          <p>A &#x2013; Jean-Paul Agon&gt;: Well, I don't know, you've heard that &#x2013; I don't know where you've heard that we try to &#x2013; that we're going to have competition between our brands and between our divisions. That's not true. On the contrary, we're trying to have complementary strategies. That's what we're aiming at, complementarity of strategies between brands and divisions. And we do not want to organize any kind of competition between them.</p>
          <p>We have a portfolio of divisions which are highly complementary. Every division is present on over particular channel as you know. The circuits are segmented. So, you have a brand belonging to one sales channel and not several. It is our strategy to make sure that we have this highly segmented picture where a brand will have its own sales channel and will be sold to a particular segment of customers and that is exactly what I tried to say earlier on.</p>
          <p>We have L'Or&#xE9;al Paris, which really is the top-notch brand on the market, the top level. L'Or&#xE9;al Paris covers categories such skincare, haircare, colorings, but also makeup products. And then you have the Consumer Division which has two brands that are complementary of L'Or&#xE9;al Paris. We have Garnier, first of all, for skincare categories and haircare, and Maybelline Gemey for the makeup categories and they indeed complete the L'Or&#xE9;al offering.</p>
          <p>And even if you look at the brand marketing mix, we do everything we can to differentiate these brands, to set them apart from each other. This is also true for Luxury Products. Biotherm is very different from Lanc&#xF4;me and Kiehl's is very different from Giorgio Armani and you have seen Nicolas demonstration with the pyramid if you remember Professional brands. So, it is indeed our strategy to organize complementarity between these brands and divisions, and we try to do this with all of our brands, and we try to covers as much ground with all of our differentiated brands as possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of questions if I may. You indicated in October that you would increase your media spending and you substantially did so in the second half and it's pretty evident from all the divisional presentation that is what you will do again in 2009. How &#x2013; but the sales growth, of course, has remained relatively weak. How much are you prepared to spend to see a decent acceleration in top line?  How much margin are you really prepared to put behind the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I remember that last time, Harold, you told us that it's very important to invest behind our brands. So, I'm glad that you noticed that we did it. But you must know, so that there is no immediate reaction to this investment and I think the most important thing &#x2013; also because we are not trying only to stimulate immediate sales and sell outs with investment behind the brands. For example, when you invest in the Professional Products Division, you invest for the long-term, you invest for the short, middle, and long-term, but it's very important to do it because you're building the fundamentals of your business; same for Luxury. Luxury, if you want to have a luxury brand, you need to invest, for example, in magazines with print advertising but this print advertising is definitely something that helps your sales but it also helps to build the image and legitimacy of your brand in the luxury segments.</p>
          <p>So, so the idea is that despite the crisis we are determined, as we said and as we did, to increase our investments in the different channels. Of course, we are going to be smart again and we are going to try to allocate the increase of investment where it's more productive, but its &#x2013; and we think that it will get some &#x2013; it will give us some results. It would give us some immediate results but more importantly, I would say, it will also give us some mid-term and long-term results in order of sustaining the development of our business, our market share and our growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That I will tell you later, maybe.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are prepared to increase the spending and &#x2013; but, you know, so &#x2013; but first I think it's very important because we did &#x2013; we said that last time we did it, and as you've seen and as Christian explained, if you compare the investment between the first half &#x2013; the second half 2008 and the second half 2007, its 80 basis point more which is definitely an indication of what we did. So, we're going to increase again. But, what's important to know also is that this year, I mean the conditions will be really exceptional, and this year we will benefit from special discount prices, conditions that we have never seen before. So, I really believe that with a good increase of our spendings but also taking advantage of the conditions of the market we will be able to increase very significantly the power of our brands.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a second question is just on the strategy, I mean you've mentioned that you would reduce SKUs, you would try and launch bigger ideas and concentrate your resources I guess to your ideas. Is it kind of a fewer, bigger, better ideas strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Well done, you  test it. I'm glad we were so clear. But no, it's true that it's exactly that, but it's not new, by the way, that fewer and bigger is something that we said already two years ago and we do it. And so we do it and some of the launches are really a good example of that. I mean, it's not very unique, but at least we are going in the right direction. Yes, Mr. Croquez.</p>

          <p>Xavier Croquez, Exane BNP Paribas. I would like to know how your sales and market shares have evolved per category, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are true to your reputation Mr. Croquez, says Mr. Agon. So, categories do we have the Croquez slides, the famous Croquez slides that's how we call them. We didn't dare put your name on the slide though. So, here are the answers to your questions. These are complete answers because you see that in total care and sun products 20% of the sales, up 5.5; haircare a smaller growth, plus 1.5%, makeup 22.1, plus 4.2; coloring, et cetera; Perfume, slightly negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is your estimate of these changes, seeing these figures, mean in terms of growing faster or slower than the market? Could you give us a little bit of color as they say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will try, says Mr. Agon. We believe that we have progressed probably a little faster than the market in care, probably a little less fast than the market for haircare. Obviously, these categories cover all of our divisions. So, when you add for haircare you add the Consumer Products haircare products and Professional Products. Obviously, it's a mixed bag which is difficult to sort out.</p>
          <p>We believe that we've gained market shares slightly in Professional Products and maybe we didn't gain market shares in Consumer Products. For Makeup, we believe that we did a good year, probably slightly more than the market. For colorants, it's a little early to have the market figures, February 15 to have the market figures for the year 2008 per category, you're asking for a lot. So, it's a little bit of color as you said. And for Fragrances, Perfumes, I think we've kept our market share, the market last year was not very dynamic.</p>
          <p>I would just like to say that for those categories the movements are not big movements, wide movements from one year to the next. We have four divisions, 15 brands, a presence in 80 countries. These numbers are the result at the end of all of these different efforts in all of these brands, these divisions, these countries. You cannot say, well, it's not as easy as saying this year we're going to put all of the investment on one category and too bad for the rest.</p>
          <p>It's more a statistical result, but this shows that we are not fairly dynamic on a certain number of categories. And I think that this year, the dynamism will be stronger for haircare. We have strong initiatives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question, says Mr. Croquez, is on market shares. We've given us a very detailed picture for the year but 2008 had two halves. A first half which was still fairly satisfactory and a second half which was much tougher which could auger as to the results of the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>So, what you said for the year overall was &#x2013; is that what you would say for the second half? Also for market shares in Western Europe, do you think you've been able to keep that during the second half and is the image for North America the same?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the questions. These are very precise questions. We are going to give you an answer. I read here and there that our market shares were decreasing in Western Europe for Consumer Products.</p>
          <p>I would like to give you all a piece of advice. You should use the right panels because there is false information being circulated. When you use the right panels which cover all of the countries, first of all, and which cover all of the categories, you do get an objective vision of our performance. When we see notes indicating market shares which are reducing, but it doesn't include makeup, and makeup is 25% of our sales. This is not serious. So, Jean-Jacques how can we assess your market shares?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the fourth quarter, for instance, to answer your question if &#x2013; also I will be looking at the fourth quarter, that is what interests me the most. Now, if you take Europe 15, an evolution of the market 1% and an evolution of the division 2%, so twice the growth of the market. U.S. total of the market minus 0.2 for the fourth quarter, and the Consumer Products plus 2.7. So, what we can say is that for the end of the year, okay, the market slowed down because overall for the full year the Europe 15 progressed by 3% and the last quarter was weaker plus 1. But we are better for the last quarter than for the whole of the year.</p>
          <p>The paradox is that the second half of the year was tougher in terms of markets slowing down and shrinkage of the purchases of the distributors, which is a recognized fact. But in market shares, the second half of the year was rather better for us, better in the U.S. and better in Europe and we are rather progressing faster than the market. Obviously, we're not going to be telling you stories and tell you that we've gained extraordinary market shares last year, but number one we didn't lose any and if you look at the details on reliable panels, it looks like we gained more.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From Bloomberg. I have a question regarding cost cutting. If you could give us an indication of how much you're going to cut by, how much you're going to cut your budget this year. You've already cut 500 jobs in the U.S., can we expect more cuts in the U.S.?  And in Western Europe, are we talking about actual job cuts or just a hiring freeze? In Western Europe, I'm talking about Western Europe now.  Do you plan to &#x2013; if there are going to be job cuts, what kind of jobs do you &#x2013; are you going to close down plants or merge them or delocalize?  And my last question is have you had any indication from &#x2013; has the Board had any indication from Madam Bettencourt as to what she intends to do with her stake after April?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have many interesting questions. So, I'll start with Madam Bettencourt. Madam Bettencourt is, I saw her yesterday because we had a Board meeting, and I can tell you that she is fine in a great shape and, but she didn't tell us anything about her intentions, but she has been committed. You have to remember that Madam Bettencourt is the daughter of the founder of the company, Eugene Schueller. And Eugene Schueller founded this company 100 years ago. So, Madam Bettencourt is extremely committed to this company, I can tell you. And when you are the daughter of the founder, you're for many, many, many reasons, and more than money, very, very committed to the company, to the people of this company and to the future of the company, number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, regarding the cost cutting, I don't want to, we're not trying to make a scary movie here. What we are just doing is to try to adapt our cost structure to the time and to the crisis. But we don't as I explained before, we don't want also to, it's not something we like to do and we don't want also to jeopardize the future of L'Or&#xE9;al by cutting structure or teams or whatever, and it would be really a mistake for the future. You know, that's not our culture at L'Or&#xE9;al and that's not our habit.</p>
          <p>So what we are trying to do is really to do things when they are really necessary. So that's why we did this &#x2013; we closed this factory in Monaco because we had a lease, this lease was expiring. We had to decide if we wanted to stay for another three, six, nine years in Monaco and it honestly didn't make sense to stay in Monaco. So, that's why we decided that. In Llantrisant in Wales, we had this opportunity &#x2013; it didn't make sense to have this factory there because 70% of the components were coming from Europe and 70% of the products that were produced in Wales were going back to Europe. So, it was completely economically not clever. So, that's why we also closed this factory. But, we really worked very hard to find a solution in order for the site to be taken by another manufacturer in order to preserve the jobs as much as possible in the site.</p>
          <p>So, we are always &#x2013; we are going &#x2013; and we are proud of that. We are going to adjust our cost base but we are going to do it respecting the people, respecting the history and the culture of L'Or&#xE9;al and also taking in consideration the future of the company.</p>
          <p>And for example in Europe we are talking about freezing hires which is something quite significant in term of the results you can get. It's something quite important. There is always quite a turnover, there are people retiring. So, if you really freeze hires for a while then you have a significant reduction of your cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So for Europe we're not talking about actually firing people, just attrition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly, exactly, that's a good definition, a good definition. And we think that it's going to be a &#x2013; it's going to produce results and also it's going to &#x2013; it's a way to respect people.</p>

          <p>Vivian Nataire from Oratorium In a period of crisis, people believe that there are opportunities for acquisitions. Have you identified any and in which sector? There may be a problem of value enhancement to &#x2013; or assessment to do a good deal.</p>
          <p>Now, the sale on Internet has increased a lot in 2008. Is this a case for you, also? Do you target all of your divisions and I have in mind Active Cosmetics? Pharmacists communicate more and more via Internet with laboratories. Is that a source of opportunities for you?</p>
          <p>And last question, what are the actions which you have envisaged, which are planned to celebrate the centennial of L'Or&#xE9;al and to highlight innovation since we've understood that that is the anti-crisis weapon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Translator: Thank you, Madam Nataire, for these questions, says Mr. Agon. I'll begin as usual with the last one. Concerning the centennial, it is true that we are celebrating our 100th anniversary. Mr. Schueller incorporated the company and created the company exactly 100 years ago, I think in June or July. It will be 100 years in June or July of this year.</p>
          <p>So, we really wondered how we should celebrate the centennial. And with the executive committee and Madame du Treme a year ago we had chosen an option which seemed very wise which was to have a no bling-bling centennial as someone wrote in La Tribune, a centennial which would be based on two major ideas. First of all, celebrating our staff, the people who create L'Or&#xE9;al, who constitute L'Or&#xE9;al day after day and I wish to thank them for their tremendous commitment that they show daily. And each L'Or&#xE9;al village as we call them, each L'Or&#xE9;al site or each L'Or&#xE9;al subsidiary will have its own celebration in its own country in their own way without a lot of expenditure. Don't worry about cost cutting; it will be very reasonable.</p>
          <p>Now the second thing we wanted to do is rather than have a centennial as do a lot of companies which is a self-celebration so to speak, we wanted to have a celebration with sharing and generosity to give back to the communities around us what they have given us. And so the second major point in the celebration will be that each of our subsidiaries will be creating a generosity project with its staff and it will be revealed at the time of the commemoration in June. So it will be a celebration for the staff and generous to the community and I think that this is perfectly suited to our times.</p>
          <p>Now, secondly, acquisitions and then I will give the floor to each of my colleagues to, for the e-business part. Now concerning acquisitions, it is true that people say that there are acquisition opportunities. First of all, this is not absolutely certain and number two, we will see if something shows up on the market which is truly irresistible, we will look at it with great attention.</p>
          <p>Now, I must say that in our divisions, we have brand portfolios which are very complete and coming back to this idea, you saw the brand for the Professional Products division, which is very complete and which suits the needs of all the hairdressers around the world. I don't really see what type of brand would be missing in the portfolio. We have no gap in Luxury. The acquisition of Saint Laurent has filled the gap that we had. We didn't have a major French designer, fashion designer at the international level.</p>
          <p>And for the cosmetics between our four brands, our four or five brands cover all the trends. So, I don't think we're in an attitude today where we would be saying we have gaps, we have something missing somewhere, let's go looking for an acquisition. And plus we need to integrate our acquisitions well, which is our priority today; but if anything passed by we would look at it with interest, of course.</p>
          <p>Now, regarding e-business, let's begin with Jean-Jacques because we have activity in the Club des Cr&#xE9;ateurs de Beaut&#xE9;.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd like to remind you that we have full ownership of this since the beginning of 2008. Part is sold by mail order, part is sold via Internet. I won't give you the exact figure for the share that is sold by Internet. I think this is the part of the things that we should keep for ourselves, but I can tell you that that is a part, which has led to the growth that we saw during the last quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Sales have been growing and Internet is largely responsible for that and the beginning of 2009, things are continuing along the same trend. So, the e-business trend is solid and we're benefiting with the Club des Cr&#xE9;ateurs de Beaut&#xE9; which have picked up at the beginning of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Active Cosmetics, from Brigitte Liberman, we have e-business in the U.S. It is true that in Europe we work with the pharmacists who develop their own website. The sales numbers on that channel are fairly low, a few percentage points. The historic country for that for pharmacies would be Germany. It's developing slowly, but it remains small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marc Menesguen. Well, e-business is fairly well-suited to luxury because it's possible to give very specific advice for makeup and care. It remains a small business, less than 1%. But in 2008 it progressed very well. It progressed &#x2013; grew by 20%.</p>
          <p>It has been growing in the U.S., where close to 10 years ago we opened up the Lanc&#xF4;me e-business website which is doing very well, over $15 million in sales. And we developed it in Asia in a fairly successful way. We developed e-business in China and Korea. So, we are looking at it closely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, go ahead says Mr. Agon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I may be the last to ask you a question but doesn't matter, someone has to come last. I have one main question and two ancillary questions.</p>
          <p>My main question pertains to the strategy that you insisted on on two occasions today, the price range of the different products which you adapt to the different categories or consumers. Now my question is, and you've mentioned two examples, in skincare with a price range from 9 to &#x20AC;18 and in the document it's much more impressive because I don't, obviously it's probably not the same products, but it goes from &#x20AC;5 to &#x20AC;250. Coming back to the first situation, my question is what does the consumer get when the consumer pays &#x20AC;9 and what does the consumer get when he pays &#x20AC;18 for the same &#x2013; a product in the same product range?</p>
          <p>And if you pay a private label product, you usually pay 10 times less, but you have almost the guarantee that the molecule you're going to be buying is almost the same. So, the basic product is the same, but it is packaged or sold in different conditions from the brand product.</p>
          <p>So, do you have the same situation in a product range and what's the breakdown of the value chain between a &#x20AC;9 product and the &#x20AC;18 product?  Is it the same active ingredient and is it just the packaging or the distribution channel which is different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer that question immediately, says Mr. Agon. So, to make sure you're not mistaken, our idea is not to sell the products that we already sell and sell them at half the price. What we want to do is complete our product offering with more affordable products. For Garnier or L'Or&#xE9;al Paris, for instance, it's fairly easy because we have a product range.</p>
          <p>We realized that mostly we specialize in anti-aging products. We have very good anti-aging firmness products for mature skins, et cetera. And maybe we sort of neglected the moisturizing products, the access products, the daily moisturizer products which don't claim to be extremely sophisticated rejuvenating or anti-age products. But, which are products that other consumers buy and which are at a lower price. So, our idea is not to have trading down of our own brands or our own products. We want to complete our own ranges with simpler, more affordable products which will not bought by the same customers, which don't offer the same service but which will enable us to recruit new consumers. Do you see what we mean?</p>
          <p>Yes or no or, so, it's not just what I will remember is that we're not buying the same product when you buy a &#x20AC;9 product or an &#x20AC;18 product. Yes, there are different types of channels, there are different &#x2013; you can buy the same product and pay double or half depending on where you buy it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, I didn't understand what you mean by the anti division or diversity, not diversity but diversion. Do you have a problem in defending your brands, given the considerable amount of fraud that exists especially in pharmacies; and have you been taking measures to identify these products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, says Mr. Agon, I can tell you a word about this. I know the problem in the U.S. very well. We talked about it regarding American Professional Products. Tim, as far as I know, thank God it's the only country where this happens.</p>
          <p>American supermarkets have started selling professional products, products that, theoretically, you find only in the hair salons; brands such as Matrix or Redken or Paul Mitchell or the others, why is that so?  Because there were customers who were interested in buying more expensive products, more technical products in the U.S., and who wanted to buy them from the supermarket. And it's organized in a very special way. There are collectors whose business it is to go buy from small hair salons, buy the items and resell them to the supermarkets.</p>
          <p>So, it's very bad for our brand image because our professional products are supposed to be exclusively professional products. So, we have a very strict policy to ensure that our hair salons abided by our rules that they did not resell to supermarkets or that there wasn't a parallel traffic that was going on and that's good for the future of the brands. It's very healthy, but it costs us a bit in sales because we stopped selling to hair salons who don't go by our rules. Marc, perhaps you can remind us of everything we do for Luxury, the coding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in Luxury all the products are coded at production and we can keep track of the logistics circuit path followed by the products which may be diverted and take measures to ensure inspection at the distribution level and reduce our deliveries to those who possibly might be diverters. So, we have a monitoring system which plays continually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you have holograms and things like that to avoid trafficking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely. But we have secrets which are made to &#x2013; which are intended to stay secret, but we have means of identifying whether a product is our product or a counterfeit product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On two occasions you highlighted point of sales advertising. Is that something which is increasing, is it important in your advertising budget or do you think that this is specific action which should give you a big advantage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, says Mr. Agon. We didn't specially highlight that. This is something that we do in a different regime way to way in the different channels. The shop windows in the pharmacies or displays in department stores and a lot of the decision to buy a product is done at the place of purchase, at the point of sale. So it's important to have advertising material at the point of sale. We are continuing to invest, but I've just said that in that area as well as in others a lot of savings can be made given the negotiation conditions that we have.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> I have a question concerning your strategic attitude. You have a company, Inn&#xE9;ov, which is producing capsules if I understood correctly, beautiful inside, and are there common points according to you with someone who would buy a food product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Who are you talking about? says Mr. Agon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have a strategy that might be going in the same direction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a very good question says Mr. Agon. Obviously, you did notice that our business, Inn&#xE9;ov, is a joint venture between the number one in cosmetics and the global number one player in food, Nestl&#xE9;. So, it's very interesting because this is where you have true complementarity, true proximity.</p>
          <p>It is in this specific instance that putting together Nestl&#xE9;'s excellent research in the area of food and L'Or&#xE9;al's excellent research in cosmetics, this where it really makes sense and this activity is led by Madame Liberman and has become the number one leader in Europe and it is beginning to sell globally, and it has a great future because these food supplements, nutritional supplements, on the condition that they are formulated for efficacy and results are very interesting products and I do note that that is probably the way for the future rather than cosmetic nutrition, which was slightly less successful recently. But, these nutritional supplements have a great future ahead of them and with Nestl&#xE9; we have an excellent collaboration in that area.</p>
          <p>We have projects to continue our collaboration on Inn&#xE9;ov and go even further but no plans to widen, no. The expertise from the both &#x2013; from the two companies have to meet and this is really an example, expertise in nutrition and cosmetics, there is know-how on both sides.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>Well, we'll see says Mr. Agon. We've suspended it temporarily. We might resume it; we'll reserve our position on that.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second technical question for Mr. Mulliez. The impact of the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; on the margin for 2009, knowing that it will be consolidated for the first time for the first half, do you have an idea of the impact, dilutive or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it will be both dilutive and accretive. I'll explain this. It will be dilutive clearly for the ratio, as Jean-Paul Agon indicated that in the second half the profitability was 6 to 7% for Yves Saint Laurent, you know the profitability of the group and the Luxury Division. So, it will be dilutive. The positive point is that this year it cost us 1% of the net earnings per share due to the step-up in stock and I won't go any further in my answer, but in 2009 it will not cost us 1%. It will be slightly accretive.</p>

          <p>A wider question says Mr. Croquez. I did take note of the fact that you talked about adapting L'Or&#xE9;al's business model. You've indicated an increase in advertising and promotion with respect to sales, you're reducing the number of references and you're going to be developing more asset products. Innovation enabled you to justify a price increase.</p>
          <p>Now, the new product innovations which are for more asset products, will that enable you to main the price or do you think there will be less price mix than in the past, or are we moving more towards volume growth exclusively?</p>

          <p>No, says Mr. Agon. Emmanuel, I think there's both. It's interesting because the examples I gave you earlier &#x2013; take &#xD4;scillation, this mascara. It sold at $30 in the U.S.; our regular L'Or&#xE9;al Mascara is less than $20. You have mascaras at 7 to $8. A Lanc&#xF4;me mascara is sold what is sold; it's worth $30 and people line up at the counter to buy it.</p>
          <p>The &#xD4;scillation Mascara has become the number one beauty product sold on the beauty floors of American department stores. So, this goes to show that when you have something which is truly exceptional, truly irresistible, people are willing to buy it.</p>
          <p>And what is very important is that what the crisis has changed and may change for the future also is the concept of getting your money's worth, the value for money; but value for money, it doesn't necessarily mean cheap. Value for money means that for a given price I have to get a product which has a high quality. So, at $30 having the number one vibrating mascara which gives you a tremendous result is value for money.</p>
          <p>Now, it's true also that a Great Lash from Maybelline, which is sold at what, 5 to $6 because it's the historic basic mascara, that is also value for money. These two ideas are not incompatible. Our idea is to do both to continue the strategy of value enhancement which was this strategy invented by Eug&#xE8;ne Schueller.</p>
          <p>I have already said here that this had one cent more in quality, one franc more in sale price and this is what has led to L'Or&#xE9;al to what it is today over a hundred year period. So, we are not going to give up this strategy of putting something great into a product and I think it would be stupid on our part to remain rigidly on the model and not complete it by being very pragmatic and also able to offer products which are different products which are products &#x2013; which have a different ambition as regards to result, for instance, but which are more affordable, more accessible which enable us to go reaching out to the consumer who perhaps are less demanding but who also &#x2013; who perhaps want to have a lower sale price. So, this is what I meant when I used the word of rendering accessible.</p>
          <p>We are continuing the value enhancement but each of the brands is actively thinking about the way to widen the offering of each of the brand on more affordable products, but which by definition don't offer the same result. Obviously I'm glad that you've given me this opportunity to remind you that this is the basic idea we have for this year. We want to continue to capitalize on these strengths of L'Or&#xE9;al and I say this here and there, I hear people asking whether the L'Or&#xE9;al model is running out of breath. I think this is very much exaggerated.</p>
          <p>The L'Or&#xE9;al model is made up of a presence in all the distribution channels at all the price levels at all of the product categories. And by definition, this model in times of crisis may be functioning slightly differently from when &#x2013; the way it functions at a market growth at plus 5%.</p>
          <p>As Lindsay Owen-Jones was saying not too long ago, he has a long experience with you. He said depending on the year people said ah, having 25% of your business in Luxury Products is not enough when the economy is doing well. People tell us L'Or&#xE9;al, you should have more than 25% of your business in Luxury Products and when times are hard people say, ah, 25% of your business in Luxury Products is too much. So we can't vary that every year.</p>
          <p>So our great strength at L'Or&#xE9;al is our innovation, our brand portfolio which is probably the best in the industry, the ability to have great launches. Our geographical expansion, which is continuing on a strong pattern, and the model has to be adapted in a pragmatic way in 2009 to take into consideration the reality of the crisis, go for new categories have more affordable products, more accessible products and accelerate our presence in the new countries. Be more aggressive than ever &#x2013; more proactive than ever in cost reduction.</p>
          <p>The initiatives we are taking are initiatives that we've never taken before and they are going in the direction of reducing prices to help us adapt sales through the crisis and pick up again after it.</p>

          <p>So, I think that was a fairly complete range of questions and answers and if no one has anything else to add, thank you for being here and we'll join you over lunch. Thank you.</p>
